We report that ApoE plays a role in facilitating the proteolytic clearance of soluble Aβ from the brain. The endolytic degradation of Aβ peptides within microglia by neprilysin and related enzymes is dramatically enhanced by ApoE. Similarly, Aβ degradation extracellularly by insulin-degrading enzyme is facilitated by ApoE. The capacity of ApoE to promote Aβ degradation is dependent upon the ApoE isoform and its lipidation status. The enhanced expression of lipidated ApoE, through the activation of liver X receptors, stimulates Aβ degradation. Indeed, aged Tg2576 mice treated with the LXR agonist GW3965 exhibited a dramatic reduction in brain Aβ load. GW3965 treatment also reversed contextual memory deficits. These data demonstrate a mechanism through which ApoE facilitates the clearance of Aβ from the brain and suggest that LXR agonists may represent a novel therapy for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation and deposition of Aβ peptides within the brain, leading to the perturbation of synaptic function and neuronal loss that typifies the disease (Tanzi and Bertram, 2005Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Twenty years of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid hypothesis: a genetic perspective.Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of familial forms of AD has established the centrality of APP processing and Aβ production to disease pathogenesis. Aβ peptides are normally produced by neurons in the brain and cleared through efflux into the peripheral circulation (Zlokovic et al., 2005Zlokovic B.V. Deane R. Sallstrom J. Chow N. Miano J.M. Neurovascular pathways and Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide.Brain Pathol. 2005; 15: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and through their degradation by proteinases within the brain (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease: progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10169) Google Scholar). An isoform of apolipoprotein E, ApoE4, has been shown to confer dramatically increased risk for late-onset AD (LOAD) (Roses et al., 1995Roses A.D. Saunders A.M. Corder E.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Han S.H. Einstein G. Hulette C. Schmechel D.E. Holsti M. Huang D. et al.Influence of the susceptibility genes apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 and apolipoprotein E-epsilon 2 on the rate of disease expressivity of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.Arzneimittelforschung. 1995; 45: 413-417PubMed Google Scholar); however, the basis for this remains one of the major unanswered questions of disease pathogenesis. ApoE plays critical roles in regulating brain Aβ peptide levels, as well as their deposition and clearance (Holtzman, 2001Holtzman D.M.

Thus, processes that regulate ApoE expression and functional state could affect its ability to influence brain Aβ homeostasis. ApoE is the predominant apolipoprotein in the brain and is synthesized and secreted mainly by astrocytes (but also by microglia; Xu et al., 2006Xu Q. Bernardo A. Walker D. Kanegawa T. Mahley R.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30001-30007Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ApoE is lipidated principally through the action of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 (and related transporters), which acts in a variety of cell types to transfer both phospholipids and cholesterol to ApoE (Hirsch-Reinshagen et al., 2004Hirsch-Reinshagen V.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40987-40993Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and, in this way, ApoE acts to traffic lipids throughout the brain. The lipidation status of ApoE is an important functional parameter, governing its conformation (Fisher and Ryan, 1999Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O.

Importantly, ApoE binds to Aβ, and this, too, is influenced by its lipidation status (Tokuda et al., 2000Tokuda T. Calero M. Matsubara E. Vidal R. Kumar A. Permanne B. Zlokovic B. Smith J.D. Ladu M.J. Rostagno A. et al.Lipidation of apolipoprotein E influences its isoform-specific interaction with Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptides.Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Studies with APP transgenic mice have demonstrated ApoE isoform-specific effects on the propensity of Aβ to be deposited in the brain (E4 > E3 > E2), the nature of the deposits, and a gene-dosage-related influence on the magnitude of these effects (Holtzman, 2004Holtzman D.M. In vivo effects of ApoE and clusterin on amyloid-beta metabolism and neuropathology.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ApoE lipidation status is also a significant determinant of whether its interaction with Aβ leads to efflux of the peptides from the brain or, alternatively, to the formation of fibrils and their deposition into plaques (Bell et al., 2007Bell R.D.

Recently, three independent studies have reported that inactivation of the Abca1 gene in APP-expressing transgenic mice resulted in reduced levels of ApoE. Remarkably, these mice exhibited a seemingly paradoxical elevation of brain Aβ peptide levels and a doubling of Aβ plaque burden without a significant effect on Aβ generation (Hirsch-Reinshagen et al., 2005Hirsch-Reinshagen V.

The outcomes of these studies strongly suggested that lipidated forms of ApoE act to enhance the clearance of Aβ peptides from the brain. The aim of the present study was to establish the mechanism by which ApoE and its lipidation affect Aβ homeostasis. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that induce the expression of Apoe, Abca1, and other genes of lipid metabolism (Beaven and Tontonoz, 2006Beaven S.W. Tontonoz P. Nuclear receptors in lipid metabolism: targeting the heart of dyslipidemia.Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). LXRs act physiologically as cellular cholesterol sensors and are activated by oxysterols. There are two LXR isoforms, LXRα and LXRβ (encoded by Nrlh3 and Nrlh2, respectively), both of which are expressed in the brain (Wang et al., 2002Wang L. Schuster G.U. Hultenby K. Zhang Q. Andersson S. Gustafsson J.A. Liver X receptors in the central nervous system: from lipid homeostasis to neuronal degeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 13878-13883Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and their activation results in the rapid and robust increase in the levels of lipidated forms of ApoE (Cao et al., 2007Cao G. Bales K.R. DeMattos R.B. Paul S.M. Liver X receptor-mediated gene regulation and cholesterol homeostasis in brain: relevance to Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.Curr.

Neurochem. 2004; 88: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of LXR transcriptional activity provides a mechanism to regulate brain ApoE levels and its lipidation status. The brain possesses robust intrinsic Aβ clearance mechanisms (Tanzi et al., 2004Tanzi R. Moir R. Wagner S. Clearance of Alzheimer's Abeta peptide: the many roads to perdition.Neuron. 2004; 43: 605-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides are proteolytically degraded within the brain principally by neprilysin (NEP) (Iwata et al., 2000Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E. Kawashima-Morishima M. Lee H.J. Hama E. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Saido T.C. Identification of the major Abeta1–42-degrading catabolic pathway in brain parenchyma: suppression leads to biochemical and pathological deposition.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE, insulysin) (Kurochkin and Goto, 1994Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide specifically interacts with and is degraded by insulin degrading enzyme.FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Genetic inactivation of these genes (Farris et al., 2003Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Insulin-degrading enzyme regulates the levels of insulin, amyloid beta-protein, and the beta-amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Metabolic regulation of brain Abeta by neprilysin.Science. 2001; 292: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) or administration of inhibitors of these proteinases into the brain results in substantial elevation of Aβ levels in the brain and induction of plaque deposition (Dolev and Michaelson, 2004Dolev I. Michaelson D.M. A nontransgenic mouse model shows inducible amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition and elucidates the role of apolipoprotein E in the amyloid cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 13909-13914Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of IDE or neprilysin lowered brain Aβ levels and reduced plaque formation (Hemming et al., 2007Hemming M.L. Patterson M. Reske-Nielsen C. Lin L. Isacson O. Selkoe D.J.

Enhanced proteolysis of beta-amyloid in APP transgenic mice prevents plaque formation, secondary pathology, and premature death.Neuron. 2003; 40: 1087-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the predominant mode of Aβ42 clearance from the brain is through its proteolytic degradation because this peptide is not efficiently exported through the vasculature (Deane et al., 2004Deane R. Wu Z. Sagare A. Davis J. Du Yan S. Hamm K. Xu F. Parisi M. LaRue B. Hu H.W. et al.LRP/amyloid beta-peptide interaction mediates differential brain efflux of Abeta isoforms.Neuron. 2004; 43: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Microglia, the brain's resident macrophages, play an essential role in Aβ clearance through their ability to take up and degrade soluble and fibrillar forms of Aβ (Rogers et al., 2002Rogers J. Strohmeyer R. Kovelowski C.J. Li R. Microglia and inflammatory mechanisms in the clearance of amyloid beta peptide.Glia. 2002; 40: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Moreover, both microglia and astrocytes secrete proteinases, including IDE, that mediate the degradation of Aβ peptides in the extracellular milieu (Qiu et al., 1998Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M. Ye Z. Vekrellis K. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Rosner M.R. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Selkoe D.J. Insulin-degrading enzyme regulates extracellular levels of amyloid beta-protein by degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32730-32738Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Despite considerable effort, the cellular mechanisms through which ApoE influences Aβ clearance remain unresolved. We report that ApoE acts to facilitate the proteolytic degradation of Aβ, a previously unappreciated action of this apolipoprotein. Moreover, the lipidation status of ApoE is a critical determinant of its ability to stimulate Aβ degradation, and this finding provides a mechanistic explanation of the increased Aβ levels and deposition observed in APP-expressing mice lacking the Abca1 gene. Importantly, we demonstrate that elevation of lipidated forms of ApoE, through activation of LXRs, results in reduced Aβ peptide and plaque levels in an animal model of AD and is associated with improved contextual memory. Therapeutic agents that increase the abundance of highly lipidated forms of ApoE, including LXR agonists, may attenuate disease pathogenesis and represent a promising strategy for the treatment of AD. We first investigated the contribution of microglia to the clearance of soluble Aβ. We found that these cells rapidly take up soluble forms of Aβ from the extracellular milieu (Figure 1A) through a nonsaturable (Figure 1B) macropinocytotic uptake mechanism (S.M. et al., unpublished data). The internalized Aβ is rapidly trafficked to a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment (Figure 1C). Indeed, incubation of BV-2 microglia with soluble Aβ42 resulted in the loss of Aβ from the medium, with complete clearance of the peptide within 24 hr (Figure 1D) that is reflective of both of its uptake into microglia as well as degradation by proteinases secreted by these cells into the extracellular milieu. Microglia efficiently degrade internalized soluble Aβ, and we observed little or no resecretion of Aβ into the medium (Figure 1E). The intracellular degradation of Aβ by microglia is carried out principally by neprilysin and related proteases whose activity can be inhibited by phosphoramidon and thiorphan (Iwata et al., 2000Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E. Kawashima-Morishima M. Lee H.J. Hama E. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Saido T.C.

Clearance of Alzheimer's Abeta peptide: the many roads to perdition.Neuron. 2004; 43: 605-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), because in the presence of these protease inhibitors the degradation of internalized soluble Aβ was dramatically inhibited (Figure 1F). ApoE has been postulated to facilitate the clearance of Aβ peptides from the brain, and we tested whether ApoE and related apolipoproteins influenced the ability of microglia to degrade soluble Aβ. ApoA-I is another major HDL-associated apolipoprotein both in the periphery and in the brain (Koch et al., 2001Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M. Stuerenburg H.J. Buhmann C. Beisiegel U. Characterization of four lipoprotein classes in human cerebrospinal fluid.J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, it functions and is trafficked in a manner similar to ApoE (Smith et al., 2004Smith J.D. Le Goff W. Settle M. Brubaker G. Waelde C. Horwitz A. Oda M.N. ABCA1 mediates concurrent cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein A-I.J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2001Wang N. Silver D.L.

ApoA-I is also lipidated by ABCA1 (Denis et al., 2004Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. Molecular and cellular physiology of apolipoprotein A-I lipidation by the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1).J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7384-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and avidly binds Aβ peptides (Harr et al., 1996Harr S.D. Uint L. Hollister R. Hyman B.T. Mendez A.J.

Apolipoprotein A-I directly interacts with amyloid precursor protein and inhibits A beta aggregation and toxicity.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3553-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), thus providing an independent measure of HDL apolipoprotein function. BV-2 microglia (Figure 2A) or primary microglia (Figure 2B) were incubated with soluble Aβ42 in the presence of exogenously supplied ApoE or ApoA-I. Coincubation with purified human ApoE or ApoA-I resulted in a dramatic stimulation of Aβ clearance from the microglia. ApoE and ApoA-I elicited a similar reduction in intracellular Aβ levels, demonstrating that the observed effects are reflective of the common actions of these apolipoproteins. The effect of ApoE on microglial Aβ clearance is dose dependent (Figure 2C). We measured the efficiency with which ApoE stimulated the clearance of Aβ from microglia by monitoring, in parallel, both the cumulative uptake of Aβ using fluorescently labeled Aβ42 and the intracellular levels of the intact Aβ42 peptide by ELISA (Figures 2D–2F). Fluorescently labeled Aβ is taken up by microglia and degraded; however, the fluorophore is retained within the cells, and the total cellular fluorescence is an independent measurement of total Aβ uptake (S.M. et al., unpublished data). We found that the ApoE-stimulated reduction in intracellular Aβ levels was a consequence of enhanced degradation and was observed at both 3 and 9 hr of incubation. These data demonstrate that the degradation of soluble Aβ within microglia is significantly enhanced by HDL apolipoproteins. Activation of LXR increased the expression of ApoE and ABCA1 (Burns et al., 2006Burns M.P. Vardanian L. Pajoohesh-Ganji A. Wang L. Cooper M. Harris D.C. Duff K. Rebeck G.W.

Microglia express both LXR isoforms and respond to LXR agonists (Zelcer et al., 2007Zelcer N. Khanlou N. Clare R. Jiang Q. Reed-Geaghan E.G. Landreth G.E. Vinters H.V. Tontonoz P.

These cells also express and secrete lipidated forms of ApoE (Xu et al., 2000Xu Q. Li Y. Cyras C. Sanan D.A. Cordell B. Isolation and characterization of apolipoproteins from murine microglia. Identification of a low density lipoprotein-like apolipoprotein J-rich but E-poor spherical particle.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31770-31777Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We tested whether elevation of lipidated ApoE levels would result in enhanced Aβ degradation by microglia by treating these cells with an agonist of LXRs. BV-2 microglia (Figure 3A) or primary microglia (Figure 3B) were pretreated with the LXR-specific agonist GW3965 for 18 hr and then incubated with exogenous soluble Aβ42 for an additional 3 or 24 hr, respectively. The GW3965-treated microglia exhibited significantly lower levels of intracellular Aβ42 due to the enhanced degradation of Aβ in the drug-treated cells compared to vehicle-treated controls. Similar effects were observed using another LXR agonist, T0901317 (Figure 3C). LXR activation was verified by the observation of increased expression of its target gene products: ABCA1 and ApoE (Figures 3A and 3B). Significantly, the combined treatment with both the LXR agonist and provision of exogenous HDL apolipoproteins resulted in a further reduction of intracellular Aβ levels, evaluated either by western analysis (Figures 3A and 3B) or by ELISA (Figure 3C). Control experiments established that the uptake of soluble Aβ was not affected by the presence of either exogenous ApoA-I or the LXR activation agonist (Figure S2A). LXR activation did not affect the expression of neprilysin in microglia (Figure S3). These data suggest that LXR activation facilitates the degradation of Aβ peptides, and this is associated with induction of LXR target genes, including Abca1 and Apoe, and elevation of lipidated ApoE levels. To directly assess whether ApoE was essential for efficient intracellular Aβ degradation, wild-type or Apoe−/− microglia were isolated and incubated with soluble Aβ42. Loss of Apoe does not impair soluble Aβ uptake by microglia (Figure S2C). Wild-type microglia efficiently degrade Aβ, resulting in lower cellular Aβ levels when examined 24 hr later. However, the degradation of soluble Aβ by Apoe-deficient microglia was significantly impaired (Figures 4A and 4B). When the Apoe null microglia were provided with exogenous ApoE (Figure 4C), their ability to efficiently degrade soluble Aβ was restored, verifying that intracellular Aβ degradation is facilitated by ApoE. Treatment of Apoe-deficient microglia with GW3965 was without effect, demonstrating the that effect of LXR agonists on Aβ degradation is dependent on expression of ApoE (Figure 4D). Human ApoE isoforms confer different risk for LOAD (E4 > E3 > E2) (Roses et al., 1995Roses A.D. Saunders A.M. Corder E.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Han S.H. Einstein G. Hulette C. Schmechel D.E. Holsti M.

We investigated whether the individual ApoE isoforms differ in their ability to facilitate the proteolytic degradation of soluble Aβ by microglia. We isolated ApoE-containing HDL particles produced by immortalized astrocytes derived from mice in which human APOE2, -E3, or -E4 alleles were knocked into endogenous mouse Apoe locus (Morikawa et al., 2005Morikawa M.

Primary microglia from Apoe−/− animals were treated with Aβ42 in the absence or the presence of the same amount of purified human ApoE-containing HDL particles. While all isoforms of human ApoE increased clearance of soluble Aβ, ApoE2 exhibited the strongest effect, whereas ApoE4 was significantly less efficient in promoting the degradation of soluble Aβ (Figure 4E). Addition of ApoE particles did not significantly influence the uptake of soluble Aβ by Apoe−/− microglia. These data demonstrate an ApoE isoform-specific promo"
https://openalex.org/W1965513983,"Rapid, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex is thought to be competitive. After monocular visual deprivation, the reduction in response of binocular neurons to one eye is matched by a corresponding increase to the other. Chronic optical imaging in mice deficient in TNFalpha reveals the normal initial loss of deprived-eye responses, but the subsequent increase in response to the open eye is absent. This mutation also blocks homeostatic synaptic scaling of mEPSCs in visual cortex in vitro, without affecting LTP. In monocular cortex, thought not to be subject to competition, responses in TNFalpha mutants are as reduced as in the binocular zone. Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TNFalpha in wild-type mice phenocopies the knockout. These findings suggest that experience-dependent competition in developing visual cortex is the outcome of two distinct, noncompetitive processes, a loss of deprived-eye responses followed by an apparently homeostatic increase in responses dependent on TNFalpha signaling."

To test whether insulin receptor signaling affects visual system function, we recorded light-evoked responses in optic tectal neurons in living Xenopus tadpoles. Tectal neurons transfected with dominant-negative insulin receptor (dnIR), which reduces insulin receptor phosphorylation, or morpholino against insulin receptor, which reduces total insulin receptor protein level, have significantly smaller light-evoked responses than controls. dnIR-expressing neurons have reduced synapse density as assessed by EM, decreased AMPA mEPSC frequency, and altered experience-dependent dendritic arbor structural plasticity, although synaptic vesicle release probability, assessed by paired-pulse responses, synapse maturation, assessed by AMPA/NMDA ratio and ultrastructural criteria, are unaffected by dnIR expression.

Plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in chow-fed Abca1(-)(M)(/-)(M) and wild-type (WT) mice were indistinguishable. Compared with WT macrophages, Abca1(-)(M)(/-)(M) macrophages had a >95% reduction in ABCA1 protein, failed to efflux lipid to apoA-I, and had a significant increase in free cholesterol (FC) and membrane lipid rafts without induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated Abca1(-)(M)(/-)(M) macrophages exhibited enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased activation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways, which could be diminished by silencing MyD88 or by chemical inhibition of NF-kappaB or MAPK. In vivo LPS injection also resulted in a higher pro-inflammatory response in Abca1(-)(M)(/-)(M) mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion of macrophages with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin normalized FC content between the two genotypes and their response to LPS; cholesterol repletion of macrophages resulted in increased cellular FC accumulation and enhanced cellular response to LPS. Our results suggest that macrophage ABCA1 expression may protect against atherosclerosis by facilitating the net removal of excess lipid from macrophages and dampening pro-inflammatory MyD88-dependent signaling pathways by reduction of cell membrane FC and lipid raft content."

Notably, let-7 miRNA has been reported to play a tumor suppressor role by repression of oncogenes including Hmga2, Ras, and Myc (3Mayr C. Hemann M.T. Bartel D.P.

Additionally, low let-7 expression is important for the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer initiating cells (9Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F.

Hundreds of miRNAs have now been identified, many of which are expressed in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. Under most conditions, control of their expression occurs at the transcriptional level. The miRNA biogenesis pathway involves the sequential processing of primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by the Microprocessor complex (comprising the RNaseIII enzyme Drosha and the double-stranded RNA-binding protein DGCR8) to release 60–70-nt precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) that are subsequently cleaved by the Dicer complex to yield mature ∼22 nt miRNAs (10Gregory R.I.

The developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein Lin28 was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of miRNA processing in embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma cells (18Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Lin28 inhibits the maturation of the let-7 family but not other miRNAs, yet a mechanistic explanation for this selectivity is unknown. We sought to gain insight into the mechanism by which Lin28 selectively blocks the processing of let-7 family miRNAs. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we explored the RNA sequence and structural requirements for Lin28-mediated regulation and found that Lin28 specifically binds the terminal loop region of let-7 precursors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the loop mediates miRNA processing inhibition in vivo and identified the domains of Lin28 required for this inhibition. Electromobilty Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA was conducted using ∼2 × 105 cpm 5′-end-labeled pre-miRNA probe, together with the indicated amounts of competitor RNA and recombinant Lin28 that was prepared as described previously (18Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were conducted in 20 μl of total volume with 30 μg of yeast tRNA. Binding buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 20 units of RnaseOUT, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Bound complexes were resolved on native 5% polyacrylamide gels. Band intensities of scanned gels were quantified using Adobe PhotoShop software. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic function of the nonlinear curve fitting method of GraphPad Prism. The total amount of probe in each binding reaction was normalized against the unbound probe (in the absence of recombinant Lin28 protein (rLin28)) and used to calculate the fraction bound by rLin28. Dissociation constants of pre-let-7g and the let-7g terminal loop were derived from a fit to the equation: Fraction bound = Bmax([rLin28])/(Kd + [rLin28]), where Bmax represents the observed maximum fraction of probe bound, [rLin28] represents protein concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitations—Transient transfections of 293T and HEK293 cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were prepared using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. FLAG-Lin28 immunoprecipitations were preformed using anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma). After a 90-min incubation, the beads were washed twice with BC500 buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.8), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by one wash with BC100 (as above except with 100 mm KCl) before elution with FLAG-peptide (Sigma). Quantitative PCR and Mutagenesis—Levels of mature miRNA species were measured by quantitative PCR using commercially available TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) per the manufacturer's instructions with sno142 RNA or U47 RNA used as internal standards for normalization. The plasmid for expression of let-7g loop/miR-21 was generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the following primers to amplify from the pcDNA3-pri-let-7g plasmid: forward, 5′-CTGAGGTAGTAGTTTGTACAGTTCTGTTGAATCTCATGGACTGTACAGGCCACTGCCTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAAGGCAGTGGCCTGTACAGTCCATGAGATTCAACAGAACTGTACAAACTACTACCTCAG-3′. Plasmids for the expression of the Lin28 proteins containing single amino acid substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the pCMV2-Lin28 using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Northern Blotting—20 μg of total RNA from each sample was used for Northern blotting as described previously (10Gregory R.I. Yan K.P. Amuthan G. Chendrimada T. Doratotaj B. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2004; 432: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Probes for miRNA detection were antisense, end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides to the mature miRNA sequence. Lin28 Selectively Binds the Terminal Loop Region of Precursor let-7 miRNAs—We sought to gain insight into the molecular determinants of Lin28-mediated miRNA processing inhibition. Using EMSA, we demonstrated that recombinant Lin28 selectively binds pre-let-7g RNA (Fig. 1A) but not other pre-miRNAs tested (data not shown). From these experiments, we determined the estimated Kd of Lin28 binding to pre-let-7g to be 2.1 ± 0.32 μm (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, competition experiments with unlabeled (cold) pre-let-7g or cold control pre-miRNA (pre-miR-138) demonstrated that Lin28 binds let-7g with at least 200-fold greater affinity than control miRNAs (Fig. 1B). The hairpin-shaped pre-miRNAs contain a highly base-paired stem that contains the mature miRNA sequence and the complementary miRNA* sequence that are connected by a terminal loop region that, depending on the particular pre-miRNA, may also contain base-paired regions. For clarity, we refer to this as the “loop” hereafter (Fig. 1C). We did not detect Lin28 binding to 22 nt let-7g (miRNA:miRNA*) duplex in EMSA (data not shown). However, using the same EMSA conditions, we detected robust binding to the let-7g terminal loop sequence with an estimated Kd value of 1.5 ± 0.28 μm (Fig. 1D). The Terminal Loop Sequence of Precursor miRNAs Mediates Lin28 Binding in Vitro and Processing Inhibition in Vivo—In mice and humans, the let-7 family miRNAs comprises 12 members, the mature miRNA sequence of which is highly conserved between the different genes (Fig. 2A). Since Lin28 inhibits processing of all let-7 family members and specifically binds the terminal loop of let-7g (Fig. 1D), we hypothesized that there should be common RNA sequence or structural features that confer Lin28-mediated regulation. Indeed, we identified a conserved cytosine nucleotide in the terminal loop region of pre-let-7 miRNAs (Fig. 2A). Although changing this cytosine to an adenosine is not predicted to alter the folding of the pre-let-7g loop region (Fig. 2B), we found that this single nucleotide substitution dramatically reduced Lin28 binding more than 20-fold relative to the wild-type pre-let-7g loop (Fig. 2B). Next, we investigated the role of the loop region in the Lin28-mediated inhibition of miRNA maturation in vivo. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids for the expression of let-7g or a chimeric pri-miRNA in which the terminal loop sequence was replaced with that of miR-21 (a miRNA that is not regulated by Lin28) (18Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Although expression of Lin28 blocked the maturation of let-7g by ∼90%, the expression of let-7g stem/miR-21 loop construct was unaffected by Lin28 (Fig. 2C). Both the Cold Shock Domains (CSDs) and the Zinc Finger Domains of Lin28 Are Required for pre-let-7 Binding in Vitro and Processing Inhibition in Vivo—Next, we sought to identify the Lin28 protein determinants of the miRNA processing block. Lin28 contains a CSD and two retroviral-type zinc fingers (Fig. 3A). Notably, Lin28 and Lin28B can both block let-7 processing and are the only proteins with this combination of motifs (18Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 19Moss E.G. Lee R.C. Ambros V.

CSDs contain ∼70 amino acids that are conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins, part of which is highly similar to the RNP-1 RNA-binding motif (21Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 22Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2861-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The Cys-Cys-His-Cys (CCHC) type zinc finger domains are found predominantly in nucleocapsid proteins of retroviruses, which are required for viral genome packaging and for the early infection process (25De Guzman R.N. Wu Z.R. Stalling C.C. Pappalardo L. Borer P.N. Summers M.F. Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 26Hall T.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Brown R.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the CSD and the CCHC domains may be important for RNA binding by Lin28. To test this, we generated single amino acid substitutions in either the CSD or the CCHC domains and tested their relative ability to bind to pre-let-7g (Fig. 3B). We identified single amino acid residues required for binding to pre-let-7g (F47A, F73A, C161A), whereas other residues had no effect (K45A). Next, we tested the effect of these mutations on Lin28 inhibition of let-7g maturation in vivo (Fig. 3C). We found a correlation between pre-let-7g binding in vitro and blocking let-7g genesis in vivo. Furthermore, single amino acid substitutions in both the CSD and the CCHC domains abolished both let-7 binding and processing inhibition, thus demonstrating that both domains are necessary for Lin28 function. We found that Lin28 specifically binds the terminal loop region of let-7 miRNA precursors and revealed an unanticipated regulatory role for the loop sequence in let-7 maturation. Although the calculated Kd values for Lin28 binding to pre-let-7g (2.1 μm) and to the terminal loop of let-7g (1.5 μm) are quite high, it is important to consider these affinities relative to those of proteins that compete for binding to the miRNA precursors. For example, the reported Kd of DGCR8 (the essential double-stranded RNA-binding component of the Microprocessor complex) binding to pri-miRNA in vitro is between 2.9 and 4.2 μm (28Sohn S.Y. Bae W.J. Kim J.J. Yeom K.H. Kim V.N. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, the estimated Kd of Lin28 is lower than that of DGCR8 and is consistent with our previous observation that Lin28 robustly inhibits the pri-miRNA-processing activity of the Microprocessor complex. In addition, it is possible that the conditions we used for the in vitro binding reaction do not precisely reflect the physiological conditions in which Lin28 acts as a blocker, in which case the physiological Kd may be lower. We demonstrate that both the CSD and the CCHC domains are required for the Lin28-mediated block in let-7 processing. Since let-7 miRNA processing is blocked in Lin28-expressing cells, we propose that plasmid-based strategies for ectopic expression of let-7 will be ineffective in certain cell types including embryonic stem cells. Approaches for expressing let-7 in these cells will require changing the pre-let-7 terminal loop sequence to bypass Lin28 regulation. Similarly, vector-based RNA interference has become a popular approach for analyzing gene function in mammalian cells (29Moffat J. Grueneberg D.A. Yang X. Kim S.Y. Kloepfer A.M. Hinkle G. Piqani B. Eisenhaure T.M. Luo B. Grenier J.K. Carpenter A.E. Foo S.Y. Stewart S.A. Stockwell B.R. Hacohen N. Hahn W.C. Lander E.S. Sabatini D.M. Root D.E. Cell. 2006; 124: 1283-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). These vectors use standard promoters to express short-hairpin RNA directed against a target mRNA. Similar designs have incorporated features of miRNA precursors, including the terminal loop sequence. So far, miR-30 and miR-155 have been utilized in this way (30Zeng Y. Wagner E.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1327-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 31Silva J.M. Li M.Z. Chang K. Ge W. Golding M.C. Rickles R.J. Siolas D. Hu G. Paddison P.J. Schlabach M.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Given the newly identified additional level of regulation by Lin28, RNA interference constructs based on pre-let-7 should be avoided for certain applications. It has been reported that Lin28 localizes primarily to the cytoplasm (20Balzer E. Moss E.G. RNA Biol. 2007; 4: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, as we recently showed, Lin28 blocks the action of the Microprocessor complex both in vitro and in vivo. Since here we demonstrate that Lin28 specifically binds to the terminal loop region of pre-let-7 miRNA, which is part of both the pri-miRNA and the pre-miRNA, it is possible that Lin28 mediates let-7 processing block by specifically binding pri-let-7 and sequestering these bound pri-miRNAs in the cytoplasm away from the action of the nuclear Microprocessor complex. Lin28 homolog B (Lin28B) up-regulation has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma, and its overexpression in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was shown to stimulate cell proliferation (33Guo Y. Chen Y. Ito H. Watanabe A. Ge X. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 384: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Considering that several studies have identified down-regulation of let-7 family miRNAs in various cancers, together with the demonstration that both Lin28 and Lin28B inhibit let-7 processing, it is likely that a better understanding of the mechanism by which Lin28 regulates let-7 biogenesis may facilitate the development of novel cancer therapeutics. It will be important therefore to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of Lin28 together with the let-7 terminal loop to provide a more detailed view of this RNA-protein interaction."

The cerebellum is involved in the learning and control of coordinated movements. The finesse and rapidity of such movements imply very precise timing abilities. Indeed, temporal accuracy has long been considered one of the hallmarks of cerebellar learning (Raymond et al., 1996Raymond J.L. Lisberger S.G.

Time and tide in cerebellar memory formation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about how the cerebellar circuitry can generate such accurate timings, partly due to the paucity of simultaneous recordings of multiple neurons in the cerebellum; nearly all previous in vivo recordings from the cerebellum have sought isolated single Purkinje cells. Despite the rarity of multineuron cerebellar recordings, reports exist of two phenomena that reflect a precise temporal organization of cerebellar cortical activity: millisecond synchrony of Purkinje cell action potentials and high-frequency (∼200 Hz) oscillations of the field potential. Recordings of pairs of Purkinje cells have revealed a precise synchrony (∼1 ms) between cells separated by less than 100 μm (Bell and Grimm, 1969Bell C.C. Grimm R.J.

Association between dendritic lamellar bodies and complex spike synchrony in the olivocerebellar system.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1747-1758PubMed Google Scholar). This synchrony has been suggested to result from common parallel fiber input (Bell and Grimm, 1969Bell C.C. Grimm R.J. Discharge properties of Purkinje cells recorded on single and double microelectrodes.J. Neurophysiol. 1969; 32: 1044-1055PubMed Google Scholar), but this issue remains unresolved. Fast oscillatory activity in the cerebellum was first observed by Adrian (Adrian, 1935Adrian E. Discharge frequencies in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.Proc. Phys. Soc. 1935; 83: 32-33Google Scholar, Isope et al., 2002Isope P. Dieudonne S. Barbour B. Temporal organization of activity in the cerebellar cortex: a manifesto for synchrony.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2002; 978: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in the form of low-amplitude, high-frequency (150–250 Hz) oscillations in the mammalian cerebellar electroencephalogram in decerebrate and anesthetized preparations. These oscillations were subsequently reported in the cerebellar cortices of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds (reviewed in Brookhart, 1960Brookhart J.M. The cerebellum.in: Field J. Magoun H.W. Handbook of Physiology, Neurophysiology. Am. Physiol. Soc., Washington, DC1960: 1245-1280Google Scholar). Later observations in chronically implanted mammals indicated that the oscillations increased in intensity during active waking and paradoxical sleep (Pellet et al., 1974Pellet J. Tardy M.F. Dubrocard S. Harlay F. Phasic electrical activity of the cerebellar cortex during sleep and wakefulness.Arch. Ital. Biol. 1974; 112: 163-195PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relation between neuronal firing and the oscillations was not studied, and no satisfactory mechanism for these oscillations was established. Recently, a pathological form of these oscillations has been associated with cerebellar ataxia in several mutant mice (Cheron et al., 2004Cheron G. Gall D. Servais L. Dan B. Maex R. Schiffmann S.N. Inactivation of calcium-binding protein genes induces 160 Hz oscillations in the cerebellar cortex of alert mice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Cheron et al., 2008Cheron G. Servais L. Dan B. Cerebellar network plasticity: From genes to fast oscillation.Neuroscience. 2008; 153: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Large-amplitude and large-scale field-potential oscillations were observed in the cerebellar cortices of these animals. Purkinje cells were phase locked to the oscillations, whose amplitude was largest in the Purkinje cell layer. This work thus suggests a link between Purkinje cells and the fast oscillations. In the present study, we use cerebellar tetrode recordings in vivo to investigate the population dynamics of Purkinje cell activity. We confirm the existence of both high-frequency oscillation and precise synchrony and show that these two phenomena are directly related. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms allows us to exclude parallel fibers as necessary for either phenomenon, contrary to previous suggestions. Instead, we show how an inhibitory mechanism involving the recurrent axon collaterals of Purkinje cells can generate both oscillations and synchrony. Finally, we elucidate specific properties of the oscillations, which notably exhibit a fixed frequency independent of the Purkinje cell firing rate. Purkinje cells converge strongly upon deep cerebellar nuclear cells, so these oscillations and synchrony are likely to be impressed upon the cerebellar output neurons and therefore to organize the output from the cerebellum. To study the organization of cell firing in the cerebellar cortex, we performed tetrode recordings from the Purkinje cell layer of this structure (Figure 1). Clustering of extracellular spike waveforms typically enabled discrimination of three to seven units from a single tetrode (Figures 1A–1D, see Experimental Procedures). In addition to simple spikes, complex spikes, which are characteristic of climbing fiber activation of Purkinje cells, were routinely observed in the recorded units, but they could be properly isolated only for a subset of the units (typically one to three) (Figures 1E–1H). The temporal properties of single-unit firing were compared to the known properties of Purkinje cells (e.g., Armstrong and Rawson, 1979Armstrong D.M. Rawson J.A. Activity patterns of cerebellar cortical neurones and climbing fibre afferents in the awake cat.J. Physiol. 1979; 289: 425-448PubMed Google Scholar, Cerminara and Rawson, 2004Cerminara N.L. Rawson J.A. Evidence that climbing fibers control an intrinsic spike generator in cerebellar Purkinje cells.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4510-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Most units exhibited an autocorrelogram with a profound central trough, occasionally bordered by ripples, revealing varying degrees of autorhythmicity (Figure 1I), as has been previously reported for Purkinje cells in vivo and in vitro (Armstrong and Rawson, 1979Armstrong D.M. Rawson J.A. Activity patterns of cerebellar cortical neurones and climbing fibre afferents in the awake cat.J. Physiol. 1979; 289: 425-448PubMed Google Scholar, Hausser and Clark, 1997Hausser M. Clark B.A. Tonic synaptic inhibition modulates neuronal output pattern and spatiotemporal synaptic integration.Neuron. 1997; 19: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). These units had an average firing rate of 38.1 ± 30.2 Hz (n = 346, mean ± SD, Figure 1J) and a main peak in their spectrum, corresponding to their modal frequency, at 63.3 ± 39.6 Hz (mean ± SD, Figure 1J). The large difference between the unit firing rate and main peak in the spectrum results from the presence of pauses in cell firing (Armstrong and Rawson, 1979Armstrong D.M. Rawson J.A. Activity patterns of cerebellar cortical neurones and climbing fibre afferents in the awake cat.J. Physiol. 1979; 289: 425-448PubMed Google Scholar, Cerminara and Rawson, 2004Cerminara N.L.

Cerebellar LTD and pattern recognition by Purkinje cells.Neuron. 2007; 54: 121-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These pauses explained the large coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals of 1.20 ± 1.07 (mean ± SD, with a clear bimodal distribution, 12% of the sample having large coefficient of variation values in the range 2–10). Another type of unit was also occasionally encountered. These units had flatter autocorrelograms than Purkinje cells, were devoid of complex spikes, and their firing was associated with a 5–10 ms reduction in Purkinje cell firing, suggesting that they might be interneurons. These units were not associated with the fast oscillations described below (unpublished data) and are not considered further in the present study. To test whether Purkinje cells fire in relation to one another, we computed their crosscorrelograms (Figure 2). These often displayed a central peak, indicating the presence of synchronous (<2 ms) firing, associated with 5 ms side peaks (Figure 2A). To pool results from all unit pairs, we identified in the crosscorrelograms the bins where counts fell outside a confidence interval determined from the expectation for two independent spike trains (Figure 2B and see Supplemental Data). Eighty-five percent of all pairs showed significant correlation (n = 502 pairs from 242 cells firing above 10 Hz out of 292). Large fractions of significant positive correlations were found at ±1 ms, confirming the presence of synchrony (any peak at 0 ms could not be resolved, see Experimental Procedures). Further positive correlations at ±5–6 ms and negative correlations at ±2–3 ms (Figures 2C and 2D) were also observed in a large number of pairs (∼40% and 25%, respectively). Units with a slow average firing rate (<10 Hz) only rarely exhibited significant correlations with their neighbors (n = 206 pairs with one slow unit from 48, data not shown). Thus, neighboring Purkinje cells express millisecond-scale synchrony together with a preferential firing at ∼5 ms intervals, indicating of the presence of a fast (∼200 Hz) rhythm. The spectrum of the local field potential in the Purkinje cell layer revealed fast oscillations. In most (40/44) cases, a peak frequency greater than 100 Hz was fitted (see Supplemental Data). The peaks were distributed in the 120–260 Hz range (Figures 3A and 3B). Corresponding small-amplitude oscillations (typically tens to hundreds of microvolts) were occasionally visible in the raw traces, but were usually difficult to observe in the Purkinje cell layer because of the intense activity. One or a few oscillations could usually be seen in the spike-triggered average of the extracellular potential, with the spike riding on the negative phase of the wave (insets in Figure 6). To test whether the field potential oscillations were related to the correlation between neighboring Purkinje cells, we analyzed the spectral density of multiunit spike trains. When four or more units could be isolated in the Purkinje cell layer, single-unit spike trains were reunited in a multiunit spike train for spectral analysis. In these cases, a high-frequency peak was often present in the spectrum of the multiunit spike trains (a fitted peak >100 Hz; n = 17/28), revealing an emergent organization of the population at a high frequency (Figure 3C). The high-frequency peak in the multiunit spectrum was absent when the multiunit activity was disorganized by shifting independently the single-unit spike trains (Figure 3D, see Supplemental Data), demonstrating that the high-frequency peak depends upon correlations between units. The peak frequency in the multiunit spike train spectrum corresponded to the peak frequency in the extracellular spectrum (Figure 3D). Because Purkinje cells tend to fire rhythmically (Figure 3E), we examined whether the main oscillatory mode of each cell was related to the global population oscillation. We compared the period of the main oscillatory mode of each cell to the period of the field oscillation (Figure 3F). If a cell fired every 2, 3, or any integer N cycles of the oscillation, the ratio between its period and the period of the field oscillation should be 2, 3, or N. However, the distribution of this ratio for a large number of cells did not exhibit peaks around integer values (Figure 3F, dashed lines), indicating that there was no systematic relation between the periods of single-unit oscillations and that of the field oscillation. Thus, the high-frequency peak does not depend upon intrinsic properties of single units (such as a harmonic of the main, lower, frequency of individual units). These results demonstrate the existence of a high-frequency organization of cerebellar cortical activity, associated with a millisecond-scale synchrony of Purkinje cells, and that the peak in the spectrum of the extracellular potential in the Purkinje cell layer results, at least in part, from the multiunit coordination of discharge of Purkinje cells. To localize the currents generating the oscillations, we recorded simultaneously the extracellular potentials in the different layers of the cerebellar cortex, using linear silicon electrodes in penetrations orthogonal to the layers. High-frequency oscillations could be seen in all the layers (Figures 4A and 4B). The wave-triggered average of the local field potential displayed (Figure 4B) a uniform phase across the Purkinje cell and granule cell layers but a reversal of phase in the molecular layer. The amplitude of the oscillation was maximal in the Purkinje cell layer and decreased with distance from the Purkinje layer. The spikes recorded in the Purkinje cell layer were phase locked to the negative phase of the oscillations in the granule cell layer (n = 6, phase = 198° ± 10° [mean ± SD], Figure S1). We then performed a current-source density analysis (Figure 4C), which revealed a source-sink pair in the Purkinje cell layer and the proximal molecular layer, indicating that the oscillations observed in the extracellular potential throughout the cerebellar cortex are generated in the layers containing the somata and proximal dendrites of the Purkinje cells. To examine the lateral extent of the oscillations, we computed the spectral coherence of the extracellular field potential in a plane parallel to the surface. The oscillations were simultaneously recorded with four-shank electrodes (see Experimental Procedures) aligned either “on beam” (along the parallel fibers) or “off beam” (parasagittally). The spectral peak frequencies of the extracellular potential were the same on the four shanks (Figure 4D). Spectral coherence between shanks was observed over a broad range of frequencies, presumably reflecting the direct influence of current source/sinks, and decreased with distance (Figure 4E). However, a coherence peak at the oscillation frequency (the peak in the spectrum in Figure 4D) decreased more slowly with distance, and a small peak (∼0.1) was generally still visible at the largest distance studied (375 μm), where broadband coherence was close to zero. The spatial decrement of oscillation coherence was independent of the orientation relative to the parallel fiber axis (Figure 4F). The high-frequency field-potential oscillations therefore exhibit coherence in the parasagittal and lateral directions over distances corresponding to at least ten Purkinje cell somata. We then investigated the synaptic mechanisms underlying the oscillations. The first hypothesis we tested was that the fast Purkinje cell oscillations are driven by excitatory inputs, the parallel or climbing fibers (Bearzatto et al., 2006Bearzatto B. Servais L. Roussel C. Gall D. Baba-Aissa F. Schurmans S. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Cheron G. Schiffmann S.N. Targeted calretinin expression in granule cells of calretinin-null mice restores normal cerebellar functions.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 380-382PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, a reduction of excitatory transmission should reduce the power of the oscillations, but intravenous administration of GYKI 52466 (Donevan and Rogawski, 1993Donevan S.D. Rogawski M.A. GYKI 52466, a 2,3-benzodiazepine, is a highly selective, noncompetitive antagonist of AMPA/kainate receptor responses.Neuron. 1993; 10: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), an antagonist of the AMPA receptors that mediate climbing and parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells (Konnerth et al., 1990Konnerth A. Llano I. Armstrong C.M. Synaptic currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2662-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), reversibly increased the oscillation power (3 ± 0.7-fold, p = 0.016, n = 7, Figures 5A, 5B, 5D, and 5E). Interestingly, the treatment did not alter the frequency of the oscillations (change in frequency: 0.22 ± 1.28 Hz, p = 0.94). The effective depression of the climbing fiber input by GYKI was verified by the complete disappearance of complex spikes (Figure 5C, GYKI: 99.7% ± 0.2% reduction of complex spike rate, p = 0.016). Thus, the oscillations do not require glutamatergic transmission to Purkinje cells. We confirmed that the oscillations did not require glutamatergic or other extracerebellar input by verifying the presence of oscillations after pedunculectomy (Figure S2). The other fast neurotransmitter that could be responsible for high-frequency oscillations is GABA. We tested the effect of picrotoxin, a noncompetitive antagonist of GABA-A receptors, on the oscillations. Picrotoxin was injected shortly after GYKI injections, so that spurious glutamatergic activity resulting from the disinhibition of the cerebellum or external structures did not interfere with the oscillations (a nonsaturating concentration of picrotoxin was used, to avoid convulsions). Picrotoxin reduced the power of the high-frequency oscillations (Figures 5D and 5E, 37% ± 12% reduction, p = 0.031, n = 7) without restoring complex spikes (Figure 5F). Here also, the oscillation frequency was unchanged by picrotoxin (change in frequency: 4.87 ± 2.92 Hz, p = 0.16). These experiments indicate that GABAergic but not glutamatergic transmission is required for the genesis of the fast oscillations. To investigate further the source of the synaptic inputs responsible for the oscillations, we applied the agonist of CB1 receptors WIN 55,212-2 (WIN), which acts presynaptically to suppress inhibitory inputs from local interneurons, together with excitatory inputs from climbing and parallel fibers (Levenes et al., 1998Levenes C.

Short-term retrograde inhibition of GABAergic synaptic currents in rat Purkinje cells is mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 200-208PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment should, however, preserve the GABAergic recurrent connections between Purkinje cells (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974Palay S.L. Chan-Palay V. The Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization. Springer-Verlag, New York1974Crossref Google Scholar), because they do not express CB1 receptors (Mailleux and Vanderhaeghen, 1992Mailleux P.

Immunohistochemical distribution of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the rat central nervous system.Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 393-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). WIN (Figure 5G-I) induced a 4.14 ± 1.26-fold (p = 0.0078, n = 8) increase in the oscillation power and a 77% ± 3% (p = 0.016) reduction in complex spike rate. The strong increase in oscillation power was not accompanied by a change in frequency (−2.17 ± 4.01 Hz, p = 0.84). The effects of WIN were counteracted by the CB1 antagonist AM 251 (n = 6, Figures 5G–5I), which rescued complex spike firing (161% ± 63% of baseline firing rate) and yielded somewhat lower oscillation power than baseline (73% ± 9% of control, p = 0.031), suggestive of a constitutive activation of the CB1 receptors. Because WIN depresses excitatory and inhibitory inputs, we tested the action of WIN after the block of excitatory transmission by GYKI, in a separate set of experiments (n = 6). The injection of GYKI produced a 4.04 ± 0.81-fold (p = 0.031) increase, and the treatment with WIN further increased the oscillation power 1.21 ± 0.08-fold (p = 0.031). This indicates that WIN increases the oscillation power even after block of excitation and thus spares the GABAergic transmission responsible for the oscillations. In summary, our results suggest that the high-frequency oscillations are not driven by excitatory inputs but rather that they are mediated by cannabinoid-insensitive GABAergic synapses, most probably those of the recurrent collaterals of Purkinje cells. We also examined the effect of the pharmacological treatments on the relation between Purkinje cell firing and the global oscillation. After block of AMPA receptors or activation of CB1 receptors, simple spikes remained time locked to the negative phase of the oscillations, while spike-triggered averages of the extracellular potential exhibited extended oscillations compared to control (Figure 6). We found no evidence for phase locking of complex spikes in spike-triggered averages. This and the strong oscillations observed during treatments blocking complex spikes suggest that climbing fibers are not entrained by the oscillations and play no role in their genesis. AMPA receptor block and CB1 receptor activation altered the firing of Purkinje cell layer units (Table 1), with a 15%–30% increase in the firing rate, a 5%–10% increase in the main firing frequency (the spectral peak in individual spike trains), and an enhancement of firing regularity, as evidenced by a 20% reduction of the coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals. These effects reflect an increased influence of the pacemaking activity of the Purkinje cells (Hausser and Clark, 1997Hausser M. Clark B.A. Tonic synaptic inhibition modulates neuronal output pattern and spatiotemporal synaptic integration.Neuron. 1997; 19: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and may result indirectly from the disappearance of complex spikes (Cerminara and Rawson, 2004Cerminara N.L.

The increase in cell firing contrasts strikingly with the absence of any significant change in the frequency of the fast oscillations in the extracellular potential, showing that the high-frequency oscillation is remarkably independent of the features of single-unit firing.Table 1An AMPA Receptor Antagonist and a CB1 Receptor Agonist Increased the Firing Rate, the Frequency of the Main Autorhythmicity Mode, and the Regularity of Purkinje CellsBaselineTreatmentMeanSEMMeanSEMpWIN (n = 51)Rate (Hz)28.42.633.22.80.014Main Freq.

The above recordings established that Purkinje cell activity is organized in a high-frequency oscillation associated with precise synchrony between cells. The pharmacological profile of the oscillations indicated that an inhibitory (GABAergic) mechanism, most likely involving the recurrent Purkinje cell collaterals, underlies the oscillations. However, it was unclear whether this single mechanism could explain all our observations. Inhibition is known to be particularly effective at promoting zero-delay synchrony between neurons in population oscillations (Bartos et al., 2007Bartos M. Vida I. Jonas P.

https://openalex.org/W1983897183,"At synapses, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) provide the molecular framework for coordinating signaling events across the synaptic cleft. Among synaptic CAMs, the integrins, receptors for extracellular matrix proteins and counterreceptors on adjacent cells, are implicated in synapse maturation and plasticity and memory formation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of integrin action at central synapses. Here, we report that postsynaptic β3 integrins control synaptic strength by regulating AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in a subunit-specific manner. Pharmacological perturbation targeting β3 integrins promotes endocytosis of GluR2-containing AMPARs via Rap1 signaling, and expression of β3 integrins produces robust changes in the abundance and composition of synaptic AMPARs without affecting dendritic spine structure. Importantly, homeostatic synaptic scaling induced by activity deprivation elevates surface expression of β3 integrins, and in turn, β3 integrins are required for synaptic scaling. Our findings demonstrate a key role for integrins in the feedback regulation of excitatory synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2005884107,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. An increase in the amount of alpha-synuclein protein could constitute a cause of PD. Alpha-synuclein is degraded at least partly by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The I93M mutation in ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is associated with familial PD. However, the relationship between alpha-synuclein and UCH-L1 in the pathogenesis of PD has remained largely unclear. In this study, we found that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for CMA, and Hsc70 and Hsp90, which can function as components of the CMA pathway. These interactions were abnormally enhanced by the I93M mutation and were independent of the monoubiquitin binding of UCH-L1. In a cell-free system, UCH-L1 directly interacted with the cytosolic region of LAMP-2A. Expression of I93M UCH-L1 in cells induced the CMA inhibition-associated increase in the amount of alpha-synuclein. Our findings may provide novel insights into the molecular links between alpha-synuclein and UCH-L1 and suggest that aberrant interaction of mutant UCH-L1 with CMA machinery, at least partly, underlies the pathogenesis of PD associated with I93M UCH-L1."

In this study we have shown that apoSOD1 without disulfide is the most facile state for formation of amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. fALS mutations impair either zinc binding, disulfide formation, or both, leading to accumulation of the aggregation-prone, apo, and disulfide-reduced SOD1. Moreover, we have found that the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) facilitates maturation of SOD1 and that CCS overexpression ameliorates intracellular aggregation of mutant SOD1 in vivo. Based on our in vivo and in vitro results, we propose that facilitation of post-translational modifications is a promising strategy to reduce SOD1 aggregation in the cell. Dominant mutations in Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), and aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been proposed to play a role in neurodegeneration.

Approximately 20% of familial cases of ALS (fALS) are defined by mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene (1Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y. Getzoff E.D.

Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5443) Google Scholar), and more than 100 types of mutations have been identified as a cause of this disease. SOD1 is an antioxidant enzyme that disproportionates O2- into O2 and H2O2 at the bound copper ion (3McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a subset of fALS-causing mutant SOD1 fully retains enzymatic dismutase activity (4Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar); therefore, toxicity arises from a gain of toxic function. Although the precise mechanism of how mutations in SOD1 cause neurodegeneration is still open to question, protein aggregates containing mutant SOD1 are found in motor neurons of symptomatic patients and rodent models (5Bruijn L.I. Miller T.M. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Accumulation of insoluble SOD1 aggregates has been proposed to inhibit various cellular activities such as axonal transport and mitochondrial function, contributing to neuronal cell death (6Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar).fALS-causing mutations in SOD1 are considered to trigger non-native interactions and self-aggregation by exerting structural destabilization of an SOD1 molecule. In particular, decreased thermostability of the metal-deficient (apo) form is evident in SOD1 with several types of fALS mutations (7Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17266-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 8Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Rodriguez et al. (9Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) claimed that the apo form of two fALS-causing mutant SOD1 (H48Q and D101N) exhibits comparable thermostability to that of the wild-type (WT) protein. Even in the absence of fALS-causing mutations, a fraction of SOD1 polypeptide is unfolded at body temperature (Tm ∼ 42 °C) (7Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17266-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); indeed, WT SOD1 has been found in protein inclusions in a small subset of sporadic ALS patients (10Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S. Kato T. Matsumoto S. Shiozawa Z. Komori T. Ikemoto A. Umahara T. Asayama K. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 179: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thermostability itself, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of SOD1 aggregation, and it is unclear how fALS-causing mutations promote the formation of SOD1 aggregates.SOD1 is stabilized and matured after post-translational modifications including copper and zinc binding and disulfide formation (11Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 847-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) is responsible for copper loading and disulfide formation in SOD1 (12Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 13Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a CCS-independent pathway of SOD1 maturation has also been reported (14Carroll M.C. Outten C.E. Proescher J.B. Rosenfeld L. Watson W.H. Whitson L.J. Hart P.J. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28648-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Given combinations of status of copper and zinc binding, disulfide formation, and dimerization, SOD1 is theoretically able to adopt 44 canonical states (11Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 847-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Among those, the most immature form is prone to unfolding at a physiological temperature and is susceptible to oligomerization particularly in mutant SOD1 (7Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17266-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SOD1 aggregation has been observed even after being stabilized by several post-translational modifications; apoSOD1 with intact disulfide forms aggregates after prolonged incubation under oxidative conditions (15Banci L. Bertini I. Durazo A. Girotto S. Gralla E.B. Martinelli M. Valentine J.S. Vieru M. Whitelegge J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11263-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Holo-SOD1 can also form Trp-linked covalent aggregates through its HCO3--dependent peroxidase activity (16Zhang H. Andrekopoulos C. Joseph J. Chandran K. Karoui H. Crow J.P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24078-24089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the form(s) of SOD1 that is the most responsible for protein aggregation has yet to be specified.In addition to the post-translational modifications for SOD1 maturation, oxidative modifications on cysteine residues are recently described as a key factor in the aggregation of mutant SOD1. SOD1 aggregates cross-linked via intermolecular disulfide(s) have been found in protein aggregates purified from transgenic mice expressing human SOD1 with fALS mutations (17Furukawa Y. Fu R. Deng H.X. Siddique T. O'Halloran T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7148-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, the non-conserved cysteine residue, Cys-111, is susceptible to oxidation to cysteine sulfonic acid, which accumulates in the protein inclusions of fALS-modeled transgenic mice (18Fujiwara N. Nakano M. Kato S. Yoshihara D. Ookawara T. Eguchi H. Taniguchi N. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35933-35944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutations in each of the four cysteine residues are, however, causative for fALS (C6F, C6G, C57R, C111Y, and C146R), implying that oxidative modification at a specific cysteine residue(s) is not essential for SOD1 aggregation.In this study we have shown that apoSOD1, which lacks the intramolecular disulfide, is the most facile state for forming amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates in the reducing environment typical of the cytosol. An effect of fALS-causing mutations on protein aggregation is to increase intracellular fractions of the apo and disulfide-reduced state by impeding at least one of the SOD1 maturation steps. Given that either metal binding or formation of canonical intramolecular disulfide protects SOD1 from aggregation, we propose that aggregate formation of SOD1 can be ameliorated by facilitating the post-translational modifications of SOD1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Recombinant SOD1 Proteins—Escherichia coli (Rosetta) harboring pET15b, which contains a human SOD1 cDNA fused with a His6 tag at its N terminus, was used for overexpression of SOD1 proteins after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Purification of SOD1 in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was performed using Proteus Midi IMAC (Pro-Chem Inc.). SOD1 is unfolded in the elute buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 6 M GdnHCl, pH 8.0), and further addition of 10 mm EDTA chelates copper and zinc ions in the sample solution. Then, the apo-form of SOD1 in 6 m GdnHCl with 10 mm EDTA was refolded in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The addition of EDTA to the protein solution inhibits binding of metal ions present as trace contaminants in buffers and reagents. Refolded protein samples were concentrated, ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any insoluble material, and then stored at -80 °C. For experiments using Zn2+ ions, EDTA was further removed by buffer exchange to 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. SOD1 with an intramolecular disulfide bond was prepared by incubating the corresponding disulfide-reduced form with 100 μm H2O2 at 37 °C for 1 h and precipitating the protein with 20% trichloroacetic acid. After washing with acetone, disulfide-bonded SOD1 was resolubilized in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. No other modifications such as tryptophan oxidation were observed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The theoretical averaged m/z of E,E-SOD1(C6S/C111S)S-S is 17,935, and a fALS mutation in which glycine is changed to arginine increases the m/z to 18,034. Observed m/z values were as follows; 17,928 in E,E-SOD1(C6S/C111S)S-S, 18,027 in E,E-SOD1(G37R/C6S/C111S)S-S, 18,030 in E,E-SOD1(G85R/C6S/C111S)S-S, 18,031 in E,E-SOD1(G93R/C6S/C111S)S-S.For Co2+ titration experiments, SOD1 was bound to HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl, washed with 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and incubated with thrombin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 1 h to cleave the His6 tag. SOD1 without a His tag was eluted from the spin column by centrifugation and treated with 20% trichloroacetic acid to remove the bound metal ions. After washing with acetone, SOD1 precipitates were re-solubilized in Chelex-treated 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Treatment of buffers with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad) removes metal ions present as trace contaminants.Before performing all in vitro experiments using purified SOD1 samples, we removed any insoluble material by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Concentration of SOD1 was spectroscopically determined from the absorbance at 280 nm by using 5500 cm-1m-1 as an extinction coefficient; 1 μl of the refolded sample was 100-fold diluted in 6 m GdnHCl, and the absorption at 280 nm was measured.Biochemical/Biophysical Analysis of SOD1 Aggregates—Electronic absorption and circular dichroism spectra were recorded using Shimazu UV-2400PC and Jasco J-720, respectively. Images of atomic force microscopy were acquired on a Digital Instruments Multimode Nanoscope IIIa scanning microscope using a J-Scanner. Solution containing SOD1 aggregates (10 μl) was deposited on freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate and incubated for 1 min. Unbound proteins and salt in the buffer solution were washed away with 50 μl of H2O. Imaging was performed in tapping mode with RTESP (Veeco) cantilevers and acquired at a scan rate of 1.0 Hz with 512 lines per image.Kinetics of SOD1 fibrillation using thioflavin T fluorescence was examined using SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices). In a 96-well plate, 150 μl of the sample solution containing 10 μm SOD1 in 100 mm NaPi, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 16.7 μm thioflavin T, pH 7.0 was set per well. Fluorescence signal was monitored at 37 °C at intervals of 2 min with 442 and 485 nm of excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. The plate was shaken for 5 s before each fluorescence reading.Transgenic Mice, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Details of the transgenic mice expressing SOD1G37R have been published elsewhere (19Boillee S. Yamanaka K. Lobsiger C.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kassiotis G. Kollias G. Cleveland D.W. Science. 2006; 312: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Staining of lumber spinal cords with thioflavin S was performed as described (20Westermark G.T. Johnson K.H. Westermark P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Human SOD1 or SOD1 fused with GFP was cloned into pIRESneo3 (Clontech). For experiments of CCS co-expression, neomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence in pIRESneo3 vector was replaced by the CCS cDNA. Neuro2a cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. After transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum for 20 h, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM without serum, incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, and then used for immunofluorescence or Western blotting analysis. To examine the effects of metal ions on the intracellular SH/SS status of SOD1, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing either 50 μm CuSO4 or 50 μm ZnSO4 after transfection for 20 h, and cells were then incubated for 20 h at 37 °C.Western Blotting Analysis of SOD1 Thiol-disulfide Status—Cells were collected in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was obtained by centrifugation. After washing with acetone, the pellet was re-dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 2% SDS, 100 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, with sonication and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the supernatant fraction was determined by BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Ten μg of total protein was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of reductants and loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. It is known that the disulfide-form of SOD1 is less efficiently transferred from the gel to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane compared with the disulfide-reduced SOD1 (17Furukawa Y. Fu R. Deng H.X. Siddique T. O'Halloran T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7148-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, after electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in SDS-PAGE running buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol to reduce the disulfide bond, incubated for 30 min, and washed with SDS-PAGE running buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (17Furukawa Y. Fu R. Deng H.X. Siddique T. O'Halloran T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7148-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Zetterstrom P. Stewart H.G. Bergemalm D. Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brannstrom T. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 14157-14162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By this procedure, protein bands corresponding to SOD1 with and without disulfide bond are equally transferred from the gel to the membrane. The protein was electroblotted on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by Western blotting using sheep anti-human SOD1 antibody (1:5000 dilution; EMD Biosciences) and peroxidase AffiniPure donkey anti-sheep IgG (H+L) (1:5000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Blots were developed with SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce), and the image was obtained using LAS 1000 (FUJI FILM).High-throughput Analysis of SOD1 Aggregates—Neuro2a cells in a 12-well plate were transfected in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum with 1.6 μg of pIRESneo3 harboring an SOD1 gene fused with GFP. After overnight transfection, the cells were incubated in DMEM at 37 °C for 24 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342. Images were captured using the Cellomics ArrayScan V from a total of 150 fields per well at 20× objective magnification. Channel 1 (365 nm, 50-nm bandwidth filter) excites Hoechst 33342, whereas channel 2 (475 nm, 40-nm bandwidth filter) excites GFP. GFP-positive aggregates and GFP-positive cells were separately counted, and fractions of aggregate-containing cells out of transfected cells were calculated. The number of GFP-positive cells counted in each well was ∼30,000 on average, and 3-5 independent experiments were done to estimate error bars.RESULTSSOD1 Becomes Insoluble in the Absence of Any Post-translational Modifications in Vivo and in Vitro—For specification of the metallation and thiol-disulfide status of SOD1, we designate the totally demetallated and reduced state as E,E-SOD1SH, the superscript of which indicates the status of the disulfide-forming Cys residues (Cys-57 and -146), and E represents “empty” at the copper or zinc binding sites. We first used pseudo-WT SOD1, in which two free cysteine residues, Cys-6 and -111, were mutated to serine, preventing possible Cys-linked oxidative aggregation during aerobic incubation (22Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, 10 μm apoSOD1 with intact intramolecular disulfide, i.e. E,E-SOD1(C6S/C111S)S-S, does not precipitate, whereas the protein forms insoluble aggregates in the presence of a reductant, dithiothreitol (DTT), after overnight agitation by shaking the sample solution with 150 rpm at 37 °C. When the protein solution was left without agitation, no aggregation was observed for at least 3 days (data not shown). The protein precipitate also forms with the agitation of 10 μm E,E-SOD1(C4S), in which all four cysteine residues (Cys-6, -57, -111, and -146) are mutated to serine, and the disulfide bond cannot form, whereas the addition of excess Zn2+ ion totally suppresses insolubility of SOD1(C4S) (Fig. 1A). Apo- and disulfide-reduced form of the WT protein also precipitates after overnight shaking in the presence of both EDTA and DTT (data not shown), suggesting that removal of both bound metal ions and intramolecular disulfide is required for SOD1 aggregation.Human SOD1 forms a tight dimer, but monomers form only when all post-translational modifications are absent (23Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Martinelli M. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47998-48003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have, thus, examined the role of monomerization in the decreased solubility using SOD1 with double mutations, F50E/G51E (24Banci L. Bertini I. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mutant SOD1 remains monomeric in the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond and/or bound metal ions. The thiol-disulfide status of the protein is confirmed by the mobility difference on an SDS-PAGE gel with and without β-mercaptoethanol in the samples (supplemental Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1B, monomeric E,E-SOD1(C6S/C111S/F50E/G51E)S-S does not form an insoluble precipitate after overnight agitation at 37 °C, whereas the addition of DTT results in increased fractions of insoluble SOD1. Monomerization alone, therefore, does not cause aggregation of SOD1 protein.We further examined the aggregation propensity of SOD1 in the cellular environment using a mouse neuroblastoma cell, Neuro2a. When fused with GFP, WT SOD1 diffuses throughout the cell (Fig. 1C). Transient expression of SOD1(C4S)-GFP, which is a model of the disulfide-reduced form, does not show any protein inclusions in the cell (Fig. 1D). Because SOD1(C4S) becomes insoluble only in the absence of metal ions in vitro (Fig. 1A), binding of intracellular metal ions would keep SOD1(C4S)-GFP soluble. It is, however, difficult to control the intracellular concentration of Zn2+ ions; therefore, we have prepared mutant SOD1 in which the ligands for Zn2+ binding, His-80 and Asp-83, are mutated to Ala, and a Zn2+ ion cannot be bound. As shown in Figs. 1, E and F, overexpression of SOD1(H80A/D83A)-GFP as well as SOD1(H80A/D83A/C4S)-GFP in Neuro2a results in the formation of protein inclusions, and the quantification of aggregate-containing cells out of total GFP-positive cells is shown in Fig. 1G. These results suggest that binding of a metal (Zn2+) ion plays a protective role against SOD1 aggregation in the cell and are also consistent with the fact that fractions of SOD1 molecules remain disulfide-reduced when overexpressed in Neuro2a cells (see below). We also confirmed the decreased solubility of SOD1-GFP proteins with mutations at the Zn2+-binding site using Neuro2a cells. Compared with SOD1(WT)-GFP, both SOD1(H80A/D83A)-GFP and SOD1(H80A/D83A/C4S)-GFP exhibit about 30% increase in the insoluble fraction when the cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, SOD1 exhibits a tendency to become insoluble when all modifications are removed in both in vitro and intracellular conditions.SOD1 Aggregates Exhibit Amyloid-like Fibrillar Properties—In some neurodegenerative diseases, pathogenetic proteins form insoluble material, which is a fibrous protein aggregate called “amyloid” (25Westermark P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5942-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have, thus, tested whether the insoluble form of SOD1 contains an amyloid-like structure using the amyloid-diagnostic dye, Congo red (26Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Insoluble SOD1 was prepared in physiological buffer conditions (pH 7) by agitation of 10 μm E,E-SOD1(C4S) at 37 °C overnight. Although the soluble form of E,E-SOD1(C4S) does not significantly change the Congo red absorption spectrum, insoluble E,E-SOD1(C4S) shifts the absorption peak from 485 to 530 nm (Fig. 2A). Insoluble aggregates of E,E-SOD1(WT)SH prepared under reducing conditions also red-shifts the Congo red absorption spectrum (data not shown). These data are indicative of the presence of an amyloid-like structure in SOD1 aggregates. Additionally, fibrous morphology with height of ∼10 nm was confirmed in insoluble E,E-SOD1(C4S) using atomic force microscopy (Fig. 2B). SOD1 polypeptide is, thus, considered to become insoluble by adopting amyloid-like structures.FIGURE 2A, absorption spectra of Congo red. 10 μm Congo red (dotted curve) was mixed with either 10 μm soluble E,E-SOD1(C4S) (broken curve) or aggregated E,E-SOD1(C4S) (solid curve). B, atomic force microscopy image of E,E-SOD1(C4S) aggregates adsorbed on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. C, CD spectra of soluble and aggregated E,E-SOD1(C4S). 20 μm soluble E,E-SOD1(C4S) was measured in 5 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, and aggregates were suspended in pure water and measured after brief sonication. D, the aggregation kinetics of E,E-SOD1(C4S) in 100 mm NaPi, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 16.7 μm Thioflavin T, pH 7.0, were monitored with thioflavin T fluorescence. Spontaneous aggregation of 10 μm E,E-SOD1(C4S) is shown in filled circles, and the lag-phase was reduced when the aggregation was seeded with 10% (w/w) E,E-SOD1(C4S) aggregates (open circles).

One of the typical features of amyloid is a β-sheet structure (25Westermark P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5942-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which is indicated by a negative CD peak around 220 nm observed in insoluble SOD1; soluble E,E-SOD1(C4S) is also composed of β-sheets but shows a negative CD peak around 200 nm (Fig. 2C). Different CD spectra between soluble and insoluble SOD1 imply structural changes and/or rearrangement of β-sheets upon formation of SOD1 fibrillar aggregates.Fibril formation is also monitored by a fluorescence increase of thioflavin T, which fluoresces upon specific binding with amyloid-like structures (27LeVine III, H.

SOD1 fibrillation at 37 °C with plate shaking (see “Experimental Procedures”) exhibits a lag time before an increase of thioflavin T fluorescence. In the absence of plate shaking, no changes in thioflavin T fluorescence were observed for at least 3 days. Experiments at 20 °C did not also result in an increase of thioflavin T. The lag time is reduced when pre-formed SOD1 aggregates are added to the soluble E,E-SOD1(C4S) solution (Fig. 2D). This “seeding” phenomenon is a typical feature observed in amyloid formation (25Westermark P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5942-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have further confirmed the amyloid-like pathology in a transgenic mouse expressing human SOD1 with a fALS-causing mutation, G37R, using another amyloid-staining dye, thioflavin S; thioflavin S-positive structures are found in the ventral horn of the lumber spinal cord in symptomatic G37R mice (Fig. 2E), where SOD1 inclusions have been detected (19Boillee S.

Thioflavin S did not stain lumber spinal cords of age-matched non-transgenic mice (C57/Bl6, Fig. 2F). These observations support previous reports of thioflavin S-positive inclusions in transgenic mouse models expressing mutant SOD1 (28Wang J. Slunt H. Gonzales V. Fromholt D. Coonfield M.

Our in vitro/in vivo results have, thus, revealed that complete loss of post-translational modifications significantly facilitates amyloid-like fibrillar aggregation of SOD1. In vitro, SOD1 polypeptide forms fibrillar aggregates even without fALS-causing mutations, leading to our next question. How do fALS mutations aggravate fibrillar aggregation of SOD1?Not All fALS-causing Mutations Increase Fibrillogenesis of SOD1 Polypeptide—fALS mutant SOD1 has the propensity to aggregate in vivo, whereas WT SOD1 does not (30Bruijn L.I.

https://openalex.org/W2131155467,"Pancreatic beta-cell loss through apoptosis represents a key factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes; however, no effective approaches to block this process and preserve endogenous beta-cell mass are currently available. To study the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a proapoptotic beta-cell factor we recently identified, we used HcB-19 (TXNIP nonsense mutation) and beta-cell-specific TXNIP knockout (bTKO) mice. Interestingly, HcB-19 mice demonstrate increased adiposity, but have lower blood glucose levels and increased pancreatic beta-cell mass (as assessed by morphometry). Moreover, HcB-19 mice are resistant to streptozotocin-induced diabetes. When intercrossed with obese, insulin-resistant, and diabetic mice, double-mutant BTBRlep(ob/ob)txnip(hcb/hcb) are even more obese, but are protected against diabetes and beta-cell apoptosis, resulting in a 3-fold increase in beta-cell mass. Beta-cell-specific TXNIP deletion also enhanced beta-cell mass (P<0.005) and protected against diabetes, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) revealed a approximately 50-fold reduction in beta-cell apoptosis in streptozotocin-treated bTKO mice. We further discovered that TXNIP deficiency induces Akt/Bcl-xL signaling and inhibits mitochondrial beta-cell death, suggesting that these mechanisms may mediate the beta-cell protective effects of TXNIP deficiency. These results suggest that lowering beta-cell TXNIP expression could serve as a novel strategy for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes by promoting endogenous beta-cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1995566893,"The present study examines the role of surface modification with an octaarginine peptide (R8) in liposomal escape from endocytic vesicles, using octalysine (K8) as a control cationic peptide; the mechanism of endosomal escape of liposomes was also investigated. Gene expression of condensed plasmid DNA encapsulated in R8-modified nanoparticles was more than 1 order of magnitude higher than that of K8-modified nanoparticles, and 2 orders of magnitude higher than gene expression using unmodified nanoparticles. The difference in gene expression could not be attributed to differences in uptake, as R8- and K8-modified liposomes were taken up primarily via macropinocytosis with comparable efficiency. The extent of R8-nanoparticle escape to the cytosol was double that of K8-nanoparticles. Suppression of endosome acidification inhibited R8-nanoparticle endosomal escape, but enhanced that of K8-nanoparticles. Using spectral imaging in live cells, we showed that R8- and K8-liposomes escaped from endocytic vesicles via fusion between the liposomes and the endosomal membrane. R8-liposomes fused efficiently at both acidic and neutral pH, whereas K8-liposomes fused only at neutral pH. Similar behavior was observed during in vitro lipid mixing and calcein-release experiments. Co-incubation of cells with distinctly labeled K8- and R8-modified nanoparticles confirmed a common uptake pathway and different rates of endosomal escape particularly at longer time intervals. Therefore, it was concluded that R8 on the liposome surface stimulates efficient escape from endocytic vesicles via a fusion mechanism that works at both neutral and acidic pH; in contrast, K8 mediates escape mainly at neutral pH.

From the perspective of cell biology, the mechanisms responsible for this enhanced internalization have also gained considerable attention as possible novel cell-entry pathways. However, despite the controversy surrounding the uptake mechanism that accompanied their discovery, it is now widely accepted that AR-CPPs are internalized via endocytosis (7Richard J.P. Melikov K.

Tremblay J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, Kaplan et al. (13Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Controlled Release. 2005; 102: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) reported that more than 99% of the TAT fusion proteins remain entrapped in macropinosomes even after fusogenic peptide treatment. We previously reported that plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensed with octaarginine (R8) ends up in lysosomes after endocytic uptake (19Akita H. Ito R. Khalil I.A. Futaki S. Harashima H. Mol. Ther. 2004; 9: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, endosomal escape is believed to be the rate-limiting step in delivery of the attached cargo to the cytosol. However, when the pDNA core was encapsulated into liposomes whose surface had been modified with a high density of R8, the liposomes were capable of stimulating uptake via macropinocytosis, and co-localization with lysosomes was reduced, indicating improved endosomal escape efficiency; the net result was high transgene expression (14Khalil I.A. Kogure K. Futaki S. Harashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3544-3551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). One explanation for the difference associated with R8 surface modification is the increased control over the density of R8 available to interact with membranes compared with free peptides, fusion proteins, and R8 polyplexes. These results raised the question as to whether octaarginine plays a role in liposome escape from endocytic vesicles. And if so, what is the escape mechanism of these R8-liposomes? Does escape depend only on the positive charge associated with the peptide or is endosomal escape dependent on specific biological properties of the arginine amino acids? Previous reports using liposomes as model membranes showed that oligoarginine peptides induced either membrane rupture (20Hitz T. Iten R. Gardiner J. Namoto K. Walde P. Seebach D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5817-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or fusion (21Thoren P.E. Persson D. Lincoln P. Norden B. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 114: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, these studies mainly focused on free peptides and were performed on model membranes and not on live cells. Therefore, the present study utilized liposomes modified with R8 as a model for AR-CPPs linked to bulky cargo to study the mechanism of R8-linked cargo escape from endocytic vesicles in live cells. To examine whether the cationic nature of octaarginine plays a role in escape, octaarginine-modified liposomes were compared with those modified with octalysine (K8), a cationic peptide with a structure similar to that of octaarginine. Recently, cellular uptake of oligolysines, which are cationic peptides that lack a guanidinium group, was reported to be comparable with that of oligoarginines (22Mai J.C. Shen H. Watkins S.C. Cheng T. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30208-30218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, K8 serves as a good model for the study of the role that the guanidinium group of R8 plays in endosomal escape. The results of the present study demonstrated that R8-modified liposomes (R8-Lip) escaped from endocytic vesicles much more efficiently than K8-modified liposomes (K8-Lip) despite utilizing the same cellular uptake pathway, macropinocytosis. The escape of both R8-Lip and K8-Lip took place mainly through liposomal fusion to the endosomal membrane. R8-Lip fusion was efficient at both acidic and neutral pH, whereas K8-Lip fusion was limited to neutral pH. These results demonstrate that R8 plays an active role in mediating liposome and endosomal membrane fusion, which leads to efficient escape. The function of R8 in fusion is discussed in detail and the difference between R8 and K8 is explained. Materials—Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), cholesterol (Chol), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Rh-DOPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD-DOPE), l-α-phosphatidic acid (PA) (from chicken egg, monosodium salt), and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Sulforhodamine B was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS), poly-l-lysine, bafilomycin A1, chlorpromazine, and amiloride were purchased from Sigma. Calcein and HEPES were obtained from Dojindo (Japan). Cholic acid was obtained from Nakalai Tesuque (Japan). Stearylated octaarginine (STR-R8) and stearylated octalysine (STR-K8) were synthesized as described previously (23Futaki S. Ohashi W. Suzuki T. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Harashima H. Sugiura Y. Bioconjugate Chem. 2001; 12: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Japan). Plasmid DNA pCMV-luc encoding luciferase was prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The anti-luciferase siRNA (21-mer, 5′-GCGCUGCUGGUGCCAACCCTT-3′, 5′-GGGUUGGCACCAGCAGCGCTT-3′) and the anti-green fluorescent protein siRNA (5′-GCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAUCTT-3′, 5′-GAUGAACUUCAGGGUCAGCTT-3′) were obtained from Thermo Electron GmbH (Germany). NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Preparation of the Octaarginine- or Octalysine-modified Liposomes—Liposomes were mainly composed of DOPE and PA (7:2 molar ratio) or EPC/Chol/STR-R8 or STR-K8 (7:3:1 molar ratio). For spectral imaging experiments, the liposomes were labeled by including 0.5 mol % Rh-DOPE and 1 mol % NBD-DOPE (mol % of the total lipid fraction). Liposomes were prepared using the hydration method followed by sonication for 1 min in a bath-type sonicator (85 W, Aiwa Co., Japan). In the case of DOPE/PA liposomes, after sonication, the liposomes were incubated with an aqueous solution of STR-R8 or STR-K8 (10 mol % of total lipids) for 30 min at room temperature. For flow cytometry experiments, an EPC/Chol/STR-R8 or STR-K8 lipid film was hydrated with sulforhodamine B, which was used as an aqueous phase marker, followed by extrusion through polycarbonate membrane filters (Nucleopore) with pore sizes of 400 and 100 nm using a Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Liposomes then were purified on a Sephadex G-100 column (Amersham Biosciences AB). The particle size distribution of the prepared liposomes was determined using a dynamic light-scattering method and the ζ-potential was calculated from the electrophoretic mobility as determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (ZEN 3600, Malvern Instruments, UK). Preparation of Octaarginine- or Octalysine-modified DNA-coated Particles—Plasmid DNA was condensed with poly-l-lysine as described previously (24Kogure K. Moriguchi R. Sasaki K. Ueno M. Futaki S. Harashima H. J. Controlled Release. 2004; 98: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). 0.25 ml of the condensed DNA solution was then added to the lipid film, which was formed by the evaporation of a chloroform solution of 137.5 nmol of lipids, DOPE/PA (7:2 molar ratio), on the bottom of a glass tube, followed by a 10-min incubation to hydrate the lipid film. The final lipid concentration was 0.55 mm. Rh-DOPE was included as a lipid-phase marker at 1 mol % of the total lipid when required. The glass tube was then sonicated for 1 min in a bath-type sonicator. When required, the coated particles were incubated with an aqueous solution of STR-R8 or STR-K8 (10 mol % of total lipids) for 30 min at room temperature after sonication. The size and ζ-potential of the coated particles were measured as described above. Transfection Assay—One day before transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 4 × 104 cells per well. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 0.25 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing unmodified, R8- or K8-modified DNA-coated particles (Unmod-Cps, R8-Cps, or K8-Cps) encapsulating 0.4 μg of DNA. Next, 1 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added and the cells were incubated for a total of 24 h. To investigate the effects of different inhibitors on gene expression, cells were pretreated with bafilomycin A1 (0.5 μm) for 30 min or with chloroquine just before addition of R8-Cps or K8-Cps and the incubation was continued for 3 h. Next, 1 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added and the incubation was continued for an additional 21 h. The cells were then washed and lysed using 75 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity in the cell lysate then was measured using a luminometer (Luminescencer-PSN, ATTO, Japan). The amount of protein in the cell lysate was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Luciferase activities were expressed as relative light units (RLU) per mg of protein. Flow Cytometry—To investigate the extent of cellular uptake for R8-Cps and K8-Cps, NIH 3T3 cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing increasing concentrations of Rh-DOPE-labeled Cps for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing heparin (20 units/ml). The cells were then trypsinized, washed twice using PBS/heparin and centrifugation at 4 °C, suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and, after being passed through a nylon mesh, analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Live cells were gated on forward and side scatter, and 10,000 viable cells were analyzed. To check the rate of cellular uptake, the same experiment was repeated at a concentration of DNA-coated particles equal to the pDNA dose used for transfection and incubation with particles was continued for 15, 90, and 180 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and analyzed as described above. To examine the mechanism of R8-Lip and K8-Lip internalization, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of amiloride (1.5 mm) or chlorpromazine (5 μg/ml) for 30 min. R8-Lip and K8-Lip containing rhodamine in the aqueous phase were then added (final lipid concentration, 0.1 mm), and the incubation was continued for 1 h. After washing once with PBS supplemented with 4 mm cholic acid and twice with PBS as described above, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Preparation of Octaarginine- or Octalysine-modified Particles Encapsulating siRNA—siRNA was condensed with STR-R8 at a nitrogen:phosphate ratio of 2.9 as described previously (25Nakamura Y. Kogure K. Futaki S. Harashima H. J. Controlled Release. 2007; 119: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A lipid film, formed by evaporation of a chloroform solution of lipids, DOPE/PA (7:2 molar ratio) on the bottom of a glass tube, was hydrated with RNase-free water during a 10-min incubation; the final lipid concentration was 0.55 mm. The glass tube was then sonicated for 1 min in a bath-type sonicator followed by sonication for 10 min using a probe-type sonicator (Branson Digital sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT) while cooling on ice. After sonication, 500 μl of small unilamellar vesicles were added to 250 μl of condensed siRNA, followed by vortexing for 1 min. The resulting siRNA-coated nanoparticles then were incubated with an aqueous solution of STR-R8 or STR-K8 (10 mol % of total lipids) for 30 min at room temperature. The size and ζ-potential of the coated particles were measured as described above. Luciferase Gene Silencing in Stably Transfected HeLa Cells—HeLa cells stably expressing luciferase were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.25 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing different R8- or K8-modified siRNA-coated nanoparticles (siRNA-R8-Cps or siRNA-K8-Cps) equivalent to 0.1 and 0.4 μg of siRNA. Next, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to the cells, followed by a 21-h incubation. The cells were then washed with PBS and lysed using 75 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity in the cell lysate then was measured as described above for the “Transfection Assay.” Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)—To investigate the intracellular trafficking of R8-Cps and K8-Cps, NIH 3T3 cell plasma membranes were first stained with the PKH67 green fluorescent cell linker (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells then were treated with modified DNA-coated particles encapsulating rhodamine-labeled pDNA, at a final concentration of 0.01 mm lipid, in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed once with medium and the incubation was continued for an additional 2.5 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then washed and examined using a confocal laser microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss Co. Ltd., Jena, Germany) equipped with an oil-immersion objective lens (Plan-Apochromat ×63/NA = 1.4). To follow the endosomal escape of K8- and R8-Cps simultaneously incubated with the cells at different time intervals, NIH 3T3 cell plasma membranes were first stained with PKH67, as mentioned above. Cells then were pulsed with K8-Cps encapsulating Cy5-labeled pDNA together with R8-Cps encapsulating rhodamine-labeled pDNA, each at a final concentration of 0.01 mm lipid, in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were then washed once with medium and examined until 30 min (short time interval) using a confocal laser microscope as described above. When checking the escape for a long time interval, the same procedure was repeated, except for a pulse time of 15 min, and the examination was conducted after 3 h. Evaluation of Membrane Fusion between Liposomes and Endocytic Vesicles Using Live Cell Spectral Imaging—For following liposome-membrane fusion in live cells we used a modification of the method that was reported earlier (26Yamada Y. Akita H. Kamiya H. Kogure K. Yamamoto T. Shinohara Y. Yamashita K. Kobayashi H. Kikuchi H. Harashima H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, R8- and K8-modified liposomes were prepared with an additional 1 mol % NBD-DOPE (excitation wavelength, 460 nm; emission wavelength, 534 nm) and 0.5 mol % rhodamine-DOPE (excitation wavelength, 550 nm; emission wavelength, 590 nm) as a donor and acceptor of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), respectively. The dual-labeled liposomes were then incubated with NIH 3T3 cells (final lipid concentration, 0.08 mm) for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were washed and supplied with fresh medium and incubated for an additional 1 h. 10 min before the end of incubation, Hoechst 33342 dye was added to the medium at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml to stain the nucleus. After incubation, the cells were washed and then observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss Co. Ltd.) to localize liposomes within the cell. To spectrometrically evaluate membrane fusion between the liposomes and the endocytic vesicles during escape, NBD was excited by light (488 nm) from an argon laser. Emitted light filtered through a dichroic mirror (HFT488) was spectrometrically analyzed using META equipment over a range of 510 to 630 nm. Spectral data are presented as the relative fluorescence intensity compared with maximal intensity (586 nm). Studying Fusion of R8- and K8-modified Liposomes to Negatively Charged Liposomes—Fusion of vesicles detected as mixing of membrane lipids was monitored using a modified probe dilution assay that is based on FRET (21Thoren P.E. Persson D. Lincoln P. Norden B. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 114: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). In brief, large unilamellar vesicles comprised of DOPC/DOPS/Chol in the molar ratio 4.75: 4.75:0.5 and containing 1 mol % NBD-DOPE and 0.5 mol % rhodamine-DOPE as a donor and acceptor of FRET, respectively, were prepared using the film hydration method described elsewhere (21Thoren P.E. Persson D. Lincoln P. Norden B. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 114: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fusion was monitored by adding the double-labeled liposomes (final concentration is 0.25 mm of total lipids) to unlabeled K8- or R8-Lip (final concentration is 2.25 mm of total lipids) in both acidic and neutral aqueous media (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, adjusted to pH 5.5 or 7.4 with NaOH). The emission fluorescence spectra were monitored between 500 and 650 nm at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm at different time points for 1 h. The occurrence of fusion was detected by following changes in the fluorescence intensity ratio (R value) of NBD-DOPE (521 nm) to Rh-DOPE (586 nm). Data are presented as the mean of two independent experiments. Effect of R8- and K8-modified Liposomes on Calcein Release from Liposomes—Liposomes comprised of DOPC/DOPS/Chol in molar ratio 4.75:4.75:0.5 entrapping calcein were prepared using the film hydration method described elsewhere (28Tachibana R. Futaki S. Harashima H. Kiwada H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, a chloroform solution of the lipids was evaporated in a flask and the residual solvent was removed with a vacuum pump. The lipid film was hydrated with an aqueous calcein solution (40 mm calcein, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Liposomes were sized by extrusion through polycarbonate membrane filters (Nucleopore) with pore sizes of 800 and 400 nm. Vesicles with entrapped calcein were separated from free calcein by size exclusion chromatography (Bio-Gel® A-1.5m gel, medium from Bio-Rad Laboratories), using PBS (pH 7.4) as the eluate buffer. The estimated entrapment yield was ∼1%. Particle size and ζ-potential were measured as described above. Calcein-release experiments were performed by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled R8- or K8-modified DOPE/PA liposomes, prepared as described above, to calcein-entrapping liposomes in both acidic (citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.5) and neutral (PBS, pH 7.4) aqueous media. The incubation temperature was adjusted to 37 °C under stagnant conditions and the incubation was continued for 30 min. Calcein release was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 100 μlat520 nm (excitation wavelength, 490 nm) before (F) and after (FTriton) addition of 10 μl of 5% Triton X-100. The percent release of calcein was calculated using the following equation.&percnt;Release=[(F×100)/(FTriton×110)]×100(Eq. 1) Data are presented as the mean of two independent experiments after exclusion of background fluorescence. Characterization of Prepared Liposomes and DNA- or siRNA-coated Particles—During preparation of the liposomes or coated particles, the stearyl moiety acted as an anchor to the lipid bilayer leaving K8 or R8 peptides freely attached to the surface. The size and ζ potential of prepared liposomes and coated particles are summarized in Table 1. K8- and R8-modified liposomes had comparable sizes and ζ-potential. Similar tendencies were observed for other coated particles between K8 and R8 given here, indicating that there were no significant differences in the physicochemical properties between K8- and R8-modified particles.TABLE 1Characterization of prepared liposomes and DNA- or siRNA-coated particlesLipid composition (molar ratio)Number of measurementsDiameteraData are mean ± S.D.ζ-PotentialaData are mean ± S.D.nmmVUnmod-CpsDOPE:PA (7:2)5158 ± 15−54 ± 8K8-CpsDOPE:PA:STR-K8 (7:2:1)11162 ± 741 ± 9R8-CpsDOPE:PA:STR-R8 (7:2:1)11161 ± 1142 ± 7EPC/Chol/K8-Lip-RAbRA, liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase.EPC:Chol:STR-K8 (7:3:1)599 ± 1732 ± 3EPC/Chol/R8-Lip-RAbRA, liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase.EPC:Chol:STR-R8 (7:3:1)471 ± 1333 ± 5siRNA-K8-CpsDOPE:PA:STR-K8 (7:2:1)5101 ± 337 ± 5siRNA-R8-CpsDOPE:PA:STR-R8 (7:2:1)5105 ± 236 ± 5Rhod-K8-CpscRhod, Cps encapsulating rhodamine-labeled pDNA.DOPE:PA:STR-K8 (7:2:1)5171 ± 1245 ± 13Rhod-R8-CpscRhod, Cps encapsulating rhodamine-labeled pDNA.DOPE:PA:STR-R8 (7:2:1)8165 ± 1444 ± 8a Data are mean ± S.D.b RA, liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled aqueous phase.c Rhod, Cps encapsulating rhodamine-labeled pDNA.

https://openalex.org/W2079297432,"Excessive neuroinflammation contributes to many neurological disorders and is poorly controlled therapeutically. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors has a central role in inflammatory reactions, being stimulated by multiple cytokines and interferons and regulating the expression of many proteins involved in inflammation. We found that STAT3 activation is highly dependent on glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). Inhibitors of GSK3 greatly reduced (>75%) the activating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophage-derived RAW264.7 cells induced by interferon-γ (IFNγ), IFNα, interleukin-6, or insulin. GSK3 inhibitors blocked STAT3 DNA binding activity and the expression of STAT3-induced GFAP and Bcl-3. GSK3 dependence was selective for activation of STAT3 and STAT5, whereas STAT1 and STAT6 activation were GSK3-independent. Knockdown of the two GSK3 isoforms showed STAT3 and STAT5 activation were dependent on GSK3β, but not GSK3α. The regulatory mechanism involved GSK3β binding STAT3 and promoting its association with the IFNγ receptor-associated intracellular signaling complex responsible for activating STAT3. Furthermore, GSK3β associated with the IFNγ receptor and was activated by stimulation with IFNγ. Thus, inhibitors of GSK3 reduce the activation of STAT3 and STAT5, providing a mechanism to differentially regulate STATs to modulate the inflammatory response.

The brain mounts a crucial inflammatory response to control the detrimental effects of injury, infection, and other insults. This neuroinflammatory response is mediated by astrocytes, the most numerous cells in the brain, and macrophage-derived microglia, which assume the immune surveillance role in the brain. If neuroinflammation is excessive or chronic, neuronal function and survival can be impaired, which contributes to many widespread neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis (1Campbell I.L. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2005; 48: 166-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Maragakis N.J. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Clin. Pract.

Therefore, clarifying inflammatory signaling pathways in the brain is critical for developing new methods to control the detrimental consequences of neuroinflammation. A central component of inflammatory signaling is the Janus kinase (JAK) 2The abbreviations used are: JAKJanus kinaseCREBcAMP response element-binding proteinGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorGSK3glycogen synthase kinase-3IL-4interleukin-4IFNinterferonLPSlipopolysaccharideNF-κBnuclear factor κBSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionTLRtoll-like receptorsiRNAsmall interference RNABIO6-bromoindirubin-3′-oximeTDZD-84-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione. /signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cascade (4Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). Activated by cytokines and interferons, receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAKs phosphorylate STATs on an activating tyrosine residue (e.g. Tyr701-STAT1 and Tyr705-STAT3). STATs are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling transcription factors that accumulate in the nucleus as a result of tyrosine phosphorylation increasing the STAT binding affinity to DNA, which slows dephosphorylation of STATs that is necessary for nuclear export, leading to regulation of gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 5Brierley M.M. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Besides regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation, the duration and degree of gene activation by STATs can be regulated by serine phosphorylation, by binding to transcriptional coactivators, and by modulation of the rate of nuclear export, which is required for renewing the non-phosphorylated pool of STATs available for reactivation (6Bhattacharya S. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Lodige I. Marg A. Wiesner B. Malecova B. Oelgeschlager T. Vinkemeier U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43087-43099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This reflects the short half-life of activated STATs (∼15 min) even at optimal DNA binding sites (8Lerner L. Henriksen M.A. Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rapid activation of STATs in response to inflammatory stimuli has heightened interest in developing strategies targeting STATs to control inflammatory responses in the periphery and the brain. In astrocytes, STAT3 is crucial for their differentiation (9Bonni A. Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Bhatt A. Frank D.A. Rozovsky I. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Greenberg M.E.

The participation of STAT3 in neuroinflammation suggests that regulating STAT3 activation in astrocytes is a promising strategy for intervention.

Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) was identified as a crucial regulator of innate inflammatory processes (14Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 15Hu X. Paik P.K. Chen J. Yarilina A. Kockeritz L. Lu T.T. Woodgett J.R. Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 2006; 24: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). GSK3 is a constitutively active Ser/Thr kinase consisting of two isoforms, GSK3α and GSK3β (16Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). GSK3 activity is tightly regulated, primarily by the phosphorylation of regulatory serines, Ser21 in GSK3α and Ser9 in GSK3β, that inhibit its activity, and also by its association in protein complexes and its subcellular localization (17Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). GSK3 was found to be a strong promoter of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-12p40, and interferon-γ (IFNγ), in part by promoting NF-κB activity (14Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), and inhibition of GSK3 protects rodents from a variety of peripheral inflammatory conditions (reviewed in Ref. 18Jope R.S. Yuskaitis C.J. Beurel E. Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 577-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). As reviewed by Yoshimura (19Yoshimura A. Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), “three major transcription factors, including NF-κB, STAT3, and STAT1 have been shown to play major roles in transmitting inflammatory cytokine signals to the nucleus.” The recent revelations that GSK3 promotes inflammation and the activation of NF-κB (14Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 20Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R.

Biol. 2005; 25: 8444-8455Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) raised the question of whether GSK3 also promotes the activation of STAT3 or STAT1. Examination of this revealed that GSK3, particularly GSK3β, is required for the activating tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, but not STAT1, in astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages induced by IFNγ and other stimuli. Surprisingly, GSK3 was found to be associated with the IFNγ receptor and activated following stimulation with IFNγ. Thus, inhibition of GSK3 reduces activation of two critical pathways of the inflammatory response, NF-κB and STAT3. Reagents—Protein-free Escherichia coli (K235) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was prepared as described before (22Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). IFNγ was obtained from R&D Systems, IFNα from PBL Biomedical Laboratories, IL-4 and GM-CSF from RayBiotech Inc., SB216763 and SB415286 from Tocris, kenpaullone, indirubin-3′-monoxime, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO), TDZD-8 and GSK3 inhibitor II from Calbiochem, IL-6 from eBioscience, insulin and LiCl from Sigma, and JSI-124 (cucurbitacin) from the NCI Developmental Therapeutic Program, National Institutes of Health. Cell Culture—Primary astrocytes were prepared from cerebral cortex of 1-day-old C57Bl/6 mice as described previously with minor modifications (23McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar), cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.3% glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin, and after 10 days of culture shaken 30 h at 250 rpm, resulting in >95% pure astrocytes as determined by immunostaining with the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. After the first hour of shaking, the medium containing microglia cells was collected. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. IFNγ (1 ng/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or both, IFNα (103 units/ml), IL-4 (25 ng/ml), GM-CSF (25 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), or insulin (50 ng/ml) were added to cell culture medium without supplements for 5 min to 6 h before cells were harvested. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and GSK3 Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membrane and soluble fractions were separated using a membrane extraction kit (Calbiochem), and nuclear and cytosolic fractions were fractionated using a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif). Proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE, and nitrocellulose membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-Tyr705-STAT3, phospho-Ser727-STAT3, phospho-Tyr701-STAT1, phospho-Tyr694-STAT5, phospho-Tyr641-STAT6, STAT3, STAT1, STAT5, STAT6, phospho-Tyr1022/1023-JAK1, phospho-Tyr1007/1008-JAK2, phospho-Tyr1054/1055-TYK2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), total phosphotyrosine, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), GSK3α/β (Upstate/Millipore, Lake Placid, NY), TLR4 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), CD119, JAK1 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), JAK2 (BIOSOURCE), Bcl-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and β-actin (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were washed three times. GSK3 activity was assayed in CD119 and TLR4 immunoprecipitants from primary astrocytes as described previously (24Peineau S. Taghibiglou C. Bradley C. Wong T.P. Liu L. Lu J. Lo E. Wu D. Saule E.

As a negative control, GSK3 activity was inhibited with lithium (20 mm) in the kinase assay to ensure specificity. STAT3 DNA Binding—Nuclei from mouse astrocytes were extracted with a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif). Astrocyte nuclear extracts (2 μg) were assayed for STAT3 DNA binding activity using the TransAM kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adenoviral Transduction—Mouse astrocytes were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium without supplements, infected with 50 multiplicity of infection of the designated adenovirus construct for 30 min, and supplemental medium was added for incubation for 36–48 h. All infected cultures were examined for adequate infection efficiency (∼80%) as assessed by green fluorescent protein fluorescence. siRNA Transfection—The prevalidated siRNA oligonucleotide sequence for STAT3 (25Zhou W. Grandis J.R. Wells A. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 95: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Silencer negative control were obtained from Ambion, and those of GSK3α and GSK3β (Smart pool) were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Cells were transfected using liposome-mediated transfection reagent Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with 50 nm siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance between groups was evaluated by analysis of variance or Student's t test. GSK3 Inhibitors Block STAT3 Activation—Stimulation of TLR4 with LPS activates inflammatory signaling in responsive cells, and this inflammatory response can be amplified by costimulating the IFNγ receptor (26Schroder K. Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. Immunobiology. 2006; 211: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which predominantly activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (27Schroder K. Hertzog P.J. Ravasi T. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). Therefore, the kinetics of STAT3 activation in mouse primary astrocytes was determined in response to treatment with LPS, IFNγ, or both, at the minimal concentration of IFNγ sufficient to induce synergistic physiological responses. Stimulation with LPS plus IFNγ caused a rapid (15 min) and long lasting increase in phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 in primary astrocytes (Fig. 1A). Most of this STAT3 activation was due to IFNγ (28Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), because IFNγ alone increased phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 to a similar degree as attained following treatment with LPS plus IFNγ. The total level of STAT3 remained unaltered following each treatment. Thus, treatment with IFNγ induced a robust and long lasting activation of STAT3 in astrocytes. GSK3 was found to be crucial for the activation of STAT3 in primary astrocytes. Treatment with the selective GSK3 inhibitor lithium (29Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) reduced the initial tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 attained after 15 min of stimulation with LPS plus IFNγ, and the inhibition by lithium was maintained throughout 6 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). Lithium blocked by 77 ± 9% (mean ± S.E., n = 4) the increase in phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 induced by a 30-min treatment with LPS plus IFNγ (Fig. 1C) but did not markedly affect the phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 or the total level of STAT3. To confirm that reduced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation caused by lithium treatment was due to GSK3 inhibition, four other structurally diverse, selective GSK3 inhibitors were tested, including SB415286, SB216763 (30Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C.

Castro A. Perez C. Moreno F.J. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Along with lithium, all five GSK3 inhibitors greatly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by treatment with LPS plus IFNγ in primary astrocytes without modifying the total level of STAT3 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the concentration dependencies of lithium and SB216763 in reducing IFNγ-stimulated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1E) were consistent with the original reports describing their inhibitions of GSK3 (30Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if GSK3 also is required for STAT3 activation in other types of cells besides primary astrocytes, macrophage-derived RAW264.7 cells and primary mouse microglia were examined. GSK3 inhibitors greatly reduced IFNγ-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in both RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1F) and mouse primary microglia (Fig. 1G), indicating that GSK3 is required for STAT3 activation induced by IFNγ in multiple cell types. Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3 promotes its accumulation in the nucleus, and thus its activity as a transcription factor (34Ma J. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Tan A.L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Treatment of astrocytes with IFNγ caused a time-dependent increase in nuclear phospho-Tyr705-STAT3, which reached a maximum at 30 min (Fig. 2A). The nuclear accumulation of activated phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 was greatly reduced by inhibition of GSK3 with lithium throughout a 5- to 120-min stimulation with IFNγ (Fig. 2A). Stimulated nuclear accumulation of phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 also was largely eliminated by treatment with TDZD-8 (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the findings that GSK3 inhibitors reduced the activation of STAT3, treatment with lithium or TDZD-8 blocked the transcriptional activation of STAT3 as determined by using nuclear extracts from primary astrocytes to measure STAT3 binding to consensus site oligonucleotides, although they did not alter the basal level of STAT3 binding (Fig. 2C). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 depressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, resulting in inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding activity. The GSK3 dependence of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity indicated that GSK3 inhibitors would block STAT3-induced gene expression. To test this, we examined the effect of inhibiting GSK3 on STAT3-induced increases in levels of proteins known to be STAT3 targets. STAT3-mediated expression was attained by expressing an active form of STAT3, STAT3C, in which covalent bonds between cysteines establishes the active dimer conformation (35Bromberg J.F.

Although originally thought to be constitutively active, recent evidence shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3C is necessary for it to be active (36Li L. Shaw P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33172-33181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expressed STAT3C was tyrosine phosphorylated in the absence of a stimulus, and this was effectively blocked by inhibiting GSK3 with lithium (Fig. 2D). STAT3C expression in primary astrocytes was sufficient to increase the levels of GFAP and Bcl-3, proteins widely reported to be induced by active STAT3 (9Bonni A. Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Bhatt A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 6965-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and these increases were blocked by lithium treatment (Fig. 2E). We noted that lithium reduced GFAP to below the control level and found that lithium treatment time-dependently reduced GFAP levels in primary astrocytes independent of any additional treatment (Fig. 2F). Thus, the inhibition of STAT3C activation by GSK3 inhibitors was sufficient to block its induction of several proteins. The regulation of STAT3 activation by GSK3 was evaluated further by comparing the effect of inhibiting GSK3 with lithium to the effect of a direct inhibitor of STAT3 activation, JSI-124 (also called cucurbitacin) (41Blaskovich M.A. Sun J. Cantor A. Turkson J. Jove R. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1270-1279PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of primary astrocytes with 10 μm JSI-124 effectively blocked IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 measured in cell extracts (Fig. 3A), membrane fractions (Fig. 3B), or nuclear fractions (Fig. 3C), and inhibition of GSK3 with lithium produced comparable, or greater, inhibition of STAT3 activation in each preparation. Treatment with JSI-124 or lithium also caused similar reductions of STAT3 activation in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3D) and mouse primary microglia (Fig. 3E). These findings demonstrate that GSK3 inhibitors have a strong ability to inhibit STAT3 activation induced by IFNγ. The GSK3 dependence of IFNγ-induced STAT3 activation raised the question of whether GSK3 also is required for other stimuli to activate STAT3. IL-6 (50 ng/ml) (42Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) induced a large increase in phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 in primary astrocytes, and this was blocked by inhibition of GSK3 with lithium or by JSI-124 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, GSK3 inhibitors also greatly reduced the stimulation of phospho-Tyr705-STAT3 induced by IFNα (103 units/ml) (43Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) or by insulin (50 ng/ml) (44Coffer P.J. van Puijenbroek A. Burgering B.M. Klop-de Jonge M. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2529-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in both primary astrocytes and RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that GSK3 is required for STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by a variety of stimuli in multiple types of cells. GSK3 Selectively Regulates STAT3 Activation—Because GSK3 strongly promoted STAT3 activation, we examined if this effect is selective or if GSK3 is also required for activation of other members of the STAT family. Treatment of primary astrocytes or RAW264.7 cells with LPS plus IFNγ increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (27Schroder K. Hertzog P.J. Ravasi T. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar, 28Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar), and this was unaffected by GSK3 inhibitors (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, the absence of effect of GSK3 inhibitors on STAT1 activation was not dependent on the stimulus, because the phosphorylation of Tyr701-STAT1 induced by IFNα (43Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) was not affected by GSK3 inhibitors (Fig. 5B). Thus, GSK3 inhibitors did not completely block IFNγ-induced signaling but selectively inhibited IFNγ-induced activation of STAT3 but not of STAT1. Activation of STAT6 also was independent of GSK3. IL-4 was used to activate STAT6 (45Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) in primary astrocytes, microglia, and RAW264.7 cells, and GSK3 inhibitors did not reduce the stimulated production of phospho-Tyr641-STAT6 (Fig. 5C). However, STAT5 (STAT5A and STAT5B) activation demonstrated GSK3 dependence in primary astrocytes, because stimulation of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation by either IFNα or IFNγ (43Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) was blocked by inhibitors of GSK3 (Fig. 5D). GSK3 inhibitors also inhibited the production of phospho-Tyr694-STAT5 induced by treatment with GM-CSF (46Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) or IFNγ in primary microglia (Fig. 5E). Thus, the activation of STAT3 and STAT5 displayed a dependence on GSK3, whereas STAT1 and STAT6 were GSK3-independent. STAT3 Tyr705 Phosphorylation Is Dependent on the GSK3β Isoform—Both isoforms of GSK3, GSK3α and GSK3β, are expressed and constitutively active in most cells and are blocked by all GSK3 inhibitors. To test if either isoform was predominant in facilitating STAT3 or STAT5 activation in astrocytes, the level of each isoform of GSK3 was selectively reduced by ∼70% using siRNA (Fig. 6A). IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylations of STAT3 and of STAT5 were reduced by knocking down GSK3β comparably with the knockdown efficiency, consistent with the effects of GSK3 inhibitors on the activation of STAT3 and STAT5 (Fig. 6, B and C). Surprisingly, the IFNγ-induced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 were increased by knockdown of GSK3α. In contrast, knocking down either isoform of GSK3 was without effect on the activation of STAT1 or on the total levels of the STATs (data not shown). Thus, GSK3β is essential for the activation of STAT3 or STAT5 by tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas GSK3α has a different regulatory role. Reinforcing these conclusions, expression of constitutively active S9A-GSK3β in astrocytes was sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the absence of additional stimuli (Fig. 6D). In contrast, STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected by expression of constitutively active S21A-GSK3α. STAT3 Inhibition by Blocking GSK3 Is Not Mediated by Phosphatases or JAKs—Because full activation of STAT3 is dependent on GSK3, we examined if GSK3 regulates phosphatase or kinase actions associated with STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (42Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar)."

We show here that YCF48 is a component of two cyanobacterial PSII RC-like complexes in vivo and is absent in larger PSII core complexes. Interruption of ycf48 slowed the formation of PSII complexes in wild type, as judged from pulse-labeling experiments, and caused a decrease in the final level of PSII core complexes in wild type and a marked reduction in the levels of PSII assembly complexes in strains lacking either CP43 or CP47.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The complex consists of over 20 intrinsic and peripheral membrane proteins, which must be assembled in a highly coordinated manner to ensure proper functioning of the complex (2Aro E-M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamäki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). At the heart of the complex is a heterodimer of the D1 (the psbA gene product) and related D2 (the psbD gene product) polypeptides, which binds most of the redox-active cofactors involved in PSII electron transfer (3Diner B.A. Rappaport F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 551-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The isolated PSII reaction center (RC) complex contains, in addition to D1 and D2, the intrinsic PsbI subunit and cytochrome b559, which bind to D1 and D2, respectively (4Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surrounding the PSII RC complex are two chlorophyll-binding proteins, CP43 (the psbC gene product) and CP47 (the psbB gene product). D1 and CP43 also provide several amino acid ligands to the Mn4Ca cluster involved in the oxidation of water (5Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.N. Maglaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S.

In vivo, the D1 protein exhibits much faster synthesis and degradation (or protein turnover) than the other PSII subunits (7Prášil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Top. Photosynth. 1992; 11: 295-348Google Scholar). This feature reflects the operation of a PSII repair cycle to overcome the effects of PSII photoinhibition, which primarily causes irreversible damage to D1 (8Yokthongwattana K. Melis A. Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Matoo A. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration, Photoprotection, Photoinhibition, Gene Regulation, and Environment. Springer, Dordrecht2006: 175-191Google Scholar). In most PSII-containing organisms, D1 is synthesized as a precursor protein (pD1) with a carboxyl-terminal extension (9Satoh K. Yamamoto Y. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 94: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 this extension consists of 16 amino acid residues, which is removed in two steps by the CtpA endoproteinase: first by cleavage on the carboxyl side of residue Ala352, to generate i-D1, and then by cleavage after Ala344 to form mature D1 (10Nixon P.J.

PSII assembly appears to occur in a stepwise fashion and involves the formation of a PSII RC-like complex, possibly from D2-cytochrome b559 and pD1-PsbI pre-complexes (14Müller B. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Dobáková M. Tichý M. Komenda J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Then the antennae, CP47 and CP43, plus other low-molecular mass polypeptides, become sequentially attached to form the PSII non-oxygen-evolving core complex. Light-driven assembly of the Mn4Ca cluster, and attachment of the lumenally exposed extrinsic proteins of PSII, complete the assembly of the PSII holoenzyme, which exists as both a monomer and dimer in vivo (2Aro E-M.

Many details, such as the timing of co-factor attachment to apoproteins and binding of small membrane polypeptides to PSII, are still obscure, as are the identity and roles of PSII assembly factors. Analysis of high chlorophyll fluorescence (HCF) photosynthetic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana led to the identification of a nucleus-encoded assembly factor, HCF136 (now designated YCF48), which was targeted to the lumen and was needed for accumulation of PSII (18Meurer J. Plücken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Later, in vivo radiolabeling experiments demonstrated that formation of the PSII RC complex was specifically blocked in the absence of YCF48 (19Plücken H. Müller B. Grohmann D. Westhoff P. Eichacker L.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, affinity chromatography using immobilized YCF48 suggested its interaction with a PSII assembly complex containing at least D2 and cytochrome b559 but whether it formed a complex with PSII in vivo was unclear (19Plücken H. Müller B. Grohmann D. Westhoff P. Eichacker L.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). YCF48 homologues are found in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms including cyanobacteria. Somewhat surprisingly, the YCF48 homologue is not absolutely required for photoautotrophic growth of Synechococcus PCC 7002 and hence is not required for assembly of PSII (20Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whether YCF48 homologues play an evolutionarily conserved role in PSII assembly is therefore unclear, and an important point to resolve. The homologue of YCF48 in the cyanobacterium Synechococystis PCC 6803 is encoded by the slr2034 gene (Cyanobase annotation). It is located upstream of the psbEFLJ operon, encoding four small subunits of PSII, including the two apopolypeptides of cytochrome b559. In this article we investigated whether the slr2034 gene product (designated here as YCF48) is involved in the assembly of cyanobacterial PSII. We show that YCF48 is a component of PSII RC-like assembly complexes consisting of at least D2, D1, cytochrome b559, and PsbI (but lacking CP47 and CP43) and that it is required for efficient assembly of PSII. Importantly we provide evidence that the unassembled precursor proteins of D1 (pD1 and iD1) are binding partners for this assembly factor and that YCF48 also functions in PSII repair. Construction and Cultivation of Cyanobacterial Strains—The strains used in the study were derived from the glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar) referred to as wild type (WT). The following previously described strains were used in the study: (i) the CP43-less strain, psbC–, with the psbC gene inactivated by a kanamycin-resistance cassette (22Vermaas W.F.J. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 17: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); (ii) the CP47-less strain, psbB–, with the psbB gene inactivated by a spectinomycin-resistance cassette (23Eaton-Rye J.J. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); and (iii) the psbEFLJ– strain with the psbEFLJ operon replaced by a kanamycin-resistance cassette (24Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The ycf48– strain was constructed by interrupting the slr2034 gene with a chloramphenicol-resistance cassette at the HindIII site located 506 bp into the 1026-bp open reading frame. Transformants were selected and segregated on chloramphenicol-containing agar plates containing 5 mm glucose and full segregation of the mutation was confirmed by PCR. Multiple ycf48 interruption strains were obtained by transformation of single mutants lacking psbC, psbB, and psbEFLJ genes using chromosomal DNA from ycf48– and their selection for the additional resistance to chloramphenicol. Liquid cultures (100–200 ml) were grown in BG-11 medium in 500-ml Ehrlenmeyer flasks, aerated using an orbital shaker, irradiated with 30 μmol photons m–2 s–1 of white light at 29 °C, and used when they reached a chlorophyll (Chl) concentration of about 2–3 μg ml–1. Solid medium contained in addition 10 mm Tes/NaOH, pH 8.2, 1.5% agar, and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate (24Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Media for cultivation of non-autotrophic strains contained in addition 5 mm glucose. Measurements of light-limited autotrophic growth rates were performed in microtitration plates (culture volume 0.25 ml) under intensive shaking and illumination at 25 μmol photons m–2 s–1. Optical densities at 750 nm were measured every 6 h using a microplate reader (Tecan Sunrise, Vienna, Austria). Values plotted against time were used for calculation of the doubling time. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from frozen cells following the hot TRIzol protocol (25Caldo R.A. Nettleton D. Wise R.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2514-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), purified by RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen), and treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion). Twenty nanograms of purified RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using random primers and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time-quantitative PCR were performed on the Rotor-Gene 3000 using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Each quantitative PCR experiment was performed on two replicates for two independent RNA isolations from the same culture. rps1 (encoding the 30 S ribosomal protein, S1) was used as a reference gene. Its level was found to be proportional to total RNA (measured spectrophotometrically) in all strains. The ΔCt method was used to calculate psbA gene expression normalized against rps1. The ΔCt values were reproducible to within 0.5 cycle. Luminometric and Polarographic Methods—The FV/F0 parameter and kinetics of Chl variable fluorescence decay were measured in dark-adapted cultures (2.5 μg Chl ml–1) using a modulation PAM101 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with an ED-101US cuvette and the Dual Modulation Kinetic Fluorometer (Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic), respectively (26Tichý M. Lupínková L. Sicora C. Vass I. Kuviková S. Prášil O. Komenda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1605: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The light-saturated steady-state rate of oxygen evolution in cell suspensions was measured polarographically in BG-11 medium containing 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, using 0.5 mm p-benzoquinone and 1 mm potassium ferricyanide as artificial electron acceptors. Photosynthetic thermoluminescence was measured with cells filtered onto the nitrocellulose membrane (6 μg of Chl) using a commercial apparatus (Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic). Cells were covered with 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, and dark-adapted for 5 min at 25 °C. Then, the temperature was decreased to 3 °C, two saturating flashes were given and thermoluminescence was measured during heating from 3 to 70 °C. The area of the thermoluminescence band B originating from the charge recombination between the donor S2 and S3 states and the PSII acceptor QB (26Tichý M. Lupínková L. Sicora C. Vass I. Kuviková S. Prášil O. Komenda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1605: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was calculated and taken as a measure for PSII content. Preparation of Membranes and Their Protein Analysis—Cyanobacterial membranes were prepared by breaking the cells using glass beads (27Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9625-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: cells were washed, broken, and finally resuspended in 25 mm Mes/NaOH, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol. Highly purified thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes were obtained using the procedure described in Ref. 28Huang F. Parmryd I. Nilsson F. Persson A. Pakrasi H.B. Anderson B. Norling B. Mol.

For analysis of protein complexes, isolated membranes were solubilized with dodecylmaltoside (DM) (DM/Chl = 40, w/w) and analyzed by blue native electrophoresis at 4 °C in 5–14% polyacrylamide gels according to Ref. 29Schägger H. von Jagow G.

The protein compositions of the complexes were assessed in the second dimension by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea (30Komenda J. Lupínková L. Kopecký J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The whole lane from the native gel was excised, incubated for 30 min in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS (w/v) and placed on the top of the denaturing gel; two lanes were analyzed in a single denaturing gel. Proteins separated in the gel were either stained by Coomassie Blue or transferred onto PVDF membrane. Membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies and then with secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The primary antibodies used in the study were raised in rabbit against: (i) residues 58–86 of the spinach D1 polypeptide; (ii) the last 12 residues of the D2 polypeptide from Synechocystis 6803; (iii) residues 380–394 of barley CP47; (iv) the whole isolated CP43 from Synechocystis 6803; (v) the whole isolated α subunit of cytochrome b559 from Synechocystis 6803; (vi) residues 2–12 of β subunit of cytochrome b559 from Synechocystis 6803; and (vii) the whole HCF136 from A. thaliana overexpressed in Escherichia coli (18Meurer J. Plücken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For autoradiography, the gel or the membrane with labeled proteins was exposed to x-ray film at laboratory temperatures for 2–3 days or to a Phosphor-Imager plate (GE Healthcare) overnight. Samples used for direct comparison and quantification of stained or labeled proteins were loaded with the same Chl content and were run on a single gel. Quantification of bands was done using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). Radioactive Labeling of the Cells—Cells containing 75 μgof Chl were resuspended in 250 μl of BG-11 in a microcentrifuge tube, shaken at 60 μmol photons m–2 s–1 for 30 min and then a mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (Trans-label, MP Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) was added (final specific activity, 400 μCi ml–1). The suspension was exposed to light at irradiance and the temperature indicated and afterward the cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for isolation of thylakoids. Co-immunoprecipitation of Cytochrome b559 and D1—Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (31Komenda J. Tichý M. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using antibody against the β subunit of cytochrome b559 (PsbF). Briefly, thylakoids isolated from radioactively labeled cells of the psbA– strain were solubilized with DM and after overnight incubation with the specific antibodies the immunoglobulins bound to Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) were released by the Tris buffer containing 2% SDS and 2% dithiothreitol at 50 °C. The eluate was analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and used for autoradiography and immunodetection. Yeast Two-hybrid Analyses—The split ubiquitin system was used to analyze membrane protein interactions in yeast (32Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ORF slr2034 was PCR amplified from genomic Synechocystis DNA, using oligonucleotides slr2034-a and slr2034-b (supplemental Table S1), cloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen, Hilden), verified by sequencing, and, subsequently, inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the yeast vector, pADSL (Dualsystems Biotech AG). Similarly, psbA-coding regions, covering either the intermediate form iD1, or the mature D1 protein, as well as psbD and ctpA coding regions, were amplified using the oligos described in supplemental Table S1. After subcloning in pDrive and sequence verifications, the respective fragments were inserted into the BamHI and StuI sites of vector pTMBV or the PstI and SpeI sites of pTFB1 (only ctpA). The pTMBV derivative containing the entire psbA coding of pD1 has already been described (33Pasch J. Ch. Nickelsen J. Schünemann D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 69: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pTFB1-psaB construct was kindly provided by F. Ossenbühl. Interaction assays were performed in the yeast strain DSY-1 (33Pasch J. Ch. Nickelsen J. Schünemann D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 69: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fusion protein synthesis was verified by co-transformation with plasmid Alg5-NubI and autoactivation of reporter gene expression was excluded by co-transformation with plasmid Alg5-NubG precisely as described (33Pasch J.

Chl Content—Pelleted cells or membranes were extracted with 100% methanol and Chl content in the extract was calculated from the absorbance at 666 and 720 nm (34Wellburn A.R. Lichtenthaler K. Sybesma C. Advances in Photosynthesis Research. Martinus Nijjhoff, Dordrecht1984: 10-20Google Scholar). YCF48 Is a Component of PSII RC Assembly Complexes in Synechocystis 6803—In A. thaliana, YCF48 was proposed to act as an assembly factor that is transiently bound to PSII assembly intermediate(s), but is not a component of fully assembled monomeric and dimeric core complexes (19Plücken H. Müller B. Grohmann D. Westhoff P. Eichacker L.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To test whether this conclusion also applies to the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we screened for the presence of the YCF48 homologue in various PSII complexes and assembly intermediates using a combination of two-dimensional PAGE (consisting of blue native PAGE and denaturing PAGE; two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE) and immunodetection using an antibody raised against the plant YCF48 (18Meurer J. Plücken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In WT, PSII proteins are found in monomeric (RCC(1)) and dimeric (RCC(2)) core complexes (Fig. 1). Small amounts of the PSII proteins, D2 and D1, also accumulate in two smaller PSII complexes: a core subcomplex lacking CP43 (termed RC47) and a RC-like assembly complex (RCa) lacking both CP47 and CP43 (15Dobáková M. Tichý M. Komenda J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Ch. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). YCF48 could not be detected in RCC(1) and RCC(2) and was found to be mainly present in the low-molecular weight region, probably in an unassembled state. A second minor cross-reaction was, however, detected in the region of the RCa complex, suggesting that YCF48 might be a component of this complex (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis we screened for the presence of YCF48 in the PSII assembly intermediates that accumulate in a strain lacking CP47 (psbB–), which is only able to assemble PSII up to the stage of PSII RC-like complexes. Three different RC-like complexes with different electrophoretic mobilities, termed RC*, RCa, and RCb, have been identified in membranes of psbB– using BN/PAGE (Fig. 2, see also Ref. 15Dobáková M. Tichý M. Komenda J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Their precise subunit composition is unclear but each contains D2, either D1 or its processing intermediate iD1, both subunits of cytochrome b559 and PsbI, and each lacks both CP43 and CP47. In freshly prepared membranes of psbB–, the YCF48 protein was detected in the most abundant complexes, RC* and RCa (Fig. 2). The remaining complex, RCb, was present in too low amounts for reliable detection of YCF48 (see also Ref. 15Dobáková M. Tichý M. Komenda J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but after subjecting thylakoids to multiple freeze/thaw cycles, its content markedly increased. Subsequent immunoblotting failed to detect YCF48 in RCb. Thus, we conclude that RC* and RCa differ from RCb by the presence of YCF48 and that RC* most probably contains one or more, as yet unknown, protein components. The data also indicated that RCb was probably generated from RC* and RCa by loss of additional factors including YCF48. The psbEFLJ deletion mutant, designated psbEFLJ–, is unable to synthesize cytochrome b559 and as a consequence is unable to accumulate the D2 protein (17Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Ch. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This strain contains no PSII RC complexes and, in agreement with the conclusions above, only unassembled YCF48 could be detected in the psbEFLJ– strain (Fig. 2C). Absence of YCF48 Inhibits Formation and Accumulation of Cyanobacterial PSII RC Assembly Complexes—To test the physiological role of YCF48 in Synechocystis 6803, we constructed an insertion mutant (designated ycf48–) in which the slr2034 gene was interrupted by a chloramphenicol-resistance cassette. Unlike the previously constructed inactivation mutant of Synechococcus PCC 7002 (20Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the Synechocystis insertion mutant exhibited a significantly slower rate of autotrophic growth than WT under the growth conditions used (Table 1). The yellow-green color of the culture suggested the enhanced accumulation of carotenoids in the mutant. This was supported by an increased absorbance at 440–500 nm in whole cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These whole cell spectra also revealed a lower cellular content of chlorophyll in the mutant (lower absorbance at 680 nm) (supplemental Fig. S1). Measurement of the chlorophyll-normalized light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution in the presence of an artificial electron acceptor, the fluorescence parameter, FV/Fo, which is a measure of the quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, and PSII thermoluminescence (Table 1) showed a 30 to 50% decrease in the levels of functional PSII in the mutant. A reduction in the levels of PSII was supported by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE of mutant thylakoids, which showed only about 50–70% the levels of RCC(1) and RCC(2) found in WT (Fig. 3, stain). Nevertheless, the PSII complexes found in the ycf48– mutant displayed very similar kinetics of electron transfer to the WT. Chlorophyll flash fluorescence measurements revealed that electron transfer on the acceptor side of PSII was similar in ycf48– and WT as was the rate of charge recombination (supplemental Fig. S2). These data therefore provide strong evidence against the possibility that ycf48– accumulates a significant level of defective PSII centers with partial oxygen-evolving activity. Besides being functionally equivalent to the PSII complexes in WT, the relative amounts of the different types of PSII complex were also similar in ycf48–. In both strains, 80–90% of the D1 subunit was found in the dimeric and monomeric core complexes, RCC(2) and RCC(1), as assessed by the intensity of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands, with the remaining 10 to 20% in the RC47 complex (Fig. 3).TABLE 1Characteristics of WT and ycf48– grown under autotrophic conditionsDoubling timeaMeasured in microtitration plates at an irradiance of 25 μmol photons m-2 s-1; average of 20 measurements ± S.D.Oxygen evolutionbLight-saturated rate of oxygen evolution measured in the absence of artificial electron acceptors; average of 3 measurements ± S.D.PSII activity (Hill reaction)cLight-saturated rate of oxygen evolution measured in the presence of 1 mm p-benzoquinone and 5 mm potassium ferricyanide; average of 10 measurements ± S.D.Fv/FodValues obtained by PAM modulated fluorimeter in the presence of 10-5 m DCMU; average of 3 measurements ± S.D.TL bandeValues were obtained by integrating the area below the thermoluminescence glow curve (B band) measured in the range from 3 to 70 °C with the cells containing 6 μg of Chl; average of 3 measurements ± S.D.hμmol O2 mg Chl-1 h-1μmol O2 mg Chl-1 h-1relative areaWT8.7 ± 0.1202 ± 12690 ± 1220.75 ± 0.0232 ± 8100%100%100%100%ycf48-16.4 ± 0.4180 ± 12450 ± 1170.53 ± 0.0318 ± 289%65%71%56%a Measured in microtitration plates at an irradiance of 25 μmol photons m-2 s-1; average of 20 measurements ± S.D.b Light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution measured in the absence of artificial ele"
https://openalex.org/W2022728700,"A fundamental question about the neural correlates of attention concerns the earliest sensory processing stage that it can affect. We addressed this issue by recording magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals while subjects performed detection tasks, which required employment of spatial or nonspatial attention, in auditory or visual modality. Using distributed source analysis of MEG signals, we found that, contrary to previous studies that used equivalent current dipole (ECD) analysis, spatial attention enhanced the initial feedforward response in the primary visual cortex (V1) at 55-90 ms. We also found attentional modulation of the putative primary auditory cortex (A1) activity at 30-50 ms. Furthermore, we reproduced our findings using ECD modeling guided by the results of distributed source analysis and suggest a reason why earlier studies using ECD analysis failed to identify the modulation of earliest V1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072204920,"Both cerebellum and neocortex receive input from the somatosensory system. Interaction between these regions has been proposed to underpin the correct selection and execution of motor commands, but it is not clear how such interactions occur. In neocortex, inputs give rise to population rhythms, providing a spatiotemporal coding strategy for inputs and consequent outputs. Here, we show that similar patterns of rhythm generation occur in cerebellum during nicotinic receptor subtype activation. Both gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) and very fast oscillations (VFOs, 80-160 Hz) were generated by intrinsic cerebellar cortical circuitry in the absence of functional glutamatergic connections. As in neocortex, gamma rhythms were dependent on GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition, whereas VFOs required only nonsynaptically connected intercellular networks. The ability of cerebellar cortex to generate population rhythms within the same frequency bands as neocortex suggests that they act as a common spatiotemporal code within which corticocerebellar dialog may occur."
https://openalex.org/W2104352868,"The “endowment effect” refers to the tendency to place greater value on items that one owns—an anomaly that violates the reference-independence assumption of rational choice theories. We investigated neural antecedents of the endowment effect in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During scanning, 24 subjects considered six products paired with 18 different prices under buying, choosing, or selling conditions. Subjects showed greater nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation for preferred products across buy and sell conditions combined, but greater mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activation in response to low prices when buying versus selling. During selling, right insular activation for preferred products predicted individual differences in susceptibility to the endowment effect. These findings are consistent with a reference-dependent account in which ownership increases value by enhancing the salience of the possible loss of preferred products."

The PDZ domains of Par-3 have also been implicated as potential phosphoinositide signaling integrators, since its second PDZ domain binds to phosphoinositides, and the third PDZ interacts with phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN. However, the molecular basis of Par-3/PTEN interaction is still poorly understood. Additionally, it is not known whether the regulatory function of PTEN in cell polarity is specifically mediated by its interaction with Par-3. The structures of Par-3 PDZ3 in both its free and PTEN tail peptide-bound forms determined in this work reveal that Par-3 PDZ3 binds to PTEN with two discrete binding sites: a canonical PDZ-ligand interaction site and a distal, opposite charge-charge interaction site. This distinct target recognition mechanism confers the interaction specificity of the Par-3·PTEN complex. We show that the Par-3 PDZ3-PTEN binding is required for the enrichment of PTEN at the junctional membranes of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.

Par-3 contains an N-terminal domain followed by three PDZ domains and an extended C terminus. In addition to binding directly to both Par-6 and aPKC, the N-terminal domain of Par-3 can self-oligomerize, thereby promoting the formation of large assemblies of the Par-3·Par-6·aPKC macromolecular complexes (18Joberty G.

Thus, Par-3 is viewed as the central organizer of the Par-3·Par-6·aPKC assembly. Among the three PDZ domains of Par-3, the first PDZ domain was reported to bind to a number of membrane proteins, such as the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (22Chan J.R. Jolicoeur C. Yamauchi J. Elliott J. Fawcett J.P. Ng B.K. Cayouette M. Science. 2006; 314: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the junctional adhesion molecule (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T.

Unexpectedly, the second PDZ domain of Par-3 was shown to bind directly to phosphoinositide lipid-containing membranes with high affinity, and this PDZ-lipid membrane interaction is critical for the function of Par-3 in the polarization of MDCK cells (25Wu H.

An intriguing and potentially important finding was that the third PDZ domain of Par-3 can directly interact with the C terminus of PTEN, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-specific phosphatase (25Wu H.

Feng W. Chen J. Chan L.N. Huang S. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 886-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, this bold speculation needs support from further experimental data. A key line of experimental data that could support the proposed model would be to elucidate the mechanism of the Par-3·PTEN complex formation and to demonstrate that the portion of PTEN localized at junctional membranes by Par-3 PDZ3 binding is specifically required for cell polarity. Here, we have determined the solution structure of Par-3 PDZ3 alone and in complex with the PTEN C-terminal tail peptide by NMR spectroscopy. We discovered that the interaction between Par-3 PDZ3 and the PTEN tail peptide is distinct from all known canonical PDZ-target complexes. We further showed that the junctional membrane localization of PTEN depends on this specific Par-3 PDZ3-PTEN tail peptide interaction. Finally, our data demonstrate that Par-3 PDZ3-mediated PTEN localization to the membrane junctions is essential for the polarization of MDCK cells. Protein Purification and Antibodies—The coding sequence for Par-3 PDZ3 (residues 579-704) was PCR-amplified from the full-length rat Par-3 (ASIP) and cloned into a modified pET32a vector.

Cell. 2007; 28: 886-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All point mutants of Par-3 and PTEN were prepared using the PCR-based method. Par-3 PDZ3-PTEN peptide fusion protein contained a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) between the C terminus of PDZ3 and the PTEN peptide (DEDQSHQITKV). Proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells at either 37 or 16 °C. The His6-tagged PDZ proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Uniformly isotope-labeled PDZ3 samples were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 minimal medium using 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source or 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. For in vitro GST pull-down-based assays, GST-PDZ3, GST-PTEN peptide, and their respective mutants were individually cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector. The fusion proteins were purified by Glutathione-Sepharose-4B affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Myc9E10 monoclonal antibody was purchased from DSHB, anti-GFP antibody was from Invitrogen, and anti-PTEN polyclonal antibody and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were from Cell Signaling. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR samples were concentrated to ∼0.1 mm (for titration experiments) or ∼1 mm (for structural determinations) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on Varian Inova 500 or 750 MHz spectrometers, each equipped with a z-axis shielded triple resonance probehead. Sequential backbone and nonaromatic, nonexchangeable side chain resonance assignments of Par-3 PDZ3 alone and in complex with the PTEN peptide were achieved by standard heteronuclear correlation experiments, including HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY, using 15N/13C-labeled samples, and confirmed by a three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY experiment using 15N-labeled samples (32Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 33Kay L.E. Gardner K.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Except for the residues in the tag region, 100% backbone sequential resonance assignments were completed, and more than 98% nonaromatic side chain resonance assignments were obtained. The side chains of aromatics were further assigned by 1H two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments using unlabeled samples in D2O (34Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Approximate interproton distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional 1H NOESY, three-dimensional 15N-seperated NOESY, and three-dimensional 13C-seperated NOESY spectra. NOE restraints were grouped into three distance ranges: 1.8-2.7 Å (1.8-2.9 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), 1.8-3.3 Å (1.8-3.5 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), and 1.8-5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. Hydrogen bonding restraints were generated from the standard secondary structure of the protein based on the NOE patterns and backbone secondary chemical shifts. Backbone dihedral angle restraints (φ and ψ angles) were derived from the secondary structure of the protein and backbone chemical shift analysis program TALOS (35Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated using the program CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). In Vitro Pull-down Assay—Aliquots of 50 μl of GST or GST-tagged proteins from 1 mg/ml stock solutions were first loaded to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry beads in an assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 4 °C. The GST fusion protein-loaded beads were washed twice with the assay buffer and then mixed with potential binding partners (purified recombinant proteins or HEK293T cell lysates overexpressed with GFP-tagged target proteins), and the mixtures were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times each with 500 μl of the assay buffer. The proteins captured by the affinity beads were eluted by boiling, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and detected either by Coomassie Blue staining or by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. In the pull-down assays, HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged proteins were lysed using radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fluorescence Polarization Assay—Fluorescence polarization assays were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-55 fluorimeter equipped with an automated polarizer at 20 °C. The PTEN synthetic peptide was labeled with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) at its N terminus. Fluorescence titration was performed by adding increasing amounts of Par-3 PDZ3 or its mutants to a constant amount of the fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-PTEN peptide (∼1 μm) in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained by fitting the titration curves with the classical one-site binding model using the software GraphPad. In this assay, ΔmP = mP - mP0, where mP is the measured polarization value of each titration point, and mP0 is the polarization value of the free peptide. RNA Interference and PTEN Knockdown—The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to knock down canine PTEN were designed using Dharmacon's online siDesign Center and inserted into pSUPER vector. Annealed double strand oligonucleotides were inserted into the BglII and HindIII cloning sites of the pSUPER vector. The two pairs of canine PTEN shRNA were designed as follows: sense primer for pSPTEN1, 5′-gatccccCAGATAATGACAAGGAATATTCAAGAGATATTCCTTGTCATTATCTGtttttggaaa-3′; antisense primer for pSPTEN1, 5′-agcttttccaaaaaCAGATAATGACAAGGAATATCTCTTGAATATTCCTTGTCATTATCTGggg-3′; sense primer for pSPTEN2, 5′-gatccccAGTAAGGACCAGAGACAAATTCAAGAGATTTGTCTCTTGGTCCTTACTtttttggaaa-3′; pSPTEN2 antisense primer, 5′-agcttttccaaaaaAGTAAGGACCAGAGACAAATCTCTTGAATTTGTCTCTTGGTCCTTACTggg-3′. Italic type indicates the 9-bp hairpin loop, and letters in lowercase represent the sequence designed for creating BglII and HindIII restriction digestion sites. Par-3-specific shRNA was designed as previously reported (25Wu H. Feng W. Chen J. Chan L.N. Huang S. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 886-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Chen X. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The empty pSUPER vector was used as a control for the PTEN knockdown. The following primary antibodies were used in the Western blot to assay the knockdown efficiency of PTEN: anti-PTEN polyclonal antibody (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), anti-occludin polyclonal antibody (1:1000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (DSHB). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratories) or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used at a concentration of 1:10000. Cellular Localization and Stable Cell Line—The wild type Par-3 was cloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector, and the wild type PTEN was cloned into the pCMV-Myc vector. MDCK II cells were transiently co-transfected with 0.5 μg each of PTEN and Par-3 plasmids/well using the Lipofectamine™ PLUS kit (Invitrogen) and cultured for 48 h before fixation. HEK293T cells or MDCK II cells were cultured at 37 °C in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-PLCδ PH were generated by selecting transfected cells with 500 μg/ml G418 as selection marker, and positive clones were maintained in normal cultural medium containing 250 μg/ml G418. Calcium Switch Assay—Calcium switch experiments were performed as described previously (25Wu H. Feng W. Chen J. Chan L.N. Huang S. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 886-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, pSPTEN1 was delivered using nucleotransfection kit (Amaxa) into cultured MDCK II cells with or without stably expressing GFP-PLCδ PH, along with the wild type PTEN or its mutants. After electroporation, ∼7.5 × 105 MDCK II cells were seeded in a 24-well tissue culture plate with minimal essential medium containing 1.8 mm calcium (high calcium medium). After ∼40 h of incubation, a confluent monolayer of MDCK cells was formed. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% calf serum, which was dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl overnight (low calcium medium). After a 16-h incubation in low calcium medium, cells were switched back to HCM for the indicated time durations. To detect ZO-1, cells were washed then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were blocked with 10% normal donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated with anti-ZO-1 primary antibody and Red X-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit; Jackson Laboratory). The images were acquired and analyzed using a Nikon TE2000E inverted fluorescent microscope. Images were taken using a monochrome camera detection system, and composite pseudocolors are used in the merged figures for comparison. Overall Structure of Par-3 PDZ3—As the first step in elucidating the molecular basis of the Par-3/PTEN interaction, we determined the solution structure of the ligand-free form of Par-3 PDZ3 using NMR spectroscopy. Except for a few residues in the two termini, the overall structure of Par-3 PDZ3 is well defined (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Par-3 PDZ3 adopts the canonical PDZ domain fold composed of six β-strands and two α-helices, of which the six β-strands form a partially open barrel with each of the open ends capped with an α-helix (Fig. 1B). Uniquely, the αB helix of Par-3 PDZ3 is one turn longer than the corresponding helix in the canonical PDZ domains (Fig. 1B). Parallel to the elongation of the αB helix, both βB and βC of Par-3 PDZ3 are longer than the corresponding β-strands in most PDZ domains. Therefore, the peptide ligand-binding channel of Par-3 PDZ3 is significantly elongated (Fig. 1B). Additionally, both the βA/βB-loop and the βB/βC-loop of the ligand-free Par-3 PDZ3 are well structured (Fig. 1A), indicating that the ligand binding groove of the domain is preformed and relatively rigid. Analysis of the molecular surface property of Par-3 PDZ3 revealed that the domain contains a prominent positively charged surface formed by four conserved residues (Lys606, Arg609, Lys611, and Lys622) at the distal end (with respect to the characteristic carboxyl-binding GLGF motif) of the peptide ligand-binding channel (supplemental Fig. 1). These distinct structural features of Par-3 PDZ3 are important for its target recognition specificity (see below for details).TABLE 1Structural statistics for the family of 20 structures of PDZ3 and PDZ-3 in complex with the PTEN peptideParametersValuesPDZ3PDZ3-PTEN peptideDistance restraintsIntraresidue (i - j = 0)831888Sequential (|i - j| = 1)562578Medium range (2 < |i - j| < 4)368366Long range (|i - j| > 5)771877Hydrogen bonds7894Total2,6102,803Dihedral angle restraintsΦ5055Ψ5155Total101110Mean root mean square deviations from the experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.014 ± 0.0010.013 ± 0.000Dihedral angle (degrees)0.197 ± 0.0360.324 ± 0.034Mean root mean square deviations from idealized covalent geometryBond (Å)0.002 ± 0.0000.002 ± 0.000Angle (degrees)0.336 ± 0.0070.370 ± 0.004Improper (degrees)0.227 ± 0.0110.249 ± 0.010Mean energies (kcal mol−1)aThe final values of the square well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1 Å−1 and 200 kcal mol−1 rad−1.ENOE25.13 ± 2.5024.83 ± 1.49Ecdih0.25 ± 0.090.71 ± 0.15EL-J−202.74 ± 7.81−284.19 ± 10.75Ramachandran plotbThe program PROCHECK (48) was used to assess the overall quality of the structures.

Open table in a new tab Structure of Par-3 PDZ3 in Complex with the PTEN C-terminal Tail Peptide—Our earlier biochemical studies demonstrated that the carboxyl tail of PTEN is directly involved in binding to Par-3 PDZ3 (25Wu H. Feng W. Chen J. Chan L.N. Huang S. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 886-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To characterize the interaction between Par-3 PDZ3 and PTEN C-terminal tail in further detail, we titrated the 15N-labeled Par-3 PDZ3 with a synthetic peptide composed of the last 10 amino acids of PTEN (referred to hereafter as the PTEN peptide). The addition of the PTEN peptide induced large chemical shift changes to a subset of peaks of PDZ3, indicating that the PTEN peptide binds specifically to the PDZ domain. We then mapped the PTEN peptide binding-induced chemical shift changes of the Par-3 PDZ domain onto its three-dimensional structure (supplemental Fig. 2). As expected, residues in the predicted peptide ligand binding αB/βB-groove underwent prominent PTEN peptide binding-induced chemical shift changes, indicating that the PDZ domain binding motif at the extreme carboxyl end of the PTEN peptide (i.e. TKV) is directly involved in binding to the PDZ domain via the classical PDZ-peptide interaction mode (38Zhang M. Wang W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PTEN peptide binding-induced chemical shift changes of Par-3 PDZ3 extend beyond the residues in the αB/βB-groove. Specifically, Lys606, Arg609, Lys611, and Lys622, which form the positively charged surface cluster, also showed significant chemical shift changes (supplemental Fig. 2). Amino acid sequence alignment analysis of PTEN from various species revealed that the three residues preceding the extreme carboxyl terminus are highly conserved acidic amino acids (see Fig. 3A), suggesting that these negatively charged residues might be interacting with the residues in the positively charged surface cluster of Par-3 PDZ3. To elucidate the detailed interaction mechanism between Par-3 PDZ3 and PTEN, we decided to determine the structure of Par-3 PDZ3 in complex with the PTEN peptide. First, we validated that the last 10 residues of PTEN are sufficient for binding to Par-3 PDZ3, since further extension of the peptide toward the N terminus did not enhance the binding affinity between Par-3 PDZ3 and PTEN (data not shown). To facilitate the NMR-based structural determination of the Par-3 PDZ3-PTEN peptide complex, we fused the PTEN peptide to the C terminus of Par-3 PDZ3 to generate a single chain fusion protein. This strategy greatly simplified the complex structure determination. The same strategy has been successfully used in determining the structures of a number of other PDZ domains in complex with their respective target peptides (39Elkins J.M. Papagrigoriou E. Berridge G. Yang X. Phillips C. Gileadi C. Savitsky P. Doyle D.A. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Pan L. Wu H. Shen C. Shi Y. Jin W. Xia J. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4576-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Additionally, the NMR spectrum of Par-3 PDZ3 in complex with the synthetic PTEN peptide and that of the PDZ3-PTEN peptide fusion protein are essentially identical, indicating that the covalent linking of the PTEN peptide to the PDZ domain has minimal perturbation to the structure of the Par-3 PDZ3-PTEN peptide complex (supplemental Fig. 3). The structure of the Par-3 PDZ3-PTEN peptide complex was determined to a high resolution (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The structure of PDZ3 in the complex is highly similar to the structure of the ligand free Par-3 PDZ3 (root mean square deviation of 0.9 comparing the backbones of the two structures). The only notable peptide binding-induced conformational change of Par-3 PDZ3 is the rotation of αB, since this rotation is necessary to widen the αB/βB-groove in order to accommodate the PTEN peptide (supplemental Fig. 4). Consistent with our earlier prediction, the three residues at the extreme C terminus of the PTEN peptide form a β-strand that pairs in an antiparallel manner with the βB of PDZ3. The side chain of the residue at the 0-position of the PTEN peptide (Val403) packs tightly into the pocket formed by Leu601, Val603, Leu662, and Met666. Due to the elongated αB-helix of Par-3 PDZ3, the residue at the -2-position (Thr401) of the PTEN peptide interacts, albeit weakly, with the side chain of Met659 (the fifth residue in the αB) instead of Asn655 at the αB1 position of Par-3 PDZ3 (Fig. 3B) (38Zhang M. Wang W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). No specific hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Thr403 from the PTEN peptide and the residues from the αB-helix of Par-3 PDZ3 could be observed. The side chain of Lys402 (the so-called -1 residue) from the PTEN peptide also lacks direct contact with Par-3 PDZ3. As"

They play a critical role in the disease, tethering infected cells away from destruction by the spleen and causing many severe symptoms. A molecular understanding of how these domains maintain their binding properties while evading immune detection will be important in developing therapeutics. In malaria of pregnancy, domains from the var2csa-encoded PfEMP1 protein interact with chondroitin sulfate on the placenta surface. This causes accumulation of infected red blood cells, leading to placental inflammation and block of blood flow to the developing fetus. This is associated with maternal anemia, low birth weight, and premature delivery and can lead to the death of mother and child. Here I present the structure of the chondroitin sulfate-binding DBL3X domain from a var2csa-encoded PfEMP1 protein. The domain adopts a fold similar to malarial invasion proteins, with extensive loop insertions. One loop is flexible in the unliganded structure but observed in the presence of sulfate or disaccharide, where it completes a sulfate-binding site. This loop, and others surrounding this putative carbohydrate-binding site, are flexible and polymorphic, perhaps protecting the binding site from immune detection. This suggests a model for how the domain maintains ligand binding while evading the immune response and will guide future drug and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1964279507,"To better understand the structural and functional roles of tryptophan at the membrane/water interface in membrane proteins, we examined the structural and functional consequences of Trp → 1-methyl-tryptophan substitutions in membrane-spanning gramicidin A channels. Gramicidin A channels are miniproteins that are anchored to the interface by four Trps near the C terminus of each subunit in a membrane-spanning dimer. We masked the hydrogen bonding ability of individual or multiple Trps by 1-methylation of the indole ring and examined the structural and functional changes using circular dichroism spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, solid state 2H NMR spectroscopy, and single channel analysis. N-Methylation causes distinct changes in the subunit conformational preference, channel-forming propensity, single channel conductance and lifetime, and average indole ring orientations within the membrane-spanning channels. The extent of the local ring dynamic wobble does not increase, and may decrease slightly, when the indole NH is replaced by the non-hydrogen-bonding and more bulky and hydrophobic N-CH3 group. The changes in conformational preference, which are associated with a shift in the distribution of the aromatic residues across the bilayer, are similar to those observed previously with Trp → Phe substitutions. We conclude that indole N-H hydrogen bonding is of major importance for the folding of gramicidin channels. The changes in ion permeability, however, are quite different for Trp → Phe and Trp → 1-methyl-tryptophan substitutions, indicating that the indole dipole moment and perhaps also ring size and are important for ion permeation through these channels.

Tryptophan is unusually abundant in membrane proteins, including ion channels (1Wallace B.A. Janes R.W. Adv. Exp. Med.

In addition to its hydrogen bonding ability, the Trp indole ring has a permanent dipole moment pointing from N1 in the five-membered ring to C5 in the six-membered ring (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the larger aromatic ring of Trp, as compared with Phe or Tyr, is more accessible for π-π and/or cation-π interactions (7Burley S. Petsko G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 125-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 8Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). Although these characteristics of the indole side chain make Trp an important component of membrane proteins (2Schiffer M. Chang C.H. Stevens F.J.

Some insights have been gained by examining free indole analogues in lipid bilayer environments, where NMR investigations led to the suggestion that aromaticity and ring shape are significant factors for the preference of Trp for the polar/nonpolar interface (10Yau W.-M.

In this study, we make further use of the gA channel framework to position the indole side chain in the bilayer and minimize confounding effects from other (unknown) contributions. gA is a 15-residue peptide with an alternating l- and d-amino acid sequence: formyl-VGALAVVVWLWLWLW-ethanolamide (the d-amino acids are underlined), which forms monovalent cation-permeable transmembrane channels when two 15-residue subunits join from opposite sides of the membrane (5O'Connell A.M.

Biological Membrane Ion Channels. Springer, New York2007: 33-80Crossref Google Scholar). Each gA subunit has four Trps, which in the single-stranded (SS) β-helical channel structure are localized near the membrane/water interface (Fig. 1C) (22Ketchem R.R. Hu W. Cross T.A.

The ability to investigate both the conformational equilibrium and ion permeation places gA channels in a class by themselves as a foundation for evaluating the physico-chemical properties and functional importance of Trp residues. Early studies showed that substitution of any one of the four Trps by Phe decreases the gA single channel conductance (27Becker M.D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Andersen O.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8830-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), with the conductance decrease being more pronounced for the “inner” substitutions, at position 9 or 11 (27Becker M.D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Andersen O.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8830-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When all four Trps are replaced by Phe, the resulting analogue, designated “gramicidin M,” forms channels with a conductance that is 6-fold less than that of the native gA channels (26Fonseca V. Daumas P. Ranjalahy Rasoloarijao L. Heitz F. Lazaro R. Trudelle Y. Andersen O.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5340-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Heitz F. Gavach C. Spach G. Trudelle Y. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 24: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, the preferred fold of gramicidin M in a lipid environment is one or more DS structures (19Salom D. Pérez-Payá E. Pascal J. Abad C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14279-14291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Cotten M. Xu F. Cross T.A. Biophys.

J. 1992; 62: 145-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results suggest that all four Trps are important for gA structure and function, although the contribution of each Trp may differ. Nevertheless, neither the studies with small indole analogues nor the studies with Trp → Phe substitutions in gA channels could indicate clearly whether the structural and functional changes are due to the loss of the dipole moment, the loss of hydrogen bonding ability, the change in hydrophobicity, or a combination of these or other contributions. Previously, the importance of the indole ring dipole moment has been studied using Trp → 5-F-Trp substitutions, which enhance the magnitude of the dipole moment yet leave other Trp side-chain properties unchanged (13Andersen O.S.

In the present study, to focus on the contribution of indole hydrogen bonding, we introduce a methyl group to replace the hydrogen attached to the indole nitrogen (N-H → N-CH3). The resulting 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-Me-Trp) indole ring (Fig. 1B) retains the aromaticity and rigid ring shape, but its ability to be a hydrogen bond donor is blocked by the methyl group. Importantly, the magnitude (2.1 ± 0.1 Debye) and direction of the dipole moments of indole and 1-Me-indole are closely similar (30McClellan A.L. Tables of Experimental Dipole Moments. W.H. Freeman, San Francisco1963: 280-325Google Scholar, 31Abribat G. Viallet P. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1970; 271: 1029-1032Google Scholar) to Trp. Using 1-Me-Trp, we synthesized singly substituted gA analogues in which Trp at either position 9, 11, 13 or 15 was replaced. To study the accumulation of effects that may accompany the loss of hydrogen bonding ability, we also made two double substitutions (“inner” pair, 1-Me-Trp9,11; “outer” pair, 1-Me-Trp13,15). In the SS β-helical channel structure, all four Trps are situated close to the bilayer/solution interface (Fig. 1C); in the (misfolded) DS structures (Fig. 1D), the outer Trp13 and Trp15 (colored magenta in Fig. 1) retain positions close to the bilayer/solution interface, whereas the inner Trp9 and Trp11 (colored maroon in Fig. 1) are buried deeper toward the bilayer center than in the SS ion-conducting channels. The properties of the pairwise methylated gA analogues could therefore become very sensitive to the “masking” of the indole-NH hydrogen bond. For completeness, we also prepared the quadruply substituted gA analogue with 1-Me-Trp9,11,13,15. We examined the 1-Me-Trp gA analogues in lipid environments: structurally by CD spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and solid state 2H NMR spectroscopy and functionally by single channel experiments, which reveal aspects of both structure and function. Our results indicate that indole hydrogen bonding dominates in determining the conformational preference of the gA channel, whereas the Trp indole ring dipole moment (and bulk) dominate in determining the ion permeability of the channels. In contrast to earlier findings with small indole analogues (10Yau W.-M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), it is striking how both the ring dipole moment and hydrogen bonding ability assume primary importance when the indole rings are peptide-attached, yet manifest their influence in different ways. Fmoc-1-Me-l-Trp was prepared (32Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Providence L.L. Shobana S. Andersen O.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 525-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by reacting N-(9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyloxy)succinimide and 1-Me-l-Trp (Sigma) and was separated by filtration and extraction from ethyl acetate/aqueous HCl (0.1 m) solution. The raw product was further purified by recrystallization from ethyl acetate twice. The final yield was about 50%, and the purity of Fmoc-1-Me-l-Trp was confirmed to be >95% by 1H NMR. The 1-Me-Trp gramicidin analogues were synthesized on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems 433A synthesizer (32Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Providence L.L. Shobana S. Andersen O.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 525-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using standard Fmoc chemistry and Trp Wang resin (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY) except for three analogues: 1-Me-Trp15, 1-Me-Trp13,15, and 1-Me-Trp9,11,13,15. For these analogues, Fmoc-1-Me-l-Trp was preloaded to HMP resin (Applied Biosystems division of PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to peptide synthesis using a method adapted from Ref. 33Sieber P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 6147-6150Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar. The analogues were finished by formylation using p-nitrophenyl formate and cleaved from the resin using 20% ethanolamine in DMF (34Greathouse D.V. Goforth R.L. Crawford T. van der Wel P.C.A. Killian J.A. J. Peptide Res. 2001; 57: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They were purified by Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Biosciences) gel permeation chromatography (solvent: MeOH), and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Zorbax SB80; 4.6 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm; MacMod Analytical, Chadds Ford, PA). The molecular mass of each analogue was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (Mass Consortium, San Diego, CA). Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). gA/lipid dispersions (1:30) for CD spectroscopy and SEC were prepared as described in Ref. 35Greathouse D.V. Hinton J.F. Kim K.S. Koeppe II, R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4291-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. The final gA concentration in each sample was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using ϵ = 20,840 m-1 cm-1 (36Turner G.L. Hinton J.F. Koeppe II, R.E. Parli J.A. Millett F.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 756: 133-137Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). (The values of ϵ and λmax are very similar for Trp and 1-Me-Trp.) CD spectra were recorded at 22-24 °C using a Jasco J710 CD Spectrometer with a 1-mm path length cell, 1.0-nm bandwidth, 0.2-nm step resolution, and 50-nm/min scan speed. Each spectrum is an average of 12 scans. SEC was used to estimate the fractions of DS and SS conformers of each gA analogue in lipid suspensions. When gA (analogue)/lipid dispersions are injected into an Ultrastyrogel 1000-Å column (7 μm, 7.8 × 300 mm, mobile phase: 100% tetrohydrofuran at 1.0 ml/min; Waters, Inc., Milford, MA), the head-to-head β6.3 SS conformers are dissociated by the solvent and therefore elute as monomers, along with unfolded or unstructured conformations. In contrast, double-stranded conformers, which are stabilized by greater numbers of hydrogen bonds, do not dissociate and therefore elute as dimers (37Bañó M.C. Braco L. Abad C. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 458: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Selective 2H Labeling—A selective 2H labeling procedure at low temperature was adapted from original methods of Bak (38Bak B. Dambmann C. Nicolaisen F. Acta Chem. Scand. 1967; 21: 1674-1675Crossref Google Scholar, 39Bak B. Led J.J. Pedersen E.J. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 3051-3054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trifluoroacetic acid-D (CF3COOD) and D2O were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Fmoc-1-Me-Trp (1 mmol) was dissolved in 4 ml of CF3COOD and incubated for 3 h at 4°C in darkness, after which the reaction was quenched by adding 12 ml of cold D2O. Fmoc-1-Me-Trp was isolated by centrifugation (13,000 rpm at 4 °C). The amino acid was washed once with D2O and twice with H2Oat 22 °C and dried under vacuum (10-3 mm Hg). The extent of deuterium exchange at each position on the indole ring was estimated from the loss of signal intensity for each individual aromatic hydrogen in the 1H NMR spectrum. When samples were incubated in total darkness, no damage to Fmoc-1-Me-Trp was observed from the 1H NMR spectra. A chirobiotic-T HPLC column (Advanced Separation Technologies Inc., Whippany, NJ) was used to confirm that no racemization had occurred during the exchange reaction. The partially 2H-labeled Fmoc-1-Me-Trp was then used for synthesis of singly substituted analogues. Preparation of Oriented Samples—Samples for solid state NMR were prepared as described by Van der Wel (40Van der Wel P.C.A. Strandberg E. Killian J.A. Koeppe II, R.E. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1479-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For each sample, 4 μmol of gA analogue and 80 μmol of DMPC (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Alabaster, AL) were used to maintain a 1:20 gA analogue/lipid molar ratio. The samples were incubated at 40 °C for several days to ensure optimal alignment before measuring. All NMR measurements were done on a Bruker AMX2 300 spectrometer, modified with a high power amplifier to achieve the large spectral width required for solid state deuterium NMR. The proper alignment of the lipid bilayers in each glass plate sample was confirmed by 31P NMR measurements as described in Ref. 40Van der Wel P.C.A. Strandberg E. Killian J.A. Koeppe II, R.E. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1479-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar. The 2H experiments were done using a quadrupolar echo pulse sequence (41Davis J.H. Jeffrey K.R. Valic M.I. Bloom M. Higgs T.P. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1976; 42: 390-394Crossref Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) with an echo delay of 65 μs, 1.5 million scans, and with 30-ms interpulse time. All measurements were done at 40 °C, when the lipids are in the liquid crystalline phase. Data Analysis—2H NMR spectra have been used to examine the orientations of Trp indole rings in gA channels (16Cotten M. Tian C. Busath D.D. Shirts R.B. Cross T.A.

Quadrupolar splittings were converted to orientation angles for the C-D bonds using the following equation (44Koeppe II, R.E. Sun H. van der Wel P.C.A. Scherer E.M. Pulay P. Greathouse D.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12268-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar),Δvq=32(e2qQh)(12(3cos2θ−1))(12(3cos2β−1))(Eq. 1) where e2qQ/h is the quadrupolar coupling constant, which has a static value of ∼180 kHz for deuterons on aromatic rings (45Gall C.M. DiVerdi J.A. Opella S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 5039-5043Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), θ is the angle between a particular C-D bond and the gA helix axis, and β is the angle between the helix axis and the direction of the magnetic field, either 0 or 90°. For gA channels, the helix axis is aligned with the membrane normal (44Koeppe II, R.E. Sun H. van der Wel P.C.A. Scherer E.M. Pulay P. Greathouse D.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12268-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 46Pulay P. Scherer E.M. van der Wel P.C.A. Koeppe II, R.E. J. Am. Chem.

Assignments of quadrupolar splittings to the C2-D and C5-D bonds for 1-Me-Trps at positions 9 and 11 are based on the corresponding C2 and C5 assignments from partially labeled Trp in gA (44Koeppe II, R.E. Sun H. van der Wel P.C.A. Scherer E.M. Pulay P. Greathouse D.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12268-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Assignments for 1-Me-Trp13 and 1-Me-Trp15 were deduced from spectral assignments of Hu et al. (43Hu W. Lazo N.D. Cross T.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14138-14146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for (unmethylated) Trp13 and Trp15 in gA, using the principle of least change. The minimum θ angle difference between a particular C-D bond in 1-Me-Trp and the corresponding Trp was calculated based on the equation above and the observed change in Δνq. Changes in indole ring orientation and dynamics upon 1-methylation were estimated by calculating the backbone-independent ring orientation angles ρ1 and ρ2 and the “effective” quadrupolar coupling constant, as described previously (44Koeppe II, R.E.

In this method, which does not depend upon knowledge of the local backbone structure, the angle ρ1 represents rotation about an axis normal to the ring plane and the ring bridge, whereas angle ρ2 represents rotation about an axis in the ring plane yet normal to the bridge (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 44Koeppe II, R.E.

Planar bilayers were formed from n-decane solutions (2.5%, w/v) of diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (from Avanti) across a hole (∼1.6-mm diameter) in a Teflon® partition that separates two aqueous solutions of unbuffered (pH ∼ 6) salt solution, 1.0 m CsCl or NaCl, which was prepared fresh each day. Single channel experiments were done at 25 ± 1 °C using the bilayer punch method (47Andersen O.S. Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 119-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), with pipette tip diameter of ∼30 μm and a Dagan 3900 patch clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Unless otherwise stated, the measurements were done at an applied potential of 200 mV. The gA analogues were added from ethanolic stock solutions to the electrolyte solution on both sides of the bilayer to final concentrations of ∼10-11 m. The final ethanol concentration was less than 0.25%, a concentration that has no effect on channel properties. The current signal was filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. Single channel current transitions were detected on-line and analyzed as described previously (48Sawyer D.B. Koeppe II, R.E. Andersen O.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 49Durkin J.T. Koeppe II, R.E. Andersen O.S. J. Mol.

The reported single current transition amplitudes and lifetime distributions are based on at least four independent determinations, two at each polarity. The lifetime histograms were transformed into survivor distributions, and average channel lifetimes (τ) were determined by fitting a single exponential distribution: N(t)/N(0) = exp(-t/τ), where N(t) denotes the number of channels with a lifetime longer than time t to each histogram (49Durkin J.T. Koeppe II, R.E. Andersen O.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy and Size Exclusion Chromatography—When the gA sequence is changed, CD spectra and size exclusion chromatograms allow one to measure the overall secondary structure. Native gA can adopt several different conformations (Fig. 1, C and D), depending on the solvent or lipid environment. In phospholipid vesicles, native gA forms predominantly the head-to-head, right-handed, SS β6.3-helical cation-conducting conformation (Fig. 1C), whose CD spectrum is characterized by positive maxima at ∼218 and ∼235 nm and negative ellipticity below 208 nm (Fig. 2) (35Greathouse D.V. Hinton J.F. Kim K.S. Koeppe II, R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4291-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This spectrum is distinct from the CD spectra of other, nonconducting conformers (24Wallace B.A. Veatch W.R. Blout E.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5754-5760Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 51Veatch W.R. Fossel E.T. Blout E.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The population of gA conformations can also be assayed using SEC. When gA/lipid dispersions are injected into an SEC column, with tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase, the SS channel structure, which is held together by only six intermolecular hydrogen bonds (52Arseniev A.S. Lomize A.L. Barsukov I.L. Bystrov V.F. Biol. Membr. 1986; 3: 1077-1104Google Scholar), is disrupted by the tetrahydrofuran, such that the peptides elute as monomers, not dimers. By contrast, when a DS dimer (Fig. 1D), which is stabilized by 28 hydrogen bonds (53Langs D.A. Science. 1988; 241: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), is injected, it does not dissociate and elutes as a dimer. SEC thus allows one to estimate the ratio of DS dimers to SS channels for a gramicidin analogue in a particular environment. Consistent with the CD spectra, the SEC profiles show that native gA elutes from DMPC or DOP"

LPS is also recognized by immune cells as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and stimulates them to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that, in extreme cases, lead to a harmful host response known as septic shock. Previous studies have revealed that a few isoforms of the AMP temporin, produced within the same frog specimen, can synergize to overcome bacterial resistance imposed by the physical barrier of LPS. Here we found that temporins can synergize in neutralizing the LPS-induced macrophage activation. Furthermore, the synergism between temporins, to overcome the protective function of LPS as well as its endotoxic effect, depends on the length of the polysaccharide chain of LPS. Importantly, mode of action studies, using spectroscopic and thermodynamic methods, have pointed out different mechanisms underlying the synergism of temporins in antimicrobial and anti-endotoxin activities. To the best of our knowledge, such a dual synergism between isoforms of AMPs from the same species has not been observed before, and it might explain the ability of such amphibians to resist a large repertoire of microorganisms.

Despite differences in their size and sequence, they all share a net positive charge at neutral pH, and fold into amphipathic structures, often after contact with membranes (8Hancock R.E. Rozek A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 206: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sitaram N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence that unlike current antibiotics, which interact strongly with specific target molecules such as proteins, many AMPs act by a nonspecific mechanism and kill microbes by disrupting their plasma membrane (3Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar, 10Shai Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 11Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol.

However, before reaching the plasma membrane, they must traverse the cell wall. In Gram-negative bacteria, this cell wall is surrounded by an asymmetric outer membrane (OM) containing primarily the amphiphilic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) in its outer leaflet. The LPS barrier is believed to be stabilized by LPS-associated cations (Mg2+) through salt bridges that neutralize the repulsive forces of adjacent LPS molecules. This leads to the formation of an oriented and tightly cross-linked leaflet that protects bacteria from a variety of host-defense hydrophobic molecules (13Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 14Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including some AMPs (15Rosenfeld Y.

Note that for all enterobacterial and most nonenterobacterial strains, LPS is composed of three parts: (i) a hydrophobic moiety, also referred to as lipid A, consisting of fatty acid chains linked to two phosphorylated glucosamine residues; (ii) an oligosaccharide core, covalently bound to the lipid A via ketodeoxyoctonic acid (KDO); and (iii) a hydrophilic O-antigenic domain, composed of repeating saccharide units, which protrudes into the surrounding medium. The composition and the number of the O-antigen repeat units vary among different bacterial species (18Trent M.S. Stead C.M. Tran A.X. Hankins J.V. J.

The immune system has evolved to recognize LPS as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Upon its recognition, LPS stimulates the innate immune cells, inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6), mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages (20Kubo Y.

Immunology. 2004; 112: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Many clinically used antibiotics cause the release of LPS from the microbial cell wall (23Prins J.M. Kuijper E.J. Mevissen M.L. Speelman P. van Deventer S.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Byl B. Clevenbergh P. Kentos A. Jacobs F. Marchant A. Vincent J.L. Thys J.P. Eur. J.

Dis. 2001; 20: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and, as a consequence, give rise to a prolonged activation of the immune cells, which results in an unbalanced systemic secretion of cytokines. This can rapidly lead to the development of septic shock, which, in extreme cases, may lead to death (25Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar, 26Angus D.C. Wax R.S. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S109-S116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In contrast with these conventional antibiotics, several AMPs possess dual functions: they kill bacteria and neutralize the endotoxic effect of LPS, although the exact mechanism is not yet well understood (27Hancock R.E. Diamond G. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 28Scott M.G. Davidson D.J. Gold M.R. Bowdish D. Hancock R.E. J.

Most living organisms produce a single AMP at the site of infection, but some animal species, particularly those from Amphibia, synthesize and secrete different isoforms of the same AMP. Among such isoforms, temporins represent the largest family, with more than 50 members (31Mangoni M.L. Marcellini H.G. Simmaco M. J. Pept. Sci. 2007; 13: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They are among the smallest amphipathic α-helical AMPs found in nature to date (10–14 amino acids) and contain only a few positively charged amino acids (net charge at a neutral pH ranging from 0 to +3) (32Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 33Mangoni M.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The majority of them act by increasing the permeability of the microbial membrane (34Mangoni M.L. Rinaldi A.C. Di Giulio A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 984-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recently, the physiological significance of the existence of multiple forms of temporins has been addressed and has revealed that temporins A and B strongly synergize in killing Gram-negative bacteria, when each is combined with temporin L (15Rosenfeld Y. Barra D. Simmaco M. Shai Y. Mangoni M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28565-28574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Temporin L has also been studied for its potential to suppress the endotoxic effect of LPS (37Giacometti A. Cirioni O. Ghiselli R. Mocchegiani F. Orlando F. Silvestri C. Bozzi A. Di Giulio A. Luzi C. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Saba V. Scalise G. Rinaldi A.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated: (i) the role of the carbohydrate region of LPS in the mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of temporins against Gram-negative bacteria; and (ii) the potential of temporins to synergize in the detoxification of LPS, and whether the underlying molecular mechanism is similar to that of the synergism against Gram-negative bacteria. Importantly, we found a strong synergism between different isoforms of temporins in the inhibition of TNF-α release from macrophages stimulated with LPS. In addition, our data emphasize a different mode of action for the synergistic effect of these AMPs in antimicrobial and anti-endotoxin activities, which show dependence on the size of the polysaccharide chain of the bacterial LPS. Materials—Rink amide 4-methyl benzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (F-moc)-protected amino acids were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Other reagents used for peptide synthesis included trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), piperidine (Merck), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, Sigma), N-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT, Sigma), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, peptide synthesis grade, Bio-Lab), and dimethylformamide (DMF, peptide synthesis grade, Bio-Lab). Proteinase K and lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (LPS O111:B4) and from E. coli O26:B6 (LPS O26:B6) were purchased from Sigma. All buffers were prepared in double glass-distilled water. Peptide Synthesis, Fluorescent Labeling, and Purification—Peptides were synthesized by an F-moc solid phase method on Rink amide resin, using an ABI 433A automatic peptide synthesizer. Cleavage of the peptides from the MBHA resin resulted in the amidation of the C terminus. To label the peptides, the F-moc protecting group was removed from the N terminus of the resin-bound peptides, by incubation with piperidine for 12 min, whereas all the other reactive amine groups of the attached peptides were kept protected. The resin-bound peptides were washed twice with DMF, and then treated with rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide (2 equiv), in anhydrous DMF containing 2% DIEA, leading to the formation of a resin-bound N-rhodamine peptide. After 24 h, the resin was washed thoroughly with DMF and then with methylene chloride. The three rhodamine-labeled temporins A (rho-temporin A), B (rho-temporin B), and L (rho-temporin L) were then cleaved from the resin. All the peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a C18 reversed-phase Bio-Rad semi-preparative column (250 × 10 mm, 300 Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). The column was eluted with a 40-min linear gradient of 20–60% acetonitrile in water, containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The purified peptides were further subjected to amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry to confirm their composition and molecular weights. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)—LPS from E. coli O111:B4 and E. coli O26:B6 were separated by SDS-PAGE with a gel containing 12% acrylamide and 0.5% SDS (38Peterson A.A. McGroarty E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 738-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of 100 μg of LPS were applied to the gel, and LPS bands visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-LPS core antibodies (mouse IgG, Hycult, Biotechnology, Netherlands). Antibacterial Activity of the Peptides—Susceptibility testing was performed by the microbroth dilution method according to the procedures outlined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (2001) using sterile 96-well plates. Aliquots (50 μl) of bacteria in mid-log phase at a concentration of 2 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml in culture medium (Mueller-Hinton, MH) were added to 50 μl of MH broth containing the peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions in 20% ethanol. Inhibition of growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm with a 450-Bio-Rad Microplate Reader after an incubation of 18–20 h at 30 °C. Antibacterial activities were expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the concentration of peptide at which 100% inhibition of growth was observed after 18–20 h of incubation. The ranges of peptide dilutions used were 0.15–40 μm for temporin L and 0.2–100 μm for temporins A and B. Synergism between temporins was evaluated by the checkerboard titration method, by adding combinations of two temporins, in a serial 2-fold dilution, to wells of a sterile flat-bottomed 96-well plate, each containing 1 × 105 CFU in a final volume of 100 μl. Briefly, wells in the first row were loaded with temporin L at twice the highest final concentration used in the experiment, and 2-fold dilutions were prepared across rows starting from the first one. Therefore, all wells in the same row kept temporin L at a constant concentration, whereas the concentration of temporin A or B varied in a serial 2-fold dilution. Note that the first column and the last row wells were loaded only with the single peptides (temporin L, A, or B, respectively), in a 2-fold dilution. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index for combinations of two peptides was calculated according to Equation 1,Σ(FICA+FICB)/n=Σ(A/MICA+B/MICB)/n(Eq. 1) where A and B are the MICs of drug A and drug B in the combination, MICA and MICB are the MICs of drug A and drug B alone, FICA and FICB are the FICs of drug A and drug B, and n is the number of wells per plate used to calculate the FIC. The FIC indices were interpreted as follows (39Lewis R.E. Diekema D.J. Messer S.A. Pfaller M.A. Klepser M.E. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2002; 49: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar): FIC ≤ 0.5, synergy; 0.5 < FIC <1, additivity; 1 ≤ FIC < 4, indifference; FIC ≥ 4, antagonism. The following Gram-negative bacterial strains were used: E. coli O111:B4, E. coli O26:B6, and the cell wall-defective mutant strains of E. coli D21, i.e. D21 e7, D21 f1, and D21 f2, with shorter LPS carbohydrate chain length (40Boman H.G. Monner D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 455-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Farnaud S. Spiller C. Moriarty L.C. Patel A. Gant V. Odell E.W. Evans R.W. FEMS Microbiol.

The Effect of LPS on the Oligomeric State of the Peptides as Determined by Rhodamine Fluorescence Dequenching Measurements—Rhodamine-labeled peptides (final concentration, 3 μm for temporin A and 1.5 μm for both temporins B and L) were added to 100 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and changes in the intensity of the fluorescence emission were followed upon the addition of different concentrations of LPS O26:B6, using a microplate counter (Wallac 1420 Victor 3™, Perkin Elmer) with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 485 and 590 nm, respectively. Proteinase K (80 μg/ml in PBS) was then added, and the resulting fluorescence was monitored. An increase in fluorescence indicates that the peptide exists as an oligomer (43Papo N. Oren Z. Pag U. Sahl H.G. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33913-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were performed at 30 °C. Evaluation of TNF-α Release from RAW264.7 Macrophages—RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured overnight in 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). The medium was then removed followed by the addition of fresh medium to each well. The cells were stimulated with LPS O111:B4 or LPS O26:B6 (10 ng/ml final concentration), in the presence of 2.5, 5, or 10 μm temporin A, B, or L. In another set of experiments, the effects of all combinations of temporins (A+B, A+L, or B+L, 2.5 μm of each) were tested. Cells that were stimulated with LPS alone and untreated cells served as controls. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Afterwards, samples of the medium from each treatment were collected. Concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) in the samples were evaluated using mouse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (BIOSOURCE (TNF-α); Biolegend (IL-6)). All experiments were repeated three times. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—LPS O26:B6, or LPS O111:B4, was diluted in 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, incorporated into the calorimeter cell (1.8 ml) and equilibrated to 38 °C in a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal Inc, Southampton, MA). Solutions of temporins A, B, and L were made at a concentration of 350 μm in matching buffer and placed in the syringe. A volume of 10 μl of peptide (1.9 μm in the cell) was successively titrated into LPS with constant stirring at 300 rpm. Mixtures of temporins A+L, B+L, or A+B, containing 175 μm of each peptide were also injected into LPS in separate experiments. At the end of the titrations, the content of the cell was removed and kept for further processing. LPS is known to be a heterogeneous mixture in nature (38Peterson A.A. McGroarty E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 738-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1), making it difficult to establish its molecular weight. In these studies, LPS O26:B6 and LPS O111:B4 were quantified with the Purpald reagent, which is a specific reagent for the detection of aldehydes, using glycerol as a standard (44Lee C.H. Tsai C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The molecular weight for the LPS monomers was determined assuming LPS is a single molecular species, which is very useful as an arbitrary mode of comparison among data found with different amounts of LPS. The obtained values (13,000 and 20,000 kDa for LPS O26:B6 and LPS O111: B4, respectively) were in agreement with those previously reported in the literature (45Ribi E. Anacker R.L. Brown R. Haskins W.T. Malmgren B. Milner K.C. Rudbach J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 92: 1493-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46McIntire F.C. Barlow G.H. Sievert H.W. Finley R.A. Yoo A.L.

J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed and plotted using the program Origin 5.0 and fitted with programs provided by the manufacturer. Quasi-elastic Light Scattering (QUELS)—To estimate the average size of the LPS particles, QUELS measurements were performed at 38 °C using a BIC 200SM/TurboCorr light scattering instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corp, Holtsville, NY) measuring the scattered light at 90°. Samples of LPS O26:B6 collected from the calorimeter cell after titration with temporins, as well as from the original LPS suspension, were measured. Measurement of QUELS with LPS O111:B4 were conducted in samples diluted in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl, in absence of EDTA. Size distributions obtained by QUELS were analyzed using the Contin method, as provided by the manufacturer. Synergism between Temporins Toward Bacteria—To investigate the role of the size of the polysaccharide chain of LPS in the molecular mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of temporins A (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) and B (LLPIVGNLLKSLL-NH2) when each is combined with temporin L (FVQWFSKFLGRIL-NH2) against Gram-negative bacteria, we tested the ability of all combinations of these peptides to inhibit the growth of E. coli O111:B4 and E. coli O26:B6. The latter strain is known to have short LPS polysaccharide chains, as indicated both by its low molecular weight bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and by its low critical micelle concentration, which is considered to be directly proportional to the polysaccharide chain length of LPS (48Aurell C.A. Wistrom A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The antimicrobial activity of temporins was also assayed against three cell wall-defective mutant strains of E. coli D21, which have lower amounts of sugar residues in their LPS backbone. The first is E. coli D21 e7, which is devoid of the O-antigen domain and has a shorter outer oligosaccharide core. The second is E. coli D21 f1, lacking the O-antigen and the outer core region, and the third is E. coli D21 f2, carrying the only KDO-lipid A complex (40Boman H.G. Monner D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 455-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Farnaud S. Spiller C. Moriarty L.C. Patel A. Gant V. Odell E.W. Evans R.W. FEMS Microbiol.

The antimicrobial activity and FIC indices of temporins are illustrated in Table 1.TABLE 1MICs of temporins and FIC indices of their combination against several E. coli strainsBacterial strainsMICaMICs are presented as average values from three independent measurements.FIC indexbFIC indices were interpreted as follows: FIC ≤ 0.5, synergism; <0.5 FIC <1, additivity; ≤1 FIC <4, indifference; FIC ≥ 4.0, antagonism.Temp ATemp BTemp LTemp A + LTemp B + LTemp A + BμmE. coli O111:B410050100.480.500.56E. coli O26:B65050100.560.610.56E. coli D21 e725252.50.560.580.56E. coli D21 f112.5252.50.560.570.57E. coli D21 f26.2512.52.50.660.900.56a MICs are presented as average values from three independent measurements.b FIC indices were interpreted as follows: FIC ≤ 0.5, synergism; <0.5 FIC <1, additivity; ≤1 FIC <4, indifference; FIC ≥ 4.0, antagonism. Open table in a new tab The data revealed that A+L and B+L pairs exhibited a relatively greater synergistic effect on E. coli O111:B4 (FIC indices of 0.48 and 0.5, respectively) (39Lewis R.E.

In contrast, FIC values ranging from 0.56 to 0.9 were found when the same peptide combinations were tested on E. coli O26:B6 and the other bacterial strains. The highest FIC values were obtained toward E. coli D21 f2, indicating the disappearance of a synergistic effect, in parallel to a shortening of the LPS carbohydrate domain. The Effect of LPS on the Organization of Temporins—To ascertain whether differences in the antimicrobial activity of temporins A+L or B+L against E. coli O111:B4 and E. coli O26:B6 reflected a different organization of the peptides when in contact with LPS with a different length of the polysaccharide region, we studied the effect of purified LPS O26:B6 (with short carbohydrate chains) on temporins that were labeled at their N terminus with rhodamine. Rhodamine is a fluorescent probe that is only slightly sensitive to the polarity of its environment and does not interfere with the antibacterial activity of the peptide (data not shown). When rhodamine-labeled monomers are self-associated, and the rhodamine probes are in proximity, the result is self-quenching of the fluorescence emission. However, a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity of the peptide, after treatment with a proteolytic enzyme, indicates that the peptide is self-associated (51Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shai Y. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31609-31616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, the fluorescence of the rho-peptides was measured before and after adding different concentrations of LPS. Fig. 3, A, B, and C show the results with rho-temporin A, rho-temporin B, and rho-temporin L, respectively. The addition of increasing concentrations of LPS O26:B6 (arrow at time 0 in Fig. 3) to labeled temporins A or B quickly decreased peptide fluorescence, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting oligomerization of the two peptides. The strongest effect was achieved when the peptide:LPS ratio was 1:4. The addition of proteinase K (right arrow in Fig. 3) to LPS-treated rho-temporins A and B caused a rapid enhancement of fluorescence up to the initial level measured prior to the addition of LPS, thus confirming the induction of peptide assembly by LPS O26:B6. In contrast, the addition of LPS to rho-temporin L did not significantly affect its fluorescence, but raised it when the peptide: LPS molar ratio increased to 1:4 (Fig. 3C), highlighting a partial disaggregation of this peptide after contact with the endotoxin. Accordingly, proteolytic digestion of LPS-treated rho-temporin L induced an additional increase of fluorescence. Altogether, the overall results with LPS O26:B6 were quite similar to those previously reported for each of these temporins with LPS O111:B4 (15Rosenfeld Y. Barra D. Simmaco M. Shai Y. Mangoni M.L.

The Effect of Unlabeled Temporins on the Fluorescence of Rhodamine-labeled Peptides—To understand the reason for the lack of synergism in the activity of temporins A+L and B+L on E. coli O26:B6, we investigated the effect of temporin L on the oligomerization of A and B in the presence of LPS O26:B6 (Fig. 4) and compared it with that of LPS O111:B4 (15Rosenf"

We produced an antibody against the SsrA peptide and used it to measure the amounts of SsrA-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli cells without interfering with tagging or altering the context of the tag added at the ends of nascent polypeptides. SsrA-tagged proteins were present in very small amounts unless a component of the ClpXP protease was missing. From the levels of tagged proteins in cells in which degradation is essentially blocked, we calculate that ≥1 in 200 translation products receives an SsrA tag. ClpXP is responsible for ≥90% of the degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins. The degradation rate in wild type cells is ≥1.4 min–1 and decreases to ∼0.10 min–1 in a clpX mutant. The rate of degradation by ClpXP is decreased ∼3-fold in mutants lacking the adaptor SspB, whereas degradation by ClpAP is increased 3–5-fold. However, ClpAP degrades SsrA-tagged proteins slowly even in the absence of SspB, possibly because of interference from ClpA-specific substrates. Lon protease degrades SsrA-tagged proteins at a rate of ∼0.05 min–1 in the presence or absence of SspB. We conclude that ClpXP, together with SspB, is uniquely adapted for degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins and is responsible for the major part of their degradation in vivo.

Recycling of ribosomes at the completion of translation is a regulated process requiring specific interaction of release factors with stop codons (1Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). When protein translation does not proceed to completion or terminate properly, one alternative mechanism used to disassemble ribosomal complexes and to degrade defective or incomplete polypeptides employs the trans-translation system (2Muto A. Sato M. Tadaki T. Fukushima M. Ushida C. Himeno H. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), the centerpiece of which is the transfer mRNA (tmRNA) (also known as 10 S RNA or SsrA RNA), the product of the ssrA or sipB gene (4Ray B.K. Apirion D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 174: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Oh B.K. Chauhan A.K. Isono K. Apirion D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4708-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). tmRNA is a small, stable RNA containing an alanyl-tRNA domain and an mRNA domain encoding an open reading frame of 10 amino acids followed by a stop codon (6Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). tmRNA, together with the RNA chaperone, SmpB, is recruited to stalled ribosomes (7Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), where the charged alanyl-tRNA domain enters the A-site. The nascent chain is transferred to the Ala-tmRNA, and the mRNA domain takes the place of the previous message allowing the short open reading frame to be translated (8Saguy M. Gillet R. Metzinger L. Felden B. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) followed by termination at the stop codon. In the process, the polypeptide is extended by 11 amino acids, AANDENYALAA (6Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Proteins with this C-terminal extension are referred to as SsrA-tagged proteins. SsrA-tagged proteins are recognized by ClpXP and other proteases and rapidly degraded in vivo (12Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 13Herman C. Thevenet D. Bouloc P. Walker G.C. D'Ari R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, the SsrA-tagging serves to rescue ribosomes from stalled translation complexes and to remove incomplete polypeptides from the cell (3Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 9Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Translating ribosomes can stall at the ends of mRNAs that are missing in-frame stop codons, which can occur with partially degraded or incompletely synthesized mRNAs (3Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 12Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), or at the ends of normal mRNAs, when the ribosome reads through a stop codon, as occurs in the presence of suppressor tRNAs (14Ueda K. Yamamoto Y. Ogawa K. Abo T. Inokuchi H. Aiba H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Stalling can also occur when two or more in-frame rare codons appear in succession (15Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or when rare codons closely precede a stop codon (16Sunohara T. Abo T. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N.

Other conditions, such as loss of fidelity of translation in the presence of antibiotics, also cause translational pausing, recruitment of tmRNA, and production of SsrA-tagged proteins (18de la Cruz J. Vioque A. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1708-1716PubMed Google Scholar, 19Abo T. Ueda K. Sunohara T. Ogawa K. Aiba H.

Some full-length or nearly full-length proteins acquire SsrA tags. Designed translational pausing near the end of the open reading frame of the lactose repressor, LacI, or the phage Mu repressor, MuC, results in a fraction of the repressor proteins acquiring an SsrA tag (21Abo T. Inada T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Ranquet C. Geiselmann J. Toussaint A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10220-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SsrA tagging of LacI affects the efficiency of repression and the timing of induction of the lac operon (21Abo T. Inada T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mu repressor variants that acquire an SsrA tag near their C terminus have weaker DNA binding properties and interact with wild type repressor targeting it for degradation by ClpXP (22Ranquet C. Geiselmann J. Toussaint A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10220-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol.

Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using a tmRNA mutated to replace a portion of the SsrA tag with a polyhistidine, which results in tagged proteins that are not degraded by ClpXP. They estimated that 0.4% of translation initiations end with SsrA tagging. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the tagged proteins purified by metal chelate chromatography revealed a heterogeneous mixture of proteins, implying that some degree of SsrA tag incorporation occurs during translation of many proteins (26Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recovery of peptides very close to the C terminus of five proteins that were identified suggested that the SsrA tag had been added after translation was complete or nearly complete (26Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), consistent with a mechanism favoring recruitment of tmRNA at the end of translation, perhaps occasioned by delays in ribosome release (27Asano K. Kurita D. Takada K. Konno T. Muto A. Himeno H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).ClpXP degrades model SsrA-tagged proteins rapidly both in vivo and in vitro (28Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 29Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2007; 282: 11465-11473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ClpXP can directly degrade SsrA-tagged proteins in vitro, but the adaptor protein SspB, which recognizes a different portion of the SsrA tag from that recognized by ClpX, contributes to degradation by delivering the tagged proteins to ClpX. SspB lowers the Michaelis constant for SsrA-tagged proteins (32Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33Levchenko I. Grant R.A. Flynn J.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and thus has its greatest activating effect at subsaturating concentrations of tagged proteins. SspB is especially effective in targeting proteins bearing mutant SsrA tags that are not well recognized by ClpX alone or tags in which the portions recognized by SspB and ClpX are separated, allowing both components to bind the tag efficiently (34McGinness K.E. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 701-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A possible implication of this result is that SspB is also involved in targeting Escherichia coli proteins that bear SsrA-like tags; the contribution of SspB to degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins might vary depending on the abundance of competing substrates and of the substrates themselves. ClpAP also degrades SsrA-tagged proteins in vitro but appears to have lower activity against these proteins in vivo (12Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 35Bohn C. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Genet.

One possibility for the lower activity of ClpA in vivo is competition from SspB (36Farrell C.M. Grossman A.D. Sauer R.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1750-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SspB and ClpA bind overlapping portions of the SsrA tag and compete with each other in vitro (30Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, Lon protease has also been shown to degrade SsrA-tagged proteins (37Choy J.S. Aung L.L. Karzai A.W. J. Bacteriol.,. 2007; 189: 6564-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that multiple protease systems can contribute to degradation of these proteins, perhaps dependent on their abundance and the presence of competing substrates.To gain more insight into the number of proteins tagged with SsrA and to determine the relative contributions of the different ATP-dependent proteases to their degradation, we produced an antibody that specifically recognizes the wild type SsrA tag and used it to measure the accumulation and degradation of the bulk population of SsrA-tagged proteins in E. coli cells. We have found that SsrA tags are incorporated into ∼0.5% proteins during translation, and all tagged proteins are degraded by ClpXP, ClpAP, and Lon. ClpXP is responsible for ≥90% of the degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins, whereas ClpAP and Lon contribute about 5 and 2% to the degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibody Production and Characterization—Details of the production of anti-SsrA antibody, quantitation of SsrA-tagged proteins, and details of strain and plasmid construction are provided in the supplemental material.Cell Growth and Sample Preparation—Samples of overnight cultures grown at 37 °C were diluted 1 to 1000 in LB in a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. The culture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. At times during the growth, with cell densities between A600 0.1 and 4.0, samples were withdrawn, and 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to give a final concentration of 5% trichloroacetic acid. After incubation on ice for 30 min, precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), washed three times with cold acetone, and dried in air. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol was added to the dried samples to give a protein concentration of 0.7–1.4 mg/ml. After heating at ∼99 °C for 5 min, the samples were centrifuged in a bench top centrifuge for 5 min to remove insoluble debris. To confirm uniform recovery of cell proteins, 10-μl aliquots of the solubilized protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue.Western Blot Analysis—Samples containing ∼10 μg of protein in SDS sample buffer were loaded into lanes of a 10% BisTris 2The abbreviations used are:BisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGDHglutamate dehydrogenase. NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) in MES running buffer. A control lane was loaded with 1–2 ng of GFP-SsrA. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes in Tris-glycine buffer containing 10% (v/v) methanol. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.025% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. Membranes were transferred to fresh blocking buffer containing an appropriate dilution of anti-SsrA IgG (1/500 to 1/3000, depending on the preparation) and incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times at room temperature with blocking buffer without milk, after which it was treated with blocking buffer containing a 3000-fold dilution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). After shaking for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was washed as above, and the ECL plus detection kit (GE Healthcare) was used to visualize the cross-reactive bands. Membranes were sometimes blocked overnight at 4 °C, and immunochemical detection was conducted the next day. On occasion blocked membranes were stored wet at –20 °C and blocked again at room temperature prior to immunochemical detection.Protein Degradation Rates Measured by Antibiotic Chase—Overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh LB and grown as described above. At mid-exponential phase (A600 ∼ 0.5), spectinomycin was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml from a freshly prepared stock solution. Samples (0.2 ml) were removed between 0 and 60 min, treated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Control samples were removed just prior to addition of antibiotic and treated along with test samples. Optical density readings were used to monitor cell growth throughout the chase period. To measure protein degradation in stationary phase cells, chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml) was added to cells at A600 ∼ 1.0, and samples were taken at 1-h intervals between 0 and 4 h and treated as above.RESULTSDetection of SsrA-tagged Proteins in E. coli Cells Using Anti-SsrA Antibody—SsrA-tagged proteins in E. coli cell extracts were monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-SsrA antibody. No specific bands were detected in lanes containing 20 μg of protein from wild type cells (Fig. 1A, lane 1). In contrast, a large number of protein bands, ranging in size from 20 to 200 kDa, were readily detected by the antibody in clpX or clpP mutant strains (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5). These protein bands were not seen in mutant strains that also carried null mutations in ssrA (Fig. 1A, lanes 11–14, and Fig. 5B, below) confirming that they require the presence of a functional ssrA gene. We refer to these bands as SsrA-tagged proteins throughout the paper. In some blots with high protein loadings, bands of ∼7 and ∼80 kDa were observed; the levels of these proteins did not change in any of the protease mutants and were present in ssrA mutants, indicating they are not SsrA-tagged proteins.FIGURE 5ClpX promotes efficient trapping of SsrA-tagged proteins by an inactive mutant of ClpP in vivo. Plasmid pBAD24-His-ClpPin, which expresses the proteolytically inactive mutant, His-ClpP-S97A, under control of the arabinose promoter, was transformed into a clpP mutant host strain and into its isogenic derivatives carrying mutations in clpA, clpX, sspB, or lon. Cells were grown to low density (A600 ∼ 0.2) in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and synthesis of His-ClpPin was induced by addition of arabinose. After 40 min, cells were collected. His-ClpPin was purified from cell extracts by metal chelate chromatography on a Talon resin. Protein (5 μg) from the peak fraction containing purified His-ClpPin was loaded in each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE. SsrA-tagged proteins were detected by Western blotting. Left panel, lanes are labeled with the relevant genotypes of the strains used: lane 1, clpP (YN594); lane 2, clpP clpA (SG30071); lane 3, clpP clpX (SG30070); lane 4, clpP clpA clpX (SG30073); lane 5, clpP sspB (ML30122); lane 6, clpP lon (ML30010); lane 7, clpP clpA lon (ML30220); lane 8, clpP clpX lon (ML30014); lane 9, clpP clpX sspB (ML30316).

Lane 10, clpP (YN594); lane 11, clpP clpX (SG30070); lane 12, clpP clpA (SG30071); lane 13, clpP ssrA (SG30088).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Null mutations in clpQ, lon, or ftsH, the genes for other ATP-dependent proteases, did not give rise to detectable amounts of SsrA-tagged proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8) nor did a mutation in clpA (Fig. 1A, lane 2), indicating that ClpXP is the major protease involved in the degradation of endogenous SsrA-tagged proteins. SsrA-tagged proteins also did not accumulate in an sspB mutant (Fig. 1A, lane 9). SspB facilitates interaction of ClpX with SsrA-tagged proteins and promotes their degradation in vitro and in vivo (30Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 32Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We show below that SspB does affect the rate of degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins, but degradation in the absence of SspB is rapid, and the steady-state levels of tagged proteins are below the detection limit of our antibody. To confirm that the SsrA-tagged proteins that accumulated in the clpX mutant were substrates for ClpX, we introduced a plasmid expressing ClpX under control of the arabinose promoter. The SsrA-tagged proteins were abundant before induction of ClpX (Fig. 1B, –arabinose) but declined rapidly 5 min after induction (Fig. 1B, +arabinose).To estimate the amounts of SsrA-tagged proteins, we used purified GFP-SsrA as a standard. The limit of detection of GFP-SsrA was in the range of 1 ng (<40 fmol) in most blots; no cross-reaction was seen with untagged GFP (data not shown). We then compared the intensities of various dilutions of GFP-SsrA to the total intensities in each lane after densitometric scanning. Lanes loaded with 20 μg of protein from a clpX mutant contained the equivalent of ∼22 ng of GFP-SsrA. As GFP-SsrA (Mr 27,264) is only slightly smaller than the average E. coli protein (Mr ∼ 33,000), we calculate that ∼0.11% of the proteins carry an SsrA tag in clpX mutant cells. The rate of incorporation of SsrA tags into newly synthesized nascent chains must be considerably higher than 0.11%, because the tagged proteins are not completely stable in clpX mutants, and <30% accumulates in the steady state (see below).An estimate of the minimum degradation rate of SsrA-tagged proteins in wild type cells can be obtained by comparison of the accumulation of the tagged proteins in wild type and mutant cells. 3In exponentially growing cells, the fraction of a newly synthesized unstable protein that accumulates is given by the ratio of its synthesis rate to the sum of its synthesis and degradation rates, ksyn/(ksyn + kdeg) (51Moesteller R.D. Goldstein R.V. Nishimoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2524-2532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis rate is approximately equal to the instantaneous rate of growth, which is ∼0.030 min–1 for all the strains except the ftsH mutant. For the clpP mutant with a kd of 0.081 min–1 (Table 2), the calculated fractional recovery would be 0.030/(0.030 + 0.081) or 0.27. When clpX cell extracts were serially diluted, SsrA-tagged proteins were visible when as little as 2–4 μgof protein was loaded in the lane (see supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, no tagged proteins were visible even with 100 μgof wild type cell extract, indicating that ≤3% of the tagged proteins accumulate in the steady state in wild type cells. If tagging occurs at the same rate in the wild type and mutant cells, this low level accumulation must reflect a degradation rate in wild type cells of ≥1.0 min–1 (t½ ≤ 1 min). 4The overall degradation rate constant is the sum of the rate constants for the individual proteases. Because the accumulated SsrA-tagged proteins in the absence of ClpX is 10–20 times the amount observed in the presence of ClpX (the limit of detection by our antibody), the rate constant for ClpX-dependent degradation is between 10 and 20 times that of all other proteases combined or at least 1.0 min–1. Below, we show that direct measurements are in agreement with this estimate.ClpA Makes a Minor Contribution to the Degradation of SsrA-tagged Proteins—Purified SsrA-tagged proteins are efficiently degraded by both ClpXP and ClpAP in vitro (28Kim Y.I.

Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and both proteases target overexpressed or engineered SsrA-tagged proteins in vivo, although ClpX is more efficient in promoting their degradation (12Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 35Bohn C. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Genet.

No SsrA-tagged proteins were detectable in wild type or ΔclpA mutant cells during exponential or stationary phase (see supplemental Fig. S5), indicating that ClpA cannot be responsible for eliminating a large fraction of the SsrA-tagged proteins. ClpA expression levels were comparable with those of ClpX under the conditions of our experiments (Ref. 39Ortega J. Lee H.S. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus, ClpX activity is much higher than ClpA activity against SsrA-tagged proteins in wild type cells.The double clpA clpX mutant has as much as two times the level of SsrA-tagged proteins as the clpX mutant (compare vector lanes in Fig. 2A and see supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that ClpA is capable of degrading these proteins. To confirm that ClpA can promote degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins that accumulate in the absence of ClpX, the clpX mutant and the clpX clpA mutant were transformed with a plasmid expressing ClpA under control of the arabinose promoter. SsrA-tagged proteins were abundant in the mutant cells containing the empty vector (Fig. 2A, top left), whereas they were absent in cells expressing ClpA from the plasmid (Fig. 2A, top right). ClpA is expressed at a low level without induction with this clone, producing about three times the endogenous ClpA level (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). This small increase was sufficient to allow degradation of the SsrA-tagged proteins, which were reduced to essentially undetectable levels. We conclude that ClpA can recognize SsrA-tagged proteins in vivo, but endogenous ClpA either does not have access to the SsrA-tagged proteins or is occupied by other protein substrates limiting its availability.FIGURE 2Increased expression of ClpA from a plasmid suppresses accumulation of SsrA-tagged proteins. A clpX mutant and an isogenic clpX clpA double mutant were transformed with a pBAD33 plasmid expressing clpA under the arabinose promoter or with the pBAD33 vector. Cells were grown to mid-exponential phase without arabinose, and equal aliquots were removed at two times 60 min apart and processed for Western blotting. A, blots with anti-SsrA antibody. The genotypes of the host strains, ML30035 (ΔclpX) and ML30060 (ΔclpX ΔclpA), are indicated at the top, and the lanes are labeled with the plasmid present in that host. B, blots with anti-SsrA antibody. Samples from the above culture were run on a separate gel and blotted with anti-ClpA antibody. The 1st lane contains purified ClpA as a reference. Other lanes were loaded with protein from equal volumes of the cultures indicated above. ClpA is expressed from the plasmid without induction at 2–3 times the endogenous level seen in clpA+ cells. The vector control samples for the clpX clpA mutant were taken from a parallel culture that was induced with 0.1% arabinose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stability of SsrA-tagged Proteins Is Not Because of Inhibition of ClpA by ClpS—ClpS is an adaptor protein that targets substrates bearing N-degrons to ClpA (40Erbse A.

To determine whether ClpS prevented ClpA from degrading SsrA-tagged proteins in vivo, we compared accumulation of SsrA-tagged proteins in a clpX and a clpX clpS double mutant during exponential growth.

The largest known chemical family of deterrents are terpenes characterized by reactive α,β-unsaturated dialdehyde moieties, including the drimane sesquiterpenes and other terpene species. Deterrent sesquiterpenes are potent activators of mammalian peripheral chemosensory neurons, causing pain and neurogenic inflammation. Despite their wide-spread synthesis and medicinal use as desensitizing analgesics, their molecular targets remain unknown. Here we show that isovelleral, a noxious fungal sesquiterpene, excites sensory neurons through activation of TPRA1, an ion channel involved in inflammatory pain signaling. TRPA1 is also activated by polygodial, a drimane sesquiterpene synthesized by plants and animals. TRPA1-deficient mice show greatly reduced nocifensive behavior in response to isovelleral, indicating that TRPA1 is the major receptor for deterrent sesquiterpenes in vivo. Isovelleral and polygodial represent the first fungal and animal small molecule agonists of nociceptive transient receptor potential channels.

Terpenes represent the largest group of natural products synthesized by plants, fungi, animals, and microorganisms (1Gershenzon J. Dudareva N. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Although some terpenes function as hormonal messengers or as constituents of biological membranes and enzymatic cofactors, the biological functions of most of the ∼25,000 different terpenes remain to be determined (1Gershenzon J. Dudareva N. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Recent studies investigating the biochemical interactions of plants, fungi, and animals suggest that one of the major biological roles of terpenes is to act as chemical deterrents against herbivores, fungivores, and predators, respectively (1Gershenzon J. Dudareva N. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 2Langenheim J.H. J. Chem. Ecol. 1994; 20: 1223-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Deterrent terpenes interact with chemosensory detection systems in target organisms to induce avoidance behavior. In animals, it has been speculated that chemodefensive terpenes could activate gustatory and olfactory pathways as well as pain-sensing neuronal pathways. Indeed, some terpenes produce a painfully pungent taste in humans, probably related to their deterrent function. Recent research on terpene deterrents has focused on sesquiterpenes, a class of terpenes consisting of three isoprene units. One of the most intensively studied defensive sesquiterpenes is isovelleral, the pungent product of the fungus Lactarius vellereus. Isovelleral is thought to be part of a fungal chemical defense system against predators (3List P.H. Hackenberg H. Arch. Pharm. 1969; 302: 125-143Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Magnusson G. Thoren S. Wickberg B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1972; 13: 1105-1108Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and is rapidly synthesized in response to injury from chemical precursors stored in the fungal laticiferous hyphae (5Camazine S.M.

In behavioral tests, fungivorous mammals were strongly repelled by isovelleral (5Camazine S.M. Resch J.F. Eisner T. Meinwald J. J. Chem.

In humans, skin contact with the fungal milky exudate often leads to painful inflammatory responses, including eczema and blistering (7Ponhold J. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1942; 182: 732-739Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 8Ponhold J. Arch. Toxicol. 1944; 13: 33-36Google Scholar). Another pungent sesquiterpene is polygodial, initially isolated from the leaves of water pepper (Polygonum hydropiper) (9Barnes C.S. Loder J.W. Aust. J. Chem. 1962; 15: 322-327Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Polygodial is also a major product of winter's bark (Drimys winteri), a South American medicinal tree, and horopito (Pseudowintera colorata), a medicinal plant native to New Zealand (10McCallion R.F. Cole A.L. Walker J.R. Blunt J.W. Munro M.H. Planta Med. 1982; 44: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Cechinel Filho V. Schlemper V. Santos A.R. Pinheiro T.R. Yunes R.A. Mendes G.L. Calixto J.B. Delle Monache F. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1998; 62: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Leaves and barks from these plants are used for analgesic and anti-inflammatory preparations to treat dental and stomach pain and other painful conditions (12Andre E. Ferreira J. Malheiros A. Yunes R.A. Calixto J.B. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although initially painful, polygodial acts as an analgesic through desensitization of sensory neurons (12Andre E. Ferreira J. Malheiros A. Yunes R.A. Calixto J.B. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Polygodial is also found in ferns (pteridophytes), bryophytes (liverworts) (13Asakawa Y. Toyota M. Oiso Y. Braggins J.E. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 2001; 49: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Socolsky C. Muruaga N. Bardón A. Chem. Biodiversity. 2005; 2: 1105-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and even in animals. Studies on Mediterranean and Pacific sea slugs have shown that these animals synthesize polygodial as a chemodefensive agent to deter predatory fish (15Cimino G. De Rosa S. De Stefano S. Sodano G. Villani G. Science. 1983; 219: 1237-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Long J.D. Hay M.E. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 2006; 307: 199-208Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, pungent sesquiterpenes are used as chemical defense agents across plant, fungal, and animal kingdoms. Both isovelleral and polygodial have been proposed to act on vanilloid receptors in peripheral sensory neurons to induce pungent sensations and neurogenic inflammation (17Szallasi A. Jonassohn M.

Calixto J.B. Geppetti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The vanilloid receptor, TRPV1, is a Ca2+-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) 3The abbreviations used are:TRPtransient receptor potentialBCTCN-(4-tertiarybutylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)tetrahydropyrazine-1(2H)-carboxamideDRGdorsal root ganglionCHOChinese hamster ovary. ion channel activated by vanilloids such as capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in chili peppers. TRPV1 is specifically expressed in nociceptive chemosensory neurons and is also sensitive to acidity and noxious heat. Both isovelleral and polygodial induce Ca2+ influx into cultured sensory neurons (17Szallasi A. Jonassohn M. Acs G. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Sterner O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Andre E. Campi B. Trevisani M. Ferreira J. Malheiros A. Yunes R.A. Calixto J.B. Geppetti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx was partially abolished by the vanilloid antagonist capsazepine (17Szallasi A. Jonassohn M. Acs G. Biro T.

Geppetti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, isovelleral and polygodial diminished binding and changed cooperativity of the high affinity vanilloid agonist resiniferatoxin on sensory neuronal membrane preparations (17Szallasi A.

Yunes R.A. Calixto J.B. Geppetti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Polygodial induced bladder contraction, a process mediated by neuropeptides released from activated sensory nerve endings in the bladder wall (18Andre E. Campi B. Trevisani M. Ferreira J. Malheiros A. Yunes R.A. Calixto J.B. Geppetti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, capsazepine was generally ineffective in blocking this activity, whereas the TRP channel pore blocker ruthenium red almost completely blocked polygodial-induced contraction (18Andre E.

In a similar fashion, isovelleral-activated relaxation of the mesenteric artery appeared to be partially independent of vanilloid receptors (19Ralevic V. Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Davis J.B. Egerton J. Smart D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). transient receptor potential N-(4-tertiarybutylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)tetrahydropyrazine-1(2H)-carboxamide dorsal root ganglion Chinese hamster ovary. Surprisingly, pharmacological studies failed to detect any agonist activity of isovelleral or polygodial on cloned vanilloid receptors, including human, rat and porcine TRPV1 isoforms (20Jerman J.C.

Pharmacol. 2001; 417: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the contrary, it was found that isovelleral has TRPV1 antagonist activity, inhibiting capsaicin activation of TRPV1 at IC50 values similar to those of capsazepine and ruthenium red (20Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Prinjha R. Harries M.H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Smart D. Jerman J.C. Gunthorpe M.J. Brough S.J. Ranson J.

Activity of polygodial on cloned vanilloid receptors remains to be established. These observations suggested that the biological actions of isovelleral and other sesquiterpenes are mediated by unknown sensory neuronal targets different from TRPV1. The discovery of the targets of sesquiterpenes will provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of pain and deterrence induced by this large class of biological deterrents and may delineate novel approaches for the development of analgesics. Animals—TRPA1-/- mice were a gift from David Julius (University of California, San Francisco). Mice were housed at an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility in standard environmental conditions (12 h light-dark cycle and ∼23 °C). All animal procedures were approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were identically matched for age (12-22 weeks) and gender, and the experimenter was blind to the genotype. Mice were genotyped as described (23Bautista D.M. Jordt S.E. Nikai T. Tsuruda P.R.

Chemicals and Analysis—Isovelleral was purchased from either Sigma or A.G. Scientific, Inc. Polygodial was purchased from Sequoia Research Products, Ltd. Methylvinylketone was purchased from Acros Organics, and methacrolein was from Alfa Aesar. All other chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfections—Adult mouse dorsal root ganglia were dissected and dissociated by a 1-h incubation in 0.28 Wünsch unit/ml Liberase Blendzyme 1 (Roche Applied Science), followed by washes with phosphate-buffered saline, trituration, and straining of debris (70 μm; Falcon). Neurons were cultured in neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen) with B-27 supplement, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Calbiochem) on 8-well chambered coverglass or 35-mm cell culture dishes (Nunc) coated with polylysine (Sigma) and laminin (Invitrogen). HEK-293T cells for Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology were cultured and transfected as described (24Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D. Nature. 2004; 427: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Imaging and Electrophysiology—Imaging and electrophysiological recordings were performed 16-26 h after dorsal root ganglion (DRG) dissection or transfection. For imaging, medium was replaced by modified standard Ringer's bath solution: 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. Cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM (10 μm, Calbiochem, CA) for 1 h and subsequently washed and imaged in standard bath solution. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed on an Olympus IX51 microscope with a Polychrome V monochromator (Till Photonics) and a PCO Cooke Sensicam QE camera and Imaging Workbench 6 imaging software (Indec). Fura-2 emission images were obtained with exposures of 0.100 ms at 340-nm and 0.100 ms at 380-nm excitation wavelengths. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) concentrations were derived from the F340/F380 emission ratio adjusted by the Kd of Fura-2 (238 nm) and ratiometric data at minimum and maximum [Ca2+]i (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Kao J.P.

Ratiometric images were generated using ImageJ software. For electrophysiology, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. After 12-24 h, cells were washed with extracellular solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES) and recorded. For whole cell recordings, pipette solution contained 75 mm CsCl, 70 mm CsF, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES. For cell-attached recordings, bath and pipette solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES. For inside-out recordings, pipette solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PPPi. Cell-attached and inside-out recordings were performed by forming a gigaseal using wax-coated borosilicate pipettes with the desired resistance (4-5 megaohms). Whole cell recordings were performed with a holding potential of 0 mV unless otherwise indicated. All currents were recorded with an HEKA EPC 10 patch-clamp amplifier (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY), filtered at 2.9 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter, and subsequently stored on a computer disk. All traces were digitally filtered at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed with HEKA Patchmaster and HEKA Fitmaster. Pain Behavior—Mice received a 25-μl injection of 1 mm isovelleral (in 10% DMSO saline) intraplantarly into the right hind paw using a 100-μl Hamilton syringe. Responses were recorded in a clear cylinder for 5 min. Nocifensive responses were visualized by slowing the video frame speed with Media Player software (Microsoft Windows). Nocifensive responses after paw injection (licking, flicking, and lifting) were quantified and combined as “total number of behaviors.” Statistics—For all statistical tests, a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The sums of nocifensive paw licking, flicking, and lifting responses (total number of behaviors, n = 10/group) after isovelleral treatment were compared between TRPA1-/- mice and wild-type littermates using analysis of variance or repeated measures analysis followed by post hoc analysis. The percentages of cultured neurons from TRPA1+/+ and TRPA1-/- mice responding to isovelleral or polygodial with an increase of [Ca2+]i to levels of >500 nm were compared using a two-tailed, two-sample with unequal variance, Student's t test. TRPV1-independent Activation of Sensory Neurons by Isovelleral—To identify sensory neuronal targets for pungent sesquiterpenes, we studied the cellular and pharmacological effects of isovelleral on cultured murine DRG neurons by ratiometric Ca2+ imaging (Fig. 1, A-C). Isovelleral (200 μm) induced a robust increase in intracellular Ca2+ in a subpopulation of tested neurons (Fig. 1, B and C). The activity of isovelleral was abolished in Ca2+-free, EGTA-buffered medium, indicating that isovelleral initiated influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). We further characterized the neuronal samples by application of mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate; 100 μm) and capsaicin (800 nm), two C-fiber-specific sensory irritants activating the Ca2+-permeable ion channels TRPA1 and TRPV1, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). As a final stimulus, potassium chloride was added to depolarize all neurons, thus activating voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Mustard oil raised [Ca2+]i in some of the cells preactivated by isovelleral but was largely ineffective at inducing Ca2+ influx into additional neurons, indicating that these two painful agents target the same cellular population. The isovelleral- and mustard oil-responsive cellular population was 92 ± 4% identical. Capsaicin activated additional cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The cells activated by isovelleral were contained within the population of capsaicin-sensitive cells and represented 75 ± 5% of capsaicin-sensitive neurons (three fields of cultured neurons, 342 total cells analyzed). Isovelleral activated neuronal Ca2+ influx with an EC50 of 130 ± 40 μm (n = 50 ± 4 neurons/concentration, tested at nine concentrations within the range of 0-200 μm). TRPV1, the capsaicin receptor, was proposed to be a candidate target for isovelleral in sensory neurons. We therefore examined the effects of genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 on isovelleral-induced neuronal influx of Ca2+. As expected, capsaicin responsiveness of DRG neurons dissociated from TRPV1-/- mice was completely abolished (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast, responsiveness to isovelleral was maintained in TRPV1-/- neurons (Fig. 1, D and E). Application of isovelleral to TRPV1-deficient neurons activated a similar proportion of sensory neurons and caused a similarly robust increase in intracellular Ca2+. (Fig. 1E). Sensitivity to isovelleral was also retained in wild-type neurons superfused with isovelleral in the presence of three TRPV1 antagonists, N-(4-tertiarybutylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)tetrahydropyrazine-1(2H)-carboxamide (BCTC) (28Behrendt H.J.

Capsazepine, reported to counteract the effects of isovelleral in vivo, was also ineffective in blocking isovelleral-induced Ca2+ influx in TRPV1-deficient neurons (supplemental Fig. 1B). Although all three antagonists abolished the effects of capsaicin, the proportion of neurons activated by isovelleral remained similar to the proportion of cells activated in the absence of TRPV1 antagonists (Fig. 1E). Finally, our patch clamp analysis of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 currents in heterologous cells confirmed earlier fluorescent imaging studies reporting an inhibitory action of isovelleral on TRPV1. Isovelleral (100 μm) robustly inhibited capsaicin (1 μm)-activated currents throughout the applied range of voltages (Fig. 1F). Only small inward TRPV1 currents remained. Capsaicin (1 μm) was transiently capable of overcoming isovelleral (100 μm) inhibition (Fig. 1F, inset, and supplemental Fig. 1C). Taken together, our initial studies suggest that TRPV1 is unlikely to be the major mediator of isovelleral-activated Ca2+ influx into cultured sensory neurons. In fact, our data confirm that isovelleral is an inhibitor of TRPV1. Activation of TRPA1 by Isovelleral in Sensory Neurons and Heterologous Cells—To further characterize the isovelleral-activated Ca2+ influx pathway, we measured the effects of isovelleral on neuronal membrane conductance by whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Isovelleral activated sustained currents in 4 of 14 recorded sensory neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). The induced currents were outwardly rectifying and blocked by ruthenium red, a blocker of a subgroup of TRP ion channels (Fig. 2, A and B). In Ca2+ imaging experiments, ruthenium red also completely abolished isovelleral-induced Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that isovelleral activated a Ca2+-permable ion channel, possibly a TRP channel, in the mustard oil-sensitive population of sensory neurons. This population is characterized by expression of TRPA1, a TRP ion channel activated by mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate) (24Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M.

To investigate potential agonist activity of isovelleral on TRPA1, we examined its effects on cloned TRPA1 channels in heterologous cells by fluorescent Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp electrophysiology. Indeed, isovelleral induced robust influx of Ca2+ into HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with human (EC50 = 0.50 ± 0.13 μm) or mouse (EC50 = 2.58 ± 1.09 μm) TRPA1 cDNA, whereas vector-transfected cells were unresponsive (Fig. 3, A and B). In patch clamp recordings from hTRPA1-transfected CHO cells, isovelleral (50 μm) activated sizable currents inhibited by ruthenium red (Fig. 3C). Cell-attached single channel recordings revealed that the channels underlying isovelleral-induced currents had a conductance of 75 ± 1 picosiemens at +60 mV and 45 ± 1 picosiemens at -60 mV, similar to single channel conductances reported for TRPA1 (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. 1D) (34Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The open single channels conductance showed outward rectification (Fig. 3E). Patch clamp recordings in the inside out configuration revealed that isovelleral was capable of activating TRPA1 channels when applied to the cytosolic side of the patch (Fig. 3F and supplemental Fig. 1E). Activity of isovelleral in the inside out configuration was retained in the absence of Ca2+ on both sides of the membrane (Fig. 3F and supplemental Fig. 1E). Agonist activity of isovelleral was unique to TRPA1, since other TRP channels, including TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, and TRPM8, did not respond to isovelleral (200 μm; not shown). Cellular and Behavioral Insensitivity of TRPA1-/- Mice to Isovelleral—To examine the role of TRPA1 in the sensory neuronal response to isovelleral, we analyzed the effects of isovelleral on neurons dissociated from TRPA1-/- mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Strikingly, we observed that responses to isovelleral were dramatically reduced in TRPA1-deficient neurons. At concentrations of isovelleral of ≤150 μm, no neuronal cellular influx of Ca2+ was observed. Only at high concentrations of isovelleral (200 μm) did we observe a residual population of isovelleral-sensitive cells (7.3 ± 1.5% of neurons, n = 363 total cells in five fields) (supplemental Fig. 2A). These cells were only activated after significant delays, and steady state [Ca2+]i remained at a much lower level than in wild-type neurons (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). These residual responses were only blocked by substantially high concentrations of ruthenium red (40 μm) and were insensitive to capsazepine (10 μm) (supplemental Fig. 2D). Thus, TRPA1 appeared to be required for the majority of the sensory neuronal responses to isovelleral in culture. Our results implicate TRPA1 as the major mediator of pungency and deterrence by isovelleral. However, neuronal activation in the intact animal could occur through other pathways. To examine the roles of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in isovelleral deterrence in vivo, we compared the nocifensive response of wild-type, TRPV1-/-, and TRPA1-/- mice after injection of isovelleral into the hind paw. The activity of isovelleral in this assay had not been reported before, requiring the establishment of a dose that would induce reproducible numbers of nocifensive responses. Wild-type mice displayed immediate nocifensive behavior (paw lifts, flicks, and licks) after injection of 25 nmol of isovelleral (25 μl of 1 mm). This amount was similar to the reported amount of isovelleral required to induce nocifensive eye wiping responses in rats (17Szallasi A. Jonassohn M. Acs G. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Sterner O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Injection of the same volume of vehicle did not cause any nocifensive responses (not shown). Although nocifensive responses in wild-type and TRPV1-/- mice were indistinguishable, TRPA1-/- mice showed a dramatically reduced number of responses after injection (Fig. 4, C and D). Differences in pain responses in TRPA1-/- mice were particularly pronounced immediately following the injection. Although wild-type mice responded immediately and continued with a constant response frequency over the entire test period, TRPA1-/- mice showed no responses within the first minute, with occasional pain responses in the later minutes of the experiment (Fig. 4E). Thus, we show that TRPA1 is the principal mediator of isovelleral-induced pain and deterrence in vivo. Activation of TRPA1 by Polygodial, a Drimane Sesquiterpene, and by Reactive Terpene Products—Does TRPA1 play a more general role in sesquiterpene-induced irritance, or is the interaction with sesquiterpenes limited to isovelleral only? To answer this question, we tested whether TRPA1 would be activated by the pungent sesquiterpene, polygodial (Fig. 5A). Polygodial (200 μm) robustly activated Ca2+ influx into cultured sensory neurons of wild-type mice (Fig. 5B). Again, TRPA1 appeared to be essential for this response, since the percentage of neuronal cells responding to polygodial was significantly reduced in neurons dissociated from TRPA1-/- mice. (Fig. 5, B and C). Polygodial strongly activated hTRPA1 channels expressed in HEK-293T cells, with EC50 = 400 ± 70 nm (n = 60 ± 7 cells/concentration, tested at 10 different concentrations within the range of 0-10 μm) (Fig. 5D). Again, other TRP channels with sensory roles, including TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, and TRPM8, were unresponsive (not shown). Thus, TRPA1 is a receptor for both isovelleral and polygodial and, potentially, other pungent sesquiterpenes. How do pungent sesquiterpenes activate TRPA1? Recent studies indicated that TRPA1 is a receptor for a wide range of noxious electrophilic agents, activating the channel through covalent modification of cysteine and lysine residues in the TRPA1 protein (35Hinman A.

The basic leucine zipper transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), is one of the genes with increased expression during ER stress. Translation of the C/EBPβ mRNA from different initiation codons leads to the synthesis of two transcriptional activators (LAP-1 and −2) and a transcriptional repressor (LIP). The LIP/LAP ratio is a critical factor in C/EBPβ-mediated gene transcription. It is shown here that the LIP/LAP ratio decreased by 5-fold during the early phase of ER stress and increased by 20-fold during the late phase, mostly because of changes in LIP levels. The early decrease in LIP required degradation via the proteasome pathway and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2α. The increased LIP levels during the late phase were due to increased synthesis and increased stability of the protein. It is proposed that regulation of synthesis and degradation rates during ER stress controls the LIP/LAP ratio. The importance of C/EBPβ in the ER-stress response program was demonstrated using C/EBPβ-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It is shown that C/EBPβ attenuates expression of pro-survival ATF4 target genes in late ER stress and enhances expression of cell death-associated genes downstream of CHOP. The inhibitory effect of LIP on ATF4-induced transcription was demonstrated for the cat-1 amino acid transporter gene.

The regulatory events in the UPR are linked to a key sensor within the ER lumen, the chaperone GRP78/BiP (5Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). In stressed cells, the binding of BiP to unfolded proteins lowers the level of free BiP, promoting the activation of three signaling pathways. (i) PERK protein kinase phosphorylates the α subunit of the translation initiation factor, eIF2 (eIF2α), to attenuate global translation initiation. Interestingly, the translation of some mRNAs increases (6Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

(ii) The transmembrane protein ATF6, which is normally retained in the ER, transits to the Golgi, where it is cleaved to produce an active transcription factor. Its target genes include ER chaperones that assist with protein folding (BiP, GRP94, and calreticulin) (10Yamamoto K. Sato T. Matsui T. Sato M. Okada T. Yoshida H. Harada A. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). (iii) The endonuclease IRE1 is activated, initiating the cytoplasmic splicing of XBP1 mRNA to a form that encodes a potent transcription factor (11Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). XBP1 forms heterodimers with ATF6 or directly induces gene transcription (10Yamamoto K. Sato T. Matsui T. Sato M. Okada T. Yoshida H. Harada A. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The level of downstream gene expression in these signaling pathways determines cell fate during the ER stress response (12Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), as recently shown for IRE1 signaling (13Lin J.H. Li H. Yasumura D. Cohen H.R. Zhang C. Panning B. Shokat K.M. Lavail M.M. Walter P. Science. 2007; 318: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Expression of the bZIP transcription factor C/EBPβ is induced by stress conditions, such as ER stress and amino acid starvation (14Chen C. Dudenhausen E. Chen H. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Chen C. Dudenhausen E.E. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27948-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ heterodimerizes with other bZIP factors, including ATF4 and CHOP, which are also induced during the UPR (16Sok J. Wang X.Z. Batchvarova N. Kuroda M. Harding H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CHOP is a C/EBP family member that has been associated with induction of apoptosis, as well as many diseases (4Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Neurology. 2006; 66: S102-S109Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). During translation of the C/EBPβ mRNA, initiation at alternate in-frame AUG codons gives rise to at least three isoforms, LAP-1, LAP-2, and LIP (see Fig. 1C) (17Calkhoven C.F. Muller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar). LAP-1 and −2 contain an N-terminal transcription transactivation domain, a central DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal leucine zipper domain that homo- or heterodimerizes with other bZIP proteins (18Nerlov C. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). LIP is missing the transactivation domain but can dimerize and bind DNA. As a consequence, LAP-1 and −2 are mostly transcriptional activators, whereas LIP acts as a repressor (19Zahnow C.A. Younes P. Laucirica R. Rosen J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1887-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is expressed in many tissues (18Nerlov C. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and high LIP levels are associated with aggressive tumors, suggesting that LIP is oncogenic (19Zahnow C.A. Younes P. Laucirica R. Rosen J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1887-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, characterization of C/EBPβ–/– mice provides clues to its functions. These mice have two phenotypes, A and B (20Croniger C.M. Millward C. Yang J. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Liu S. Harada-Shiba M. Chakravarty K. Friedman J.E. Poli V. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mice with the B phenotype die in the perinatal period because of hypoglycemia and inability to mobilize glycogen. Mice with the A phenotype survive to adulthood but have defective glucose and lipid homeostasis. They have fasting hypoglycemia, lower hepatic glucose production, as well as reduced plasma insulin and free fatty acids. The importance of the individual C/EBPβ isoforms in vivo has not been demonstrated. However, in a recent report, mice containing a knock-in mutation of the LAP-2 translation initiation codon did not have the metabolic defects of the C/EBPβ–/– mice, suggesting important roles for LAP-1 and LIP in the cellular metabolism (21Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yamakami M. Omori H. Yamamoto M. Yoshimori T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5378-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The importance of C/EBPβ in the ER stress response has been shown by the reduced apoptosis of C/EBPβ–/– MEFs (22Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), which suggested that this protein might play a role in the regulation of gene expression during the response. In fact, C/EBPβ has been associated with regulation of the asparagine synthase (AS) gene (23Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and genes downstream of CHOP (DOCs) during ER stress (9Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 24Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because there are no clear consensus DNA-binding sites for the bZIP heterodimers induced during ER stress, regulation of individual genes needs to be determined experimentally. The opposing roles of LIP and LAP in the regulation of gene expression (23Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the induction of C/EBPβ expression during ER stress (15Chen C. Dudenhausen E.E. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27948-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the potential of LAP and LIP to form heterodimers with other bZIP transcription factors led us to undertake the studies in this report. We explored the regulation of LIP and LAP levels during ER stress and the physiological significance of C/EBPβ in the stress-response program. We found that LIP levels decrease during the first few hours of ER stress, followed by a large increase, whereas LAP levels showed a steady increase. The result was a decline and then a large increase in the LIP/LAP ratio. Both LIP and LAP were found to be short lived proteins that are degraded by the proteasome. Our results suggest that changes in the rates of synthesis and degradation are important for regulating LIP and LAP levels. We also show that LIP can inhibit the transcription of stress-response genes that are activated by the binding of ATF4 to an amino acid-response element (AARE). In support of this idea, the expression of these genes was altered in C/EBPβ–/– MEFs. In wild-type cells and in C/EBPβ–/– MEFs expressing LIP (but not LAP), expression increased early in the UPR and then declined, whereas the expression remained elevated in C/EBPβ–/– MEFs. In contrast, a subset of genes that also require AAREs for induction of transcription during ER stress were attenuated in the absence of C/EBPβ. The transcription factor CHOP has been implicated in the regulation of these genes (9Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 12Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Our data suggest differential regulation of AARE-mediated transcription during ER stress by C/EBPβ. The findings in this study are consistent with the notion that the LIP/LAP ratio is an important regulator of the stress response, and that the high levels of LIP during the late response correlate with attenuated expression of ATF4-regulated genes.

To induce ER stress, 8–10-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with Tu (1 μg/g body weight). After 24 h, livers, kidneys, and pancreata were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 250 mm sucrose) as described previously (31Yaman I.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were sonicated in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer/g of tissue and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 380 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1% deoxycholic acid, incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as total cell lysates. Nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (31Yaman I. Fernandez J. Sarkar B. Schneider R.J. Snider M.D. Nagy L.E. Hatzoglou M. J.

Total cell lysates (20 μg of protein) or nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies using standard procedures. Antibodies for the following proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: ATF4 (C-20, sc-200), BiP (H-129, sc-13968), C/EBPβ C terminus (C-19, sc-150), CHOP (B-3, sc-7351), HDAC1 (H-11, sc-8410), and XBP1 (M-186, sc-7160). Anti-FLAG antibodies (PRB-132P) were from Covance. Antihistone H3 antibodies (sc-9715) were from Cell Signaling. Anti-eIF2α-P antibodies (44–728G) were from BIOSOURCE. Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibodies (T9026) were from Sigma. Anti-eIF2α antibodies were prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals. Polysome Profiles and RNA Isolation—Control or Tg-treated C6 cells were incubated for the last 5 min of treatment with 100 μg/ml CHX. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were suspended and homogenized by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle in 500 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 200 units/ml RNase inhibitor, 100 μg/ml CHX, and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture/10 ml (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min; the supernatants were collected, and absorbances were measured. About 7 A260 units of the cytosolic extracts were layered over 10–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 19 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, fractions (∼1.2 ml each) were collected. RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and used to determine the distribution of ribosomal RNAs (by agarose gel electrophoresis) and mRNAs (by qRT-PCR). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—C6 cells were incubated for 1 h in l-Met-, l-Cys-deficient DMEM (Invitrogen catalog number 21013) containing 10% dialyzed FBS with or without 400 nm Tg. Cells were then incubated in Met-, Cys-deficient DMEM with 35S-Met and -Cys (100 μCi/ml Expre35S35S Protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without Tg for an additional hour. Cells were scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates (500 μg of protein) were incubated overnight with anti-C/EBPβ (2 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-150). Samples were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. DNA Affinity Pulldown—A biotinylated double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing two copies of the cat-1 AARE (5′-CGCGCGGCTGATGAAACCGGCTCGCGCGCGGCTGATGAAACCGGCTCG-3′) was used to isolate proteins from C6 cell nuclear extracts as described previously (32Chodosh L.A.

Extracts (500 μg of protein) were incubated streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C; the beads were removed, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) was added to the supernatants for 30 min, followed by 100 pmol of the biotinylated oligonucleotide in binding buffer (12 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 4 °C. Streptavidin magnetic particles were added, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and the particles isolated. The particles were washed twice in binding buffer and once with binding buffer supplemented with 40 mm KCl at room temperature. The isolated proteins were separated on 12% SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—First-strand cDNA samples were synthesized from RNA samples using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). The PCR primers used are listed in supplemental Table 1. Differential Regulation of the Transcriptional Activator LAP and Transcriptional Repressor LIP during ER Stress—Although C/EBPβ has been implicated in the transcriptional control of stress-response genes (14Chen C. Dudenhausen E. Chen H. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Chen C. Dudenhausen E.E. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27948-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), its role in the adaptive response of cells to ER stress is not clear. Because translation of the C/EBPβ mRNA produces two transcriptional activators, LAP1 and −2, and a transcriptional repressor, LIP (Fig. 1E), we first determined the levels of LAP and LIP in C6 cells treated with Tg for 0–24 h, which acts by depleting ER Ca2+ stores (6Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). As expected, Tg caused ER stress, as shown by the induction of key modulators of the stress response (1Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). These include the transcription factors ATF4, CHOP, and the spliced form of XBP1 in nuclear fractions (Fig. 1A), as well as the phosphorylated form of the translation initiation factor eIF2α in whole cell lysates (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the levels of histone deacetylase 1 and tubulin, which were used as loading controls for nuclear and whole cell fractions, respectively, were constant. Tg caused a small increase in nuclear LAP2 levels (Fig. 1A). In contrast, LIP levels decreased in nuclear extracts from 0 to 3 h, followed by an increase from 9 to 24 h, with the final level greatly exceeding that in untreated cells. The levels of LIP and LAP were also examined in whole cell lysates (Fig. 1B). Similar to nuclear fractions, LIP declined and then showed a large increase; in contrast, LAP levels increased continuously throughout the experiment. The LIP/LAP ratio has been proposed to be a critical modulator in the expression of C/EBPβ-regulated genes (33Zahnow C.A. Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 35Raught B. Liao W.S. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar). During ER stress, the LIP/LAP ratio in total cell lysates decreased by 90% in the early response (3–6 h) and then increased by 30-fold from the minimum (Fig. 1C). This finding suggests that modulation of LAP and LIP levels may be required for the adaptive response to ER stress. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with Tu, which causes ER stress by blocking N-glycosylation (not shown). We also examined the levels of C/EBPβ mRNA during Tg treatment by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1D). The levels rose by ∼4-fold after 3 h of treatment and remained elevated. This finding can explain the increased levels of both LIP and LAP in whole cell extracts but not the differential accumulation of these proteins during late ER stress (Fig. 1B). Because LIP and LAP are synthesized from the same mRNA, the changes in the relative levels of these proteins must be due to independent regulation of their synthesis and degradation. LIP is expressed by translation initiation at an in-frame AUG codon (AUG3) in the C/EBPβ ORF (Fig. 1E). To confirm that the LIP protein expressed during ER stress is the authentic p20 C/EBPβ isoform, we mutagenized AUG codons in an expression vector that encodes mouse C/EBPβ with a C-terminal FLAG epitope. These mutations preserve the C/EBPβ ORF. LAP, but not LIP, was expressed from the AUG3mut construct as seen in blots probed with anti-C/EBPβ and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1F), whereas both forms were expressed from the AUG4mut construct, demonstrating that C6 cells express authentic LIP that is translated from AUG3. These data exclude the possibility that the LIP isoform is a product of proteolysis in our cells, as suggested previously (27Baer M. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26582-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We next determined if nuclear C/EBPβ levels are regulated in mice treated with Tu, which is a rapid inducer of ER stress in vivo. Tuhas been shown to cause an acute ER stress response in the kidney (22Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Among the other tissues, pancreas and to a lesser extent liver are most susceptible to ER stress (36Scheuner D. Mierde D.V. Song B. Flamez D. Creemers J.W. Tsukamoto K. Ribick M. Schuit F.C. Kaufman R.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of C/EBPβ in the ER stress response, we compared the induction of stress-response genes in wild-type (WT) and C/EBPβ–/– mice at 24 h of treatment. This time of treatment has been associated with kidney damage (22Zinszner H. Kur"

Glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain show unusual sensitivity to external ions, resulting in an apparent requirement for sodium in order for glutamate to activate kainate receptors. Here, we solve the structure of the Na+-binding sites and determine the mechanism by which allosteric anions and cations regulate ligand-binding dimer stability, and hence the rate of desensitization and receptor availability for gating by glutamate. We establish a stoichiometry for binding of 2 Na+ to 1 Cl− and show that allosteric anions and cations bind at physically discrete sites with strong electric fields, that the binding sites are not saturated in CSF, and that the requirement of kainate receptors for Na+ occurs simply because other cations bind with lower affinity and have lower efficacy compared to Na+."
https://openalex.org/W2076777258,"Subcellular compartmentalization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) facilitates local protein phosphorylation. However, little is known about how PKA targeting to AKAPs is regulated in the intact cell. PKA binds to an amphipathic helical region of AKAPs via an N-terminal domain of the regulatory subunit. I<i>n vitro</i> studies showed that autophosphorylation of type II regulatory subunit (RII) can alter its affinity for AKAPs and the catalytic subunit (PKA<sub>cat</sub>). We now investigate whether phosphorylation of serine 96 on RII regulates PKA targeting to AKAPs, downstream substrate phosphorylation and calcium cycling in primary cultured cardiomyocytes. We demonstrated that, whereas there is basal phosphorylation of RII subunits, persistent maximal activation of PKA results in a phosphatase-dependent loss of RII phosphorylation. To investigate the functional effects of RII phosphorylation, we constructed adenoviral vectors incorporating mutants which mimic phosphorylated (RIIS96D), nonphosphorylated (RIIS96A) RII, or wild-type (WT) RII and performed adenoviral infection of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that more AKAP15/18 was pulled down by the phosphomimic, RIIS96D, than RIIS96A. Phosphorylation of phospholamban and ryanodine receptor was significantly increased in cells expressing RIIS96D <i>versus</i> RIIS96A. Expression of recombinant RII constructs showed significant effects on cytosolic calcium transients. We propose a model illustrating a central role of RII phosphorylation in the regulation of local PKA activity. We conclude that RII phosphorylation regulates PKA-dependent substrate phosphorylation and may have significant implications for modulation of cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2011929063,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) transduce external signals required for sensory processes, e.g., photoreception, olfaction, and taste. Nerve growth cone guidance by diffusible attractive and repulsive molecules is regulated by differential growth cone Ca2+ signaling. However, the Ca2+-conducting ion channels that transduce guidance molecule signals are largely unknown. We show that rod-type CNGC-like channels function in the repulsion of cultured Xenopus spinal neuron growth cones by Sema3A, which triggers the production of the cGMP that activates the Xenopus CNGA1 (xCNGA1) subunit-containing channels in interneurons. Downregulation of xCNGA1 or overexpression of a mutant xCNGA1 incapable of binding cGMP abolished CNG currents and converted growth cone repulsion to attraction in response to Sema3A. We also show that Ca2+ entry through xCNGCs is required to mediate the repulsive Sema3A signal. These studies extend our knowledge of the function of CNGCs by demonstrating their requirement for signal transduction in growth cone guidance."
https://openalex.org/W1982535074,"The presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mGluR7 modulates excitatory neurotransmission by regulating neurotransmitter release and plays a critical role in certain forms of synaptic plasticity. Although the dynamic regulation of mGluR7 surface expression governs a form of metaplasticity in the hippocampus, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGluR7 trafficking. We now show that mGluR7 surface expression is stabilized by both PKC phosphorylation and by receptor binding to the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1. Phosphorylation of mGluR7 on serine 862 (S862) inhibits CaM binding, thereby increasing mGluR7 surface expression and receptor binding to PICK1. Furthermore, in mice lacking PICK1, PKC-dependent increases in mGluR7 phosphorylation and surface expression are diminished, and mGluR7-dependent plasticity at mossy fiber-interneuron hippocampal synapses is impaired. These data support a model in which PICK1 binding and PKC phosphorylation act together to stabilize mGluR7 on the cell surface in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2021619782,"CXC and CC chemokines are involved in numerous biological processes, and their function in situ may be significantly influenced by heterodimer formation, as was recently reported, for example, for CXC chemokines CXCL4/PF4 and CXCL8/IL8 that interact to form heterodimers that modulate chemotactic and cell proliferation activities. Here we used molecular dynamics simulations to determine relative association free energies (overall average and per residue) for homo- and heterodimer pairs of CXC (CXCL4/PF4, CXCL8/IL8, CXCL1/Gro-α, and CXCL7/NAP-2) and CC (CCL5/RANTES, CCL2/MCP-1, and CCL8/MCP-2) chemokines. Even though structural homology among monomer folds of all CXC and CC chemokines permits heterodimer assembly, our calculated association free energies depend upon the particular pair of chemokines in terms of the net electrostatic and nonelectrostatic forces involved, as well as (for CC/CXC mixed chemokines) the selection of dimer type (CC or CXC). These relative free energies indicate that association of some pairs of chemokines is more favorable than others.

Chemokines are small (8-12 kDa) homologous proteins that are involved in many biological processes, ranging from chemotaxis (1Baggiolini M.

They are generally subdivided into four subfamilies based on relative positioning of the first two of four highly conserved cysteine residues: CXC, CC, C, and CX3C (6Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). In the largest chemokine subfamilies, CC and CXC, the first two cysteines are adjacent (CC motif) or separated by a single nonconserved amino acid (CXC motif), respectively. The C chemokines lack the first and third of the conserved cysteines, and the CX3C chemokines have three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues. The sequence identity between chemokines varies from less than 20% to over 90%. Nevertheless, chemokines from different subfamilies adopt essentially the same monomer folds. Each monomer has a flexible N-terminal domain, followed by an N-terminal loop, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet region, and a prominent C-terminal α-helix (7Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All chemokines oligomerize into dimers, and some also into tetramers (8Clark-Lewis I. Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J.H. Dewald B.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional folds of dimers are similar among members of a subfamily. However, despite having strikingly similar monomer folds, CXC and CC monomers associate differently (7Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

CXC and CC chemokine quarternary structure is determined primarily by which amino acid residues are present at the particular inter-subunit interface (7Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Therefore, monomers of different chemokines may be mutually substitutable if the arrangement of individual residues at a given monomer-monomer interface in a heterodimer is energetically and sterically more favorable than that in either homodimer. Indeed, we showed recently, using NMR and surface plasmon resonance, that at least three members of the CXC family, CXCL4, its N-terminal chimera PF4M2 (15Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Milius R.

Moreover, it has been suggested that heterodimerization between members of CXC and CC subfamilies can also occur as follows: chemokine CXCL4 and CC chemokine CCL5/RANTES (19von Hundelshausen P.

The functional result is that heterodimerization dramatically modulates the biological activities of these chemokines. For example, the presence of angiogenic CXCL8 in solution with anti-angiogenic CXCL4 increases the anti-proliferative activity of CXCL4 against endothelial cells (16Nesmelova I.V. Sham Y.

Here we used the molecular mechanics and Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) approach to calculate binding free energies (21Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T.

Free energy calculations from MD simulations have been used in various biological applications (24Gilson M.K. Given J.A. Bush B.L. McCammon J.A. Biophys.

J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 891-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The MM-PBSA approach has emerged recently as a rapid computational approach that is broadly applicable to molecular systems that differ substantially in structure and/or are of comparable size, such as protein-protein complexes (21Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y. Wang W. Donini O. Cieplak P. Srinivasan J. Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Acc. Chem.

Here we investigated formation of chemokine complexes by evaluating absolute binding free energies and comparing them to experimentally determined values. Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for homodimers (CXCL8, CXCL4, CXCL1, CXCL7, CCL5, CCL2, and CCL8), heterodimers (CXCL4/CXCL8, PF4M2/CXCL8, CXCL4/CXCL1, CXCL4/CXCL7, CXCL8/CXCL1, CXCL8/CXCL7, and CXCL1/CXCL7; two types of CCL2/CCL5, CCL2/CCL8, CCL2/CXCL8, CCL5/CXCL8, CCL2/CXCL4, and CCL5/CXCL4; and two complexes with CCL5 mutants, CCL5(E26A)/CXCL4 and CCL5(44AANA47)/CXCL4) and homotetramers of CXCL4 and PF4M2. Starting protein structures for molecular dynamics simulations were built based on x-ray or NMR structures taken from the Protein Data Bank (30Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar) without change. The corresponding Protein Data Bank entries were 1RHP, 1PFM, 1IL8, 1MSG, 1NAP, 1RTO, 1DOM, and 1ESR. The tetramer of CXCL4 is formed as a sandwich of dimers (AB and CD). Therefore, the homodimer of CXCL4 for the simulation was obtained by deleting one of the dimers (CD) from x-ray-derived tetramer. Heterodimers of CXCL4/CXCL8 (or other CXC chemokines) were formed by replacing one of the monomer subunits from an AB-type dimer of native CXCL4 with a monomer subunit from CXCL8 after superimposing the CXCL4 and CXCL8 homodimer. For CXCL4/CXCL8, a heterodimer of AC-type (adjacent monomers from dimers forming a sandwich) was also built by replacing C subunit of CXCL4 with a monomer subunit from CXCL8. For CCL2/CXCL8 and CCL5/CXCL8, two types of heterodimers were built, CXC-type (using CXCL8 homodimer as a template) and CC-type (using CC chemokine partner homodimers as a template). Fig. 1 shows the three-dimensional structures of CXCL4 tetramer, CXC (or AB)-type and AC-type dimers of CXCL4 derived from tetramer, and CC-type dimer exemplified by CCL2. All initial structures were built using the Insight II program (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego). Hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structure using HBUILD module of the CHARMM program (31Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The ionization state of the system was set at pH 5.0, the pH value used in our experimental studies (16Nesmelova I.V. Sham Y. Dudek A.Z. van Eijk L.I. Wu G. Slungaard A. Mortari F. Griffioen A.W. Mayo K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4948-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At this pH, the net charge on monomers was +9 for CXCL4, +6 for CXCL8, +8 for CXCL1, +7 for CXCL7, +6 for CCL5, +7 for CCL2, and +5 for CCL8. Amino acid sequences of these chemokines are shown in Fig. 1. Although native CXCL4 and CXCL7 have 70 amino acid residues, coordinates for the first 6 residues in CXCL4 and first 4 residues in CXCL7 are not provided in the PDB files. Therefore, truncated CXCL7 has been used in this study, and absent N-terminal residues in CXCL4, which are important in forming CC-type heterodimers, have been added based on homology modeling using PF4M2. MD simulations were performed using the c29b2 version of CHARMM (31Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). After an initial equilibration of 0.005 ns, we performed a 1-ns trajectory simulation for each hetero- and homodimer. The time step in the simulations was 1 fs. Coordinates were saved at 1-ps time intervals, resulting in a total of 1000 configurations for analysis. All complexes were simulated in boxes of 74 × 63 × 63 Å3 or 70 × 65 × 65 Å3 with explicit solvent molecules described by the TIP3P model, along with periodic boundary conditions. To make the total charge of the box 0, chloride ions were added to neutralize the system. Simulations were carried out using the CHARMM 22 all-hydrogen force field (32MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher III, W.E.

Chem. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11819) Google Scholar) with a dielectric constant of 1. 2000 steps of steepest descent minimization, followed by gradual heating to 300 K, and 5000 steps of system equilibration preceded each simulation run. The temperature during runs was maintained at 300 K. van der Waals (vdW) interactions were truncated at 13 Å using a shifted smoothing function, whereas electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald method (33Darden T.A. York D.M. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar). The SHAKE method was employed to constrain bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms (34Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C J. Comp. Physics. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17193) Google Scholar). Free Energy Calculations—The MM-PBSA method combines an explicit molecular mechanical (MM) model for the solute with a continuum Poisson-Boltzmann method for the solvation free energy. In this method, a molecular dynamics simulation is initially performed on a protein complex solvated explicitly using periodic boundary conditions. Then the solvent is removed, and the binding free energy, ΔG, is calculated for each time increment according to Equation 1,ΔG=ΔEMM+ΔGPBSA-TΔS(Eq. 1) where ΔEMM is the change in molecular mechanical energy upon binding; ΔGPBSA is the change in solvation energy, and TΔS is the entropic contribution to binding. An estimate of the vibrational entropic contribution to the binding energy can be done by using normal mode (NM) analysis (35Case D.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 285-290Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Strictly speaking, when oligomerization is considered, separate trajectories for each monomer and oligomer should be acquired and analyzed. However, we assumed that the conformation of the monomer subunit in both free and bound states is the same and estimated ΔG from snapshots over the trajectory of the complex only. Therefore, energetic contributions from bonds, angles, and torsion angles are essentially not considered. Chemokine dimerization or tetramerization was described by the following set of equilibria shown in Equation 2,M+M→KDDD+D→KTT(Eq. 2) M, D, and T indicate monomer, dimer (homo- or hetero-), and tetramer (CXCL4 only) states, respectively. The following thermodynamic cycle (Equation 3) was used to evaluate the free energy of dimer or tetramer formation in water, ΔGwb,(Eq. 3) Here ΔGgb is the free energy of dimer or tetramer formation in the gas phase. ΔGsM1, ΔGsM2, and ΔGsC are the free energies of solvation for molecule 1 (M or D), molecule 2 (M or D), and for the complex (D or T), respectively. ΔGwb was determined as the sum shown in Equation 4,ΔGwb=ΔGgb+ΔGsC-ΔGsM1-ΔGsM2(Eq. 4) All energy calculations were performed using the MM-PBSA approach (21Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y. Wang W. Donini O. Cieplak P. Srinivasan J. Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Acc. Chem.

Dyn. 1998; 16: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Wang W. Kollman P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 567-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and the CHARMM program (31Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). Comparisons were then made between homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers. In the MM-PBSA method, ΔGgb is calculated from molecular mechanics interaction energies shown in Equation 5,ΔGgb=ΔGgel+ΔGgvdW(Eq. 5) Here ΔGgel is the electrostatic free energy, and ΔGgvdW is the vdW interaction free energy between two molecules in the gas phase. Only complexes, and not monomers, were simulated; therefore, only nonbonded contributions to the free energy have been considered. The solvation free energy was determined as the sum of electrostatic (ΔGelg) and non-electrostatic (ΔGnon-elg), terms as indicated in Equation 6,ΔGs=ΔGsel+ΔGsnonel(Eq. 6) The electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy, ΔGel, was calculated using the finite difference Poisson-Boltzman method with the PBEQ module in CHARMM (31Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). Both ΔGsel and ΔGgel were calculated simultaneously in two steps. For the initial Poisson-Boltzmann calculation, the grid size was set to 1.0 Å. For the second step, the grid size was decreased to 0.45 Å, and the box was filled 85%. The dielectric constant for the interior of protein is usually considered to be in the range from 2 to 4. For this study it was set to 2, and the dielectric constant of water was set to 80. The non-electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy includes vdW interactions between solute and solvent, ΔGvdW, and is the free energy required to create the solute cavity in the solvent, ΔGcav. The vdW and cavity terms were represented by a linear function of the total solvent-accessible surface area shown in Equation 7,ΔGsnonel=ΔGvdw+ΔGcav=γ×SASA+b(Eq. 7) where γ = 0.00542 kcal/(mol·Å2), and b = 0.92 kcal/mol (36Sitkoff D. Sharp K.A. Honig B. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 1978-1988Crossref Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). For the solvent-accessible surface area calculation, the radius of the probe sphere was set to 1.4 Å. Contributions to the binding free energy per residue were calculated as the difference in energy of a given residue in the monomer from that in the dimer (dimerization) or in the dimer and in the tetramer (tetramerization). Electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions were considered separately, using the approach described above. Vibrational entropy was estimated from normal mode analysis using VIBRAN module of CHARMM program (31Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The estimation was based on 40 snapshots taken from the last 800 ps of the trajectory (500 ps for tetramers) with an even interval. CXC Heterodimers of CXCL4 and CXCL8—To validate our MD-based approach, we first investigated CXC chemokines CXCL4 and CXCL8, because heterodimerization between them has been demonstrated experimentally, and structural evidence as to how they associate as heterodimers is available (16Nesmelova I.V. Sham Y. Dudek A.Z. van Eijk L.I. Wu G. Slungaard A. Mortari F. Griffioen A.W. Mayo K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4948-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Three observations from these calculations on CXCL4 and CXCL8 support our approach as follows: 1) the time dependence of root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) for backbone heavy atoms; 2) time-averaged fluctuations per residue; and 3) expected free energy variations of residues at the homo- and heterodimer interfaces. Fig. 2A illustrates the time dependence of r.m.s.d. for backbone heavy atoms (averaged) of CXCL4 subunit in homodimer (black) and heterodimer with CXCL8 (green). Because the first six N-terminal residues (and last four C-terminal residues) in each dimer deviated substantially from their initial positions compared with other residues during MD simulations, these more flexible residues were not included in the r.m.s.d. values reported. Initial r.m.s.d. values for all structures (Fig. 2A) leveled out at about 200-300 ps (500 ps for CXCL4 tetramer, data not shown), and then fluctuated within less than 0.5 Å over the remainder of the simulation. The relative constancy of r.m.s.d. values over the last 700-800 ps of the trajectory suggests formation of stable homo- and heterodimers. Structural stability is further supported by viewing time-averaged fluctuations per residue, as plotted in Fig. 2B for CXCL4 and CXCL8. Here the amplitude of fluctuations correlates well with elements in the folded structures of these CXC chemokines. For example, residues experiencing the largest fluctuations are located within the more flexible N and C termini and the loops, whereas residues within the less flexible, well structured regions (three-stranded β-sheet and C-terminal α-helix) show considerably smaller r.m.s.d. values (less than 1 Å) (37Grasberger B.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Ye J. Mayer K.L. Stone M.J. J. Biomol.

Model. 2001; 19: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This correlation supports the idea that our calculations reflect actual structural effects. Moreover, time-averaged fluctuations reflect essentially the same trends as observed experimentally (11Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 37Grasberger B.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol.

Model. 2001; 19: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, fluctuational amplitudes are essentially the same for homodimers and heterodimers, further supporting thermodynamic stability of the CXCL4/CXCL8 heterodimer. Calculated free energies are given in Table 1, and electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to these free energies are plotted per residue in Fig. 3, e.g. for CXCL4 and CXCL8 homodimers and heterodimers. For comparison, experimentally determined free energies are provided in Table 2. Although these calculated free energies are comparable with those determined using MM-PBSA approach with other proteins (28Xu Y. Wang R. Proteins. 2006; 64: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Gohlke H. Kiel C. Case D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 891-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), it is readily apparent that the calculated energies far exceed those determined experimentally. Clearly this discrepancy lies in the limits of the calculated energies, as we will discuss later under “Discussion.” Nevertheless, trends in these energies can be compared. In this regard, although hydrophobic interactions contribute the most and about equally to the energetics of CXCL4 and CXCL8 homodimer formation, electrostatic interactions contribute more to the energetics of homodimer formation for CXCL8 than for CXCL4. In fact, homodimerization of CXCL4 is electrostatically unfavorable, with a total electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy of +5.54 kcal/mol for the homodimer and +12.3 kcal/mol for the homotetramer (Table 1).TABLE 1Calculated binding free energiesΔGg+selΔGg+snonelNMΔGcalcΔGgvdWΔGsnonelHomodimers (tetramers where noted) CXCCXCL4/PF45.54−31.6−4.149.30−20.9PF4M24.22−30.4−4.2710.7−19.8CXCL4/PF4 (tetramer)12.3−35.5−9.489.22−23.5PF4M2 (tetramer)21.9−42.7−11.310.7−21.4CXCL8/IL8−16.5−25.3−3.338.81−36.3CXCL1/Gro-α3.47−32.3−4.248.84−24.2CXCL7/NAP-21.05−31.1−4.2711.7−22.7CCCCL2/MCP-12.18−39.8−4.3610.4−31.5CCL5/RANTES−4.07−35.8−4.579.57−34.9CCL8/MCP-2−7.16−40.4−5.279.18−43.7Heterodimers, CXCCXCL4/CXCL8−1.78−32.7−4.148"
https://openalex.org/W2004867530,"Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces."

Among its other functions, TNFα perturbs muscle regeneration by preventing satellite cell differentiation. In the present study, the role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a mediator of TNFα, was investigated in differentiating myoblast cell lines. Addition of TNFα to C2 myoblasts induced immediate and delayed phases of JNK activity. The delayed phase is associated with myoblast proliferation. Inhibition of JNK activity prevented proliferation and restored differentiation to TNFα-treated myoblasts. Studies with cell lines expressing MyoD:ER chimera and lacking JNK1 or JNK2 genes indicate that JNK1 activity mediates the effects of TNFα on myoblast proliferation and differentiation. TNFα does not induce proliferation or inhibit differentiation of JNK1-null myoblasts. However, differentiation of JNK1-null myoblasts is inhibited when they are grown in conditioned medium derived from cell lines affected by TNFα. We investigated the induced synthesis of several candidate growth factors and cytokines following treatment with TNFα. Expression of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was induced by TNFα in wild-type and JNK2-null myoblasts. However, LIF expression was not induced by TNFα in JNK1-null myoblasts. Addition of LIF to the growth medium of JNK1-null myoblasts prevented their differentiation. Moreover, LIF-neutralizing antibodies added to the medium of C2 myoblasts prevented inhibition of differentiation mediated by TNFα.

Massive loss of skeletal muscle occurs in a variety of disorders: chronic catabolic conditions such as AIDS, sepsis, and cancer and genetic disorders, collectively known as muscular dystrophies. In all cases of muscle wasting, including chronic diseases or genetic disorders, it is believed that inflammation contributes to the process (1Tidball J.G. Wehling-Henricks M. Curr. Opin.

Thus, muscle loss is most probably a result of the perturbed balance between muscle degeneration and regeneration caused by proinflammatory cytokines. tumor necrosis factor α c-Jun N-terminal kinase leukemia inhibitory factor estrogen receptor nuclear factor κB myosin heavy chain bromodeoxyuridine differentiation medium phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting interleukin 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole reverse transcriptase. tumor necrosis factor α c-Jun N-terminal kinase leukemia inhibitory factor estrogen receptor nuclear factor κB myosin heavy chain bromodeoxyuridine differentiation medium phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting interleukin 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole reverse transcriptase. Muscle regeneration occurs by the expansion and differentiation of satellite cells that lie beneath the basal lamina (6Hawke T.J. Garry D.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 534-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Normally these cells are quiescent (resting), expressing the paired box transcription factor Pax7, but not the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). In response to trauma, such as injury, these cells are activated, first by initiating the expression of MyoD and then by proliferation. Activation of satellite cells is promoted by the release of growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and cytokines like IL-6 from the injured tissue and infiltrating macrophages. Finally, the expression of myogenin is induced, and cells differentiate and fuse with preexisting myofibers (reviewed in Ref. 7Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Perturbation of muscle regeneration at any stage: activation, proliferation, or differentiation, causes fatal loss of muscle tissue. TNFα perturbs muscle regeneration in chronic and genetic disorders, though the mechanism is still obscure (8Coletti D. Moresi V. Adamo S. Molinaro M. Sassoon D. Genesis. 2005; 43: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TNFα affects several intracellular signaling pathways leading to the activation of NFκB, caspase 8, and stress-induced pathways like c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK (9Guttridge D.C. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2004; 7: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Whereas the involvement of NFκB and caspases in muscle wasting has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the role of stress pathways. Several studies have indicated that NFκB activity inhibits muscle differentiation by reducing the levels of the MyoD protein and activating the expression of cyclin D1 (10Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Faseb J. 2001; 15: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The role of JNK in the effect of TNFα on myogenesis has been less investigated. A recent study suggested that activation of JNK by TNFα blocks IGF-1 signaling necessary for the differentiation of myoblasts (13Strle K. Broussard S.R. McCusker R.H. Shen W.H. LeCleir J.M. Johnson R.W. Freund G.G. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 4363-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yet, the mechanism has not been fully explored; is JNK involved in myoblast proliferation, or alternatively is JNK involved in inhibition of myoblast differentiation but not in proliferation? Which isoforms of JNK participate in these processes? How does JNK affect these processes? In the present work we approached these questions. We have shown that TNFα induces proliferation via JNK and indirectly prevents differentiation of myoblasts. The JNK1 isoform is involved in these processes. Interestingly, JNK1 mediates the expression of LIF, which prevents the differentiation process independently of proliferation. Therefore, our results indicate that TNFα affects myoblast proliferation directly via JNK1 and myoblast differentiation indirectly through the autocrine effect of LIF. Materials—SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) was purchased from BIOMOL, dissolved in DMSO, and added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 20 μm. TNFα was purchased from Cytolabs, was dissolved in water, and added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. LIF was purchased from Calbiochem and was added to cell culture to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in PBS, and added to culture medium to a final concentration of 100 μm. Thymidine was added to cell medium at a concentration of 2 mm. Neutralizing LIF antibody was from Chemicon and was added at 1 μg/ml. Cell Culture—C2 cells were a gift from Dr. David Yaffe (14Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% calf serum (HyClone), penicillin, and streptomycin (growth medium, GM). To induce differentiation, we used Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg of insulin per ml and 10 μg of transferrin per ml (differentiation medium, DM). Fibroblasts from different mice strains (wild type, JNK1-/-, JNK2-/-, c-Jun-/-, and IKKβ-/-) were infected with a retrovirus encoding the MyoD protein and the hormone binding domain of estrogen receptor (pBABE puro MyoD:ER) (15Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Myoblast cell lines were isolated following selection with puromycin (3 μg/ml). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 15% calf serum (GM). Addition of 10-7 m β-estradiol to DM induced translocation of the cytoplasmic chimera protein into the nucleus and initiation of the myogenic program (supplemental Fig. S1). In some experiments, conditioned media from certain cell lines (wild-type, JNK1-/-, and JNK2-/- MyoD:ER) were used to replace the medium of JNK1-/- MyoD:ER cells grown in parallel. The medium was replaced every 6 h with fresh conditioned medium of growing cells. Western Analysis—Cells were lysed, whole cell extracts were collected, and equal amounts of extracted proteins (40 μg) were loaded and separated over 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% w/v nonfat dry milk) and then in the same buffer with the primary and secondary antibodies. Between the second and third incubations, membranes were washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 and 1× TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Immunoblotting was conducted with the following antibodies: anti-c-Jun and anti-phospho-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:1000, anti-myogenin, F5D (1:1000) and anti-MyHC, MF20 (1:1000), anti-JNK and anti-phospho-JNK, anti-α-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich) 1:10,000. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit of Pierce. Immunohistochemical Staining—Cells were fixed and immunostained. The primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-MyHC (MF-20), anti-pc-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-phospho-histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-BrdU. Cells were exposed to secondary antibody and DAPI. The immunochemically stained cells were viewed at ×200 or ×650 magnification under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, model BX50) and photographed with a digital camera. Cell Cycle Analysis—BrdU was added to cell medium to a final concentration of 10 μm. After 3 h, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100. Following a PBS wash, the cells were incubated in 2 n HCL solution for 1 h. The solution was neutralized by washing the cells with 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 8.5). The cells were incubated for 90 min with 6 mg/ml anti-BrdU antibody (BMC9318, Roche Applied Science) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were exposed to a secondary antibody and DAPI and finally viewed at ×200 magnification under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, model BX50). Cells that were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol and treated with 2 mg/ml of RNase A (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at 37 °C. Ten minutes before analysis, propidium iodide (PI) was added at 100 μg/μl. DNA content was analyzed by using FACS and ModFit software (Becton Dickinson). RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase PCR)—After removal of the culture medium, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Total RNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit, TRI REAGENT™ (MRC). The procedure was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT reactions were performed following DNaseI treatment, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ammonium acetate precipitation. RNA was incubated with 1 μl of a random hexamer (0.1 mg/ml), 4 min at 65 °C. The RT reaction mixture was added including pairs of primers, which were incubated for 45 min at 42 °C. The following pairs of primers were used: Basic FGF: F, 5′-AAC TAC AAC TCC AAG CAG AAG AGA GA-3′;R, 5′-TTA AGA TCA GCT CTT AGC AGA CAT-3′; HGF: F, 5′-CCA TGA ATT TGA CCT CTA TG-3′; R, 5′-ACT GAG GAA TGT CAC AGA-3′; IGF-1: F, 5′-AAG GAG AAG GGA TTC CTA TCT G-3′; R, 5′-TAT TTA GCT GCC TTT CCA GGT C-3′; PDGF-A: F, 5′-GCC CCT GCC CAT TCG GAG GAA GA-3′; R, 5′-GGC CAC CTT GAC GCT GCG GTG G-3′; IL-6: F, 5′-TTC CTC TCT GCA AGA GAC T-3′; R, 5′-TGT ATC TCT CTG AAG GAC T-3′; LIF: F, 5′-CCC ATA ATG AAG GTC TTG GC-3′; R, 5′-CTC CTC TCT AGA AGG CCT G-3′; GAPDH: F, 5′-ACA TCA TCC CTG CAT CC-3′; R, 5′-CTC CTT GGA GGC CAT GT-3′. TNFα Induces Two Phases of JNK Activity Necessary to Inhibit Myoblast Differentiation—TNFα was added to C2 cells during early differentiation stages, and JNK activity was measured by analyzing the phosphorylation state of c-Jun (Ser-63,73) (Fig. 1A). Two phases of c-Jun phosphorylation following the addition of TNFα were observed; an immediate phase at 30–120 min and a late phase at 24 h (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with an antibody to phospho-JNK, indicating that JNK is involved in c-Jun phosphorylation following TNFα treatment (Fig. 1A). Next, the expression of myogenic markers was analyzed (Fig. 1B). Addition of TNFα to DM reduced late expression of myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) (24–48 h in DM). Because TNFα inhibits the expression of myogenic markers and myoblast differentiation (16Miller S.C. Ito H. Blau H.M. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we asked whether JNK was involved in the process. TNFα was added to C2 cells during early differentiation stages, and differentiation was assessed 48 h later by analyzing myotubes formation (Fig. 1C). Differentiation was significantly prevented when TNFα was included in the medium. The addition of a pharmacological inhibitor of JNK, SP600125, at a concentration preventing phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 1C, lower panel) allowed the formation of myotubes in the presence of TNFα (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Partial rescue of differentiation in the presence of JNK inhibitor was also suggested by the expression of the early differentiation marker, myogenin and the late marker, MyHC (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that JNK is involved in TNF-mediated inhibition of myoblast differentiation. JNK1 but Not JNK2 Is Involved in Mediating the Effects of TNFα on Myoblasts—To further investigate the inhibitory role of JNK in myogenesis downstream of TNFα and to identify the JNK isoforms involved, myogenic lines were derived from JNK1- and JNK2-null fibroblasts (17Sabapathy K. Hochedlinger K. Nam S.Y. Bauer A. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding MyoD-estrogen receptor chimera protein were stably integrated into wild-type, JNK1-, and JNK2-null fibroblasts (3T3) derived from knock-out mice. The inclusion of β-estradiol in the growth medium induces the translocation of the chimera protein (MyoD:ER) into the nucleus, where MyoD initiates the muscle program. The formation of myotubes in the three cell lines indicates that they acquired the myogenic phenotype (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Proliferation of JNK1-deficient myoblasts was significantly slower than the other two cell lines (17Sabapathy K. Hochedlinger K. Nam S.Y. Bauer A. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This cell line was also slower than the others in its differentiation rate (not shown). Interestingly, TNFα significantly inhibited differentiation of wild type as well as of JNK2-null cells, but did not affect JNK1-null cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The expression of myogenin and MyHC proteins analyzed by Western blotting indicated the same; the levels of these proteins were not affected following TNFα treatment in JNK1-null cells, whereas they were significantly reduced in wild-type and JNK2-null cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, this effect of TNFα on the expression of myogenic markers was observed late (48 h in DM) rather than early (24 h in DM) (Fig. 2B). Similarly, C2 myoblasts expressing shRNA directed to JNK1 partially restored MyHC expression to TNFα-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S2). The results indicate that JNK1 but not JNK2 is involved in inhibition of differentiation by TNFα. Next, we examined JNK kinase activity toward c-Jun following TNFα treatment of the three cell lines. Addition of TNFα to the wild-type cell line (3T3 MyoD:ER) induced two phases of c-Jun phosphorylation; the first at 30 min and the second at 24 h (Fig. 2C), a pattern similar to that observed in C2 myoblasts (see Fig. 1A). TNFα induced a much weaker phosphorylation of c-Jun in JNK1-/- myoblasts relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 2C). Phosphorylation of c-Jun was not detectable 24 h following the addition of TNFα to JNK1-/- myoblasts like in wild-type myoblasts. Addition of TNFα to JNK2-null cells induced a significant and sustained c-Jun phosphorylation that only disappeared later than 24 h (Fig. 2C). These results imply the involvement of JNK1 in the phosphorylation of c-Jun following TNFα. The correlation between sustained and late phosphorylation of c-Jun and inhibition of myogenesis by TNFα indicates that the c-Jun protein itself may participate in a pathway downstream of TNFα-inhibiting myogenesis. Therefore, we generated myoblasts from c-Jun-/- fibroblasts by expressing the MyoD:ER chimera protein. Similar to the other cell lines, the formation of myotubes indicated that these fibroblasts also acquired the myogenic phenotype, though their growth and differentiation rates were significantly slower than wild-type myoblasts (not shown). Interestingly, TNF treatment of these cells, did not reduce but rather induced expression of differentiation markers relative to control cells (Fig. 2D). Therefore, TNFα may have stimulated differentiation of this cell line in contrast to its inhibitory effect on wild-type and JNK2-null cells. Overall, TNFα did not inhibit differentiation of JNK1 and c-Jun-deficient myoblasts, indicating that these proteins mediate inhibition of differentiation by TNFα. TNFα Induces a Wave of Myoblast Proliferation That Is Dependent on JNK1 and c-Jun Activities—The resistance of JNK1- and c-Jun-null cells to the inhibition of myoblast differentiation by TNFα was further investigated. JNK1- and c-Jun-null fibroblasts share certain defects in cell cycle, significantly reducing their proliferation rates (17Sabapathy K. Hochedlinger K. Nam S.Y. Bauer A. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 18Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that TNFα induces proliferation of wild-type myoblasts and not of JNK1- and c-Jun-deficient myoblasts in a way that would explain its distinct effects on differentiation. We analyzed the percentage of C2 cells in S phase by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 3A). Twelve percent of C2 cells were in S phase following 24 h of growth in differentiation medium (DM; see “Experimental Procedures”). The number of C2 myoblasts in S phase was increased to 37% following treatment with TNFα. The percentage of cells in S phase was decreased to 12% if the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was added to TNFα-treated myoblasts (Fig. 3A). Hence, TNFα induced proliferation of differentiating C2 cells, which was likely mediated by JNK. We further analyzed the percentage of cells in S phase following the addition of TNFα to different MyoD:ER cell lines (Fig. 3B). The addition of TNFα to wild-type and JNK2-null cells significantly increased the number of cells in S phase after 24 h in DM relative to cells not treated with TNFα (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In contrast, TNFα did not increase the percentage of JNK1- or c-Jun-null cells in S phase after 24 h in DM (Fig. 3B, lower panel). FACS analysis of the different cell lines further substantiated the notion that TNFα did not induce proliferation of JNK1- and c-Jun-null cells, whereas it induced significant proliferation of wild-type and JNK2-null cells (Fig. 3C). This is suggested by the proportion of cells in S and G2/M stages relative to cells in G1 stage of the cell cycle (Fig. 3C, left panel). In conclusion, TNFα induces the proliferation of myoblasts in a JNK1 and c-Jun-dependent manner. The apparent correlation between proliferating myoblasts and c-Jun phosphorylation occurring 24 h following TNFα treatment may indicate that phosphorylated c-Jun was associated with proliferating cells. To further investigate this possibility, wild-type MyoD:ER myoblasts were grown for 24 h following their treatment with TNFα and were immunostained using anti-phospho-c-Jun, and anti-phospho-histone H3 (Fig. 3D). Phosphorylated histone H3 marks cells in mitosis. Interestingly, phospho-c-Jun staining was observed only in cells expressing phospho-histone H3 (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the second peak of c-Jun phosphorylation following TNFα treatment likely represents mitotic myoblasts. Interestingly, phospho-c-Jun appears to be excluded from DNA and is concentrated in what appears as centromeres of mitotic cells. TNFα Inhibits Myoblast Differentiation Indirectly—The overt inhibition of differentiation by TNFα (see Figs. 1 and 3) could not be explained merely by the proliferating myoblasts, because not all myoblasts entered the cell cycle (see Fig. 3). Therefore, we hypothesized that the myoblasts that reentered the cell cycle could prevent differentiation of the remaining population of resting myoblasts. To investigate this possibility, we added Ara-C to differentiating cells treated with TNFα. Ara-C is an analogue of cytosine used in chemotherapy, which upon incorporation to newly synthesized DNA kills cells in the S phase. The addition of TNFα to differentiation medium almost abolished the formation of myotubes (Fig. 4A, left panel). However, when proliferating cells were eliminated by Ara-C treatment, most of the remaining cells formed myotubes despite the presence of TNFα. Similarly, Ara-C treatment restored the expression of myogenic markers like myogenin and MyHC inhibited by addition of TNFα to differentiating myoblasts (Fig. 4A, right panel). A different approach was used to arrest cell cycle at the G1 stage; thymidine was added to medium of myoblasts treated with TNFα. Thymidine block allowed for myoblast differentiation in the presence of a TNFα concentration normally preventing differentiation (supplemental Fig. S3). The above results suggest that cell cycle arrest or removal of proliferating cells prevents the inhibitory effect of TNFα, indicating that TNFα may not interfere directly with the differentiation of non-replicating myocytes. Consequently, we speculated that cells forced into the cell cycle by TNFα secrete growth factors/cytokines into the culture medium preventing the differentiation of the remaining myoblasts. To further investigate this possibility, we analyzed the differentiation of JNK1-/- myoblasts grown in conditioned medium isolated from either JNK1-/-, JNK2-/-, or wild-type myoblasts grown in the absence or presence of TNFα (Fig. 4B). Conditioned medium from JNK1-/- cells grown without or with TNFα did not affect formation of myotubes (left panel) and muscle gene expression (right panel) of JNK1-/- cells. However, conditioned medium originated from JNK2-/- or wild-type cells treated with TNFα completely abolished muscle differentiation of JNK1-/- cells. These results clearly indicate that wild-type and JNK2-/- cells treated with TNFα, but not JNK1-/- cells secreted factor(s) into the growth medium that prevented the differentiation of JNK1-/- cells. Myoblasts Express the Proinflammatory Cytokines IL-6 and LIF in Response to TNFα—Assuming that TNFα induced the secretion of growth factors or cytokines into the medium that inhibited the differentiation of myoblasts, we screened for the expression of certain growth factors and cytokines. The selected factors all involved cell proliferation, stemness, and antagonism of differentiation. C2 cells were treated with TNFα, and 24 h later the expression of certain growth factors and cytokines was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5A). The expression of some growth factors, known to inhibit myoblast differentiation, like bFGF, HGF, and PDGF was not affected by TNFα treatment. The expression of IGF-1, functioning both on proliferating as well as differentiating myoblasts, was down-regulated following TNFα treatment (Fig. 5A). The expression of two cytokines, IL-6 and LIF was substantially induced following TNFα treatment. We further analyzed the expression profile of these two cytokines in C2 cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 5B). Transcripts of IL-6 and LIF were identified in two peaks following the addition of TNFα to C2 cells; the first around 30 min to 2 h and the second around 24 h. This pattern is similar though not identical to that of c-Jun phosphorylation following the addition of TNFα to C2 cells (see Fig. 1A), suggesting that IL-6 and LIF expression may be mediated by JNK activity. The involvement of JNK1 in the expression of IL-6 and LIF was investigated using the chimera MyoD:ER-expressing cell lines. Addition of TNFα to wild-type and to JNK2-/- myoblasts induced two phases of IL-6 and LIF expression, after 2 and after 24 h (Fig. 5C). In contrast, TNFα induced sustained expression of IL-6, but no expression of LIF in JNK1-/- myoblasts (Fig. 5C). This result indicates that LIF but not IL-6 expression is dependent on JNK1 activity. Because TNFα stimulates NFκB activity, it was important to find out whether NFκB was also involved in the expression of LIF. For analyzing NFκB activation following TNFα treatments in the different cell lines, the cellular localization of p65, part of the NFκB complex, was investigated (supplemental Fig. S4). P65 was translocated from the cytoplasm to cell nuclei following the addition of TNFα to wild-type MyoD:ER myoblasts, indicating that NFκB was activated. Likewise, TNFα also induced the translocation of p65 into the nuclei of the other cell lines including JNK1-null myoblasts (supplemental Fig. S4). Therefore, it appears that NFκB activity is induced by TNFα in JNK1-/- myoblasts, which is not sufficient to induce the expression of LIF (see Fig. 5C). In another experiment, a myogenic cell line expressing MyoD:ER was derived from fibroblast cells originated from IKKβ-null mouse and therefore devoid of NFκB activity (19Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Massive apoptosis of these myoblasts occurred 48 h after the addition of TNFα to these cells (not shown). Still, TNFα induced a constitutive expression of LIF in the absence of NFκB activity (supplemental Fig. S5A). The constitutive expression of LIF correlated well with constitutive activit"

PKCδ is conventionally viewed as a lipid-dependent enzyme that is anchored to membranes in close proximity to target substrates through interactions with lipid cofactors. However, there is recent evidence that PKCδ also is dynamically regulated through activation loop (Thr505) phosphorylation (3Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J.

In the case of cPKCs, activation loop phosphorylations are mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and are essential to generate a catalytically competent enzyme. Although newly synthesized PKCδ also undergoes maturational phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1-dependent Thr505 phosphorylation, PKCδ differs from other PKC isoforms in that 1) PKCδ is a catalytically active enzyme even without Thr505 phosphorylation and 2) PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is dynamically regulated through an autocatalytic mechanism (4Rybin V.O.

Although there are hints that Thr505 phosphorylation might contribute to the control of PKCδ enzymology, a PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation mechanism that regulates the actions of PKCδ toward a physiologically relevant substrate in a differentiated cell has never been reported. protein kinase C cardiac troponin I green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphatidylserine high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight wild type phospho site-specific antibody diacylglycerol protein kinase D. PKCδ also is regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the consequences of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation remain disputed, because PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation is variably linked to increased, decreased, or unchanged PKCδ activity (1Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Inconsistencies in the literature have been attributed to the presence of multiple tyrosine residues throughout the structure of PKCδ (including Tyr52, Tyr64, Tyr155, Tyr187, Tyr311, Tyr332, Tyr512, and Tyr523, numbering based upon rodent sequence) that are targets for independently regulated phosphorylations by Src family kinases, c-Abl, and potentially other tyrosine kinases. The general consensus in the literature is that PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation patterns vary according to the nature of the inciting stimulus and dictate the functional properties of the enzyme in cells. Our recent studies show Tyr311 and Tyr332 (residues in the hinge region of PKCδ that links the regulatory and kinase domains) are phosphorylated in vivo in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes and in vitro in kinase assays performed with Src (4Rybin V.O.

We also obtained unanticipated evidence that Src and PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation promote PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation in cells. These results run counter to the prevailing assumption that PKCδ tyrosine and Thr505 phosphorylations are independently regulated mechanisms and suggest that at least some of the dynamically regulated changes in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in cells can be attributed to tyrosine phosphorylation (i.e. PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation constitutes a final common mechanism to control PKCδ activity, including during oxidative stress). PKCs induce structural and functional ventricular remodelling both by activating signaling pathways that alter gene expression and by directly phosphorylating myofilament proteins that control cardiac contraction (7Dorn G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). cTnI, the “inhibitory” subunit of the troponin complex, is an important PKC substrate that plays an indispensable role in Ca2+-dependent regulation of myofilament function (8Huang X. Pi Y. Lee K.J. Henkel A.S. Gregg R.G. Powers P.A. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). At low intracellular [Ca2+], cTnI is anchored to the actin filament via peptides (an inhibitory peptide 138GKFKRPTLRRVR149) and a second actin-binding site (residues 161–188) flanking a so-called switch peptide (9Howarth J.W. Meller J. Solaro R.J. Trewhella J. Rosevear P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 706-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This tethering of cTnI acts together with other regulatory proteins to prevent strong, force-generating interactions of myosin cross-bridges with thin filaments. At high intracellular [Ca2+], the switch peptide binds strongly to the cTnC regulatory domain and induces a movement of cTnI away from actin thereby releasing inhibition (for recent reviews see Refs. 10Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 39-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar and 11Metzger J.M. Westfall M.V. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and references within). Myofilament function is further regulated and fine-tuned to hemodynamic load, by cTnI phosphorylation. cTnI contains three phosphorylation clusters (Ser23/Ser24, Ser43/Ser45, and Thr144) that exert distinct effects on cardiac function. Ser23/Ser24 phosphorylation desensitizes myofilaments to Ca2+ and leads to an enhanced rate of relaxation, augmented cross-bridge cycling, and accelerated unloaded shortening velocity. In contrast, Ser43/Ser45 phosphorylation leads to a decrease in maximal actomyosin Mg-ATPase, Ca2+-activated force, and cross-bridge cycling rate. Despite the fact that Thr144 is critically positioned in the inhibitory peptide region, the functional impact of Thr144 phosphorylation has been less intensively studied. Recent studies suggest that Thr144 phosphorylation may influence myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (12Burkart E.M. Sumandea M.P. Kobayashi T. Nili M. Martin A.F. Homsher E. Solaro R.J. J. Biol.

PKC-dependent cTnI phosphorylation is believed to be particularly important in the development of hypertrophy/failure syndromes, where coordinate increases in PKC isoform expression and cTnI phosphorylation have been linked to reduced actin-myosin interactions and depressed contractile function (7Dorn G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 15Sumandea M.P. Burkart E.M. Kobayashi T. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

However, conventional models of PKCδ activation, which attribute PKC isoform specificity entirely to translocation events that localize the enzyme to membranes, do not adequately explain PKC-dependent cTnI phosphorylation in the sarcomere. A role for tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ that is released from membranes and recovered as a constitutively active, lipid-independent enzyme in the soluble fraction of H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes would be more plausible (6Rybin V.O. Guo J. Sabri A. Elouardighi H. Schaefer E. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19350-19361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This study examines the role of PKCδ as a cTnI kinase, with a particular focus on the role of Src (and PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation) to regulate PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI and transduce physiologically relevant changes in contractile function. Materials—Antibodies were from the following sources: PKCδ-Thr(P)505, PKCδ-Tyr(P)311, Src-Tyr(P)416, troponin I-Ser(P)23/Ser(P)24, and anti-pTXR from Cell Signaling Technology; GFP (for immunoblot analysis), PKCδ, and PKCδ-Tyr(P)332 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Src from Oncogene; anti-Tyr(P) from Upstate Biotechnology; and GFP (for immunoprecipitation) from Invitrogen. Recombinant human PKCδ was from Calbiochem; active Src kinase was from Invitrogen; c-Abl was from Upstate Biotechnology. PMA was from Sigma. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycerol was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. The other chemicals were reagent grade. cTnI Phosphorylation in Adult Ventricular Cardiomyocytes—Left ventricular myocytes enzymatically isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats according to a modification of published methods were plated for 2 h on laminin-coated dishes (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen) at a density of 5 × 104 rod-shaped cells/35-mm dish (27Wolska B.M. Kitada Y. Palmiter K.A. Westfall M.V. Johnson M.D. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H24-H32PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed with fresh media, pretreated with vehicle (Me2SO), GF109203X (5 μm), or PP1 (10 μm) and then stimulated with H2O2 (5 mm) or PMA (100 nm) for 15 min. Cell lysis was in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (with protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and was followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min) to pellet myofilament proteins, which were then resuspended in a urea/thiourea sample buffer and separated on 15% acrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond (to detect phosphorylated proteins) followed by Sypro Ruby (to detect total protein), and analysis was by imaging on a Typhoon 9410 molecular imager (GE Healthcare) using ImageQuant TL software. Cardiomyocyte Culture and PKCδ Immunoprecipitation for Kinase Assays—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure that uses a differential attachment procedure followed by irradiation to enrich for cardiomyocytes (6Rybin V.O.

The cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 4 days and then serum-deprived for 24 h prior to experiments. The cells were treated with vehicle, 5 mm H2O2, or 100 nm PMA for 15 min and then lysed in homogenization buffer, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCδ (Santa-Cruz) and used in immunocomplex kinase assays modified only to include cTn complex as substrate according to methods described previously (4Rybin V.O.

In Vitro Kinase Assays with Recombinant Enzymes—In vitro kinase assays were performed with 0.032 units (32.4 ng) of recombinant human PKCδ (Calbiochem) for assays of cTn complex phosphorylation (or 0.4 units for peptide mapping studies) or other serine/threonine kinases (0.083 units of PKCα, 0.063 units of PKCβII, 0.566 units of PKCϵ, 0.026 units of PKD, or 3.84 units of PKA; all from Upstate Biotechnology) in 80 μl of a reaction buffer containing 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.9 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 76 mm NaCl, 23.5% glycerol, 0.006% Brij-35, 0.023% Triton X-100, 0.04 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 83 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS), 175 nm PMA, 4 μg of troponin complex, and [γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi, 97 μm). Incubations were for 30 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of Src or c-Abl (0.66 units) and lipid cofactors; PS-PMA was included in assays to allosterically activate PKCδ and render it a better substrate for Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (4Rybin V.O. Guo J. Gertsberg Z. Elouardighi H. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23631-23638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PKCδ Mutants—pPKCδ-EGFP (pGFP-PKCδ) was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Mary Reyland (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). The pPKCδ-EGFP construct expresses PKCδ protein with enhanced GFP fused to its C terminus. The pPKCδ(T505A)-EGFP and pPKCδ(T505E)-EGFP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manual for the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The PKCδ expression plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells by Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the instruction manual. The cells were grown for 24 h, lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH7.5, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin A). Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody 3E6 (Invitrogen). Peptide Mapping Studies—For peptide mapping studies, kinase reactions (see above) were stopped by adding 27 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the band corresponding to PKCδ was excised from the membrane, cut into small pieces, and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.5%, w/v) in acetic acid (100 mm), followed by five water washes (to remove the acid) and a 10-min incubation at room temperature in the dark with 100 mm iodoacetate to carboxymethylate PKCδ. The membrane pieces were then washed three times with water and twice with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 60 μl of a buffer containing 42 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 17 μm HCl, and 10 μg of sequencing grade trypsin. Digested peptides were eluted from the membrane by sonication and lyophilized, and the residue was reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated by reverse phase-HPLC on a Vydac semimicro C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm). The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 140 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluant was monitored at 220 nm, and fractions were collected every 30 s for Cherenkov counting. Radioactive peptides of interest were submitted to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Columbia University Protein Chemistry Core Facility for sequencing by MALDITOF mass spectrometry. Mechanical Measurements in Skinned Rat Ventricular Myocytes—Rat ventricular myocytes were mechanically isolated and mounted in the experimental set-up as described previously (20Hinken A.C. McDonald K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C500-C507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Isometric force production and the rate constant of force redevelopment (ktr) were assessed in single, skinned myocytes, as described previously (20Hinken A.C. McDonald K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C500-C507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), before and after PKCδ treatment alone (as described above) or in combination with Src kinase. All of the PKCδ treatments were in the presence of lipid cofactors (PS/PMA). Lipid cofactors and Src alone had no effect on mechanical parameters. Statistical Analysis—All of the values are presented as the means ± S.E., and the values of p < 0.05 were the criteria of statistical significance. Statistical evaluation was by Student t test (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software). cTnI Phosphorylation via a PKCδ/Src-dependent Mechanism in H2O2-treated Cardiomyocytes—Initial studies examined the mechanisms that control cTnI phosphorylation in situ in the myofilament lattice of cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress by H2O2 treatment. Fig. 1 shows that PMA (which directly activates PKCs) and H2O2 induce similar increases in cTnI phosphorylation. The H2O2-dependent increment in cTnI phosphorylation is completely abrogated by GF109203X (a relatively nonselective inhibitor of PKC isoforms), and it is markedly blunted by PP1 (an inhibitor of Src family kinases). The observation that H2O2 increases cTnI phosphorylation through a PKC-dependent mechanism that requires tyrosine kinase activity provided the rationale to consider a role for tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ. PKCδ was immunopurified from vehicle-, PMA-, and H2O2-treated cardiomyocyte cultures and used in assays with cTn ternary complexes (consisting of equimolar cTnI, cTnC, and cTnT) as substrate to resolve the cellular actions of PKCδ from the actions of other PKC isoforms. Native PKCδ is recovered from quiescent cardiomyocyte cultures with only very low lipid-independent cTnI kinase activity; cTnI phosphorylation is markedly increased when lipid activators, PS/PMA, are added to the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2A). PMA treatment of cardiomyocyte cultures, prior to PKCδ immunoprecipitation, leads to a minor increase in basal and lipid-dependent cTnI kinase activity, in association with a trace increase in overall PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. Oxidative stress induced by H2O2 treatment results in a marked increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation and a dramatic increase in PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI, including in assays without lipid cofactors (i.e. PKCδ is recovered from cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress as a lipid-independent cTnI kinase). Although H2O2 treatment has been linked to the activation of an array of serine/threonine kinases that may potentially associate with PKCδ during immunoprecipitation, control experiments identify similar pharmacologic profiles for the cTnI kinase activity recovered from resting and H2O2-treated cultures; in both cases, cTnI phosphorylation is fully inhibited by 5 μm GF109203X and 5 μm Gö6983 (broad spectrum PKC inhibitors) but not by 10 μm Gö6976 (a conventional PKC isoform-selective inhibitor that also directly inhibits the catalytic activity of PKD, another potential H2O2-activated cTnI kinase; Fig. 2 and data not shown). These results implicate PKCδ as a lipid-independent cTnI kinase in cardiomyocytes exposed to oxidative stress. PKCδ kinase activity may be activated by H2O2 indirectly as a result of Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation or directly through cysteine oxidation (17Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-dependent changes in PKCδ activity, we compared cTnI phosphorylation by PKCδ recovered from myocytes treated with H2O2 alone or H2O2+PP1 (to inhibit PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation). Fig. 2B shows that H2O2 increases overall PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation (tracked with a general anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) and PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation (tracked by phospho site-specific antibodies (PSSAs)); H2O2-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation is blocked by PP1, under conditions that also block H2O2-dependent activation of Src (tracked by immunoblotting for Src activation loop Tyr416 phosphorylation). PP1 attenuates (by 28.4 ± 4%, n = 4, p < 0.05) but does not entirely block the H2O2-dependent increase in cTnI phosphorylation by PKCδ. These results indicate that H2O2 increases PKCδ phosphorylation of cTnI through at least two mechanisms that differ in their requirements for Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. The Src and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms that regulate PKCδ activity are the focus of the remainder of the studies in this manuscript. Src Phosphorylates PKCδ at Tyr311 and Tyr332, Leading to Enhanced PKCδ Phosphorylation of cTnI—We recently used PSSAs to identify Tyr311 and Tyr332 as sites for Src-dependent PKCδ phosphorylation (4Rybin V.O. Guo J. Gertsberg Z. Elouardighi H. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23631-23638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recombinant PKCδ (human sequence) was subjected to in vitro kinase assays without and with active Src in buffers containing [γ-32P]ATP and PS/PMA, and radiolabeled PKCδ was subjected to peptide mapping analysis as an alternative method to map sites for Src-dependent PKCδ phosphorylation sites (without relying on available PSSAs). Fig. 3A shows that Src increases 32P incorporation into PKCδ, leading to the appearance of a PKCδ species that migrates more slowly in SDS-PAGE and displays increased PKCδ-Tyr(P)311 and PKCδ-Tyr(P)332 immunoreactivity. Src also increases PKCδ autophosphorylation at Thr505, consistent with our recent observation that the activation loop of PKCδ is the target of an autophosphorylation reaction that is augmented by Src (4Rybin V.O. Guo J. Gertsberg Z. Elouardighi H. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23631-23638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PKCδ purified by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose was excised from the membrane and digested with trypsin, and peptide fragments were separated by reverse phase-HPLC (Fig. 3B). Radioactive peptide fragments detected in assays with PKCδ + Src (but not in assays with PKCδ alone) were sequenced by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to determine sites for Src-dependent PKCδ phosphorylation. Fig. 3B shows that three distinct radioactive peaks were detected in reverse phase-HPLC chromatograms of phospho-peptide fragments derived from in vitro kinase assays with PKCδ, Src, and [32P]ATP (and not in vitro kinase assays with PKCδ alone). Peaks 1 and 2 were identified by mass spectrometry analysis as the oxidized and reduced forms of a Tyr(P)332-containing fragment (note that differences in oxidation status arise during sample preparation and should not be construed as evidence that this modification occurs in cells). Peak 3 contained a Tyr(P)311 fragment, as well as nonphosphorylated forms of peptides containing Tyr64 and Tyr52 (other sites on PKCδ that have been reported to be phosphorylated under certain stimulatory conditions). Collectively, these results identify Tyr311 and Tyr332 as the major sites for in vitro Src-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. Having identified Tyr311 and Tyr332 as major targets for Src-dependent PKCδ phosphorylation in vitro and H2O2-dependent PKCδ phosphorylation in vivo, we performed in vitro kinase assays with PKCδ, active Src, a kinase buffer containing [32P]ATP and cTn complex (consisting of wild type (WT) cTnT, WT-cTnC, and WT-cTnI) to determine whether Src-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation leads to a change in PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI. PKCδ phosphorylates cTnI in a lipid-dependent fashion in vitro, with cTnI phosphorylation markedly increased in assays performed in the presence of active Src (under conditions that lead to PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation; Fig. 3C). The Src-dependent increment in cTnI phosphorylation cannot be attributed to direct myofibrillar protein phosphorylation by Src, because 1) cTnI phosphorylation is completely blocked by GF109203X and 2) anti-Tyr(P) antibodies detect tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of PKCδ and Src, but no anti-Tyr(P) immunoreactivity comigrating with cTnI was detected. These results indicate that the Src-dependent increment in cTnI phosphorylation results from serine/threonine phosphorylation by PKCδ rather than direct cTnI tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. In vitro kinase assays were extended to use cTn complexes containing WT-cTnI or substituted forms of cTnI (cTnI-S23D/S24D, cTnI-S23A/S24A, cTnI-S43E/S45E, cTnI-Thr144E, or cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E; see Fig. 4A) as substrate to 1) map the sites phosphorylated by allosterically activated PKCδ (in assays with PS/PMA) and 2) determine whether the Src-dependent increment in PKCδ activity is directed toward the same or different sites on cTnI. PhosphorImager analysis of PKCδ-dependent cTnI phosphorylation shows that PKCδ preferentially radiolabels forms of cTnI that can be phosphorylated at Ser23/Ser24 (Fig. 4B, top panel, gray bars). PKCδ induces similar increases in 32P incorporation into WT-cTnI and cTnI mutants harboring Ser → Glu substitutions at Ser43/Ser45 or Thr144 alone or in combination (i.e. cTnI-S43E/S45E, cTnI-T144E, and cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E), whereas PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI-S23D/S24D is markedly reduced in comparison. Quantification of data from three separate experiments shows the S23D/S24D substitution (making Ser23/Ser24 nonphosphorylatable) reduces PKCδ-dependent cTnI phosphorylation by 68.0 ± 2.3% (relative to WT-cTnI; n = 3, p < 0.05). These results indicate that PS/PMA-activated PKCδ phosphorylates cTnI primarily at Ser23/Ser24; Ser43/Ser45 and Thr144 are relatively poor substrates for allosterically activated PKCδ. A similar mutagenesis approach was used to map the Src-de-pendent increment in PKCδ-dependent cTnI phosphorylation to cTnI-Thr144. Src increases PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of WT-cTnI and forms of cTnI that can be phosphorylated at Thr144 (cTnI-S23D/S24D or cTnI-S43E/S45E), whereas the Src-dependent increment in PKCδ-dependent cTnI phosphorylation is abrogated by T144E or cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E substitutions (Fig. 4B, top panel, black bars). Conclusions derived from PhosphorImager studies were validated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). An anti-cTnI-Ser(P)23/Ser(P)24 PSSA that specifically recognizes the Ser23/Ser24-phosphorylated form of cTnI detects similar PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of WT-cTnI and cTnI mutants harboring single residue substitutions at Ser43/Ser45 and Thr144 (alone and in combination); this PSSA does not detect phosphorylation of the cTnI-S23D/S24D mutant. Importantly, radiolabeling studies show that Src increases overall WT-cTnI phosphorylation by PKCδ, bu"
https://openalex.org/W2169882872,"Differential binding between cadherin subtypes is widely believed to mediate cell sorting during embryogenesis. However, a fundamental unanswered question is whether cell sorting is dictated by the biophysical properties of cadherin bonds, or by broader, cadherin-dependent differences in intercellular adhesion or membrane tension. This report describes atomic force microscope measurements of the strengths and dissociation rates of homophilic and heterophilic cadherin (CAD) bonds. Measurements conducted with chicken N-CAD, canine E-CAD, and Xenopus C-CAD demonstrated that all three cadherins cross-react and form multiple, intermolecular bonds. The mechanical and kinetic properties of the heterophilic bonds are similar to the homophilic interactions. The thus quantified bond parameters, together with previously reported adhesion energies were further compared with in vitro cell aggregation and sorting assays, which are thought to mimic in vivo cell sorting. Trends in quantified biophysical properties of the different cadherin bonds do not correlate with sorting outcomes. These results suggest that cell sorting in vivo and in vitro is not governed solely by biophysical differences between cadherin subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1605880567,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in children worldwide. RSV infects airway epithelial cells, where it activates inflammatory genes via the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB is controlled by two pathways, a canonical pathway that releases sequestered RelA complexes from the IκBα inhibitor, and a second, the noncanonical pathway, that releases RelB from the 100-kDa NF-κB2 complex. Recently we found that the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a major intracellular RSV sensor upstream of the canonical pathway. In this study, we surprisingly found that RIG-I silencing also inhibited p100 processing to 52-kDa NF-κB2 (“p52”), suggesting that RIG-I was functionally upstream of the noncanonical regulatory kinase complex composed of NIK·IKKα subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments not only demonstrated that NIK associated with RIG-I and its downstream adaptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), but also showed the association between IKKα and MAVS. To further understand the role of the NIK·IKKα pathway, we compared RSV-induced NF-κB activation using wild type, Ikkγ-/-, Nik-/-, and Ikkα-/--deficient MEF cells. Interestingly, we found that in canonical pathway-defective Ikkγ-/- cells, RSV induced RelA by liberation from p100 complexes. RSV was still able to activate IP10, Rantes, and Groβ gene expression in Ikkγ-/- cells, and this induction was inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated RelA knockdown but not RelB silencing. These data suggest that part of the RelA activation in response to RSV infection was induced by a “cross-talk” pathway involving the noncanonical NIK·IKKα complex downstream of RIG-I·MAVS. This pathway may be a potential target for RSV treatment. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in children worldwide. RSV infects airway epithelial cells, where it activates inflammatory genes via the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB is controlled by two pathways, a canonical pathway that releases sequestered RelA complexes from the IκBα inhibitor, and a second, the noncanonical pathway, that releases RelB from the 100-kDa NF-κB2 complex. Recently we found that the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a major intracellular RSV sensor upstream of the canonical pathway. In this study, we surprisingly found that RIG-I silencing also inhibited p100 processing to 52-kDa NF-κB2 (“p52”), suggesting that RIG-I was functionally upstream of the noncanonical regulatory kinase complex composed of NIK·IKKα subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments not only demonstrated that NIK associated with RIG-I and its downstream adaptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), but also showed the association between IKKα and MAVS. To further understand the role of the NIK·IKKα pathway, we compared RSV-induced NF-κB activation using wild type, Ikkγ-/-, Nik-/-, and Ikkα-/--deficient MEF cells. Interestingly, we found that in canonical pathway-defective Ikkγ-/- cells, RSV induced RelA by liberation from p100 complexes. RSV was still able to activate IP10, Rantes, and Groβ gene expression in Ikkγ-/- cells, and this induction was inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated RelA knockdown but not RelB silencing. These data suggest that part of the RelA activation in response to RSV infection was induced by a “cross-talk” pathway involving the noncanonical NIK·IKKα complex downstream of RIG-I·MAVS. This pathway may be a potential target for RSV treatment.

These features, along with the finding that inhibition of mucosal NF-κB signaling in a mouse model of RSV disease blocks mononuclear infiltration and disease manifestations (3Haeberle H. Casola A.

Five members of the NF-κB family have been reported, including three subunits with transactivating function, RelA, RelB, c-Rel, and two DNA binding subunits, NF-κB1 (p50) and NF-κB2 (p52) (7Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The NF-κB molecules are sequestered in the cytoplasm by interacting with a group of inhibitory proteins including IκBα, IκBβ, IκBϵ, p100, and p105 (8Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Currently, it is understood that NF-κB activation can be controlled by two separate pathways, the canonical and noncanonical pathways, activated by distinct stimuli and under control of distinct IκB kinase (IKK) complexes. The canonical NF-κB pathway is induced by the monokines TNF and interleukin-1, stimulating the IKK complex composed of the catalytic kinases, IKK-α and-β and the regulatory subunit, IKKγ (9Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Activated IKK, in turn, induces the phosphorylation-coupled degradation of IκBα, liberating sequestered cytoplasmic RelA allowing RelA to translocate into the nucleus and initiates gene transcription (10Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The non-canonical NF-κB pathway is induced by lymphotoxin β (LTβ), the TNF superfamily member, LIGHT, or other lymphokines (11Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W.

A. 1994; 91: 12634-12638Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This pathway stimulates a complex of NIK and IKKα, resulting in the phosphorylation-coupled proteolysis of 100-kDa NF-κB2 (“p100”) to form the activated 52-kDa NF-κB2 (“p52”)-RelB complex. Although we found that RSV was able to activate NIK kinase activity and p52 formation (15Choudhary S. Boldogh S. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8948-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the mechanism how RSV activates the NIK·IKKα complex is unknown. Recently, we found that retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a DEXD/H box RNA helicase, was the initial intracellular sensor for RSV infection and upstream of the canonical NF-κB pathway (16Liu P. Jamaluddin M. Li K. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1401-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). RIG-I is a central regulator of dsRNA-induced signaling for most of the single-stranded RNA viruses (17Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T.

RIG-I is upstream of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, also known as interferon-β promoter stimulator 1, caspase recruitment domain (CARD) adaptor inducing IFN-β (Cardif) or virus-induced signaling adaptor (19Seth R.B.

Activated RIG-I binds to MAVS through a homologous CARD motif; interestingly this interaction is absolutely required for downstream RIG-I signaling and occurs on the outer mitochondrial membrane (19Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). In this study, we discover that siRNA-mediated RIG-I silencing inhibits basal and RSV-inducible p52 formation. Further investigation revealed that NIK associates with the RIG-I·MAVS complex via the RIG-I NH2-terminal CARD domain and the COOH terminus of NIK. Surprisingly, we found RSV induced RelA activation in Ikkγ-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), cells lacking a functional canonical NF-κB pathway. In nondenaturing co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated that the NIK·IKKα complex induced RelA release from cytoplasmic p100 complexes. Together, these findings indicate RIG-I controls RelA activation by two distinct downstream signaling modules, one mediated by canonical pathway activation and the second involving a novel cross-talk pathway dependent on complex formation with NIK·IKKα whose activation liberates RelA from p100 sequestration. Targeted disruption of this pathway may have significant effects in modulating the inflammatory response to RSV without affecting the viral replication. Cell Cultures—Human A549 pulmonary type II epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in F12K medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

HEK293 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Virus Preparation and Infection—The human RSV A2 strain was grown in Hep2 cells and prepared as described (27Ueba O. Acta Med. Okayama. 1978; 32: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). The viral titer of purified RSV pools was varied from 8 to 9 log plaque forming units/ml, determined by a methylcellulose plaque assay. Viral pools were aliquoted, quick-frozen on dry ice-ethanol, and stored at -70 °C until they were used. For viral adsorption, cells were transferred into culture medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and RSV infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for the times as described in the text. Plasmid Construction—Expression vectors encoding full-length and a series of deletion mutants of NIK were produced by PCR and cloned as BamHI/XbaI sequences into the pEGFP-Myc plasmid (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers are shown in Table 1. A FLAG-tagged full-length NIK expression vector (FLAG_EGPF_NIK) was constructed as a COOH-terminal fusion in pEGFP plasmid. Expression vectors encoding FLAG epitope-tagged RIG-I and its deletion mutants were under the control of a tetracycline response element in a modified pT1S plasmid as described (16Liu P.

(Lafayette, CO). The siRNA targeting RIG-I and control siRNA were transfected at 100 nm into A549 cells using a TransIT-siQuest transfection kit (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The control siRNA and the siRNA targeting RelA and RelB were transfected at 50 nm into MEF cells using reverse transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were RSV infected at the indicated times. The silencing efficiency of siRNA was evaluated using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) for RIG-I as well as Western immunoblot for RelB and RelA. RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted using acid guanidium phenol extraction (TriReagent; Sigma). One microgram of RNA was reversibly transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction mixture. One μl of cDNA product was diluted 1:2, and 2 μl was amplified in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 12.5 μl of SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and 0.4 μm each of forward and reverse gene-specific primers (Table 3), aliquoted into 96-well, 0.2-mm thin-wall PCR plates, and covered with optical quality sealing tape. The plates were denatured for 90 s at 95 °C and then subjected to 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in iCycler (Bio-Rad). After PCR was performed, PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels to assure a single amplification product. Static analysis of gene expression was described before (16Liu P. Jamaluddin M. Li K.

Gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max film (Kodak) for autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblot—Whole cell extracts were prepared using modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Whole cell extracts were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) for 10 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitation was conducted for 2 h at 4 °C with primary Ab. Immune complexes were then precipitated by adding 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with cold TB buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630), and immune complexes were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween and probed with the primary Ab indicated in the figure legends. Membranes were washed and incubated with IRDye 700-conjugated anti-mouse Ab or IRDye 800-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab (Rockland, Inc.). Finally, the membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and scanned by an Odyssey infrared scanner. Sources of primary Ab were: anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Stratagene), anti-Myc mAb (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-RelA C20 polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz), anti-p52 polyclonal Ab (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), and goat anti-RSV antibody (Biodesign). For the experiments requiring the second primary antibody, the membrane was not stripped to remove the first primary antibody, and the second primary antibody was incubated with membrane directly. Electroporation—Two million freshly isolated MEFs were suspended in 100 μl of MEF2 nucleofactor solution (Amaxa), and transfected (program A023) with 5 μg of plasmid DNA. After transfection, cells were immediately transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured for at least 48 h before treatment. RSV-induced p52 Formation Is RIG-I-, NIK-, and IKKα-dependent—Recently, we have reported that RSV infection activated the noncanonical pathway. To illustrate, we stimulated A549 cells with the LTβ agonist, LIGHT (29Kim Y.S. Nedospasov S.A. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2130-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a noncanonical pathway activator, and compared p52 formation with that induced by RSV infection (Fig. 1A). LIGHT rapidly and strongly induced p52 formation within 30 min after treatment, which persisted for more than 6 h. In addition, we noted p100 expression was up-regulated, a consequence of p100 being downstream of the NF-κB pathway (30Tian B. Brasier A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2003; 58: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similarly, RSV infection induced p52 formation detectable 12 h after RSV adsorption and persisted for 24 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the response to LIGHT, the p100 precursor was transiently induced at the 12-h point and did not persist at 24 h. This is probably due to the transient activation of the noncanonical pathway in RSV infection (15Choudhary S. Boldogh S. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8948-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that RSV-induced NF-κB activation is dependent on active viral replication, with either UV-inactivated RSV or RSV-conditioned medium being unable to induce NF-κB binding upon exposure to naïve cells (5Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Han Y. Elliott T. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether RSV replication is necessary for p100 processing, A549 cells were exposed to RSV, UV-inactivated RSV, or conditioned medium from RSV-infected cells. Although replication competent RSV induced p52 formation, neither UV-inactivated RSV nor CM from RSV-infected cells produced detectable p52 formation (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, p52 formation has previously been shown to be mediated via a co-translational mechanism, where newly synthesized p100 was the preferential target for processing to p52 (31Mordmuller B. Krappmann D. Esen M. Wegener M. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, it was shown that cycloheximide (CHX) inhibits the formation of both p100 and p52. To determine whether RSV induced p52 formation also via a co-translational mechanism, RSV infection was repeated in the presence of CHX. We noted that CHX inhibited the formation of the p100 precursor and inducible p52 formation was inhibited (Fig. 1B, right panel). These data indicated that RSV replication was required for p52 formation, and that newly synthesized p100 was the primary source of p52 processing. RIG-I is the major cytoplasmic sensor of RSV infection upstream of the canonical pathway, but the pathway mediating noncanonical activation is unknown (16Liu P. Jamaluddin M. Li K. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1401-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We next examined whether RIG-I mediated RSV-induced p52 formation. For this purpose, we silenced RIG-I expression using siRNA transfection. In comparison with control siRNA-transfected cells, where RIG-I mRNA was not detectable in uninfected cells and its expression was strongly up-regulated 24 h after RSV infection, accumulation of RIG-I mRNA was significantly reduced in cells transfected with RIG-I-specific siRNA (Fig. 1C, top). Importantly, both the basal and RSV-induced p52 accumulation was significantly decreased in RIG-I-silenced cells (Fig. 1C, bottom). To confirm the NIK and IKKα dependence in noncanonical pathway activation, p52 formation was determined in wild type (WT), NIK-deficient (Nik-/-), IKKα-deficient (Ikkα-/-), and IKKγ-deficient (Ikkγ-/-) MEFs. Here, p52 formation was observed in WT and Ikkγ-/- MEFs 24 h after RSV infection, but was completely abolished in Nik-/- and Ikkα-/- cells (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that RSV-induced p52 formation was RIG-I dependent, involving both the NIK and IKKα kinases. RIG-I and MAVS Associate with NIK and IKKα—To further investigate the novel functional interaction between RIG-I and NIK, and determine the domains involved, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted. First, full-length Myc_NIK and different FLAG_RIG-I constructs were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. The RIG-I constructs included full-length RIG-I, the RIG-I NH2 terminus containing the two CARD domains (RIG_N), and the RIG-I COOH-terminal part containing the helicase domain (RIG_C). NIK was precipitated using the anti-Myc Ab, and RIG-I association was detected by Western immunoblot using anti-FLAG Ab (Fig. 2A, first panel from top). These results indicated that NIK bound to full-length RIG-I and RIG_N, but not RIG_C, suggesting that the two CARD domains of RIG-I are required for RIG-I·NIK complex formation. To confirm this finding, the reverse experiment was performed using the anti-FLAG Ab to precipitate RIG-I and NIK association determined using anti-Myc Ab in the Western immunoblot. The same result was observed in this experiment (Fig. 2A, third panel from top). We next investigated whether the downstream RIG-I adapter, MAVS, complexed with NIK. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using full-length FLAG- and GFP-tagged NIK and different deletion mutations of MAVS. For this experiment, 4 forms of Myc and Strawberry-tagged MAVS plasmids were used including wild type MAVS (MAVS), MAVS deleted in its NH2-terminal CARD domain (MAVS_dN), MAVS deleted in its COOH-terminal transmembrane domain (MAVS_dC), and MAVS without both its CARD and transmembrane domains (MAVS_Dou). First, full-length NIK was precipitated using anti-FLAG Ab and MAVS association detected by anti-Myc Ab in Western immunoblot (Fig. 2B, top panel). The converse experiment was conducted to precipitate MAVS using anti-Myc Ab, and NIK detected using anti-FLAG in Western blot (Fig. 2B, third panel from top). Both experiments produced the same result, only the full-length MAVS associated with NIK. To confirm that this observation was not the result of artifactual overexpression, we sought to co-immunoprecipitate the endogenous proteins. For this experiment, RSV-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with IgG, or with anti-MAVS Abs. The presence of NIK was then assayed in the washed immune complexes by Western immunoblot. A specific NIK band was observed only in the MAVS immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2C). These data confirmed that the endogenous proteins formed a complex in cellulo. To identify which NIK domains were required for MAVS complex formation, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted using different NIK deletion mutants. A series of expression vectors encoding Myc epitope-tagged NH2 and COOH-terminal domain deletions were tested (Fig. 3A). These constructs were co-transfected with full-length FLAG-tagged MAVS, and MAVS-associated complexes precipitated using anti-FLAG Ab. Our results suggested that the N-terminal deletion mutants of NIK (C1, C2, and C3) associate with MAVS, but the COOH-terminal deletions (N1, N2, and N3) did not (Fig. 3B). This result suggested that the COOH terminus of NIK spanning amino acids 660–947 was required for complexing with MAVS. Because of the central role of IKKα in mediating the noncanonical pathway, and its functional requirement for RSV-induced p52 formation (shown in Fig. 1D), the association of IKKα and MAVS was also investigated. Full-length FLAG-tagged IKKα was co-expressed with full-length or deletion mutants of MAVS. The complex was precipitated using anti-Myc Ab and IKKα association detected using anti-FLAG Ab in the Western immunoblot. Our result suggested that only full-length MAVS binds IKKα (Fig. 3C). To confirm this finding, GFP-tagged IKKα and YFP-tagged MAVS were cotransfected into A549 cells. 36 h after transfection, colocalization of IKKα and MAVS were studied by confocal microscopy. Three images are shown in Fig. 3D. The first image shows two cells expressing both GFP_IKKα and YFP_MAVS. The colocalization of these two molecules is demonstrated by the yellow color in the merged figure (at right). In the second image, most cells express only GFP_IKKα; here the IKKα distribution is evenly dispersed through the cytoplasm. In the third image, one cell is expressing GFP_IKKα only and the fluorescence distribution is even throughout the cytoplasm. The other cell expressing both YFP_MAVS and GFP_IKKα, the redistribution of green fluorescence to a mitochondrial pattern is again demonstrated. Together these data indicate that IKKα is recruited to colocalize with MAVS on the mitochondrion. RSV Activates RelA Translocation in Ikkγ-/- MEFs—To further understand the function of the NIK·IKKα complex in RSV-induced signaling, we infected WT, Ikkγ-/-, Nik-/-, and Ikkα-/- MEFs with RSV and assayed nuclear extracts (NE) for canonical NF-κB DNA binding activity using a RelA/NF-κB1-selective probe (28Tian B.

In mammals, DPP III is associated with important physiological functions and is a potential biomarker for certain types of cancer. Here, we present the 1.95-Å crystal structure of yeast DPP III representing the prototype for the M49 family of metallopeptidases. It shows a novel fold with two domains forming a wide cleft containing the catalytic metal ion. DPP III exhibits no overall similarity to other metallopeptidases, such as thermolysin and neprilysin, but zinc coordination and catalytically important residues are structurally conserved. Substrate recognition is accomplished by a binding site for the N terminus of the peptide at an appropriate distance from the metal center and by a series of conserved arginine residues anchoring the C termini of different length substrates.

A number of bioactive peptides that play crucial roles in the nervous and endocrine systems have been identified. These peptides interact with corresponding receptors and subsequently modulate downstream pathways. The consequences of such processes are terminated by the degradation of those active peptides either by peptidases or through internalization by other mechanisms. A number of peptidases that act on physiologically important peptides have been identified and are classified into different groups according to their mode of action (exo- versus endopeptidases), catalytic signature motifs, or metal content (1Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Because of their role in the organism, inhibition of peptidases has therapeutic implications, such as the treatment of hypertension in the case of inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (2Waeber B.

Dipeptidyl-peptidase III (DPP III 2The abbreviations used are: DPP IIIdipeptidyl-peptidase IIIMADmultiple wavelength anomalous dispersionMIRmultiple isomorphous replacementTLStranslation/libration/screw. ; EC 3.4.14.4) enzymes form a group of aminopeptidases with molecular masses of ∼80-85 kDa. They specifically cleave dipeptides from the N termini of their substrates and have restricted specificity on dipeptidyl-arylamide substrates, preferring Arg-Arg-2-naphthylamide (3Chen J.-M.

It is generally found to be a cytosolic protein, but membrane-associated DPP III in rat brain has been reported as well (9Lee C.-M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

Regarding non-mammals, DPP III has been partially purified and characterized from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (14Huang J. Kim J. Ramamurthy P. Jones T.H.D. Exp.

The exact physiological roles of these enzymes are not yet clear. However, some pharmacological experiments link DPP III with pain regulation mechanisms because low levels of DPP III activity have been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals suffering from acute pain (16Sato H. Kimura K. Yamamoto Y. Hazato T. Masui. 2003; 52: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, high concentrations of DPP III found in the superficial laminae of rat spinal cord dorsal horn (17Chiba T. Li Y.H. Yamane T. Ogikubo O. Fukuoka M. Arai R. Takahashi S. Ohtsuka T. Ohkubo I. Matsui N. Peptides. 2003; 24: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as well as the high in vitro affinity shown by the human enzyme toward important neuropeptides, such as enkephalins and endomorphins (18Barsun M. Jajčanin N. Vukelić B. Spoljarić J. Abramić M. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), also indicate that this hydrolase could play a role in the mammalian pain modulatory system. These findings make DPP III a potential drug target, and efforts toward inhibitor design and synthesis are under way (19Agić D. Hranjec M. Jajčanin N. Starčević K. Karminski-Zamola G. Abramić M. Bioorg. Chem. 2007; 35: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, DPP III has also obtained much attention because of its overexpression in ovarian malignant tissues, and this property can be further exploited as a potential biomarker for carcinoma (20Šimaga Š. Babić D. Osmak M. Sprem M. Abramić M. Gynecol. Oncol. 2003; 91: 194-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a role for DPP III has been implied in cataractogenesis and endogenous defense mechanisms against oxidative stress (21Liu Y. Kern J.T. Walker J.R. Johnson J.A. Schultz P.G. Luesch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5205-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Zhang H. Yamamoto Y. Shumiya S. Kunimatsu M. Nishi K. Ohkubo I. Kani K. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Biochemical investigations showed DPP III to be a zinc metallopeptidase containing 1 mol of zinc/mol of protein with a dissociation constant of 2.5 × 10-13 m at pH 7.4 (4Fukasawa K. Fukasawa K.M. Kanai M. Fujii S. Hirose J. Harada M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Commonly, cobalt ions significantly activate DPP III from various origins (3Chen J.-M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11860-11865Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All known DPP III sequences contain the unique motif HEXXGH, which enabled the recognition of the dipeptidyl-peptidase III family as a distinct evolutionary metallopeptidase family (family M49, MEROPS, the Peptidase Database (1Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), www.merops.ac.uk). Mutagenesis data on the HEXXGH motif in the rat enzyme imply that the histidine residues coordinate the metal ion and that the glutamic acid acts as a general base in peptide hydrolysis (24Fukasawa K. Fukasawa K.M. Iwamoto H. Hirose J. Harada M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8299-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A second conserved linear motif within the DPP III family, EEXR(K)AE(D), is found 22-55 amino acids toward the C terminus from the first one (6Abramić M. Špoljarić J. Šimaga Š. Period. Biol. 2004; 106: 161-168Google Scholar, 7Abramić M. Šimaga Š. Osmak M. Čičin-Šain L. Vukelić B. Vlahoviček K. Dolovcak L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the involvement of the second glutamic acid residue in the coordination of the active-site zinc was shown (24Fukasawa K. Fukasawa K.M. Iwamoto H. Hirose J. Harada M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8299-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Apart from that, little is known about the molecular mechanism of action of this hydrolase because no experimental three-dimensional structure of DPP III enzymes is available. Homology modeling was not possible because of the low sequence identity to proteins with known structure, already indicating a novel fold. Because of the more facile accessibility, we chose the ortholog from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sharing ∼40% sequence identity with mammalian DPP III, for our structural studies. The enzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and we present here its high resolution crystal structure and discuss the implications of this first DPP III structure for the catalytic mechanism and substrate recognition. Cloning of Yeast DPP III for Large-scale Expression in E. coli—The open reading frame YOL057W encoding yeast DPP III was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from S. cerevisiae (BY4741). The PCR product was inserted into the NdeI/XhoI restriction sites of pET21a (Novagen). Cloning into this vector using NdeI/XhoI and deletion of the stop codon allow expression of the protein with a hexahistidine affinity tag at the C terminus. Cysteine-to-serine point mutations in yeast DPP III were produced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pET21a-DPP III-His6 as template. Expression and Purification of S. cerevisiae DPP III-His6—A single colony of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was grown overnight in 5 ml of Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 36 μg/ml chloramphenicol, which was then used to inoculate a 500-ml culture. After 3 h at 37 °C, expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Cells were allowed to grow overnight at 20 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and subsequently stored at -70 °C. For protein purification, 4 liters of E. coli cells expressing DPP III-His6 were grown in parallel, and the resulting bacterial paste was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole (buffer A) as the resuspension buffer. The cells were lysed by five cycles of sonication, 1 min each. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin essentially according to protocol number 11 provided by the supplier (Qiagen). In particular, buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole was used to wash the column, and the bound protein was eluted in buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole. The progress of DPP III-His6 purification was monitored by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. All fractions of high purity and an appropriate amount of enzyme (according to SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation with the Amicon CentriPrep system (molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa). Further analysis of recombinant wild-type DPP III by size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the protein exists in a mono- and dimeric form. The latter form could be resolved into monomers using dithiothreitol, suggesting formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between monomers. Crystallization trials with wild-type DPP III were unsuccessful and prompted us to elucidate the nature of the dimerization process by generating five single cysteine-to-serine mutant proteins. This led to the identification of Cys-130 as the cause for dimerization. A biochemical characterization of these five single mutant proteins will be presented elsewhere. 3N. Jajčanin-Jozić, S. Deller, T. Pavkov, P. Macheroux, and M. Abramić, manuscript in preparation. Here, we have continued our structural work with the C130S mutant protein, which exhibited comparable enzymatic activity to the wild-type protein. Selenomethionine-labeled DPP III was expressed from the met- E. coli strain B834(DE3). The purification of the selenomethionine-containing DPP III followed the same protocol as for the recombinant C130S mutant protein. X-ray Crystallography—For crystallization, the C130S mutant of DPP III from S. cerevisiae was concentrated to 18 mg/ml (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7) and 100 mm NaCl). Initial conditions were identified from the Hampton Index Screen using the microbatch technique. After optimization, diffraction quality plate-like crystals (with a maximum dimension of 0.3 mm) were grown using sitting drop vapor diffusion in 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 900 mm MgCl2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The crystals were monoclinic, space group P21, with one DPP III molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled protein were grown under the same conditions. In parallel, we tried to obtain “classical” heavy atom derivatives. Native PAGE shift experiments (25Boggon T.J. Shapiro L. Structure. 2000; 8: R143-R149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) indicated that mercury and osmium compounds specifically bound to DPP III. On the basis of these results, we succeeded in preparing a mercury derivative by soaking the crystals for 2 h in a solution containing mercury p-hydroxybenzoate. All data sets were collected from flash-cooled crystals at 100 K without the use of any additional cryoprotectant. The structure was solved by a combination of MAD and MIR. Selenomethionine MAD data were collected at beamline X12 at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron/European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg (λpeak = 0.9779 Å, λinfl = 0.9787 Å, λrem = 0.9180 Å). The mercury derivative data set was collected at the XRD beamline at Elettra Trieste (λ = 0.8298 Å), and the high resolution native data set was obtained at beamline ID23 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble (λ = 0.9537 Å). The data sets were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar) and MOSFLM (27Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Heavy atom sites (13 selenium and 1 mercury) were found independently with SOLVE/RESOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) as well as SHELXD (29Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Phases (overall figure of merit of 0.65) were calculated and extended to 1.95-Å resolution using PHENIX (30Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3664) Google Scholar). A first model was built using PHENIX and ARP/wARP (31Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), yielding ∼600 of the 711 amino acids. The starting model was completed and refined against the high resolution data set using PHENIX and COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). Rfree values (33Kleywegt G.J. Brunger A.T. Structure. 1996; 4: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) were computed from 5% randomly chosen reflections not used for the refinement. In the later stages of refinement, a TLS analysis was performed (34Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and four TLS groups were defined (residues 2-310, 311-432, 433-672 plus a zinc ion, and 673-711) for refinement in PHENIX. The first refinement cycle including TLS led to a reduction in both R and Rfree of ∼2%. The final structure contains amino acid residues 2-711, one zinc ion, two magnesium ions, and 450 water molecules, resulting in R = 0.1923 and Rfree = 0.2283. Three residues (Ser-37, His-578, and Ser-680) were modeled with alternative conformations. The stereochemistry of the structure was checked using PROCHECK (35Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), showing 99.7% of the residues in the core and allowed regions and none in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (supplemental Fig. 5).

Open table in a new tab Overview of the DPP III Structure—We determined the crystal structure of the C130S mutant of DPP III from S. cerevisiae at 1.95-Å resolution by a combination of selenomethionine MAD and MIR. (For a representative portion of the electron density map, see supplemental Fig. 1.) This specific variant was chosen because the mutation gave rise to homogeneous monomeric protein samples compared with the monomer/dimer mixtures usually obtained for the native enzyme. 3N. Jajčanin-Jozić, S. Deller, T. Pavkov, P. Macheroux, and M. Abramić, manuscript in preparation. The mutation site turned out to be on the surface of the protein and far away (56 Å) from the metal center. Not surprisingly, this particular amino acid exchange also did not significantly alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme. DPP III is an elongated molecule with overall dimensions of 75 × 60 × 50 Å. Two lobes can be identified that are separated by a cleft, ∼40 Å wide and 25 Å high. This cleft divides the whole enzyme into two domains: an upper mostly helical domain (residues 429-670) and a lower domain with mixed α- and β-secondary structures (Fig. 1). The lower domain has an extension (residues 346-383) that forms an α-helix followed by a long loop and embraces the upper domain. A five-stranded β-structure forms the core of the lower domain (β7, β8, β9, β10, and β11) (magenta in Fig. 1; see supplemental Fig. 2 for the numbering of secondary structure elements). On one side, this structure is flanked by five helices (α1, α8, α9, α10, and α12), whereas the other side is accessible and forms part of the “floor” of the cleft opposite to the catalytic metal center (Fig. 1). The C-terminal tail of the protein (residues 671-711) folds back and interacts with the lower domain mainly by forming a short, parallel, two-stranded β-sheet with residues 9-18 and by contacts of the C-terminal α-helix. The catalytic zinc ion is bound to the upper domain at the “roof” of the cleft. An extensive search for similar folds was carried out using MSDssm (36Krissinel E. Hentick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar), DALI (37Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar), and DEJAVU (39Kleywegt G.J. Jones A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) but did not yield any significant matches. Zinc Binding—The zinc-binding site is part of the upper domain and is built up by His-460, His-465, and Glu-517, which coordinate the metal ion through the N-ϵ atoms of the imidazole rings and the carboxylate group, respectively (Fig. 2A). The two His ligands belong to the conserved HEXXGH signature motif (24Fukasawa K. Fukasawa K.M. Iwamoto H. Hirose J. Harada M.

The two other glutamate residues in this motif (Glu-516 and Glu-521) are hydrogen-bonded to the zinc-coordinating histidine residues (His-465 and His-460, respectively). A water molecule completes the tetrahedral coordination of the zinc ion. This water molecule is also hydrogen-bonded to Glu-461 (Fig. 2B). Although the DPP III structure represents a novel fold, the mode of zinc binding closely resembles that observed in other structurally unrelated metallopeptidases, such as neprilysin (40Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Hennig M. Winkler F.K. Dale G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and thermolysin (41Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 3). These two enzymes also coordinate the metal ion through two histidines and one glutamate, and a structural superposition of the zinc-binding residues reveals a very similar coordination geometry (Fig. 2C). In all three cases, the two histidine residues are part of a conserved motif, which, in the case of DPP III and its homologs, contains an additional amino acid residue (HEXXGH compared with the conventional HEXXH motif). In neprilysin and thermolysin, this metal-binding motif is part of a helical structure in which the terminal histidine residues are located on the same side of the helix. Despite the insertion of an additional residue, an equivalent coordination geometry is feasible in DPP III because of a slight widening of the last turn of the helix (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. 4) and a concomitant distortion of the helical hydrogen bonding pattern (i to i+5 instead of i to i+4). In line with this observation is experimental evidence that the deletion of one leucine residue from the HELLGH motif in rat DPP III did not completely abolish its activity (24Fukasawa K. Fukasawa K.M. Iwamoto H. Hirose J. Harada M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8299-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that this truncated motif is still able to build up a functional zinc coordination site. Active-site Cleft—The central cleft region extending on both sides of the zinc ion is the most plausible area for substrate binding. This region is quite open and appears to be easily accessible to peptide substrates. The roof part of the cleft is formed by the helical structure of the upper domain, whereas the floor is formed mainly by the central five-stranded β-sheet. Helix α13 (connecting the two domains) forms the backside of the cleft. On the left side, the cleft is confined by the C-terminal tail going from the upper to the lower domain, whereas it opens up toward the right side of the cleft, which is formed by the loop region of the arm-like extension of the lower domain (Fig. 1). A TLS analysis (using four rigid groups) indicated considerable flexibility of the protein and identified libration modes of the upper and lower domains, which lead to an opening and closing of the substrate-binding cleft. A sequence alignment of eukaryotic DPP III enzymes reveals a high sequence identity between human, rat, and mouse DPP III (>90% identity), whereas these enzymes share only ∼40% sequence identity with yeast DPP III. Previously, five conserved regions were identified in such alignments (supplemental Fig. 2) (6Abramić M. Špoljarić J. Šimaga Š. Period. Biol. 2004; 106: 161-168Google Scholar, 7Abramić M.

In our structure, two of these five regions involve zinc-binding residues, whereas the others are located in close proximity to this site (supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, we performed an AMAS analysis (42Livingstone C.D. Barton G.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 745-756PubMed Google Scholar) on a sequence alignment of DPP III enzymes from human, rat, mouse, and yeast and calculated a conservation score that takes into account physicochemical properties of amino acid side chains. This score was then mapped onto the molecular surface of yeast DPP III, clearly indicating a high degree of conservation among eukaryotic DPP III enzymes especially around the zinc-binding site and the proposed active-site cleft (Fig. 3A). Specific conserved residues in the vicinity of the metal center include Glu-461, His-578, and Arg-582. Structurally equivalent residues are also found in the active sites of thermolysin (Glu-143, His-231, and Arg-203) and neprilysin (Glu-584, His-711, and Arg-717). In the latter enzymes, the glutamic acid residue has been shown to act as a general base in the deprotonation of the water molecule that attacks the scissile amide bond. The role of the histidine is to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate, whereas the arginine residue binds to the P1′ carbonyl oxygen (41Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar). A superposition of all three enzyme structures (based on the zinc-binding residues, His-His-Glu) reveals a very similar arrangement of these important residues (Fig. 2C). This close structural resemblance with thermolysin and neprilysin and the full conservation of these residues in DPP III enzymes indicate similarly important roles in catalysis. Predicted Mode of Substrate Binding—As yet, no structural information on DPP III-substrate complexes is available. We tried to identify possible modes of substrate binding based on comparisons with structures of inhibitor complexes of neprilysin and thermolysin. Specifically, we chose the complexes of thermolysin with phosphonamidate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-P-Leu-Ala (Protein Data Ba"

In Escherichia coli, the components of this pathway directly responsible for protein degradation are the ClpAP protease and its adaptor ClpS. We recently demonstrated that ClpAP is able to recognize N-end motifs in the absence of ClpS although with significantly reduced substrate affinity. In this study, a systematic sequence analysis reveals new features of N-end rule degradation signals. To achieve specificity, recognition of an N-end motif by the protease-adaptor complex uses both the identity of the N-terminal residue and a free α-amino group. Acidic residues near the first residue decrease substrate affinity, demonstrating that the identity of adjacent residues can affect recognition although significant flexibility is tolerated. However, shortening the distance between the N-end residue and the stably folded portion of a protein prevents degradation entirely, indicating that an N-end signal alone is not always sufficient for degradation. Together, these data define in vitro the sequence and structural requirements for the function of bacterial N-end signals.

Regulated proteolysis is fundamental for cellular survival because it provides an irreversible control mechanism. For example, progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle requires timely turnover of cyclins to synchronize and order specific events, such as DNA replication and chromosome segregation (1Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Proteolysis also initiates the SOS response to DNA damage in bacteria via degradation of the transcriptional repressor LexA (2Little J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 791-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Neher S.B. Flynn J.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A.

Health Perspect. 1985; 62: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Defective protein turnover can initiate events as diverse as loss of competence in Bacillus subtilis (5Turgay K. Hahn J. Burghoorn J. Dubnau D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6730-6738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and angiogenesis via Hif1 (hypoxia-inducible factor) in mammals (6Willam C. Masson N. Tian Y.M. Mahmood S.A.

The importance of proteolysis as a regulatory mechanism highlights the need to understand the mechanisms by which these proteases select the right substrates and avoid unintended protein destruction. Energy-dependent proteases are composed of an oligomeric ATP-dependent unfolding enzyme and an enclosed proteolytic chamber (7Sauer R.T. Bolon D.N. Burton B.M. Burton R.E. Flynn J.M. Grant R.A. Hersch G.L. Joshi S.A. Kenniston J.A. Levchenko I. Neher S.B. Oakes E.S. Siddiqui S.M. Wah D.A. Baker T.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The architecture of this chamber requires that substrates pass through an axial entry gate that is too narrow to allow entry of folded proteins. The unfoldase harnesses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive mechanical unfolding of protein substrates and to translocate the resultant denatured polypeptide into the proteolytic chamber for peptide bond cleavage (8Benaroudj N. Tarcsa E. Cascio P. Goldberg A.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, there are several proteolytic complexes; for example, the ClpX and ClpA ATPases unfold substrates and translocate the polypeptide chains into the ClpP proteolytic chamber for degradation (11Kim Y.I.

Known bacterial degradation signals vary in sequence complexity and in length from a few amino acids to roughly 10 residues (14Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins also confer or enhance recognition by binding both the substrate and the unfoldase. For example, one region of the SspB adaptor binds to the ClpX unfoldase, and another domain recognizes a region of the ssrA degradation tag, facilitating tethering of ssrA-tagged substrates to ClpXP and the probability of productive engagement (15Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Wah D.A. Levchenko I. Rieckhof G.E. Bolon D.N. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SspB and ClpX can bind the ssrA tag simultaneously, allowing SspB to hand off substrates to ClpX directly (17Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sequence determinants for the ssrA-SspB and ssrA-ClpX interactions have been characterized both structurally and biochemically (15Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T.

Cell. 2003; 12: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of adaptor-mediated delivery for substrates to ClpAP is not well understood. ClpS is a multifaceted adaptor, which enhances ClpAP turnover of N-end rule substrates but also prevents ClpAP from degrading other classes of substrates (20Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B.

Biol. 2008; 15: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because ClpS possesses both stimulatory and inhibitory activities, it can change the profile of ClpAP degradation dramatically. The evolutionarily conserved N-end rule relates the intracellular half-life of a protein to its N-terminal residue (25Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 26Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A.

In bacteria, proteins beginning with any of the three aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, or Trp) or the aliphatic residue Leu are degraded by ClpAP with assistance from ClpS (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Side chain hydrophobicity per se is not sufficient for N-end rule recognition, since Ile, Val, and Met do not target substrates for ClpAP degradation. Substrates with the same N-end rule residue but different adjacent sequences are also degraded with varying rates in vivo, indicating that residues beyond the N terminus affect degradation in the bacterial N-end rule (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is known that ClpS binds directly to both ClpAP and N-end rule substrates to enhance protein turnover. ClpAP also shows weak affinity for N-end substrates in the absence of ClpS. These observations raise several questions about the mechanism of N-end rule substrate recognition by ClpA and ClpS. What is the molecular basis of the sequence signal that determines how efficiently an N-end motif is recognized? What are the individual contributions of ClpA and ClpS in degrading N-end motif substrates? To address these questions, we mutagenized an N-end pentapeptide (YLFVQ) that efficiently targets substrates for ClpAP degradation (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and assayed the effects on in vitro degradation of GFP 4The abbreviations used are:GFPgreen fluorescent proteinSUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. 4The abbreviations used are:GFPgreen fluorescent proteinSUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. fusion proteins by ClpAP in the presence and absence of ClpS. We confirmed the importance of N-terminal Leu, Tyr, Trp, or Phe residues for robust ClpAPS degradation (26Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Competition experiments also established that modification of the α-amino group substantially diminished ClpAPS recognition. The N-end rule thus uses the combination of the N-terminal residue's side chain and the α-amino group as the principal recognition determinants of the degradation signal. The positive contributions of these two determinants are antagonized by the presence of acidic residues adjacent to the motif, demonstrating that sequence adjacent to the N-terminal residue influences recognition by ClpAPS. Furthermore, N-end signals are not sufficient to promote degradation if the distance between the folded region of the protein and the N-terminal residue is too short, indicating that there is also a structural component to the N-end rule. Examination of individual contributions of ClpS and ClpAP revealed that ClpS bound poorly to acidic N-end motifs but well to short N-end motifs, whereas ClpAP degraded some acidic N-end substrates efficiently but could not degrade short N-end motifs. We conclude that both ClpS and ClpA are important in determining the efficacy of N-end substrate processing. These results dissect the bacterial N-end rule into components that are important for recognition in vitro and show how the presence of ClpS alters the sequence selectivity of ClpAP. green fluorescent protein small ubiquitin-like modifier high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. green fluorescent protein small ubiquitin-like modifier high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. Plasmids and Proteins—GFP variants (GFPuv with serine at position 65 changed to threonine) and Y-titin were cloned into a pET23b.smt3 vector using AgeI and NotI sites (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequences of GFP variants are shown in Fig. 5A; “ASK” initiates the GFP sequence. For protein expression, substrates were subcloned into the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible vector pET23b.his6-smt3 (pET23b from Novagen) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21 λDE3 (28Malakhov M.P.

His6-SUMO-GFP fusions were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic aid affinity chromatography as described (28Malakhov M.P. Mattern M.R. Malakhova O.A. Drinker M. Weeks S.D. Butt T.R. J. Struct. Funct.

Some GFP variants were purified to >95% purity, using a low substitution phenyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) but were degraded at the same rate as GFP proteins not processed with this second purification step. ClpA, ClpP, ClpS, and 35S-YLFVQ-titin were purified as described (11Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol.

GFP (100 μm) was acid-denatured by adding hydrochloric acid to 25 mm for 5 min at room temperature (30Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GFP Degradation Assays—Loss of GFP fluorescence in degradation assays was monitored using a Photon Technology International fluorimeter (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 511 nm). ClpA6 (50 nm), (ClpP-His6)14 (100 nm), ClpS (450 nm), and GFP substrate (10 nm) were premixed as described at 30 °C (12Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For degradation reactions lacking ClpS, 100 nm ClpA6 and 200 nm ClpP14 were used. In Fig. 3, GFP concentrations from 50 nm to 16 μm were used. To initiate degradation, ATP (4 mm) was added at time 0. Initial changes in fluorescence were calculated from the linear portion of the kinetic trace, typically over the first 3 min, and converted to initial rates of GFP protein degradation using a linear standard curve relating fluorescence at 511 nm to GFP concentrations. For determination of steady-state kinetic parameters in Fig. 3, the average initial rates from three independent experiments were plotted as a function of the total substrate concentration. Since [GFP substrate] was not always in excess of [ClpAPS], the data were fitted (R2 > 0.95) by a nonlinear least squares algorithm to a quadratic version of the Michaelis-Menten equation.Vobs=kcat×((KM+[ClpAPS]o+[GFP]o)-((KM+[ClpAPS]o+[GFP])2-4×([ClpAPS]o×[GFP]o))0.5)/(2×[ClpAPS]o)(Eq. 1) Degradation reactions of unfolded GFP were performed using ClpA6 (800 nm), (ClpP-His6)14 (1.6 μm), and ClpS (4.8 μm). ATP regeneration mixture (4 mm ATP, 50 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm creatine phosphate) was added prior to the addition of unfolded GFP, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. Unfolded YA3-GFP (1.5 μm) was added at time 0 to initiate the reaction. At each time point, 10 μl of reaction mix was quenched by adding 2.5 μl of SDS loading buffer on ice. Samples were boiled and electrophoresed on a 15% Tris-glycine gel, which was stained with Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes) at a 1:5000 dilution in 7.5% acetic acid and scanned on a Typhoon 9400 imager (excitation, 488 nm; detection, 555 nm). Quantification was performed with ImageQuant 4.0, and intensities were normalized to the ClpP intensity in each lane. Three independent experiments were performed. A representative gel and quantification are shown in Fig. 5C. Peptide Competition Assays—Peptide competition assays were performed by assaying loss of YLFVQ-GFP fluorescence. β-Galactosidase peptides were synthesized by the MIT Biopolymers facility and contained the first 21 residues of β-galactosidase fused to different N-terminal residues. These peptides were added to a final concentration of 50 μm in reactions containing 50/100/450 nm ClpA/P/S and 500 nm YLFVQ-GFP; degradation was started by adding ATP. The YLFVQR peptide was acetylated by incubating 1 mm peptide in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.9) with 200 mm acetic anhydride overnight at room temperature. Acetyl-YLFVQR was purified by HPLC, lyophilized, and resuspended in H2O. The addition of a single acetyl group was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Acetyl-YLFVQR or unmodified YLFVQR peptide was added to degradation reactions containing 50/100/450 nm ClpA/P/S, 35 nm YLFVQ-GFP, and 3.3 or 6.6 μm peptide. The initial degradation rate in the absence of peptide was normalized to 1, and degradation rates in the presence of peptide competitor were determined relative to the initial rate and averaged (n = 3). Fluorescent Labeling of Peptides—Peptides with the sequence H2N-XLFVQYH6C (where X represents different N-terminal residues) were synthesized using an Apex 396 solid phase instrument, dissolved in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and incubated with 5 μg/ml maleimide-fluorescein (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. Fluorescein-labeled peptides were purified by HPLC, lyophilized, and resuspended in water. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured at 30 °C (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 520 nm) using 1.4 μm fluorescinated peptide and 1.4 μm ClpS. Protein Competition Assays—Samples containing 50/100/450 nm ClpA/P/S and 2 μm 35S-YLFVQ-titin were premixed with GFP competitor substrate (10 μm except for untagged GFP (a gift of P. Chien), which was used at 40 μm). Degradation was initiated by the addition of 4 mm ATP, and 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn every 30 s and quenched by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Degradation rates were determined from the time-dependent accumulation of radiolabeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides (11Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—ClpS binding experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument. ClpS was covalently bonded to a CM5 chip surface by amine coupling using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. A 300-response unit surface of immobilized ClpS was used for the binding studies, and another flow cell immobilized with 7000 response units of anti-ClpS antibody was used as a nonspecific binding control surface. GFP (440 nm) binding injections of 400 s were performed at a 30-μl/min flow rate in running buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% P20 surfactant). Each GFP injection was preceded by an identical buffer injection whose composition matched that of the GFP solution. The GFP-ClpS interaction responses were double-referenced by subtracting the SPR signal from the GFP injection over the control flow cell as well as the signal from the buffer injection over the ClpS surface. Specific Side Chains at the N-terminal Residue Are Critical for Recognition—To allow the N-terminal sequence of a model substrate (GFP) to be modified without constraints imposed by translational initiation or post-translational processing, we constructed and purified variants as His6-SUMO-X7-GFP fusions, cleaved these proteins with SUMO protease (28Malakhov M.P. Mattern M.R. Malakhova O.A. Drinker M. Weeks S.D. Butt T.R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and repurified the X7-GFP molecule to remove the protease and His6-SUMO fragment. The strong N-end motif YLFVQEL was used as a reference X7 sequence (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the glutamate-leucine was encoded by a SacI restriction site to facilitate cloning. Variants with the first Tyr replaced by other N-end rule residues (Phe, Leu, or Trp), by aliphatic side chains (Ile or Val), or by Thr were also constructed and purified. At low substrate concentrations where the rate of degradation by ClpAPS (ClpAP plus ClpS) was determined by the second order rate constant (kcat/Km), only the N-end rule substrates were degraded efficiently (Fig. 1A) (data not shown), consistent with the reported selectivity of the N-end rule (26Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Among good substrates, the variant with Phe at the N terminus was degraded most rapidly, whereas the variant with Tyr was degraded at the slowest rate. This difference arose from a ∼20% reduction in Km but not Vmax (not shown), suggesting modest differences in recognition of N-end residues by ClpAPS. As another probe of the importance of the N-terminal residue, we assayed ClpAPS degradation of YLFVQEL-GFP in the presence of a large excess of peptide competitor consisting of a variable N-terminal residue followed by the first 21 residues of E. coli β-galactosidase. Efficient competition was observed when the N-end rule residues Tyr or Leu were at the N terminus but not when Met or Arg occupied this position (Fig. 1B). Therefore, both direct degradation and competition assays can be applied to probe the sequence rules of the N-end signal. The α-Amino Group Is a Recognition Element of the N-end Rule—The purified precursor His6-SUMO-YLFVQEL-GFP protein was not degraded by ClpAPS (not shown), suggesting that the lack of a free N-terminal Tyr and/or the presence of “upstream” residues prevents recognition. To test the importance of a free α-amino group, we compared inhibition of ClpAPS degradation of YLFVQEL-GFP by the hexapeptide YLFVQR before and after blocking its N terminus by treatment with acetic anhydride. The unmodified peptide was a good inhibitor, whereas competition by the acetylated peptide was reduced substantially but not eliminated (Fig. 1C). The latter result was not caused by incomplete acetylation, since MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry before and after chemical modification gave single species of the expected masses (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the α-amino group is an important feature but is not an essential component of the N-end signal. Acidic Residues near the N-end Residue Weaken ClpAPS and ClpS Binding—We previously found that substrates with the same N-end residue but different neighboring sequences were degraded with different Km values, suggesting that residues beyond the N terminus affect functional interactions with ClpAPS (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To probe whether these effects are caused by packing or electrostatic interactions, we individually changed residues 2, 3, 4, and 5 of YLFVQEL-GFP to a basic residue (Arg), a small residue (Ala), or an acidic residue (Glu). When low concentrations of these substrates were tested for ClpAPS degradation, the Arg and Ala variants were degraded at rates similar to YLFVQEL-GFP (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that ClpAPS does not require specific side chains at positions 2–5 for efficient N-end degradation. By contrast, changing residue 2, 3, or 4 to Glu slowed degradation (Fig. 2C), with the largest effect observed when Glu was adjacent to the N-end residue. Indeed, replacing residue 2 with either Glu or Asp slowed degradation more than 10-fold, whereas changing this residue to Gln had only a small effect (Fig. 2D). Thus, the negative charge and not the shape of the position 2 side chain causes poor degradation by ClpAPS. A variant with residues 3–5 replaced by Glu (YLEEEEL-GFP) was degraded very slowly, suggesting that a net negative charge near the N-end residue is poorly tolerated by ClpAPS (Fig. 2D). To determine if the deleterious effects of acidic residues arose from poor substrate binding or slower turnover by ClpAPS, we determined steady-state kinetic parameters for the parental substrate YLFVQEL-GFP (Km = 26 nm; Vmax = 1.2 min-1) and for YEFVQLE-GFP (Km = 1400 nm; Vmax = 1.4 min-1) (Fig. 3). These results show that the principal effect of the Leu2→Glu substitution is an approximately 50-fold weakening of apparent affinity of the substrate for ClpAPS. We conclude that acidic side chains at residues 2–4 of N-end degradation signals interfere with ClpAPS binding but not processing. The “N-end receptor sites” in ClpS and/or ClpA may have a negative electrostatic potential that interacts unfavorably with negatively charged residues in the N-end signal. To examine the relative affinity of ClpS for acidic N-end signals, surface plasmon resonance was used to monitor binding of immobilized ClpS to YEFVQEL-GFP and YLFVEEL-GFP. The YEFVQEL-GFP protein, which was degraded slowly by ClpAPS, also bound poorly to ClpS (Fig. 4A). By contrast, YLFVEEL-GFP has the same net charge but was degraded 6-fold more rapidly by ClpAPS (Fig. 2C) and bound well to ClpS. These results show that acidic residues near the N-end residue influence ClpAPS degradation, at least in part, by weakening ClpS binding and also demonstrate that ClpS binding affinity is correlated with ClpAPS degradation activity of acidic N-end substrates. Is this ClpS binding defect entirely responsible for the slow degradation of YEFVQEL-GFP by ClpAPS? ClpAP can degrade N-end substrates without ClpS, but with 10–70-fold weaker apparent affinity than ClpAPS, depending on the sequence of the N-end signal (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that ClpAP degraded both YEFVQEL-GFP and YLFVQEL-GFP at similar rates, indicating that ClpAP itself is not inhibited by an acidic residue at position 2 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the presence of several acidic residues (YLEEEEL-GFP) near the N-end residue slowed substrate degradation by ClpAP. These results indicate that acidic N-end signals affect ClpAPS and ClpAP recognition differently. Length Determinants of N-end Signals—Erbse et al. (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) found that ClpAPS degraded GFP with an N-end Phe followed by a 10-residue linker but not when the N-terminal Phe was placed adjacent to GFP. In our YLFVQEL-GFP construct, the N-terminal Tyr is seven residues from the alanine that begins the GFP sequence (YLFVQELASK; the lysine begins the folded region of GFP). To address the role of linker length, we determined rates of ClpAPS degradation of constructs with six alanines between the N-terminal Tyr and the first residue of GFP (YA6-GFP) and variants with the linker reduced by two (YA4-GFP) or three residues (YA3-GFP). The YA6-GFP substrate was degraded by ClpAPS with a Km of 140 nm, a value 6-fold higher than the Km for YLFVQEL-GFP (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with a modest contribution of residues beyond the N terminus to ClpAPS interactions. The YA4-GFP substrate was degraded about 5-fold more slowly than YA6-GFP (Fig. 5A), showing that linker length influences degradation. No degradation of YA3-GFP was detected even at high substrate concentrations (Fig. 5B). Thus, GFP N-end tags that are too short pose a problem for ClpAPS. To determine if this defect is due to the proximity of a folded domain adjacent to the YA3 N-end signal, YA3-GFP was acid-denatured prior to the addition into a degradation reaction containing ClpAPS. Unfolded YA3-GFP was degraded rapidly, whereas native YA3-GFP was not turned over even using increased ClpAPS concentrations (Fig. 5C). This result indicates that N-end signals are not effective degradation motifs when located too close to the folded N-terminal region of the substrate. To establish whether ClpS or ClpAP is responsible for this observation, experiments were designed to test the roles of both recognition modules. Dissecting the Individual Contributions of ClpS and ClpAP to Substrate Recognition—In principle, ClpAPS might fail to degrade native YA3-GFP either because ClpS does not bind this protein and/or because ClpA cannot accept this protein from ClpS or cannot unfold it after transfer. In surface plasmon resonance assays, immobilized ClpS bound YLFVEEL-GFP and YA3-GFP to comparable extents but bound very poorly to ILFVQEL-GFP, a non N-end rule protein (Fig. 4A,6A). To verify that ClpS is selective for N-end residues, fluorescinated peptides with N-terminal Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Ile were incubated with ClpS, and fluorescence anisotropy was measured (Fig. 6B). All peptides except for the Ile variant produced an increase in anisotropy when ClpS was added, indicating that ClpS does not recognize an N-terminal Ile. Together, these data show that the inability of ClpAPS to degrade YA3-GFP does not arise from a ClpS binding defect (Fig. 6C). We determined rates of ClpAP degradation of YA3-GFP, ILFVQEL-GFP, LLFVQEL-GFP, and YLFVQEL-GFP in the absence of ClpS (Fig. 6D). Under these conditions, the non N-end substrate (ILFVQEL-GFP) was degraded at a rate similar to the two good N-end rule substrates (LLFVQEL-GFP and YLFVQEL-GFP). However, ClpAP did not degrade the short tag variant YA3-GFP (Fig. 6D). Thus, N-end residues located too close to the folded region of GFP do not serve as degradation signals for ClpAP or for ClpAPS. The preceding experiments suggest that the defect in YA3-GFP degradation arises after binding to ClpS. If this model is correct, then YA3-GFP should act as a competitor and inhibit ClpAPS degradation of another N-end rule substrate by blocking the N-end recognition site on ClpS. In contrast, because ILFVQEL-GFP is not recognized by ClpS but is degraded by ClpAP, this substrate may compete by occupying the degradation activity of ClpAP (Fig. 7A). Indeed, ClpAPS degradation of the characterized N-end substrate 35S-YLFVQMSHLA-titin (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was inhibited by the addition of YA3-GFP, LLFVQEL-GFP, and ILFVQEL-GFP but not by tagless GFP (Fig. 7B). LLFVQEL-GFP was a much better competitor than YA3-GFP or ILFVQEL-GFP. These results can be rationalized if LLFVQEL-GFP competes with the 35S-substrate for binding ClpS but also competes for a binding site in ClpAP, thereby inhibiting both initial recognition and subsequent unfolding and degradation by ClpAP. By contrast, ILFVQEL-GFP is a weaker inhibitor, because it only competes for ClpAP binding, and YA3-GFP is a weaker inhibitor, because it only competes for ClpS binding. Together with the results from Fig. 6, these data suggest that the efficiency of ClpAPS in degrading N-end rule substrates depends on recognition of the substrate by both ClpS and by ClpAP. The original discovery of the bacterial N-end rule identified four N-terminal residues (Leu, Phe, Trp, and Tyr) that target β-galactosidase for degradation (26Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It is now known that the ClpA unfoldase and the ClpS adaptor participate in recognition of N-end rule signals (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The results presented here further define the molecular basis for N-end rule sequence selectivity and the roles of ClpA and ClpS in recognition. We confirmed that the expected N-end residues mediated ClpAPS degradation of GFP variants with modest differences in efficiency in the order Phe > Leu > Trp > Tyr. By contrast, GFP with an N-terminal Ile showed no detectable ClpAPS degradation at low concentrations, where N-end rule substrates were efficiently degraded. Thus, ClpAPS recognition is highly selective, discriminating between side chains as similar as Leu and Ile. In addition to the N-terminal side chain, we find that a free α-amino group contributes to but is not essential for ClpAPS binding. This finding is consistent with studies showing that blocking the N terminus of an otherwise good N-end rule signal reduced ClpS binding on a peptide blot (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ClpS is required for high affinity interactions with N-end rule substrates (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and we find that ClpS alone discriminates between substrates with good N-end rule residues and those with Ile at the N terminus. Thus, ClpS enhances the degradation of N-end substrates by ClpAP by recognizing the α-amino group in combination with a Leu, Phe, Trp, or Tyr side chain at the N terminus (Fig. 8A). Our results show that residues adjacent to the N-end residue influence the affinity of ClpAPS interactions. Specific side chains at these positions are not required. For example, changing the N-end signal of YLFVQEL-GFP to YAAAAAA-GFP increased the Km for degradation only 6-fold, indicating that residues make small contributions to apparent affinity. Notably, however, an acidic residue at position 2 (YEFVQEL-GFP) increased Km 50-fold; a variant with acidic residues at positions 3–5 (YLEEEEL-GFP) was also a very poor ClpAPS substrate. These effects are probably caused by repulsion between acidic residues in ClpAPS and those in these N-end signals, which is consistent with the slower in vivo degradation of substrates carrying acidic N-end sequences (22Wang K.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that ClpS alone bound YEFVQEL-GFP very poorly compared with YLFVEEL-GFP, and mutational studies suggest that Asp35 and Asp36 of ClpS form part of its binding site for N-end signals (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Negative electrostatic potential in this binding site would help bind the positively charged α-amino group of N-end signals. Moreover, some endogenous N-end signals contain a basic residue at position 2, because aminoacyl transferase adds Leu or Phe to bacterial proteins with an N-terminal Lys or Arg (26Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems likely that discrimination against acidic N-end sequences is a consequence of optimizing binding to N-end signals with an overall positive charge. Importantly, our results and those of Erbse et al. (21Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) demonstrate that proteins with N-end signals bind ClpS but are not necessarily ClpAPS substrates. Specifically, in our work, ClpAPS and ClpAP did not degrade YA3-GFP, although ClpS bound this protein well. By contrast, ClpAPS degraded a variant with one extra residue between the N-end Tyr and GFP (YA4-GFP), although less rapidly than it degraded a substrate with a longer linker (YA6-GFP). Apparently, the distance between the N-end residue and the folded region of GFP must be sufficiently long to allow degradation, but this requirement is obviated when YA3-GFP is unfolded. This length dependence could arise because steric restrictions prevent access of short GFP N-end tags to a binding site in the ClpA hexamer. Alternatively, such tags might be engaged by ClpA but be too short to allow a strong enough grip to allow unfolding. Based on our results, we propose that N-terminal sequences have a wide range of abilities to target native proteins for ClpAPS degradation (Fig. 8B). At one extreme are short tags like YA3, which do not target GFP for degradation, although they have an N-end residue and bind ClpS well. Next are tags like ILFVQEL that do not have an authentic N-end residue or acidic N-end signals, such as YEFVQEL, that do not bind ClpS but can be engaged by sites in ClpAP. In the middle of the spectrum are signals with N-end residues that that have weaker affinities for ClpAPS because of the presence of negatively charged residues; both the number and positions of acidic residues appear to determine precise affinity. At the other extreme are strong N-end signals, such as YLFVQEL, that allow efficient ClpAPS degradation at nanomolar substrate concentrations. Our results also raise several questions regarding the eukaryotic N-end rule, which recognizes the additional N-end residues Ile (in some organisms), Arg, Lys, and His. The N-end signal receptor Ubr1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that possesses a binding site for N-terminal Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile and a separate site for N-terminal Arg, Lys, and His (31Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Interestingly, N-terminal Asp and Glu are recognized by the argininyl transferase Ate1p (32Balzi E. Choder M. Chen W.N. Varshavsky A. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7464-7471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which conjugates an Arg residue to these N termini. Is an N-terminal Arg residue recognized less efficiently when the second residue is acidic? If acidic residues in Ubr1 are important for docking the α-amino group and the Arg for this type of N-end signal, then electrostatic repulsion with acidic residues on the N-end signal may reduce binding affinity just as in the case of ClpS. Additionally, are shorter N-end sequences bound by Ubr1, and are these substrates ubiquitinated efficiently? Does the proteasome possess the same steric requirements for N-end signal length as ClpAP, although N-end substrates carry polyubiquitin chains as their proteasome localization determinants? At present, it is not known how N-end substrates for ClpAPS are generated in the cell. Proteins with good N-end residues do not arise from translation and normal post-translational processing, because the initiator formyl-Met of proteins with second residues Phe, Leu, Trp, or Tyr is not removed by methionine aminopeptidase (33Flinta C. Persson B. Jornvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The next challenge will be to isolate endogenous N-end substrates and to determine the extent and impact of sequence control in the N-end rule degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2103093306,"Intracellular heme is a redox active molecule that can be detrimental to cells at high concentrations or under oxidizing conditions. To prevent accumulation, the inducible enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) catalyzes degradation of heme. In the absence of elevated intracellular heme or oxidative stress, the basic region leucine zipper transcriptional regulator BACH1 binds HMOX1 antioxidant response elements and represses transcription. Conversely, increased intracellular heme or sulfhydryl oxidation inactivate BACH1, permitting transcriptional induction of HMOX1. Here, we investigate the effect of BACH1 inactivation on the induction of HMOX1 and as a mechanism for broader gene induction. We show that BACH1 is inactivated at low micromolar arsenite concentrations and that BACH1 inactivation is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional induction of HMOX1. Because BACH1 is thought to interact with antioxidant response element motifs, we further examined the role of BACH1 as a regulator of inducible antioxidant gene expression by assessing the global profile of gene expression following BACH1 knockdown using small interfering RNA. The loss of BACH1 function in human keratinocytes results almost exclusively in HMOX1 induction, suggesting that BACH1 may function as a rheostat regulating levels of intracellular free heme."
https://openalex.org/W2028216008,"Concomitant with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, RNA maturation factors are recruited to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II, whose phosphorylation state changes during a transcription cycle. CTD phosphorylation triggers recruitment of functionally different factors involved in RNA processing and transcription termination; most of these factors harbor a conserved CTD interacting domain (CID). Orchestration of factor recruitment is believed to be conducted by CID recognition of distinct phosphorylated forms of the CTD. We show that the human RNA processing factor SCAF8 interacts weakly with the unphosphorylated CTD of Pol II. Upon phosphorylation, affinity for the CTD is increased; however, SCAF8 is promiscuous to the phosphorylation pattern on the CTD. Employing a combined structural and biophysical approach, we were able to distinguish motifs within CIDs that are involved in a generic CTD sequence recognition from items that confer phospho-specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2066542032,"Rap1b has been implicated in the transduction of the cAMP mitogenic signal. It is phosphorylated and activated by cAMP, and its expression in models where cAMP is mitogenic leads to proliferation and tumorigenesis. Akt is a likely downstream effector of cAMP-Rap1 action. cAMP elevation induced a rapid and transient Akt inhibition that required activated and phosphorylated Rap1b. However, the mechanism(s) by which cAMP-Rap regulates Akt remains unclear. Here we show that (i) upstream regulators, PIK and PDK1, are not the target(s) of the cAMP inhibitory action; (ii) constitutively active Akt and calyculin A-stimulated Akt are resistant to cAMP inhibition, suggesting the action of a phosphatase; (iii) cAMP increases the rate of Akt dephosphorylation, directly implicating an Akt-phosphatase; (iv) Epac- and protein kinase A (PKA)-specific analogs synergistically inhibit Akt, indicating the involvement of both cAMP-dependent effector pathways; (v) H89 and dominant negative Epac 279E block cAMP-inhibitory action; (vi) Epac associates in a complex with Akt and PP2A, and the associated-phosphatase activity is positively modulated by cAMP in a PKA- and Rap1-dependent manner; (vii) like its action on Akt inhibition, PKA- and Epac-specific analogs synergistically activate Epac-associated PP2A; and (viii) dominant negative PP2A blocks cAMP-inhibitory action. Thus, we uncovered a novel cAMP-Epac/PKA-Rap1b-PP2A signaling module involved in Akt regulation that may represent a physiological event in the process of cAMP stimulation of thyroid mitogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2084210410,"The hydrolytic cleavage of the hydantoin ring of allantoin, catalyzed by allantoinase, is required for the utilization of the nitrogen present in purine-derived compounds.

Here we show that an alternative allantoinase gene (puuE) can be precisely identified by analyzing its logic relationship with three other genes of the pathway. The novel allantoinase is annotated in structure and sequence data bases as polysaccharide deacetylase for its homology with enzymes that catalyze hydrolytic reactions on chitin or peptidoglycan substrates.

Allantoin ((2,5-dioxoimidazolidin-4-yl)urea) is one of the most nitrogen-rich organic compounds. Some plants economize carbon by using this compound as a nitrogen carrier instead of glutamine and glutamate that have less favorable nitrogen-carbon ratios (1Todd C.D. Tipton P.A. Blevins D.G. Piedras P. Pineda M. Polacco J.C. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Conversely, soil animals eliminate the excess of nitrogen present in purine bases mainly in the form of uric acid and allantoin. In turn, microorganisms can utilize these compounds as nitrogen sources by degrading them to carbon dioxide, glyoxylate, and ammonia (2Vogels G.D. Van der Drift C. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 403-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The metabolic routes to and from allantoin are straightforward; there is only one known path for its formation and degradation (see Fig. 1A). Allantoin is formed from uric acid, in a three-step enzymatic pathway that has been recently elucidated (3Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The last step of the pathway is the decarboxylation of 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-ureido-imidazoline (OHCU) 3The abbreviations used are:OHCU2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-ureido-imidazolineHYNhydantoinACA5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide hydrochloride. 3The abbreviations used are:OHCU2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-ureido-imidazolineHYNhydantoinACA5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide hydrochloride.; OHCU is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to racemic allantoin (4Kahn K.

However, because OHCU decarboxylase is strictly stereoselective, only the S enantiomer of allantoin is formed in nature (5Kim K. Park J. Rhee S. J. Biol.

In turn, allantoate can be acted upon by two different enzymes to release ammonia (upon allantoate amidohydrolase) or urea (upon allantoicase). Given that the cleavage of the hydantoin ring is required for the utilization of the nitrogen present in the allantoin molecule, no organism is expected to be able to use allantoin for growth without possessing allantoinase activity. This activity is indeed especially common in microorganisms, and it has been documented in various bacterial and yeast species (2Vogels G.D. Van der Drift C. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 403-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A gene coding for allantoinase (DAL1) was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Buckholz R.G. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1991; 7: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The corresponding protein revealed a clear sequence similarity with other enzymes acting on cyclic amide rings, such as hydantoinases and dihydroorotases (9LaPointe G. Viau S. LeBlanc D. Robert N. Morin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 888-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By structural comparisons, these proteins were then included in a large superfamily (comprising urease, adenine deaminase, and other hydrolases) characterized by a common structural core consisting of an ellipsoidal (β/α)8 barrel and a conserved metal-binding site (10Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Genes coding for proteins with allantoinase activity have been documented in amphibians, insects, bacteria, and plants (11Gaines P.J. Tang L. Wisnewski N. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Hayashi S. Jain S. Chu R. Alvares K. Xu B. Erfurth F. Usuda N. Rao M.S. Reddy S.K. Noguchi T. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kim G.J. Lee D.E. Kim H.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7021-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Yang J. Han K.H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); they are all homologous to DAL1 and constitute a monophyletic group in the amidohydrolase superfamily, thus making identification of allantoinase genes in sequence data bases straightforward. Surprisingly, however, no DAL1 sequences are found in organisms that are known to use allantoin as a nitrogen source. It is known, for example, that Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses allantoinase activity (15Janssen D.B. Joosten H.M. Herst P.M. van der Drift C. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a strain with a defective allantoinase gene, named puuE (purine utilization E), has been described (16Matsumoto H. Ohta S. Kobayashi R. Terawaki Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 167: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, allantoinase activity and a mutant strain that cannot grow on media containing allantoin as a sole nitrogen source have been identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (17Fluri R. Kinghorn J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). Yet genes coding for allantoinase do not appear to be present in the genomes of these organisms.To find the genes responsible for the allantoinase activity in these and other organisms, we have utilized genome comparison looking for a gene whose presence or absence in whole genomes followed a particular logic relation (18Bowers P.M. Cokus S.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Science. 2004; 306: 2246-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with three other genes of the purine degradation pathways. In accordance with the biochemical pathway, the presence of this candidate gene in a given genome would imply the absence of DAL1 and the presence of either allantoicase or allantoate amidohydrolase (see Fig. 1A). We show that a previously uncharacterized gene exhibiting this logic relationship, whereas related to polysaccharide deacetylases and lacking sequence similarity with the known allantoinase, encodes a protein that specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of (S)-allantoin into allantoic acid. The determination of the three-dimensional coordinates of the protein in complex with substrate analogs allowed us to relate the functional properties of the protein to its structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBioinformatics—We first selected genes known or presumed through chromosomal proximity to be involved in purine degradation. Hidden Markov models of the corresponding protein families were downloaded from Pfam and used to search protein sets deriving from complete genomes with the pfam_scan.pl script (19Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). Protein sets of 138 complete genomes were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site. Proteins obtained with the pfam_ scan.pl search were divided in orthologous groups by using OrthoMCL (20Li L. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Roos D.S. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (4023) Google Scholar) at an inflation index of 2.0. Proteins belonging to orthologous groups were encoded as present “1” or absent “0” in a binary vector describing their genomic distribution.Vectors were then combined according to the logic relationship D ↔ A (B V C), where A, B, and C are DAL1 allantoinase, allantoate amidohydrolase, and allantoicase, respectively, and D is an unknown protein. A dedicated Perl script was used to evaluate the agreement of different vector combinations to the logic relationship, as measured by the “uncertainty coefficient” (18Bowers P.M. Cokus S.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Science. 2004; 306: 2246-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Significance of the logic relationship was calculated by applying the right-sided Fisher's exact text to a 2 × 2 contingency table with the observed outcomes of the logic expressions. The Ngram Statistic Package of Perl was used for calculations.Multiple sequence alignments were carried out with the profile mode of Clustalw (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) using the superposition of the polysaccharide deacetylase structures as a guide; structural superpositions were obtained with Vector Alignment Search Tool at the NCBI. Protein alignments decorated with structural elements were visualized using the Espript server. The size of the PuuE tetramer was estimated from the three-dimensional coordinates with Moleman2. Interactions between PuuE chains were analyzed with PDBsum. Pymol was used to study models and generate figures. The topological representation of PuuE was constructed with TopDraw (22Bond C.S. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Chemicals—All of the reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Pseudomonas fluorescens type strain was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM 50090). (S)-Allantoin used in the CD assays was produced through the degradation of uric acid (0.2 mm) in the presence of 0.16 units of urate oxidase from Candida utilis, 0.12 μg of zebrafish 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase (23Zanotti G. Cendron L. Ramazzina I. Folli C. Percudani R. Berni R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and 6 μg of zebrafish OHCU decarboxylase (6Cendron L. Berni R. Folli C. Ramazzina I. Percudani R. Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18182-18189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reactions were conducted in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6. 15N,13C-Labeled (S)-allantoin used in NMR assays was produced through the degradation of 15N,13C-labeled uric acid (3Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (6.9 mm) in the presence of 20 units of urate oxidase from C. utilis, 28 units of catalase from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Fluka), 3.7 μg of zebrafish HIU hydrolase, and 25 μg of zebrafish OHCU decarboxylase. The reactions were conducted in 1.1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 80% D2O, pD 7.6.Cloning, Gene Expression, and Protein Purification—Genomic DNA was prepared from P. fluorescens using described procedures (24Kalia A. Rattan A. Chopra P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The region encoding the P. fluorescens PuuE protein (GenBank™ accession number EU293536) was PCR-amplified using Go Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and two sequence specific primers: an NdeI-tailed upstream primer (5′-CATATGAGCGCTGACTACCC-3′) and a downstream primer (5′-TTCGTAGATGTCGGCGAAG-3′).The amplification product was inserted into the pGEM vector (Promega) to generate the intermediate vector pGEM-PuuE. The restriction fragment obtained from NdeI digestion of plasmid pGEM-PuuE was then ligated into the dephosphorylated NdeI site of the expression vector pET11b (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was sequenced on both strands and electroporated into Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus cells (DE3).The expression of PuuE was induced at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; after 72 h at 12 °C the cells were resuspended in 180 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 8) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were lysed by four 15-s bursts of sonication. PuuE was purified to homogeneity, as assessed by 12% SDS-PAGE analysis, by gel filtration (Sephadex-G100, Pharmacia) with a final yield of ∼3.5 mg/l of cell culture. The ϵ280 nm (extinction coefficient) of PuuE was estimated to be 63830 m-1 cm-1, based on the amino acid sequence.The molecular weight of purified PuuE was estimated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column (Pharmacia) (55 × 1.5 cm), using buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.6) for equilibration and elution. The markers used were human retinol-binding protein (21.3 kDa), human transthyretin (55 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.4 kDa), and cystathionine β-lyase (163.9 kDa).Protein Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—The crystals were obtained with the isothermal vapor diffusion technique in the hanging drop setting at 4 °C, after mixing equal volumes of 10 mg/ml recombinant PuuE in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.03 m K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, and a precipitant solution containing 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 30% polyethylene glycol 8000. They belong to the P4 tetragonal space group, with cell parameters a = b = 98.13 Å and c = 62.10 Å. The Matthews coefficient (Vm) value of about 2.05 corresponds to the presence of two monomers/asymmetric unit and a solvent content of about 39% of the cell volume. Analogous crystals were grown for complexes with 0.7 mm hydantoin (HYN) and 0.7 mm 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide hydrochloride (ACA).Diffraction data were measured at the ID14-eh1 and ID29 beamlines of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Three data sets were collected without adding any cryoprotectant for the uncomplexed enzyme (1.58 Å resolution) and the two complexes with HYN (1.8 Å resolution) and ACA (2.25 Å resolution). X-ray data collections were processed with the software MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) and merged and scaled with SCALA (26Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar). The structure of the native enzyme was solved using the molecular replacement method with the program Phaser (27McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Journal of Applied Crystallography. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14133) Google Scholar), starting from the crystal structure of a putative polysaccharide deacetylase from P. aeruginosa (PAO1) as a template (Protein Data Bank code 1Z7A). The refinement was carried out including two monomers in the asymmetric unit, by the software Refmac (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar) and SHELXL (29Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), alternated by manual adjustments. The examination of the Fo - Fc electron density map for the complex with HYN showed a clear difference density in the putative active site cavity of both the monomers present in the asymmetric unit, and this volunteer electron density had the expected molecular features of this small planar molecule. Analogous results were obtained for the complex with ACA, even if the electron density was less well defined. Coordinates and topology of HYN and ACA compounds were generated by the Dundee PRODRG2 Server (30Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). The crystallographic R factors for the uncomplexed enzyme and for the complexes with HYN and ACA were reduced to final values of 0.208 (Rfree = 0.232), 0.199 (Rfree = 0.225), and 0.207 (Rfree = 0.230), respectively.Biochemical Assays—Circular dichroism measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a 10-mm path length cuvette with a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter. PuuE activity was determined using (S)-allantoin (0.2 mm) or (R,S)-allantoin (0.4 mm) as substrates in the presence of PuuE (0.37 μm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6. CD spectra were recorded in the 200-350-nm range for 10 min, one spectrum every min. PuuE activity was also determined using a Varian Cary 1E UV-visible spectrophotometer, by the addition of (R,S)-allantoin (0.63 mm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6.To evaluate the velocity of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction at different substrate concentrations, CD signals were monitored at a fixed wavelength (215 nm). The reactions were initiated by the addition of PuuE (0.19 μm) to 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing different concentrations of (R,S)-allantoin or allantoic acid as substrates. The substrate concentrations varied between 0.015 and 0.86 mm for allantoin and between 0.028 and 7.81 mm for allantoic acid. The reaction rate was obtained for each substrate concentration by linear fitting of data points collected over the first 15 s of the reaction. The kinetics experiments were carried out in triplicate.The equilibrium constants for the conversion of allantoin to allantoic acid were calculated by measuring the direction of CD signals (λ = 215 nm, 25 °C) upon enzyme addition at different product/substrate ratios. Allantoic acid/(R,S)-allantoin ratios varied between 70/30 and 99/1.The metal content of active PuuE preparations was determined spectrophotometrically using the chelator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol. The 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol solution (5 mm) was prepared in Milli-Q water, pH 9. The enzyme (10 μm) was denatured in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 8 m urea, pH 8, and supplemented with 0.1 mm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, and the absorbance in the 200-800-nm range was recorded using a Varian Cary 1E spectrophotometer. A calibration curve was obtained using ZnCl2 (0.0-6.0 μm) by monitoring the absorbance at 500 nm. The effect of the addition of metal ions on the enzyme activity was determined by preincubating the enzyme with buffers containing from 2- to 500-fold excess metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+). The protein activity was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. The experiments were also carried out by preincubating the enzyme with EDTA (2.5-250 mm).To obtain 13C NMR spectra of the product of the PuuE-catalyzed reaction, a 1.1-ml solution of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 80% D2O, pD 7.6, containing 15N,13C-labeled (S)-allantoin (6.9 mm) was supplemented with PuuE (0.54 μm); the solution was gently stirred for 1 min and then transferred in a 5-mm NMR tube to collect spectra at different times. The 13C NMR spectra were proton decoupled and were collected at 25 °C with a VARIAN Inova 600 instrument.RESULTSLogical Identification of puuE—Given three genes of the purine degradation pathway, DAL1 allantoinase (A), allantoate amidohydrolase (B), and allantoicase (C), we want to find a fourth gene (D) whose presence in complete genomes is consistent with the logic relationship D ↔ A (B V C). In other words, D is present if and only if A is absent and B or C are present. Genes of purine degradation are often clustered in prokaryotes, and in some cases even in eukaryotes (31Wong S. Wolfe K.H. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The search was therefore restricted to genes that are found, at least in some instances, in the proximity of genes involved in purine degradation.After careful distinction between orthologous and paralogous families (see methods for details), the search in a set of 138 genomes identified a single strong candidate (Fig. 1). The logic expression relating D to the other three genes is false in four of the 52 genomes where A or D are found. In the remaining 86 genomes, 13 contain genes that were classified as allantoicase or allantoate amidohydrolase. Exceptions to the logical rule deduced by the metabolic pathway are not unexpected. They can arise by limitations of the gene search and classification procedure or represent true biological exceptions. An example of the latter case is the presence in mammals of an allantoicase ortholog that has a different function (32Vigetti D. Monetti C. Prati M. Gornati R. Bernardini G. Gene. 2002; 289: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Overall, the logic expression relating D to DAL1 allantoinase, allantoate amidohydrolase, and allantoicase is true in 121 of 138 genomes, with an uncertainty coefficient (U) (18Bowers P.M. Cokus S.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Science. 2004; 306: 2246-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) of 0.43 (p < 10-14).The pattern of presence and absence of the four genes across genomes is largely independent from species phylogeny. While maintaining the logic relation, the assortment of the four genes has been modified several times during evolution by events of gene loss or gain (Fig. 1B). As pointed out in previous studies, multiple correlated events of gene loss or gain make a compelling case for the existence of a functional link (33Barker D. Pagel M. PLoS. Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Because of its relations with other genes of the purine degradation pathway, we considered the gene D responsible for the allantoinase activity found in Pseudomonas, S. pombe, and other organisms and named it puuE after the allantoinase mutant described in P. aeruginosa (16Matsumoto H. Ohta S. Kobayashi R. Terawaki Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 167: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by puuE has sequence similarity with enzymes that remove N-linked or O-linked acetyl groups of cell wall polysaccharides. Although acting on quite different substrates, polysaccharide deacetylases catalyze a hydrolytic reaction similar to that catalyzed by allantoinase.Function of the PuuE Protein—Recombinant PuuE (308 amino acids) was cloned from P. fluorescens and overproduced in E. coli. The purified protein eluted from a calibrated gel filtration column with an estimated molecular mass of ∼140 kDa, consistent with a homotetrameric assembly.When PuuE was assayed by CD spectroscopy using (S)-allantoin as substrate, we observed the disappearance of the (S)-allantoin spectrum (Fig. 2A, upper panel). When PuuE was assayed with the racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-allantoin as substrate, we observed the formation of the (R)-allantoin spectrum (Fig. 2A, lower panel); once it had reached its maximum value, the spectrum decayed at the same rate as the spontaneous racemization of allantoin (34Kahn K. Tipton P.A. Bioorganic Chemistry. 2000; 28: 62-72Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (not shown), indicating that the enzyme has an absolute stereospecificity for the S enantiomer of allantoin. The formation of allantoic acid in the reaction catalyzed by PuuE could be unambiguously assessed by NMR spectroscopy using 13C-labeled (S)-allantoin (Fig. 2B). The reaction appears to be reversible; when PuuE was assayed by CD spectroscopy using high concentrations of allantoic acid as substrate, we observed the formation of the (S)-allantoin spectrum (not shown). An equilibrium ratio of allantoic acid to (S)-allantoin of 68:1 was calculated by measuring the direction of shift upon enzyme addition at different product/substrate ratios.FIGURE 2Biochemical activity of the PuuE protein.

Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The velocity of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of (S)-allantoin at different substrate concentrations shows a hyperbolic relationship, with a Km of 0.26 mm and a Kcat of 12.6 s-1. The reverse reaction, the stereoselective condensation of allantoic acid to form (S)-allantoin, is catalyzed by the enzyme with a Km of 2.4 mm and a Kcat of 1.6 s-1. The enzyme activity was also assayed with compounds similar to allantoin: hydantoin, hydantoin-5-acetic acid, 2-imidazolidone, 4 (5Kim K. Park J. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23457-23464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)-imidazole-carboxaldehyde, and 5-amino-4-imidazole-carboxamide hydrochloride. None of these compounds proved to be a substrate of the enzyme. However, hydantoin and 5-amino-4-imidazole-carboxamide hydrochloride were found to inhibit allantoin hydrolysis.Because all of the known PuuE homologs as well as DAL1 allantoinases have been reported to depend on bivalent metals for catalysis (35Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Blair D.E. Schuttelkopf A.W. MacRae J.I. van Aalten D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 10968-10975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we carried out experiments to determine whether the catalytic activity of PuuE depends on metals. Metal chelators did not influence the enzyme activity, and the enzyme was not activated by incubation with Zn2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+. Furthermore, in 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol-based assays, enzymatically active PuuE preparations revealed a very low (<0.1) metal/protein ratio.The PuuE Family—PuuE allantoinase belongs to a large family named polysaccharide deacetylase that comprises in sequence data bases more than 2000 proteins from about 700 species. The structures of several members of the family are known from structural genomics and dedicated studies (36Blair D.E. Schuttelkopf A.W. MacRae J.I. van Aalten D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1998930337,"Among the recently discovered Staphylococcus aureus immune evasion proteins, Sbi is unique in its ability to interact with components of both the adaptive and innate immune systems of the host. Sbi domains I and II (Sbi-I and Sbi-II) bind IgG. Sbi domain IV (residues 198-266) binds the central complement protein C3. When linked to Sbi-III, Sbi-IV induces a futile consumption of complement via alternative pathway activation, whereas isolated Sbi-IV specifically inhibits the alternative pathway without complement consumption. Here we have determined the three-dimensional structure of Sbi-IV by NMR spectroscopy, showing that Sbi-IV adopts a three-helix bundle fold similar to those of the S. aureus complement inhibitors Efb-C, Ehp, and SCIN. The (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectrum of Sbi-III indicates that this domain, essential for futile complement consumption, is natively unfolded, at least when isolated from the rest of Sbi. Sbi-IV and Sbi-III-IV both bind C3dg with 1:1 stoichiometry and submicromolar affinity. Despite low overall sequence identity, Sbi possesses the same residues as Efb at two positions essential for Efb-C binding to C3d. Mutation to alanine of either of these residues, Arg-231 and Asn-238, abolishes both Sbi-IV binding to C3dg and Sbi-IV alternative pathway inhibition. The almost complete conservation of Sbi-III and Sbi-IV amino acid sequences across more than 30 strains isolated from human and animal hosts indicates that the unique mechanism of Sbi in complement system subversion is a feature of infections of both humans and economically important animals."
https://openalex.org/W2126534365,"Sodium channel Nav1.7 has recently elicited considerable interest as a key contributor to human pain. Gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 produce painful disorders, whereas loss-of-function Nav1.7 mutations produce insensitivity to pain. The inherited erythromelalgia Nav1.7/F1449V mutation, within the C terminus of domain III/transmembrane helix S6, shifts channel activation by -7.2 mV and accelerates time to peak, leading to nociceptor hyperexcitability. We constructed a homology model of Nav1.7, based on the KcsA potassium channel crystal structure, which identifies four phylogenetically conserved aromatic residues that correspond to DIII/F1449 at the C-terminal end of each of the four S6 helices. The model predicted that changes in side-chain size of residue 1449 alter the pore's cytoplasmic aperture diameter and reshape inter-domain contact surfaces that contribute to closed state stabilization. To test this hypothesis, we compared activation of wild-type and mutant Nav1.7 channels F1449V/L/Y/W by whole cell patch clamp analysis. All but the F1449V mutation conserve the voltage dependence of activation. Compared with wild type, time to peak was shorter in F1449V, similar in F1449L, but longer for F1449Y and F1449W, suggesting that a bulky, hydrophobic residue is necessary for normal activation. We also substituted the corresponding aromatic residue of S6 in each domain individually with valine, to mimic the naturally occurring Nav1.7 mutation. We show that DII/F960V and DIII/F1449V, but not DI/Y405V or DIV/F1752V, regulate Nav1.7 activation, consistent with well established conformational changes in DII and DIII. We propose that the four aromatic residues contribute to the gate at the cytoplasmic pore aperture, and that their ring side chains form a hydrophobic plug which stabilizes the closed state of Nav1.7. Sodium channel Nav1.7 has recently elicited considerable interest as a key contributor to human pain. Gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 produce painful disorders, whereas loss-of-function Nav1.7 mutations produce insensitivity to pain. The inherited erythromelalgia Nav1.7/F1449V mutation, within the C terminus of domain III/transmembrane helix S6, shifts channel activation by -7.2 mV and accelerates time to peak, leading to nociceptor hyperexcitability. We constructed a homology model of Nav1.7, based on the KcsA potassium channel crystal structure, which identifies four phylogenetically conserved aromatic residues that correspond to DIII/F1449 at the C-terminal end of each of the four S6 helices. The model predicted that changes in side-chain size of residue 1449 alter the pore's cytoplasmic aperture diameter and reshape inter-domain contact surfaces that contribute to closed state stabilization. To test this hypothesis, we compared activation of wild-type and mutant Nav1.7 channels F1449V/L/Y/W by whole cell patch clamp analysis. All but the F1449V mutation conserve the voltage dependence of activation. Compared with wild type, time to peak was shorter in F1449V, similar in F1449L, but longer for F1449Y and F1449W, suggesting that a bulky, hydrophobic residue is necessary for normal activation. We also substituted the corresponding aromatic residue of S6 in each domain individually with valine, to mimic the naturally occurring Nav1.7 mutation. We show that DII/F960V and DIII/F1449V, but not DI/Y405V or DIV/F1752V, regulate Nav1.7 activation, consistent with well established conformational changes in DII and DIII. We propose that the four aromatic residues contribute to the gate at the cytoplasmic pore aperture, and that their ring side chains form a hydrophobic plug which stabilizes the closed state of Nav1.7.

Most IEM mutations in Nav1.7 are clustered in transmembrane segments (S1, S4, S5, and S6) and linkers joining S4 and S5 of domains I (DI) and DII (6Dib-Hajj S.D. Cummins T.R. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Waxman S.G. Dib-Hajj S. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the F1449V mutation, which causes inherited erythromelalgia in the largest family studied to date, is located more distally at the cytoplasmic end of the S6 segment of DIII and the juncture with L3, the cytosolic loop which joins DIII and DIV (13Dib-Hajj S.D. Rush A.M. Cummins T.R. Hisama F.M. Novella S. Tyrrell L. Marshall L. Waxman S.G. Brain. 2005; 128: 1847-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because L3 carries the peptide motif IFM, which functions as the fast inactivation gate of sodium channels (20Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the F1449V Nav1.7 mutation affects steady state fast inactivation (13Dib-Hajj S.D. Rush A.M. Cummins T.R. Hisama F.M. Novella S. Tyrrell L. Marshall L. Waxman S.G. Brain. 2005; 128: 1847-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In contrast, the basis of the F1449V effect on channel activation is not obvious. We therefore constructed a homology model of Nav1.7, to test possible structural features that might underlie the altered channel activation. Here we show that phylogenetically conserved aromatic residues, located at equivalent positions in each S6 helix relative to the conserved “gating-hinge” glycine (or serine in DIV/S6) residue, contribute to the putative cytoplasmic activation gate of Nav1.7, possibly by forming a hydrophobic plug, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. Our results also show that substitution of DIII/F1449 with bulky hydrophobic residues does not alter the voltage dependence of activation. Compared with wild-type Nav1.7, however, time to peak was shorter in F1449V, similar in F1449L, but longer for F1449Y and F1449W. The DIII/F1449V and DII/F960V mutations destabilize the closed state of the channel, consistent with channel activation being initiated by conformational changes in DII and DIII. These findings identify a conserved hydrophobic motif at the cytoplasmic aperture of Nav1.7 and provide a mechanistic basis for the decreased threshold for activation by the IEM mutation DIII/F1449V. Computational Modeling of Nav1.7—A homology model of the closed-state pore domain of Nav1.7 was generated using the crystal structure of the KcsA potassium channel (PDB code 1BL8) (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar) as the structural template. KcsA was chosen over the structure of Kv2.1, because the latter channel was crystallized in the open state (22Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). KcsA was also chosen over the closed-state KirBac1.1 (23Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and KirBac3.1 channel structures, because more extensive experimental studies have been carried with KcsA to investigate the structural basis of pore gating. Moreover, although differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic bilayer thickness and the presence of the S1-S4 voltage sensor may alter pore structure, numerous studies have used an homology model generated from the open-state MthK channel (e.g. Cronin et al. (24Cronin N.B. O'Reilly A. Duclohier H. Wallace B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10675-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), and KcsA is the more common template for homology modeling studies of closed state eukaryotic sodium (25Lipkind G.M.

The Nav1.7 sequence (Swiss-Prot accession Q15858) was aligned with the KcsA channel sequence (Swiss-Prot accession P0A334) using ClustalW (31Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The outer helices (PDB file residues 23-48), pore-pointing helices (residues 63-74), and pore-lining inner helices (residues 88-117) of KcsA provided the coordinates for modeling the equivalent sequences in each of the four domains in the Nav1.7 model: S5 (Swiss-Prot sequence residues DI:239-264, DII:860-885, DIII:1315-1340, and DIV: 1638-1663), pore-pointing helices (residues DI:348-359, DII: 914-925, DIII:1393-1404, and DIV:1685-1696), and pore-lining S6 helices (residues DI:378-407, DII:944-973, DIII:1433-1462, and DIV:1736-1765) (Fig. 1). Aromatic residues (phenylalanine or tyrosine) are present at the C terminus of the four S6 helices at equivalent positions relative to the conserved glycine gating-hinge residues (or the corresponding serine residue in DIV/S6). Residues of the KcsA structure were mutated to the Nav1.7 sequence using the Biopolymer module of SYBYL (version 7.0, Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Additional mutations were introduced to generate the F1449V, F1449L, F1449Y, and F1449W mutant Nav1.7 models. Both the wild-type and mutant models were subjected to 500 rounds of conjugate-gradient minimization in SYBYL using the Tripos force-field (32Clark M. Cramer R. Van Opdenbosch N. J. Computat. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The pore diameters of the channel models were calculated using the program HOLE (33Smart O.S. Neduvelil J.G. Wang X.

The DIII/F1449L, DIII/F1449Y, DIII/F1449W, DI/Y405V, DII/F960V, and DIV/F1752V mutants and the double mutant F960V/F1449V were introduced into hNav1.7R using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis reagents (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were transfected with each individual mutant channel construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Transfected HEK 293 cells were grown under standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C) in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 50% F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. We have previously shown that gating properties of Nav1.7R in transfected HEK 293 cells are similar to those of Nav1.7R in native DRG neurons (34Herzog R.I. Cummins T.R. Ghassemi F. Dib-Hajj S.D.

The pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 CsF, 10 NaCl, 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES; 302 mosmol (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH), and the extracellular bath contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 0.0003 TTX; 310 mosmol (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). TTX was added to the bath solution to block all endogenous voltage-gated sodium currents that might be present in HEK 293 cells (36Cummins T.R. Zhou J. Sigworth F.J. Ukomadu C. Stephan M. Ptacek L.J. Agnew W.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and thereby permitted study of Nav1.7R in isolation. All recordings were conducted at room temperature (∼21 °C). The pipette potential was adjusted to zero before seal formation, and the voltages were not corrected for liquid junction potential. Capacity transients were cancelled, and series resistance was compensated at 10 μsby 65-95%. Leakage current was subtracted digitally online using hyperpolarizing potentials applied after the test pulse (P/4 procedure). Currents were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at a rate of 100 kHz. Voltage protocols were carried out at a predetermined time after establishing cell access. Standard current-voltage (I-V) families were obtained using 40-ms pulses from a holding potential of -120 mV to a range of potentials (-100 to +60 mV) in 5-mV steps with 5 s between pulses. The peak value at each potential was plotted to form I-V curves. Activation curves were obtained by calculating the conductance G at each voltage V,G=IV-VREV(Eq. 1) with Vrev being the reversal potential, determined for each cell individually. Activation curves were fitted with the following Boltzmann distribution equation,GNA=GNA,max1+e-(Vm-V1/2k)(Eq. 2) where GNa is the voltage-dependent sodium conductance, GNa,max is the maximal sodium conductance, V½ is the potential at which activation is half-maximal, Vm is the membrane potential, and k is the slope factor. Protocols for assessing steady-state fast-inactivation consisted of a series of pre-pulses from -130 to -10 mV, each lasting 500 ms from a holding potential of -100 mV, followed by a 40-ms depolarization to -10 mV to measure the non-inactivated transient current. The normalized curves were fitted using a Boltzmann distribution equation,INaINa,max=11+eVm-V1/2k(Eq. 3) where INa,max is the peak sodium current elicited after the most hyperpolarized pre-pulse, Vm is the preconditioning pulse potential, V½ is the half-maximal sodium current, and k is the slope factor. Analysis of variance tests were carried out using Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was tested using a two-sided Dunnett's multiple comparison test as post-hoc analysis. All data are compared with WT and presented as mean ± S.E.

In this study the crystal structure of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA, which has been the subject of molecular dynamics simulations (e.g. Holyoake et al. (38Holyoake J. Domene C. Bright J.N.

Cell. 2008; 132: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to elucidate the structural basis of pore gating, has provided the structural template for homology modeling of the Nav1.7 pore in a closed conformation. Fig. 1 shows the alignment of the S6 transmembrane segments in each of the four domains of Nav1.7 with the corresponding pore-lining helix from KcsA. The assignment of the C-terminal end of S6 of KcsA and the corresponding coordinates in Nav1.7 in our studies include the terminal tripeptide WFV representing the last helical turn of the inner helix of KcsA (21Doyle D.A.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar), which was missing in previously reported sodium channel models (25Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Scheib H. McLay I. Guex N. Clare J.J. Blaney F.E. Dale T.J. Tate S.N. Robertson G.M. J. Mol. Model (Online). 2006; 12: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the nine human sodium channels shows that there are gating-hinge glycine residues in S6 in domains I-III (a serine residue is present in DIV/S6) at positions equivalent to those in the bacterial channels and that the terminal residue in each of the aligned S6 helices is an aromatic amino acid, either tyrosine in domain I (DI) or phenylalanine in the other three domains (Fig. 1). The wild-type Nav1.7 homology model shows that the side chain of the aromatic residue at the cytoplasmic end of S6 in each of the four domains (DI/Y405, DII/F960, DIII/F1449, and DIV/F1752) contribute to a potential pore-obstructing hydrophobic gate (Fig. 2A). A similar hydrophobic gate has been suggested for the acetylcholine receptor (40Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 41Beckstein O. Sansom M.S.P Phys. Biol. 2006; 3: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 42Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and has been identified in the bacterial potassium channel KirBac1.1 (23Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The model suggests that the four aromatic residues share a similar environment in Nav1.7 closed state. Thus, we expected that mutation to the small residue valine (Fig. 2, B and C) might destabilize the hydrophobic cluster in the closed-state conformation of the Nav1.7 pore, permitting the channel to open at more hyperpolarized potentials as has been observed in patch clamp studies (13Dib-Hajj S.D. Rush A.M. Cummins T.R. Hisama F.M. Novella S. Tyrrell L. Marshall L. Waxman S.G. Brain. 2005; 128: 1847-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of substitution of F1449 with an aliphatic hydrophobic residue leucine (F1449L), and the aromatic residues tyrosine (F1449Y) and tryptophan (F1449W). Fig. 3 shows Nav1.7 homology models with F1449V, F1449L, F1449Y, and F1449W substitutions. Calculations of the diameter of the pore in the vicinity of the aromatic residues reveal that the calculated pore diameter of WT channel is 0.6 Å, and that of F1449V is almost double at 1.1 Å. The substitution of another hydrophobic residue leucine (F1449L) is 0.76 Å, whereas substitution of F1449 by aromatic residues tyrosine (F1449Y) reduces the pore diameter to 0.5 Å, and tryptophan (F1449W) to 0.45 Å. Therefore changes in side-chain size alter the effective plugging of the pore in addition to reshaping inter-domain contact surfaces that are involved in the putative closed-state stabilization. Effect of Substitutions at F1449 on Channel Opening—The predicted effects of substitutions at F1449 that emerged from computer modeling were tested in whole cell patch clamp studies. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of HEK 293 cells that were co-transfected with wild-type Nav1.7R (WT) or mutant channels and green fluorescent protein were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To avoid heterogeneity caused by transfections of up to four plasmids (α-subunit, β1 and β2 subunits, and green fluorescent protein), only the Nav1.7 channel α-subunit and green fluorescent protein were transfected into HEK 293 cells. As expected, WT and mutant Nav1.7 constructs produced fast inactivating transient sodium current (Fig. 4A, 5A, and Fig. 6A). The capacitance of HEK 293 cells did not significantly change when transfected with WT or mutant Nav1.7R constructs (Table 1). WT and DIII/F1449V, DIII/F1449L, or DIII/F1449Y channels produced comparable current densities while DIII/F1449W channels produced a significantly smaller current density that is about half that of WT channels (Table 1).FIGURE 5Contribution of C terminus residues of DII/S6 and DIII/S6 to channel opening.

https://openalex.org/W1970411560,"The Chk1 kinase is highly conserved from yeast to humans and is well known to function in the cell cycle checkpoint induced by genotoxic or replication stress. The activation of Chk1 is achieved by ATR-dependent phosphorylation with the aid of additional factors. Robust genotoxic insults induce apoptosis instead of the cell cycle checkpoint, and some of the components in the ATR-Chk1 pathway are cleaved by active caspases, although it has been unclear whether the attenuation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway has some role in apoptosis induction. Here we show that Chk1 is activated by caspase-dependent cleavage when the cells undergo apoptosis. Treatment of chicken DT40 cells with various genotoxic agents, UV light, etoposide, or camptothecin induced Chk1 cleavage, which was inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. The cleavage of Chk1 was similarly observed in human Jurkat cells treated with a non-genotoxic apoptosis inducer, staurosporine. We have determined the cleavage site(s), Asp-299 in chicken and Asp-299 and Asp-351 in human cells. We further show that a truncated form of human Chk1 mimicking the N-terminal cleavage fragment (residues 1–299) possesses strikingly elevated kinase activity. Moreover, the ectopic expression of Chk1-(1–299) in human U2OS cells induces abnormal nuclear morphology with localized chromatin condensation and phosphorylation of histone H2AX. These results suggest that Chk1 is activated by caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptosis and might be implicated in enhancing apoptotic reactions rather than attenuating the ATR-Chk1 pathway.

These results suggest that Chk1 is activated by caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptosis and might be implicated in enhancing apoptotic reactions rather than attenuating the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Cell cycle checkpoint machinery is activated in response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA synthesis and induces cell cycle arrest for enabling cells to repair the insults that may cause genomic instability (1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 2Zhou L. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). The checkpoint kinase Chk1 is a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase that functions as a major effector in the G2/M-phase DNA damage checkpoint and S-phase replication checkpoint (3Chen Y. Sanchez Y. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A major upstream kinase of Chk1 is ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related), which belongs to phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase family and forms a complex with ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) 2The abbreviations used are: ATRIPATR-interacting proteinBRCTBRCA1 C-terminalAIRautoinhibitory regionNLSnuclear localization signalFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterhhumanchchickenChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketone. 2The abbreviations used are: ATRIPATR-interacting proteinBRCTBRCA1 C-terminalAIRautoinhibitory regionNLSnuclear localization signalFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterhhumanchchickenChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketone.

The ATR-Chk1 pathway also controls the timing of firing on early and late replication origins during normal S-phase (7Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. Nat.

The ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 requires additional factors including the Rad17-replication factor C complex, the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex, TopBP1, and Claspin (8Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 9Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M.

ATR-ATRIP and the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 clamp are independently loaded onto single-stranded DNA tracts and recessed DNA ends generated by stalled DNA replication forks, with the aid of replication protein A and the clamp loader Rad17-replication factor C, respectively. TopBP1 contains BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains I through VIII and directly activates the ATR-ATRIP complex via the ATR-activating domain intervening between BRCT VI and VII (11Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the BRCT I-II region of TopBP1 interacts with Rad9, and this interaction is necessary for the binding of ATR-ATRIP to TopBP1 (12Delacroix S. Wagner J.M. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto K. Karnitz L.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Chk1 kinase is activated by phosphorylation of at least two serine residues, Ser-317 and Ser-345, located in a Ser/Thr-Gln (SQ/TQ)-rich domain (14Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The SQ/TQ domain is mapped between a highly conserved N-terminal kinase domain (residues 1–265) and a C-terminal domain with ill-defined function (15Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human Chk1 kinase domain (residues 1–289) revealed an open kinase conformation, and the truncated Chk1 without the C-terminal half exhibited more than 20-fold higher activity than full-length Chk1 (16Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Katsuragi and Sagata (17Katsuragi Y. Sagata N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) identified an autoinhibitory region (AIR) in the C-terminal ∼85 amino acids of Xenopus Chk1, which largely overlaps with a bipartite and unusually long nuclear localization signal (NLS). The authors further suggested that the phosphorylation of Ser-317 and Ser-345 induces a conformational change of the AIR and reverses the autoinhibition. The phosphorylation of Ser-345, but not Ser-317, is also required for proteolytic degradation of Chk1 following the treatment of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin (18Zhang Y. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y. Mercurio F. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The Chk1 degradation is mediated by an ubiquitin/proteasome system containing Cul1 or Cul4A and was suggested to function in limiting the duration of Chk1 signaling induced by low-intensity replication stress. Furthermore, Claspin, a mediator protein required for Chk1 activation, is also degraded by an ubiquitin/proteasome system in an SCFβTrCP-dependent manner (19Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20Peschiaroli A. Dorrello N.V. Guardavaccaro D. Venere M. Halazonetis T. Sherman N.E. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The proteasome-dependent down-regulation of Claspin appears to be implicated in cell cycle-dependent fluctuation of its cellular level as well as recovery from genotoxic stress. Robust genotoxic insults induce apoptosis rather than the cell cycle checkpoint. The implication of Chk1 in apoptosis remains to be elucidated. In the literature, some components in the ATR-Chk1 pathway are known to be cleaved by activated caspases during apoptosis. Human Rad9 is cleaved by caspase-3 after exposure to DNA-damaging agents or staurosporine (21Lee M.W. Hirai I. Wang H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cleavage-resistant Rad9 generated by site-directed mutagenesis appeared to protect the cells from death induced by DNA-damaging agents, suggesting a positive role of Rad9 cleavage in promoting apoptosis. Clarke et al. (22Clarke C.A.L. Bennett L.N. Clarke P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35337-35345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have reported that Claspin is also cleaved by caspase-7 during the initiation of apoptosis, and a smaller C-terminal fragment has a dominant inhibitory effect on Chk1 phosphorylation. More recently, another group has shown that Claspin is cleaved into multiple fragments by caspase-3 and -7 and also degraded via the proteasome (23Semple J.I. Smits V.A.J. Fernaud J. Mamely I. Freire R. Cell Death Diff. 2007; 14: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The authors suggest the possibility that the down-regulation of Claspin by two different pathways promotes apoptosis. However, the biological roles of caspase-mediated cleavage of ATR-Chk1 components during apoptosis remain to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Chk1 is cleaved into two fragments by caspase during apoptosis in chicken DT40 and human Jurkat cells. The cleavage site(s) is Asp-299 in chicken and Asp-299 and Asp-351 in human cells, which are located between the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal domain containing the AIR and NLS. We further show that a truncated form of human Chk1 mimicking the N-terminal cleavage fragment (residues 1–299) possesses ∼8-fold higher kinase activity compared with full-length Chk1. Moreover, ectopic expression of Chk1-(1–299) in human U2OS cells induces locally condensed nuclear morphology as well as H2AX phosphorylation, suggesting a possible role of Chk1 cleavage in promoting apoptosis. Cell Culture and Cell Cycle Analysis—Chicken B-lymphocyte line DT40 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% chicken serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 50 μm etoposide (Sigma) or 500 nm camptothecin (Sigma) or irradiated with 30 J/m2 of UV-C light from germicidal lamps (GL-10, Toshiba). DDB1 (damaged DNA-binding protein 1)-conditional knock-out clone (DDB1-/-/-/hDDB1) was generated as described previously (24Wakasugi M. Matsuura K. Nagasawa A. Fu D. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. Matsunaga T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and 1 μg/ml doxycycline (final concentration) was used for suppressing the expression from the rescue transgene hDDB1. Human B-lymphocyte line Jurkat was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (Sigma) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. To induce apoptosis, cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma). Human osteosarcoma U2OS and kidney cell line HEK293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin as described above. The cells treated with various agents were collected by centrifugation and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20 °C. After washing with FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm EDTA), cells were incubated with FACS buffer containing 50 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide. The samples were analyzed using FACSCalibur and Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Cloning of Chicken Chk1 cDNA and Construction of Expression Plasmids—Total RNA was isolated from wild-type DT40 cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed to cDNAs by ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). A full-length chicken Chk1 (chChk1) cDNA was amplified by PCR, subcloned into the pEF6/Myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen), and verified by DNA sequencing (pEF6/chChk1-Myc-His). In addition, pEF6/chChk1-Myc-His was digested with KpnI and PmeI and subcloned into the pCMV-Myc plasmid (Clontech) to generate the expression construct of chChk1 tagged with Myc and Myc-His at the N and C termini, respectively (pCMV-Myc/chChk1-Myc-His). Various DA mutants of chChk1 (D299A, D329A, or D336A) and human Chk1 (hChk1) (D130A, D299A, or D351A) were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using a pair of sense primers (shown as follows) and antisense primers: chChk1(D299A), 5′-CGCTCTGACACAGCCTTCTCTCCTGTG-3′; chChk1(D329A), 5′-GGCGCGCTGTGGGCCAGCAGCACGGGC-3′; chChk1(D336A), 5′-ACGGGCAGCATCGCCCGCCTGGTGCAG-3′; hChk1(D130A), 5′-ATAACTCACAGGGCTATTAAACCAGAA-3′; hChk1(D299A), 5′-CAATCCAATTTGGCCTTCTCTCCAGTA-3′; and hChk1(D351A), 5′-CCCACATGTCCTGCTCATATGCTTTTG-3′. A construct for expressing a truncated hChk1 mutant (residues 1–299) tagged with Myc at the N terminus was generated by PCR and subcloning into the pCMV-Myc vector. All mutant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Transfection and Immunoblotting—Exponentially growing DT40 or Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of growth medium. Twenty μg (DT40) or 50 μg (Jurkat) of expression plasmids were added to the cell suspension and electroporated using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 950 microfarads. After incubation for 18 h, cells were treated with or without apoptosis-inducing agents and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and used for immunoblot analysis. The antibodies used in this study are as follows: monoclonal anti-Chk1 (G-4) and polyclonal anti-c-Myc (A-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-Myc (Clontech), polyclonal anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling), and monoclonal anti-caspase-6 (Medical & Biological Laboratories). Monoclonal antibodies against DDB1 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were generated as described previously (24Wakasugi M. Matsuura K. Nagasawa A. Fu D. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. Matsunaga T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The signals were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) or Immobilon western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore) and a LAS1000 lumino-image analyzer (Fuji Film). In Vitro Caspase Assay—DT40 cells were electroporated with pCMV-Myc/chChk1-Myc-His and lysed following an 18-h incubation. The lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the active recombinant caspase-3, -6, -7, or -8 (Medical & Biological Laboratories) in caspase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were separated in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. In Vitro Chk1 Kinase Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc/hChk1 (wild-type, D130A, or residues 1–299) using TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad) and lysed after a 48-h incubation. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antiserum against c-Myc and protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After sequential washing with lysis buffer, phosphate-buffered saline, and kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate), the immunoprecipitants were incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm biotinylated CHKtide (Upstate), 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA, and biotinylated CHKtide was recovered by streptavidin-coated Dynabeads M-280 (Dynal). After extensive washing with kinase buffer, radioactivity incorporated into the CHKtide was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—U2OS cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc/hChk1 (wild-type, residues 1–299, or 1–299/D130A) by Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen) and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. After fixation with methanol/acetone at -20 °C, the cells were immunostained with polyclonal anti-Myc and monoclonal anti-γ-H2AX (Upstate) antibodies, subsequently with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugates (Invitrogen), and counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). To obtain fluorescence images, a Leica DMIRBE microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics) was used. Apoptosis Induces Chk1 Truncation in Chicken DT40 Cells—We have previously established a conditional DDB1 knockout DT40 clone (DDB1-/-/-/hDDB1), which lacks all DDB1 alleles and contains human DDB1 transgene under control of the tetracycline-responsive element. The addition of doxycycline leads to complete loss of DDB1 and thereby induces a severe growth defect and subsequently cell death by apoptosis (24Wakasugi M. Matsuura K. Nagasawa A. Fu D. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. Matsunaga T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). During the analyses of various cellular factors under DDB1-depleted conditions, anti-Chk1 (G-4) monoclonal antibody revealed a time-dependent decrease of full-length Chk1 and concomitant appearance of a faster migrating band around 35 kDa following 96- and 120-h doxycycline treatment (Fig. 1A), when a significant population of DDB1-/-/-/hDDB1 cells undergoes apoptosis (24Wakasugi M. Matsuura K. Nagasawa A. Fu D. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. Matsunaga T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Another anti-Chk1 (FL-476) polyclonal antibody also detected this band (data not shown), indicating an intrinsic signal of Chk1. The ∼35-kDa band was similarly observed in DDB1-/-/-/hDDB1 cells treated with UV light (Fig. 1B), topoisomerase I poison camptothecin, and topoisomerase II poison etoposide (Fig. 1C) under doxycycline-free conditions. These results suggest that the truncated form of Chk1 is generated during apoptosis caused by DDB1 depletion as well as genotoxic treatment. To ascertain the relationship between Chk1 truncation and apoptosis, we treated wild-type DT40 cells with various concentrations of etoposide and analyzed them with Western blotting and flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A and B). Five μm or higher concentrations of etoposide evoked Chk1 truncation and apoptotic sub-G1 cells, whereas 1 μm etoposide induced neither. Kinetic analysis using 50 μm etoposide also revealed a similar time course between the appearance of truncated Chk1 and sub-G1 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk completely abolished Chk1 truncation as well as the increase of sub-G1 population. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that genotoxic stress-induced Chk1 truncation is associated with apoptosis induction. Chicken Chk1 Is Cleaved at Asp-299 by Active Caspase during Apoptosis—We next tried to understand the molecular basis of Chk1 truncation during apoptosis. Wild-type DT40 cells were electroporated with a plasmid expressing chicken Chk1 tagged with Myc and His6 at the C terminus (chChk1-Myc-His) and treated with 50 μm etoposide. The ectopic expression of tagged Chk1 was verified by immunoblotting with anti-Chk1 (G-4) and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Upon etoposide treatment, anti-Chk1 (G-4) antibody showed a more intense signal of truncated Chk1, although this band is invisible with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 4). On the other hand, anti-Myc antibody, but not anti-Chk1 (G-4) antibody, detected new doublet bands around 20 kDa. The upper band seems to be a phosphorylated form of the lower band because λ-phosphatase treatment led to a single band (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that chicken Chk1 is cleaved at a single site in the process of apoptosis, generating ∼35-kDa N-terminal and ∼20-kDa C-terminal fragments. Consistent with this notion, double-tagged Chk1 containing an additional Myc tag at the N terminus (Myc-chChk1-Myc-His) exhibited a slightly larger product (∼38 kDa) following etoposide treatment, which is also detectable with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 4 versus lane 6). To test the possibility that Chk1 is cleaved by caspase(s), we performed an in vitro caspase assay using the lysate prepared from DT40 cells expressing Myc-chChk1-Myc-His. Following incubation with active recombinant caspase-3, -6, -7, or -8, only caspase-7 exhibited truncated Chk1 with the same mobility as the etoposide-induced Chk1 fragment in DT40 cells expressing Myc-chChk1-Myc-His (Fig. 3B, lane 4 versus lane 6). Furthermore, the caspase-7-induced Chk1 cleavage was totally abolished by the addition of Z-VAD-fmk to the reaction (Fig. 4C, lane 2 versus lane 4). We conclude that Chk1 is cleaved by active caspase, most likely caspase-7, during apoptosis. We further tried to determine the cleavage site of Chk1 using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4A). Based on the size of the cleavage product, we mutated three Asp sites (Asp-299, Asp-329, or Asp-336) to Ala individually in Myc-chChk1-Myc-His and tested for the etoposide-induced cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4B, the substitution of Asp-299 to Ala (D299A) resulted in no Chk1 cleavage, whereas other two mutants (D329A and D336A) showed a comparable cleavage with wild-type Chk1. Consistently, the lysate from DT40 expressing Myc-chChk1(D299A)-Myc-His showed no Chk1 cleavage after incubation with active recombinant caspase-7 (Fig. 4C, lane 2 versus lane 3). Furthermore, the ectopic expression of truncated Chk1, Myc-chChk1-(1–299), exhibited identical mobility with the etoposide-induced cleavage fragment of Myc-chChk1-Myc-His (data not shown). These results demonstrate that apoptosis-dependent Chk1 cleavage takes place at Asp-299 in chicken DT40 cells. Human Chk1 Is Cleaved at Asp-299 and Asp-351 upon Apoptotic Stress—We asked whether Chk1 cleavage also occurs in human cells undergoing apoptosis. Human B-lymphocyte line Jurkat cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine, a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor, and apoptosis induction was verified by the cleavage of caspase-6 (Fig. 5A) as well as the increase of the sub-G1 population (Fig. 5B). Under these conditions, anti-Chk1 (G-4) antibody detected two truncated products (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3), which were not observed in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (lanes 4 and 5), indicating that Chk1 is also cleaved in apoptotic human cells. We similarly constructed plasmids expressing double-tagged human Chk1 (Myc-hChk1-Myc-His), wild-type, or D299A mutant and electroporated them into Jurkat cells. Following staurosporine treatment, wild-type Chk1 exhibited two cleavage fragments (Fig. 5C, lane 4) as seen in endogenous Chk1 (Fig. 5A), whereas D299A mutant Chk1 showed only one product with lower mobility (Fig. 5C, lane 5), suggesting that a smaller band is a cleavage product at Asp-299. To identify the second cleavage site in human cells, we also constructed a plasmid expressing D351A mutant Chk1, based on the estimated size as well as the fact that Asp-351 is not conserved in chicken (Fig. 4A). As expected, Jurkat cells transiently expressing D351A mutant Chk1 showed only one product with higher mobility following staurosporine treatment (Fig. 5C, lane 6). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that Chk1 is cleaved at Asp-299 and/or Asp-351 in human cells undergoing apoptosis. The N-terminal Cleavage Fragment of Chk1 Exhibits Elevated Kinase Activity and Induces Abnormal Nuclear Morphology as Well as H2AX Phosphorylation—It has been reported previously that Xenopus Chk1 contains the AIR at the C terminus, which suppresses its N-terminal kinase activity (17Katsuragi Y. Sagata N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the common cleavage site Asp-299 is mapped between the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal AIR (Fig. 4A), prompting us to compare the kinase activities between full-length Chk1 and truncated Chk1 mimicking the N-terminal cleavage fragment (residues 1–299). HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing N-terminally Myc-tagged human Chk1: wild-type Myc-hChk1, kinase-dead mutant Myc-hChk1(D130A), or truncated mutant Myc-hChk1-(1–299). The equal amounts of Chk1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and their kinase activities were measured in vitro using a Chk1 substrate (CHKtide) and 32P-labeled ATP (Fig. 6A). As a negative control, the immunoprecipitant from HEK293T cells transfected with a vector alone exhibited only marginal radioactive incorporation into the CHKtide. In addition, the immunoprecipitant from wild-type Chk1 transfectant showed negligible radioactivity in the absence of CHKtide (data not shown). Under these conditions, wild-type Chk1, but not kinase-dead mutant Chk1(D130A), moderately phosphorylated the CHKtide substrate. Interestingly, truncated Chk1-(1–299) exhibited markedly higher kinase activity (∼8-fold), consistent with the observation by Katsuragi and Sagata (17Katsuragi Y. Sagata N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We next wished to examine the subcellular localization of Chk1-(1–299) because the truncated Chk1 also loses the NLS colocalizing with the AIR (Fig. 4A). Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Myc-hChk1, full-length or truncated (residues 1–299), and analyzed by immunostaining with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 6B). Full-length Chk1 was mainly detected in the nucleus and some in the cytoplasm. In clear contrast, truncated Chk1-(1–299) was localized in subcellular regions showing less or no staining of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. In addition, the cells expressing truncated Chk1-(1–299) exhibited abnormal nuclear morphology with localized chromatin condensation. Furthermore, those cells were merged with strong signals of phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX), whereas most of the cells transfected with full-length Chk1 or kinase-dead truncated Chk1-(1–299/D130A) displayed no γ-H2AX signals. These results raise a possibility that the N-terminal cleavage fragment of Chk1 might be implicated in enhancing apoptotic signals. Chk1 has critical roles in G2/M- and S-phase checkpoints induced by genotoxic or replication stress and activated via the phosphorylation at Ser-317 and Ser-345 by ATR kinase in concert with several mediator proteins. On the recovery from cell cycle checkpoints after removal of the stress, the activated ATR-Chk1 pathway is down-regulated by proteasomal degradation of its components such as Chk1 and Claspin (18Zhang Y. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y. Mercurio F. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S.

Sherman N.E. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway is also attenuated when the cells undergo apoptosis. Rad9 and Claspin, essential for Chk1 phosphorylation/activation, are cleaved by caspases following apoptosis induction (21Lee M.W. Hirai I. Wang H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Clarke C.A.L. Bennett L.N. Clarke P.R. J. Biol.

Cell Death Diff. 2007; 14: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Those cleavages appear to function in switching the cellular response from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis. Similarly, other proteins involved in checkpoint or DNA repair such as ATM, DNA-PKcs, Bub1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and Rad51 are known to be substrates for active caspases during apoptosis (25Fischer U. Jänicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Diff. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 26Perera D. Freire F. Cell Death Diff. 2005; 12: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rad9 cleavage has been suggested to have an additional and more positive role in the apoptosis pathway. The N-terminal cleavage fragment of Rad9 is localized in the cytoplasm, instead of nuclear localization of full-length Rad9, and binds to Bcl-XL, thereby promoting apoptosis (21Lee M.W. Hirai I. Wang H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Chk1 is cleaved during apoptosis in chicken as well as human cells. The Chk1 cleavage was observed in apoptotic cells induced by DDB1 depletion or genotoxic (UV light, camptothecin, and etoposide) and non-genotoxic (staurosporine) treatments (Figs. 1, 2, and 5), suggesting a general response during apoptosis. While we were conducting this study, another group observed a similar truncated product of Chk1 in HeLa cells treated with etoposide or cisplatin (27Okita N. Kudo Y. Tanuma S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2007; 30: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the apoptosis-dependent Chk1 cleavage is mediated by active caspase, most likely caspase-7 (Fig. 3), and Asp-299 is the common cleavage site in chicken (SDTD-F) and human (SNLD-F) cells, although Asp-351 (TCPD-H) is also cleaved in human cells (Figs. 4 and 5). Asp-299 is highly conserved among different species including human, mouse, rat, and chicken, whereas Asp-351 is conserved only in human and rat (Fig. 4A), suggesting that Asp-299 is a more general target for active caspase. Intriguingly, Asp-299 and Asp-351 residues are located between the highly conserved N-terminal kinase domain (residues 1–265) and the C-terminal domain containing the AIR and NLS (15Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 16Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S.

Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cleavage of Chk1 at Asp-299 or Asp-351 divides full-length Chk1 into two fragments, one containing the kinase domain and another containing the AIR and NLS (Fig. 4A). We showed that truncated Chk1 (residues 1–299) mimicking the N-terminal cleavage fragment exhibited ∼8-fold higher activity compared with full-length Chk1 (Fig. 6A). Chen et al. (16Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) reported that C-terminally truncated Chk1 (residues 1–265 or 1–289) is >20-fold more active than full-length Chk1. These results suggest that the N-terminal cleavage fragment of Chk1 may have a function in phosphorylating some known or unknown substrates during apoptosis. Identification of the substrates for truncated Chk1 would be helpful for understanding the role of Chk1 cleavage in apoptosis. Because both cleavage sites, Asp-299 and Asp-351, are near and within the SQ/TQ-rich domain (Fig. 4A), respectively, it is reasonable to ask whether the phosphorylation status affects the caspase-mediated Chk1 cleavage. A human Chk1 phosphorylation mutant (S317A/S345A) transiently expressed in Jurkat cells exhibited a similar level of cleavage at both Asp-299 and Asp-351 sites following staurosporine treatment (data not shown), indicating that the phosphorylation of at least Ser-317 and Ser-345 has neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects on the caspase-dependent Chk1 cleavage. Consistently, caffeine, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase inhibitor, showed no significant effects on Chk1 cleavage in DT40 cells treated with etoposide (data not shown). Another important aspect would be subcellular localization of the N-terminal Chk1 fragment, which loses not only the C-terminal AIR but also the NLS. The immunostaining study using truncated Chk1-(1–299) mimicking the N-terminal fragment revealed a unique subcellular localization, in which Chk1-(1–299) is hardly merged with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, whereas full-length Chk1 and kinase-dead truncated Chk1-(1–299/D130A) were detected mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 6B). More intriguingly, U2OS cells expressing truncated Chk1-(1–299) exhibited locally condensed nuclear morphology and phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser-139 (Fig. 6B). The H2AX phosphorylation is known to be triggered by DNA double-strand breaks, stalled replication forks, or single-stranded DNA gaps during nucleotide excision repair in quiescent cells (28Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar, 29Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol.

Yamashita K. Inobe M. Matsunaga T. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Apoptotic DNA fragmentation also induces H2AX phosphorylation (31Rogakou E.P. Nieves-Neira W. Boon C. Pommier Y. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9390-9395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the N-terminal Chk1 fragment may induce DNA damage, probably double-strand breaks, enhancing apoptotic signals, or promote some apoptotic reactions thereby causing DNA fragmentation. Further study is required to clarify the mechanism of H2AX phosphorylation caused by the N-terminal Chk1 fragment and uncover a possible function of Chk1 cleavage in apoptosis induction. In summary, this study provides a new finding that Chk1 is activated by caspase-dependent cleavage during apoptosis and raises the possibility that the resultant N-terminal fragment may play a role in promoting apoptotic reactions through phosphorylating some substrates by its highly elevated kinase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2094193812,"Airway epithelial Na-K-2Cl (NKCC1) cotransport is activated through hormonal stimulation and hyperosmotic stress via a protein kinase C (PKC) delta-mediated intracellular signaling pathway. Down-regulation of PKCdelta prevents activation of NKCC1 expressed in Calu-3 cells. Previous studies of this signaling pathway identified coimmunoprecipitation of PKCdelta with SPAK (Ste20-related proline alanine-rich kinase). We hypothesize that endogenous PKCdelta activates SPAK, which subsequently activates NKCC1 through phosphorylation. Double-stranded silencing RNA directed against SPAK reduced SPAK protein expression by 65.8% and prevented increased phosphorylation of NKCC1 and functional activation of NKCC1 during hyperosmotic stress, measured as bumetanide-sensitive basolateral to apical (86)Rb flux. Using recombinant proteins, we demonstrate direct binding of PKCdelta to SPAK, PKCdelta-mediated activation of SPAK, binding of SPAK to the amino terminus of NKCC1 (NT-NKCC1, amino acids 1-286), and competitive inhibition of SPAK-NKCC1 binding by a peptide encoding a SPAK binding site on NT-NKCC1. The carboxyl terminus of SPAK (amino acids 316-548) pulls down endogenous NKCC1 from Calu-3 total cell lysates and glutathione S-transferase-tagged NT-NKCC1 pulls down endogenous SPAK. In intact cells, hyperosmotic stress increased phosphorylated PKCdelta, indicating activation of PKCdelta, and activity of endogenous SPAK kinase. Inhibition of PKCdelta activity with rottlerin blocked the increase in SPAK kinase activity. The results indicate that PKCdelta acts upstream of SPAK to increase activity of NKCC1 during hyperosmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2071442537,"Induction of apoptosis by tensile forces is an important determinant of connective tissue destruction in osteoarthritis and periodontal diseases. We examined the role of molecular components of the unfolded protein response in force-induced apoptosis. Magnetic fields were used to apply tensile force through integrins to cultured fibroblasts bound with collagen-coated magnetite beads. Tensile force induced caspase 3 cleavage, DNA fragmentation, depolarization of mitochondria, and induction of CHOP10, all indicative of activation of apoptosis. Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum showed evidence for both physical and functional associations between bound beads and the endoplasmic reticulum. Force-induced apoptosis was not detected in PERK null cells, but reconstitution of wild-type PERK in PERK null cells restored the apoptotic response. Force-induced apoptosis did not require PKR, GCN2, eIF2α, or CHOP10. Furthermore, force more than 24 h did not activate other initiators of the unfolded protein response including IRE-1 and ATF6. However, force-induced activation of caspase 3 was dependent on caspase 9 but was independent of mitochondria. We conclude that force-induced apoptosis depends on a novel function of PERK that occurs in addition to its canonical role in the unfolded protein response.

We conclude that force-induced apoptosis depends on a novel function of PERK that occurs in addition to its canonical role in the unfolded protein response. The ability of cells to sense and respond to physical stresses is required for tissue homeostasis and normal development. In muscle, bone, tendons, the periodontium, and the cardiovascular system, applied forces of physiological magnitude regulate cellular processes that are critical for normal tissue and organ function such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration (1Wang J.H. Thampatty B.P. Biomech. Model Mechanobiol. 2006; 5: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In contrast, pathophysiological forces can induce apoptosis (2Cheng W. Li B. Kajstura J. Li P. Wolin M.S. Sonnenblick E.H. Hintze T.H. Olivetti G. Anversa P. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2247-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Indeed, force-induced death is an important mediator of connective tissue destruction in osteoarthritis (3Kuhn K. D'Lima D.D. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2004; 12: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and periodontitis (4Yamaguchi M. Kasai K. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (Warsz). 2005; 53: 388-398PubMed Google Scholar).Cells in mechanically active environments constitutively exhibit protective responses that provide resistance to apoptosis in the face of either continuous or intermittent, high amplitude physical forces (5Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of these protective responses, cell viability and normal tissue function are maintained. For example, tensile and compressive forces applied to bone cells help to maintain bone mass by balancing bone apposition and resorption, in part by regulating cell proliferation and cell death (3Kuhn K. D'Lima D.D. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2004; 12: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cellular adaptations in high load environments include submembrane cytoskeletal buffering of high amplitude forces (5Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, tensile forces are delivered through collagen fibers and integrins to adhesion complexes; these forces are then transmitted intracellularly by actin filaments (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both focal adhesions and actin filaments are required for force-induced apoptosis (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kainulainen T. Pender A. D'Addario M. Feng Y. Lekic P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol.

Notably, application of high amplitude tensile forces through collagen-coated magnetite beads in fibroblasts, which is a good model for the forces that are delivered to connective tissue cells in vivo (7Kainulainen T.

Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cell death (10Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). eIF2α is regulated in the UPR as cells progress from physiological protein translation to compensatory responses to exogenous forces. These data suggest that the UPR pathway may translate force-induced signals into apoptotic responses.The UPR is conventionally considered as a stress response that is activated by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER or by stressors such as hypoxia, changes in calcium concentration, and nutrient deprivation. The UPR is activated by three triggering molecules in the ER membrane: PERK (PKR (double-stranded RNA-activating protein kinase)-like ER kinase/pancreatic eIF2α kinase), IRE-1 (inositol requiring ER-to-nucleus signaling 1), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) (11Wu J. Kaufman R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Activation of these molecules initiates signaling cascades leading to the attenuation of general translation and the induction of chaperone proteins and protein degradation pathways. Ultimately, after prolonged application of force, apoptosis occurs (12Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar).Apoptosis arising from UPR stimulation involves the up-regulation of CHOP10 (CAATT enhancer binding homologous protein 10)/GADD153 (growth and DNA damage protein 153), which is a downstream target of PERK through eIF2α phosphorylation, and to a lesser extent ATF6 and IRE-1 (13Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Although other mechanisms by which the UPR can initiate apoptosis have been studied, this particular pathway is well characterized and is best correlated with apoptotic signals originating from the ER. Based on these previous data, we determined whether force-induced cell death is mediated through signaling systems in the ER.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—JC-1 and mag-fura-2/AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).

All rights, title, and interest in these materials are owned by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were maintained according to Pender and McCulloch (19Pender N. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CHOP10/GADD153 null MEFs were from R. C. A. Caspase 9 null MEFs were provided by Razq Hakem (Princess Margaret Hospital/Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario) (20Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) null MEFs were obtained from Tak Mak (Princess Margaret Hospital/Ontario Cancer Institute) (20Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In all experiments, control samples included untreated cells and thapsigargin-treated cells (1 μm for 0.5 or 1 h or 300 nm for 24 h).Collagen Bead Preparation and Mechanical Force Application—Collagen-coated magnetite beads (9Wang J. Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were bound to cells at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in medium containing 10% serum prior to force exposure (0.65 piconewtons/μm2) at 37 °C. After force induction, cells were washed with PBS, and lysates were collected in Laemmli sample buffer for determination of protein concentration and analysis. Tensile forces were applied by placing the magnet above the cells. Compressive forces were applied by placing the magnet below cells, and twisting forces were applied by rotating the magnet placed above cells by 90° after half the total length of exposure time.Isolation of Focal Adhesions—After addition of collagen- or BSA-coated magnetite beads, bead-associated proteins were isolated from cells as described (9Wang J. Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS to remove unbound beads, scraped into cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer (9Wang J. Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and sonicated for 10 s. The beads were isolated from the lysate with a magnet, resuspended in cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer, homogenized, and reisolated magnetically. Bead-associated proteins were removed by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. In control experiments, cell cultures were treated with swinholide A (50 nm, 25 °C, 20 min) prior to bead binding to dissipate focal adhesion formation.Ectopic Expression of ER Stress Proteins—A wild-type mouse PERK expression vector was transfected into PERK null MEFs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After force application, cell lysates were collected for protein concentration determination and analysis. Hemagglutinin-tagged mouse PERK constructs in pcDNA3 were kindly provided by T. Rutkowski and R. J. K.Western Blotting—Adherent cells and the culture medium containing detached cells were combined for preparation of samples. Cell lysates were collected in Laemmli sample buffer, and protein concentrations were measured with the BCA protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and blotted with antibodies. Quantitation of band intensity was performed using the NIH ImageJ 1.34n program. The values were normalized to actin loading controls within the same lane and expressed as a ratio relative to the zero time point for comparison between lanes.Colocalization of ER Resident Proteins with Beads—Chamber slides (8-well, Labtek) were coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml in PBS). Cells were plated for 6 h prior to incubation with collagen-coated or BSA-coated latex microbeads for 30 min at 37 °C. Prior to immunostaining, cells were fixed (3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature), blocked, and permeabilized (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA) for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA. Immunofluorescence staining was performed with mouse calnexin antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody for 1 h, washed, and sealed with coverslips. The slides were viewed with a Nikon 300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Imagepoint, Photometrics, Phoenix, AZ).ER Calcium Release—Estimation of [Ca2+]ER was performed as described (21Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with mag-fura-2/AM (4 μm) for 150 min. The medium was replaced with nominally calcium-free HEPES buffer (9Wang J. Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) for bead binding and then force application. Visual inspection of mag-fura-2/AM-loaded cells showed fluorescent labeling of intracellular organelles as shown earlier (22Arora P.D. Silvestri L. Ganss B. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14100-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which correspond spatially with the ER. [Ca2+]ER measurements based on the mag-fura-2 fluorescence ratio were obtained with alternating excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.DNA Fragmentation—Staining for DNA fragmentation (TdT-mediated X-dUTP nick end labeling, TUNEL) was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after force application, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with Citrate buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and then stained with the TUNEL reagent mixture for at least 1 h at 37 °C. They were washed with PBS and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Positive control cells were treated with 300 nm thapsigargin for 24 h and stained in the same manner. Stained cells were visualized on a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope, and digital images were captured using a Nikon CoolPix camera. For estimation of the percent of TUNEL-positive cells, three fields were photographed from each of three separate cultures, and the mean percent of TUNEL-positive cells was estimated from the total number of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells.Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ψm)—JC-1 is a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye that exists largely as a green fluorescent monomer at low membrane potential in dead or dying cells. At higher (physiological) mitochondrial membrane potentials, JC-1 forms red fluorescent “J-aggregates.” JC-1 staining followed by analysis of JC-1 aggregates and monomers by two-color flow cytometry was conducted as described (7Kainulainen T. Pender A. D'Addario M. Feng Y. Lekic P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21998-22009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with collagen beads and treated with or without force. Floating (presumptive dead) cells were washed away and removed. Attached cells were trypsinized, washed, and suspended in PBS containing 10% serum and stained with JC-1 at 0.32 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS for analysis as described (23Kulkarni G.V. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells denoted as positively stained for aggregates were determined from signal thresholds of untreated controls and for monomers cells treated with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone for 2 h to dissipate ψm.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Detection of XBP-1 Cleavage—RT-PCR detection of XBP-1 (XhoI site-binding protein 1) cleavage was performed as described by Ref. 24Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar with modifications to primers for human XBP-1. Preparation of cDNA from RNA was performed using the Qiagen Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario) by diluting RNA in RNase-free water, denaturing at 65 °C for 5 min, and incubating with 5 mm dNTPs, 10× RT buffer, 10 μm oligo(dT)20, and Omni RT mixture at 42 °C for 2 h for cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed using the Qiagen HotStarTaq master mixture kit by mixing cDNA with HotStarTaq mixture and 25 μm forward and reverse primers for PCR amplification of XBP-1 products. The PCR products were resolved on a 3% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gel (Cambrex, Rockland, ME). The primers used for hXBP-1 were forward, 5′-GAGAACCAGGAGTTAAGACA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAAGACTAGGGGCTTGGTA-3′.Animal Model—For assessment of force-induced cell death in vivo, latex rubber separators were placed between the first and second mandibular molar teeth of male Wistar rats (250 g; n = 3) (25Roberts W.E. Chase D.C. Jee S.S. Arch. Oral Biol. 1974; 19: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This maneuver applies tensile forces to rat periodontal ligament cells in vivo and initiates apoptosis in periodontal ligament cell populations (7Kainulainen T. Pender A. D'Addario M. Feng Y. Lekic P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21998-22009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Controls (n = 3) consisted of animals without separators. Rats were killed at 2 days after stimulation. Jaws were fixed in paraformaldehyde, decalcified, and prepared for paraffin sections. Cells in the periodontal ligament were stained with an antibody to phosphorylated PERK at 1:100 as described (26Zhou J. Lhotak S. Hilditch B.A. Austin R.C. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The tissue sections were not counterstained. The experiments were conducted according to an experimental protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Toronto.Statistical Analysis—For continuous variables, means and S.E. were computed. Band intensities reported are averaged data from three separate measurements. Statistical significance was estimated by Student's t test using individual values from three different measurements. All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate.RESULTSMechanical Force Induces Apoptosis—Robust time-dependent increases in the active (cleaved) form of caspase 3 were observed in MEFs and in HGFs exposed to tensile force (Fig. 1a). This was consistently observed as early as 16 h after force application and was detected with application of stretching, compression, and twisting forces (Fig. 1b). To ensure complete and reliable detection of activation in all subsequent studies, cleavage of caspase 3 was monitored after 24 h of force exposure. Tensile force did not activate caspase 8, an indicator of death receptor-mediated apoptosis activation (Fig. 1c), but did increase phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 1d). DNA fragmentation detected by TUNEL staining was observed in MEFs (45% TUNEL-positive at 24 h) and in human gingival fibroblasts (35% TUNEL-positive at 24 h) after exposure to mechanical forces (Fig. 1e) and was restricted to cells that bound collagen-coated beads. In contrast, cells with attached collagen-coated magnetite beads that were not exposed to tensile force exhibited minimal caspase 3 cleavage and no detectable DNA frag-mentation (Fig. 1, a-c and e). Together, these data indicate that the primary inducer of apoptosis is mechanical force and not collagen bead binding alone.Cells loaded with JC-1 to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential, incubated with collagen beads, and then exposed to force or no force showed that tensile force reduced the ratio of JC-1 aggregates to monomers (Table 1), an estimate of ψm. The aggregate-to-monomer ratio was reduced to less than one-third of that of cells not exposed to force, indicating that stretching forces cause dissipation of ψm. Cells treated with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone, a positive control for dissipation of ψm, exhibited a ratio of aggregates to monomers that was 1/15 that of control ratios. Thus tensile force may be able to induce apoptosis in fibroblasts through intrinsic pathways associated with both the ER and mitochondria.TABLE 1Mitochondrial membrane potential in attached cellsTime (h)/treatmentNo. of aggregatesNo. of monomersAggregate:monomer0/Beads + no force19626123.2 (3.4)24/Beads + no force787221903.6 (3.3)24/Beads + force138414291.0 (0.9)2/Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone20511440.2 (0.3) Open table in a new tab Plasma Membrane Interactions with the ER at Focal Adhesions—Increased eIF2α phosphorylation has been observed in response to force application (9Wang J. Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and our data above (Fig. 1d) indicated that the UPR is activated in this system. Accordingly, we determined if there was a mechanical continuity between focal adhesions and the ER. Colocalization and coisolation experiments were performed to assess whether focal adhesion proteins bound to magnetite beads can interact with the ER. In human fibroblasts, collagen or BSA-coated beads were bound to cells and stained for calnexin, an ER protein. Enrichment of calnexin was observed around collagen-coated beads but not around BSA-coated beads in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2a) or in unpermeabilized cells (data not shown). Second, focal adhesion-associated proteins were isolated from cells after binding to collagen-coated beads, and the bead-associated proteins were immunoblotted. Both calnexin and GRP78/BiP, another ER resident chaperone protein, were detected in immunoblots of the focal adhesion-associated proteins from collagen-coated bead-bound samples (Fig. 2b, lane 1) but not from BSA-coated bead-bound samples (Fig. 2b, lane 2). Vinculin, a focal adhesion-associated protein, was also detected in these samples, indicating that the adhesions formed around the beads were authentic focal adhesions. Inhibition of actin filament polymerization with swinholide A blocked focal adhesion formation and coaggregation of calnexin and GRP78/BiP (Fig. 2b, lane 3), indicating that the interaction between focal adhesions and ER-resident proteins depends on the integrity of actin filaments and the formation of focal adhesions.FIGURE 2Association between plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. a, human gingival fibroblasts plated on poly-l-lysine were incubated with collagen (Coll)- or BSA-coated latex microbeads for 30 min at 37 °C and immunostained for calnexin followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody. The microscope was focused on the dorsal surface of the cell to image bead-associated proteins. DIC, differential interference contrast. Magnification was ×800. b, immunoblots of proteins from focal adhesion complexes show coisolation of calnexin and GRP78/BiP with complexes prepared from cells bound with collagen-coated beads (lane 1) but not with BSA beads (lane 2). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with swinholide A blocked formation of focal adhesion complexes and the association of calnexin and GRP78/BiP (lane 3). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), used as a control for FAC purity, was detected only in whole cell lysates (lane 4). c, mag-fura-2 ratio data are shown for estimation of [Ca2+]ER. Cells plated on poly-l-lysine were loaded with mag-fura-2/AM and preincubated with collagen- or BSA-coated beads. Traces are representative of three independent experiments, each with n = 3-5 cells. The bottom panel shows composite traces of five cells incubated with thapsigargin (Tg;1 μm) at the indicated time as a positive control for release of calcium from the ER.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether applied forces can generate an ER-specific response, [Ca2+]ER was estimated from measurements of the mag-fura-2 excitation ratio in single cells. Dye-loaded fibroblasts were switched to Ca2+-free medium (to prevent entry of Ca2+ through stretch-activated plasma membrane channels (27Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and within 1 min, force was applied (for a 1-s duration). Under these conditions, cells exhibited rapid reduction of the mag-fura-2 ratio when forces were applied through collagen-coated beads but not BSA-coated beads (Fig. 2c), indicating a close physical association between focal adhesions (the site of force application in this model) and the ER. As a control, thapsigargin-treated cells exhibited rapid reduction of the magfura-2 ratio (Fig. 1c).PERK Mediates Force-induced Apoptosis—The data above indicated that mechanical forces could be transmitted to the ER and thereby activate apoptosis, possibly through the UPR. Because tensile forces can increase eIF2α phosphorylation in fibroblasts (9Wang J. Laschinger C. Zhao X.H. Mak B. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W2054551128,"T-cadherin is unique among the family of type I cadherins, because it lacks transmembrane and cytosolic domains, and attaches to the membrane via a glycophosphoinositol anchor. The N-terminal cadherin repeat of T-cadherin (Tcad1) is ≈30% identical to E-, N-, and other classical cadherins. However, it lacks many amino acids crucial for their adhesive function of classical cadherins. Among others, Trp-2, which is the key residue forming the canonical strand-exchange dimer, is replaced by an isoleucine. Here, we report the NMR structure of the first cadherin repeat of T-cadherin (Tcad1). Tcad1, as other cadherin domains, adopts a β-barrel structure with a Greek key folding topology. However, Tcad1 is monomeric in the absence and presence of calcium. Accordingly, lle-2 binds into a hydrophobic pocket on the same protomer and participates in an N-terminal β-sheet. Specific amino acid replacements compared to classical cadherins reduce the size of the binding pocket for residue 2 and alter the backbone conformation and flexibility around residues 5 and 15 as well as many electrostatic interactions. These modifications apparently stabilize the monomeric form and make it less susceptible to a conformational switch upon calcium binding. The absence of a tendency for homoassociation observed by NMR is consistent with electron microscopy and solid-phase binding data of the full T-cadherin ectodomain (Tcad1-5). The apparent low adhesiveness of T-cadherin suggests that it is likely to be involved in reversible and dynamic cellular adhesion-deadhesion processes, which are consistent with its role in cell growth and migration.

T-cadherin, also known as truncated, H-, or heart cadherin is an unusual member of the family of type I cadherins that function in calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion and thereby govern processes important for tissue morphogenesis such as cell recognition, sorting, coordinated cell movements, and polarity (1Halbleib J.M. Nelson W.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3199-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). T-cadherin is widely expressed in the brain and the cardiovascular system, but absent or strongly depleted in many cell cancer lines (2Lee S.W. Nat.

Classical cadherins accumulate at adherens junctions, where they interact via their cytoplasmic domain with integrins, catenins, and specific kinases. In contrast, T-cadherin has been localized within lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, is targeted to the apical surface in polarized epithelial cells, and redistributed to the leading edge of migrating cells (10Doyle D.D.

The alignment of amino acid sequences of the N-terminal extracellular domain of human T- and classical cadherins reveals ≈30% sequence identity (Fig. 1B). Residues important for calcium binding such as Glu-11 and the calcium binding motifs LDRE and DXND are well conserved. In contrast, amino acids important for the adhesive function of classical cadherins are not shared by T-cadherin (Fig. 1B). These include Trp-2 and residues of the hydrophobic binding pocket of cad1 (Ile-24, Ser-26, Tyr-36, Ala-80, Asp-90, and Met-92), which accommodates Trp-2 in the intercellular strand-exchange dimer (19Boggon T.J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Similarly, residues in cad1 and cad2 that make contacts in the crystal structure of C-cadherin (19Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and which have been proposed to represent the cis-interaction interface are mostly replaced by other amino acids (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Based on the unusual amino acid composition, domain organization, and different cellular localization, it has been suggested that the adhesive capacity of T-cadherin is lower and that the mechanism of T-cadherin-induced calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion should be different from those of classical cadherins (28Vestal D.J. Ranscht B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we report the NMR characterization of the structure, dynamics, and calcium binding properties of the N-terminal cadherin domain of human T-cadherin (Tcad1, residues 1-105 of the mature form, residues 139-243 of the unprocessed precursor protein). Tcad1, as the other characterized cadherin domains, adopts a β-sandwich structure with a Greek key folding topology. However, Tcad1 is monomeric, both in the absence and presence of calcium. This is supported by additional EM and solid-phase binding data of the full T-cadherin ectodomain (Tcad1-5). The structure of Tcad1 shows that isoleucine 2, which is conserved in T-cadherins from different organisms (Fig. 1C), occupies a hydrophobic pocket on the same monomer. The latter is formed by equivalent residues to those lining the binding pocket for Trp-2 in the strand-exchange dimer of classical cadherins. Based on the presented NMR data of Tcad1, the higher stability of the monomeric form and its lower susceptibility for calcium-induced conformational changes are rationalized. DNA Constructs for NMR Studies—The DNA fragment encoding for the first two extracellular domains of T-cadherin (1-223, Tcad12) preceded by a His tag/Factor Xa cleavage site (MGH10SSGHID4KHMIEGR) was obtained by PCR using a cDNA of human T-cadherin. The fragment was cloned into NdeI/BamHI restriction sites of the Escherichia coli expression vector pET-19b (Novagen). A plasmid encoding residues 1-105 (Tcad1) was prepared by introducing a stop codon after residue 105 in the Tcad12-encoding plasmid. Expression and Purification of Tcad1 and Tcad12 for NMR Studies—Proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). 15N and 13C labeling was carried out by growth on minimal medium using 15NH4Cl, and 13C6-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were disrupted in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8 using a French press. The resulting protein solution was diluted 1:1 and the protein denatured by the addition of 6 m urea. The unfolded protein was loaded onto a Ni-affinity chromatography column. Unspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the column with 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, pH 8. Refolding of the protein on the column was achieved by washing with the same buffer without urea. Elution occurred in two steps by raising the imidazole concentration (300 and 500 mm). Tcad1 was digested without dialysis after 1:1 dilution with an imidazole-free buffer. Tcad12 was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8 prior to digestion with Factor Xa. In both cases, the cleaved His tag was removed by Ni-affinity chromatography. The correct mass was confirmed by MALDI-TOF or ESI mass spectrometry. NMR Sample Preparation—Tcad1 and Tcad12 were dialyzed into 5 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.02% NaN3, 95% H2O, 5% D2O, pH 7.8. The concentration of Tcad1 was ∼0.6 mm for the structure determination, ∼0.2 mm for the calcium binding studies, and ranged from 0.07 to 0.6 mm for the concentration-dependent measurements. The Tcad12 concentration was 0.86 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Bruker DRX600 and 800 spectrometers. The data were processed with NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11613) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (30Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). Assignments for the 13C, 15N, and 1H nuclei have been described (31Bang E. Haussinger D. Stetefeld J. Ahrens T. Grzesiek S. Dames S.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 38: 179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments and dihedral angle information were derived from 3D-HACAHB-COSY, 3D-HNHA, 3D-HNHB, 13CO-{13Cγ}-SED- and 15N-{13Cγ}-SED-15N-1H-HSQC, and 13C-{13CO}-SED- and 13C-{15N}-SED-13C-1H-HSQC spectra. Distance restraints were obtained from 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Information about the backbone dynamics was derived from 15N-relaxation experiments including the measurement of T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE. Details and original references for these experiments can be found in Ref. 32Grzesiek S. Bax A. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Tjandra N. Wingfield P.T.

Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) using torsion angle molecular dynamics. Distance restraints were generated in NMRView and classified according to NOE-cross-peak intensities. Upper bounds were 2.8, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 Å. The lower bound was always 1.8 Å. For all NOE-restraints r-6 sum averaging was used. Backbone dihedral angle restraints for φ and ψ were derived based on 3JHNHα, the determined 13C and 1Hα chemical shifts, and on initial structure calculations. Stereospecific assignments were obtained for 13 β-methylene and 8 valine γ-methyl proton pairs. Based on 3JHαHβ2/3 and 3JNβ2/3 coupling constants and NOE data, side chain χ1 angles were restrained to one of the staggered conformations (60°, 180°, -60°) ± 30°. For regions with β-sheet conformation, hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) were defined by HN-O distance bounds of 1.8-2.3 Å, and N-O distance bounds of 2.6-3.1 Å. The 20 lowest energy structures out of 200 calculated ones were finally refined in a water shell (34Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M.

Proteins. 2004; 55: 483-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification for EM and Solid-phase Binding Studies—Several (fusion) protein constructs were generated to carry out in vitro EM and solid-phase binding studies (Fig. 1A). These comprise His-tagged (-H) and Strep-tagged (-S) versions of T-cadherin domains 1-3 (Tcad1-3-S), fusions containing the first five domains of T-cadherin and the coiled-coil trimerization domain of cartilage matrix protein (Tcad1-5cmp-H/S), a fusion containing the first T-cadherin domain, domains 2-5 of E-cadherin, and the trimerization domain of cartilage matrix protein (Tcad1Ecad2-5cmp-H), as well as a fusion containing the first five domains of E-cadherin and the trimerization domain of cartilage matrix protein (Ecad1-5cmp-H) or the pentamerization domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (Ecad1-5comp-S). Vectors for expression of these constructs in human embryonal kidney cells were obtained as described in the supplemental data. Human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine and 10 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all obtained from Invitrogen). Transfectants were generated as described before (36Ahrens T. Pertz O. Häussinger D. Fauser C. Schulthess T. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19455-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and bulk cultures were used for protein expression. Confluent cells were maintained in 23 ml of DMEM F12, 1% glutamine, 10 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin for 48 h. Then the medium was collected, and new medium was added. This procedure was repeated 8-10 times. Supernatants were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min, buffered in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, and stored at -20 °C. Supernatants containing recombinant proteins were sterile-filtered, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, and concentrated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Tcad1-5cmp-H, Tcad1Ecad2-5cmp-H, Ecad1Tcad2-5cmp-H, and Ecad1-5cmp-H was performed as described (24Ahrens T. Lambert M. Pertz O. Sasaki T. Schulthess T. Mege R.M. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tcad1-3-S and Tcad1-5cmp-S were purified via Strep-Tactin®-Sepharose columns (IBA, Göttingen). Purified proteins were stored at -20 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and 0.5 mm CaCl2. The expression and folding of T-cadherin constructs in eukaryotic HEK 293 cells was analyzed based on Western blots, silver-stained SDS gels, and circular dichroism data (supplemental Fig. S3). Solid-phase Binding Assays—200 μl of trimeric Ecad1-5cmp-H (50 nm), Tcad1-5cmp-H, or Tcad1Ecad2-5cmp-H (50 nm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4 were coated at 4 °C overnight on 96-well flat bottom plates (Becton Dickinson). All buffers contained 2 mm Ca2+. Plates were then blocked with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1 and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. After three washing steps, different concentrations of the Strep-tagged ligands Ecad1-5comp-S, Tcad1-3-S, or Tcad1-5cmp-S (in 20 mm Tris, 0.04% Tween 20, 2 mm Ca2+) were added to the wells for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were again washed three times before 1 mg/ml HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added for 1.5 h at room temperature. HRP activity was measured at 405 nm using ABTS (Roche Applied Science) as substrate. One representative experiment out of three (almost identical) is shown. Description of the Structure of Tcad1—Initial NMR studies on a T-cadherin construct containing the first two cadherin repeats (Tcad12) indicated that the second repeat was unfolded (supplemental Fig. S2). The reason for this behavior is currently unclear. Under similar conditions, the second domain of Ecad12 with equivalent domain boundaries (1-219) is folded (22Haussinger D. Ahrens T. Aberle T. Engel J. Stetefeld J. Grzesiek S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore the domain boundaries should have been defined correctly. It has however been observed that in an E-cadherin construct encompassing the 2nd and the 3rd cadherin repeat, the latter is unfolded (37Alattia J.R. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because the second domain in Tcad12 is unfolded, we restricted the structural characterization to Tcad1. According to NMR relaxation, EM, and solid-phase binding data, this Tcad1 domain is monomeric in solution in the presence and absence of calcium (see below). The NMR structure of the calcium-free form of the Tcad1 monomer together with a topology diagram is shown in Fig. 2. Corresponding structural statistics are given in Table 1. Tcad1 adopts a β-barrel structure with a Greek key folding topology (Fig. 2B). The β-sheets formed by strands F-G-C and B-I-H-E, colored in green and blue in Fig. 2A, are also found in the known structures of classical cadherins (19Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S.

Ikegami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33650-33663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Conserved proline and glycine residues in the cad1 domains of cadherins (Figs. 1B and 2C) strongly determine the overall fold by marking the ends of β-sheet strands and restricting the conformation of loop regions. In Tcad1, prolines 16, 18, 46, and 90 show a cis-peptide bond conformation. This is evident from strong NOE-correlations between the α-protons of the respective proline and the preceding residue and the observation of characteristic proline 13Cβ and 13Cγ chemical shifts (39Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, glycines 39, 41, 48, 57, 84, 89 as well as asparagine 12 have positive φ-angles. Such cis-peptide bonds in conserved prolines and positive φ-angles in conserved glycines and asparagines are also found in the crystal structures of N-cadherin (PDB code 1NCH; Pro-16, Pro-18, Pro-47, Gly-40, Gly-42, Gly-49, Gly-58, Gly-85, Asn-12), C-cadherin (PDB code 1L3W; Pro-18, Pro-47, Gly-40, Gly-42, Gly-49, Gly-58, Gly-85, Asn-12), and E-cadherin (PDB code 1FF5; Pro-18, Pro-47, Gly-40, Gly-42, Gly-49, Gly-58, Gly-85, Asn-12). A notable feature of the Tcad1 structure are several residues (Val-21, Val-42, Asn-55, Asn-56, Val-69, Asn-83, Leu-87) with large (>8.5 Hz) 3JHNHα coupling constants characteristic for β-sheet like φ-angles of -90° to -130°. However, based on NOE-correlations, these residues adopt a helical structure with ψ-angles between 0° and -90°. Similar φ- and ψ-angles are observed for the equivalent residues in N-, C- (except Asn-84) and E-cadherin.TABLE 1Statistics for the 20 final in a water shell refined structures of human T-cadherin (1-105)Experimental restraintsDistance restraintsAll (assigned + ambiguous)Total3843 (3437 + 406)15N-NOESY1069 (925 + 144)Aliphatic 13C-NOESY2665 (2431 + 234)Aromatic 13C-NOESY109 (81 + 28)Hydrogen bond40Φ angle restraints57Ψ angle restraints46ϰ1 angle restraints32Structural statisticsaNone of the structures had distance restraints violations > 0.3 Å or dihedral angle violations > 5°.R.m.s.bR.m.s.(d.), root mean square (deviation). deviations from experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.0142 ± 0.0005Dihedral angle (°)0.224 ± 0.047R.m.s. deviations from idealized geometryBonds0.0102 ± 0.0002Angles1.174 ± 0.021Improper1.370 ± 0.080Total Energy (kcal mol−1)−3932 ± 91Procheck (Ref. 50Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab In comparison to classical cadherins, the most interesting part of the Tcad1 structure is the region around isoleucine 2. In Tcad1, residues Ile-2 and Val-3 (strand A, Fig. 2A) form an antiparallel β-sheet with residues Val-25 and Asp-26 (strand D). This is evident from interstrand NOEs between V2Hα and V26Hα, V3HN and V25HN, and strong sequential Hi-1α to HiN contacts. Accordingly, in all 20 structures, V3N and V25O as well as V25N and V3O are within H-bonding distance to each other. In Ecad1, NMR evidence shows that V3N and the equivalent K25O also form an intramolecular H-bond for monomeric E-cadherin at low concentrations (22Haussinger D. Ahrens T. Aberle T. Engel J. Stetefeld J. Grzesiek S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Such an intramolecular H-bond is also observed in the ECAD1-internalin complex (40Schubert W.D.

At high concentrations in the presence of calcium, classical cadherins dimerize via strand-exchange, and the V3N-K25O H-bond switches to an intermolecular form. The resulting dimeric H-bonds are basically identical in all structures that show strand-exchange, i.e. N-cadherin (21Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), C-cadherin (Fig. 3B, right side) (19Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and E-cadherin (22Haussinger D. Ahrens T. Aberle T. Engel J. Stetefeld J. Grzesiek S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For T-cadherin, no evidence of dimerization is observed, but apparently the monomeric T-cadherin preserves the H-bond contact between Val-3 and residue 25 seen in monomeric forms of other cadherins. The side chain of Ile-2 in Tcad1 inserts into a pocket that is formed by residues equivalent to those lining the hydrophobic pocket for Trp-2 in classical cadherins (Fig. 3, B-D). Mostly hydrophobic interactions are found to residues Val-24, Asp-26, Arg-29, Phe-35, Val-77, Thr-79, Glu-88, and Val-9"

In this study, a knock-out strain for Saccharomyces cerevisiae LeuRS was constructed to analyze in vivo the tRNA aminoacylation properties of S. cerevisiae and human cytoplasmic LeuRSs. The activities of several editing-defective mutants of ycLeuRS were determined in vitro and compared with those obtained in vivo in a complementation assay performed in the knock-out strain. The editing activities of these mutants were analyzed in the presence of either norvaline, a leucine analogue, or AN2690, a specific inhibitor that targets the editing active site. In general, the in vivo data are consistent with those obtained in vitro. Our results show that ycLeuRS post-transfer editing plays a crucial role in the establishment of the aminoacylation fidelity. When impaired, the viability of cells bearing editing-defective mutants is drastically decreased in the presence of noncognate amino acid. This study also emphasizes the crucial function of some semi-conserved residues around the editing site in modulating the editing efficiency.

It is presumed that the genetic code underwent an initial period during which codons did not specify an unalterable amino acid. The earliest proteins were a mixture of statistical products due to unclear code assignment from various similar amino acids (1Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The modern unalterable genetic code arose with the evolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), 3The abbreviations used are:aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseLeuRSleucyl-tRNA synthetaseCP1connecting polypeptide 1ycLeuRSyeast cytoplasmic LesRSymLeuRSyeast mitochondrial LeuRShcLeuRShuman cytoplasmic LeuRSAatRNAA. aeolicus tRNANvanorvaline5-FOA5-fluoroorotic acid5-FOAs5-FOA-sensitiveSD-Trp-synthetic defined medium minus tryptophan. 3The abbreviations used are:aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseLeuRSleucyl-tRNA synthetaseCP1connecting polypeptide 1ycLeuRSyeast cytoplasmic LesRSymLeuRSyeast mitochondrial LeuRShcLeuRShuman cytoplasmic LeuRSAatRNAA. aeolicus tRNANvanorvaline5-FOA5-fluoroorotic acid5-FOAs5-FOA-sensitiveSD-Trp-synthetic defined medium minus tryptophan. which catalyze the esterification reaction that links an amino acid with the corresponding anticodon triplet on its cognate tRNA (2Schimmel P.

As components of the translation apparatus, aaRSs are responsible for the fidelity of protein synthesis, and aaRS errors can lead to genetic code ambiguity and disruption of cellular functions (4Nangle L.A.

Thus, many aaRSs have developed an editing mechanism to remove their errors and maintain translational fidelity (5Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. LaPointe J. Brakier-Gingras L. Translation Mechanisms.

LeuRS contains a classic editing domain, connecting polypeptide 1 (CP1), which can hydrolyze the aminoacyl bond of mischarged aa-tRNALeu (6Betha A.K. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A.

However, most previous studies on LeuRS editing have been performed in in vitro systems, and very few studies have shed light on the effect of editing deficiency in vivo (14Bacher J.M. de Crecy-Lagard V.

Recently, an Escherichia coli-based assay was established to identify amino acids that compromise the fidelity of E. coli and yeast mitochondrial LeuRS (EcLeuRS and ymLeuRS) during translation (19Karkhanis V.A. Mascarenhas A.P. Martinis S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8765-8768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Karkhanis V.A. Boniecki M.T. Poruri K. Martinis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33217-33225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the structural basis and functional implementation of the editing reaction carried out by eukaryotic LeuRS. We previously found that the human cytoplasmic LeuRS (hcLeuRS) is quite active as a free enzyme, and its kinetic constants for ATP, leucine, and tRNALeu in the ATP-PPi exchange and tRNA leucylation reactions were determined (21Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34755-34763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, the editing function of this enzyme has not yet been addressed. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic LeuRS (ycLeuRS) consists of 1090 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 120 kDa. It is encoded by the gene ycleuS. ycLeuRS has been reported to recognize its cognate tRNALeu with the anticodon loop acting as a major identity determinant (22Soma A. Kumagai R. Nishikawa K. Himeno H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and aminoacylate E. coli tRNALeu efficiently (23Soma A. Himeno H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4374-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, ycLeuRS performs the editing function through both pre-transfer hydrolysis as a major pathway in vitro (24Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and post-transfer editing in dependence on an essential conserved aspartic acid residue (9Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the present study, we created several LeuRS mutants for highly conserved residues and assayed their in vitro enzymatic activities. Then, we constructed a leuS knock-out yeast strain, ScΔleuS, and determined the growth rates of compensated ScΔleuS strains expressing these mutants to assess their effect on editing. We found that ycLeuRS activates norvaline (Nva) with a much higher efficiency than isoleucine, and this poses a strong challenge to the editing step of ycLeuRS in vivo. We demonstrate that the post-transfer editing pathway is the major proofreading pathway in vivo and is critical for yeast cell survival in the presence of noncognate amino acid. Our results also suggest that several unique residues in ycLeuRS play important roles in optimal editing reaction to maintain translational fidelity in vivo. The in vivo data obtained by this method match up to those obtained in vitro, and the former seemed to be more sensitive to slight changes in the editing activity of ycLeuRS than the latter. Materials, Strains, and Vectors—Amino acids, ATP, dithiothreitol, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mg/ml yeast total tRNA were purchased from Sigma. [l-14C]Leucine (300 Ci/mol), [l-3H]isoleucine (1 mCi/ml), [γ-32P]ATP, and tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. GF/C filters were from Whatman Co. (Mainstone, England). T4 DNA ligase and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Sangon Co. (Canada, Shanghai Branch); nickelnitrilotriacetic acid Superflow was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Germany). All oligonucleotides for amplifying DNA fragments were synthesized by Invitrogen. Aquifex aeolicus tRNALeuGAG (AatRNALeu) with an accepting activity of 1400 pmol/A260 was prepared from an overexpressing strain carrying this gene. The strain was constructed in our laboratory (26Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 25: 41590-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar). E. coli—DH5α and BL21 (DE3) were used for cloning and producing recombinant proteins. The pET28a plasmid was used to construct the recombinant plasmid with ycleuS. Compound AN2690 and the recombinant pET16-hcLeuRS plasmid harboring the gene that encodes human cytoplasmic LeuRS (hcLeuRS) were gifts from Dr. Alley, Anacor Co., in 2006. The haploid S. cerevisiae strain YAMB4 (a/α ura3–52 lys2–801am trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ade2-Δ450 ade3-Δ1483), YAC4 plasmid carrying the HIS3 gene, pALR10 (pUN50-ADE3) plasmid, and yeast-E. coli centromere-based shuttle plasmid p414TEF were gifts from Dr. Eriani, Institut de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France. Gene Cloning and Construction of Recombinant Plasmids—A 4.3-kb DNA fragment containing the yeast leuS open reading frame with an upstream promoter sequence (0.5 kb) and a downstream terminator sequence (0.5 kb) was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using the Pyrobest enzyme (Takara, Japan). The following primers were used: forward (5′-GATCGATCGAGCTCATTGGCTCAATATTTTAGCCG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGCGGATCCATTAGGCCTTTTCATCTTTTAA-3′). After digestion with SacI and BamHI, the PCR product was inserted into the corresponding sites of the pALR10 plasmid to create the recombinant pAL5 plasmid (Ura+, Ade3+, and leuS+) that could rescue the ycLeuRS-disrupted strain. The open reading frame of the ycleuS gene was amplified from the aforementioned DNA by PCR using the following primers: forward (5′-GCGGATCCATGTCTTCTGGTTTGGTCTTAGAAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGAATTCTTAAATATTTTGGAAGACAACACCTGGG-3′). Then the PCR product was digested with BamHI-EcoRI and inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI sites in p414TEF and pET28a to obtain p414TEF-ycleuS and pET28a-ycleuS, respectively. The single-point mutation in ycLeuRS was performed by PCR from p414TEF-ycleuS or pET28a-ycleuS by a previously described method (26Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 25: 41590-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen). p414TEF and pET28a recombinant plasmids containing leuS or various leuS mutants were used to perform the complementation assay in S. cerevisiae and to produce recombinant proteins in E. coli, respectively. The gene encoding human cytoplasmic LeuRS (hcleuS) and its mutant D399K were amplified from pET16-hcLeuRS by PCR and inserted into p414TEF by the aforementioned method to obtain recombinant plasmids for the complementation assay in S. cerevisiae. Production and Purification of His6-ycLeuRS and Its Mutants—BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the pET28a recombinant plasmids containing ycleuS and its mutants, and these cells were used to produce ycLeuRS protein along with various mutant proteins. The enzymes were purified by nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, as described previously (27Chen J.F. Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215477) Google Scholar). Determination of the Aminoacylation, ATP-PPi Exchange, Misaminoacylation, and Hydrolytic Editing Activity—The aminoacylation activities of ycLeuRS or its various mutants were determined at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm [l-14C]leucine, 1 mg/ml yeast total tRNA, and 5 nm enzyme. The kinetics of ycLeuRS in an ATP-PPi exchange reaction were determined at 30 °C in the presence of 0.02–0.2 mm Leu and 0.01–1 mm Nva and 1–125 mm Ile, as described previously (7Chen J.F. Guo N.N. Li T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, and 2 mm [32P]pyrophosphate (10 cpm/pmol). The reaction was initiated with 50 nm enzyme. Misaminoacylation assays were carried out using the same procedure as the aminoacylation assay except that 20 μm [l-3H]Ile (30 Ci/mmol) and 1 μm enzyme were used (7Chen J.F. Guo N.N. Li T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The charging capacity of the yctRNALeu transcript by ycLeuRS cannot be detected. However, ycLeuRS could charge AatRNALeu and hydrolyze misacylated Ile-AatRNALeu efficiently. Thus, we used Ile-AatRNALeu as the substrate in the hydrolytic editing assay. Ile-AatRNALeu was obtained by charging AatRNALeu with Ile catalyzed by AaLeuRS D373A (a post-editing defective mutant enzyme), which was purified as described previously (8Zhao M.W. Zhu B. Hao R. Xu M.G. Eriani G. Wang E.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic editing activity of ycLeuRS was measured at 30 °C in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μm [3H]Ile-AatRNALeu. The reactions were initiated with 2.5 nm of each enzyme. At appropriate time intervals, aliquots were quenched on Whatman 3MM filter pads and precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The radioactive counts were measured in a scintillation counter, as described previously (8Zhao M.W. Zhu B. Hao R. Xu M.G. Eriani G. Wang E.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All values represent the average from three experiments. Generation of ycleuS Null Strain—The 5′ 556-bp and the 3′ 548-bp DNA fragments of ycleuS were amplified by PCR and digested by EcoRI-BamHI and BamHI-XbaI, respectively. The 1.8-kb HIS3 DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from the YAC4 plasmid and digested by BamHI. These three fragments were ligated and inserted into pUC19 using the EcoRI-XbaI sites to produce pUC19-ΔycleuS-HIS3. In pUC19-ΔycleuS-HIS3, a 2.166-kb fragment from ycleuS that encodes the middle 722 amino acid residues (Ile-186 through Val-908) of ycLeuRS was replaced by HIS3, and ycleuS was disrupted by the HIS3 marker gene. The linear 2.8-kb ΔycleuS-HIS3 sequence cleaved by EcoRI and XbaI from pUC19-ΔycleuS-HIS3 was transformed into the YAMB4 yeast strain. His+ colonies were selected and induced on sporulation plates, tetrads were dissected, and then haploids were plated on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) plates. Two spores were unable to grow, whereas the other two growing spores were His-. When a rescue plasmid encoding leuS (pAL5: Ura+, Ade+, and leuS+) was transformed, the disrupted diploid produced four viable spores after segregation. Dissection showed four viable haploids per tetrad, a result of the complementation by the plasmid-encoded ycLeuRS. Two of these were His- and could grow on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) medium, whereas the other two were His+ and 5-FOA-sensitive (5-FOAs). We selected the His+ and 5-FOAs haploids and confirmed the integration event by PCR analysis of the genomic DNA. The resulting YAMB4 haploid strain that was disrupted for leuS was designated ScΔleuS. In Vivo Complementation Assay—The carrier plasmid p414TEF with a tef promoter (TRP selection marker gene) allows a moderate level of constitutive gene expression (29Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The plasmids carrying the genes encoding ycLeuRS, hcLeuRS, and EcLeuRS were transformed separately into the ScΔleuS strain. Transformants were grown at 30 °C on a plate with synthetic defined (SD) medium minus tryptophan (SD-Trp-). In 2–3 days, colonies formed and were further analyzed for the compensation phenotype. By culturing in liquid SD-Trp- media, cells were grown to an A600 = 0.1. And then 5 μl of yeast culture was dropped to 5-FOA plates without tryptophan and with uracil to allow the loss of the pAL5 maintenance plasmid. The growth of the yeast cells was then observed. Measurement of the Growth Rate—Knock-out yeast cells containing the different rescuing plasmids p414TEF-leuS were grown at 30 °C in liquid SD-Trp- media. Each culture was diluted in liquid SD-Trp- media to an initial A600 = 0.1. The diluted culture was shaken at 30 °C. A parallel assay in which the medium was supplemented with various concentrations of Nva, 1 mm Ile, or 1.25 μg/ml AN2690 was performed separately. The A600 value was measured at various intervals, and the growth rate was calculated according to the logistic growth equation (14Bacher J.M. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1697-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Plasmids Harboring the ycleuS Mutants—Alignment of the editing domain sequence from prokaryotic, archaeal, and eukaryotic LeuRSs shows that only the “T-rich,” “GTG,” and “editing catalytic” regions are well conserved (Fig. 1A). We define three types of residues based on conservation: 1) absolutely conserved residues through all species, e.g. Thr-319 and Asp-419; 2) conserved residues in the eukaryotic cytoplasmic LeuRSs from yeast to human, e.g. Thr-347 and Thr-410; and 3) conserved residues of each kingdom, e.g. Lys-404, Ser-416, and Asp-418. Although the equivalent residues of Thr-319 and Thr-410 in prokaryotic LeuRS (10Xu M.G. Li J. Du X. Wang E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Asp-419 in ycLeuRS (9Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have been studied before, the in vivo effects of these mutations remain unclear. Thr-347 is located in the large peptidic region between the T-rich and GTG regions. This region is poorly conserved in prokaryotic LeuRS, and little information is available on its role. Residues Lys-404 and Asp-418 have not yet been investigated in LeuRS, whereas the homologue of Asp-416 in prokaryotic LeuRS has been shown to have no effect on editing (9Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the aforementioned seven residues were selected for mutagenesis to study their effects on the editing function of ycLeuRS. A diagram of the homologous structure of the editing domain of Thermus thermophilus LeuRS (TtLeuRS), in which the mutated residues are highlighted, is provided (Fig. 1B). Recombinant plasmids containing ycleuS single-point mutations at these seven positions were constructed to assay the aminoacylation and editing properties (see “Experimental Procedures”). Construction of the S. cerevisiae leuS Null Allele Strain ScΔleuS and Compensation of ScΔleuS with LeuRSs from Various Species—To test the enzymatic activity of ycLeuRS mutants in vivo, a knock-out S. cerevisiae strain for leuS, ScΔleuS, was constructed. ScΔleuS could not survive without the rescuing plasmid pAL5, showing that leuS is an essential gene. Human cytoplasmic LeuRS could rescue ScΔleuS lethality but not E. coli LeuRS (Fig. 2A). This suggests that human enzyme hcLeuRS can charge the yeast cytoplasmic tRNALeu in vivo, whereas prokaryotic EcLeuRS cannot cross the species barrier of recognition. Yeast Strains Harboring ycLeuRS and the Enzymes Mutated in the Editing Domain Grow at the Same Rate in the Absence of Excess Leu Analogue—Native ycLeuRS and its seven mutated derivatives were overproduced in E. coli and purified to 90% homogeneity, as assessed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The aminoacylation of yctRNALeu by the eight proteins was assayed and was not found to be obviously different (Fig. 3A). The ScΔleuS yeast strain was transformed with plasmids expressing each of the wild-type or mutant ycLeuRS enzymes. All the mutants were able to rescue the knock-out strain as shown by the ability of these plasmids to substitute the rescuing plasmid pAL5 on 5-FOA plates (data not shown). The growth rates of the 8 ScΔleuS strains were monitored in liquid SD-Trp-. All were comparable to the native one (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the mutation of these residues did not impair significantly the aminoacylation properties of LeuRS, at least under normal growth condition without excess Leu analogues (Ile, Met, Val, and Nva, etc.). Mischarging Capacity with Ile and Deacylation Activity of Mutant Enzymes in Vitro—To investigate the editing activity of ycLeuRS mutants, we examined the accumulation of mischarged Ile-tRNALeu in vitro. Among the seven mutants, only ycLeuRS-D419A and ycLeuRS-T319E yielded mischarged Ile-tRNALeu (Fig. 4A); the other five mutants did not noticeably mischarge tRNALeu with Ile (data not shown). Deacylation of AaIle-tRNALeu by ycLeuRS and its seven mutants was also studied (Fig. 4B). AaIle-tRNALeu was rapidly hydrolyzed by ycLeuRS; however, the post-transfer editing activity of ycLeuRS-D419A or ycLeuRS-T319E was completely abolished, while the deacylation ability was impaired to various degrees with the five other mutants. ycLeuRS Misactivates Nva Efficiently—The kinetics of ycLeuRS for Leu, Nva, and Ile in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction were assayed. Nva was efficiently misactivated with a catalytic efficiency decreased of only 105-fold (Table 1). Ile was also misactivated by ycLeuRS, but the catalytic efficiency for Ile was 69-fold lower than that for Nva (Table 1). Because Nva was misactivated more efficiently than Ile, it was used in the following in vivo experiments.TABLE 1Kinetic constants of activation and misactivation by ycLeuRS at 30 °C All values are the average of three experiments.Kmkcatkcat/Kmkcat/Km (relative)μms–1s–1 μm–1Leu4.41 ± 0.8337.5 ± 0.058.51Nva167 ± 4.913.5 ± 2.70.0819.53e–3Ile8713 ± 124210.2 ± 1.61.17e–31.38e–4 Open table in a new tab Effect of Exogenous Nva on the Growth Rate of ScΔleuS Carrying the Editing-defective LeuRS Mutant—Under physiological conditions, yeast cells are not exposed to excess of noncognate amino acids. Thus weak mischarging of tRNA may mask the toxicity of possible editing defects to cells. To circumvent this problem, we measured the growth rates of the eight strains in liquid SD-Trp- media containing a low concentration of Leu (0.51 mm) and a large excess of noncognate amino acids Nva (10 mm). Under these growth conditions we were expecting to increase the amount of noncognate amino acid Nva in the cytoplasm. The growth rate of ScΔleuS containing the gene encoding wild-type ycLeuRS cultured with 10 mm Nva was decreased by 35% in comparison to that without Nva (Figs. 3B and 4C). This indicates that ycLeuRS could not completely prevent the mischarging of Nva in vivo due to the highly efficient misactivation with Nva. The growth rate of the strains containing LeuRS-T319E or LeuRS-D419A mutant enzymes was severely inhibited (13% or 34% of the growth rate of the ScΔleuS-ycLeuRS strain) compared with wild-type ycLeuRS. These data show that the catalytic editing pocket composed of the T-rich region and hydrolytic Asp residue is crucial for cell viability in the presence of Nva. Substitution of the semi-conserved residues Lys-404, Ser-416, and Asp-418 with their equivalent residues from prokaryotic LeuRS reduced the growth rate to −55%, 62%, and 66% of the wild-type growth rate, respectively (Fig. 4C). The last two mutants T347A and T410A exhibited a more severely decreased growth rate of 51% and 40% of the wild-type strain, respectively (Fig. 4C). In summary, the data show that a toxic effect is clearly observable in the presence of an excess of noncognate amino acid. This contrasts with the absence of effect on the growth rate in a standard culture medium and suggests that editing is really crucial in extreme growth conditions exhibiting elevated concentrations of noncognate amino acid analogues. We also tested the growth of all the editing-deficient strains at the low concentration of 1 mm Nva. For the crucial editing mutants such as T319E and D419A, both yeast strains displayed severe growth inhibition (data not shown). The other editing mutant yeast strains showed less conspicuous but still significant growth inhibition (data not shown). Further, we studied the growth of the strain carrying the severe D419A mutation in the presence of a modest excess of noncognate amino acid Ile (1 mm excess compared with no addition of Ile in the standard SD-Trp- media). Although Ile is involved in protein biosynthesis as a natural amino acid, we could observe a significant inhibitive effect on the growth rate of the editing-defect strain bearing D419A mutation (data not shown). The Yeast Knock-out Strain Can Be Used to Study the Binding of AN2690—A recently developed antibiotic, AN2690 (see Fig. 5A), specifically targets the editing active site of LeuRS (25Rock F.L. Mao W. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Crepin T. Zhou H. Zhang Y.K. Hernandez V. Akama T. Baker S.J. Plattner J.J. Shapiro L. Martinis S.A. Benkovic S.J. Cusack S. Alley M.R. Science. 2007; 316: 1759-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). AN2690 with tRNALeu forms a stable adduct in the editing pocket of ycLeuRS and thus prevents the catalytic turnover and the synthesis of Leu-tRNALeu (25Rock F.L. Mao W. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Crepin T. Zhou"
https://openalex.org/W1966876910,"The neuronal adaptor protein Fe65 is involved in brain development, Alzheimer disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) signaling, and proteolytic processing of APP. It contains three protein-protein interaction domains, one WW domain, and a unique tandem array of phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. The N-terminal PTB domain (Fe65-PTB1) was shown to interact with a variety of proteins, including the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1), the ApoEr2 receptor, and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60. We have determined the crystal structures of human Fe65-PTB1 in its apo- and in a phosphate-bound form at 2.2 and 2.7Å resolution, respectively. The overall fold shows a PTB-typical pleckstrin homology domain superfold. Although Fe65-PTB1 has been classified on an evolutionary basis as a Dab-like PTB domain, it contains attributes of other PTB domain subfamilies. The phosphotyrosine-binding pocket resembles IRS-like PTB domains, and the bound phosphate occupies the binding site of the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) within the canonical NPXpY recognition motif. In addition Fe65-PTB1 contains a loop insertion between helix α2 and strand β2(α2/β2 loop) similar to members of the Shc-like PTB domain subfamily. The structural comparison with the Dab1-PTB domain reveals a putative phospholipid-binding site opposite the peptide binding pocket. We suggest Fe65-PTB1 to interact with its target proteins involved in translocation and signaling of APP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The neuronal adaptor protein Fe65 is involved in brain development, Alzheimer disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) signaling, and proteolytic processing of APP. It contains three protein-protein interaction domains, one WW domain, and a unique tandem array of phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. The N-terminal PTB domain (Fe65-PTB1) was shown to interact with a variety of proteins, including the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1), the ApoEr2 receptor, and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60. We have determined the crystal structures of human Fe65-PTB1 in its apo- and in a phosphate-bound form at 2.2 and 2.7Å resolution, respectively. The overall fold shows a PTB-typical pleckstrin homology domain superfold. Although Fe65-PTB1 has been classified on an evolutionary basis as a Dab-like PTB domain, it contains attributes of other PTB domain subfamilies. The phosphotyrosine-binding pocket resembles IRS-like PTB domains, and the bound phosphate occupies the binding site of the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) within the canonical NPXpY recognition motif. In addition Fe65-PTB1 contains a loop insertion between helix α2 and strand β2(α2/β2 loop) similar to members of the Shc-like PTB domain subfamily. The structural comparison with the Dab1-PTB domain reveals a putative phospholipid-binding site opposite the peptide binding pocket. We suggest Fe65-PTB1 to interact with its target proteins involved in translocation and signaling of APP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Fe65 is an adaptor protein predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a critical role in neuronal development and APP 2The abbreviations used are:APPamyloid precursor proteinPTBphosphotyrosine-bindingPHpleckstrin homologyITCisothermal titration calorimetryr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationIP3inositol 1,4,5-triphosphatePDBProtein Data Bank. 2The abbreviations used are:APPamyloid precursor proteinPTBphosphotyrosine-bindingPHpleckstrin homologyITCisothermal titration calorimetryr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationIP3inositol 1,4,5-triphosphatePDBProtein Data Bank. signaling (1King G.D.

Fe65 exhibits three protein-protein interaction domains with different binding specificities as follows: one N-terminal WW domain and two contiguous C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domains (PTB1 and PTB2).

PTB domains are protein-protein interaction modules recognizing short peptide regions, including the canonical NPXpY consensus sequence (sometimes reduced to NXXpY; X indicates relaxed residue selectivity) (21Smith M.J. Hardy W.R. Murphy J.M. Jones N. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8461-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PTB domains differ in their specificities for phosphorylated or unphosphorylated tyrosines, and most of the analyzed PTB domains bind their substrates in a Tyr(P)-independent manner. Based on evolutionary and structural comparisons, the PTB domains have been classified in three different subfamilies as follows: the Tyr(P)-dependent IRS-like and Shc-like PTB domains, and the Tyr(P)-independent Dab-like PTB domains (22Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All PTB domains include the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfold consisting of seven antiparallel β-strands forming two orthogonal β-sheets (β-sandwich) capped by a C-terminal α-helix. The peptide binding pocket is mainly formed by the β5-strand and the C-terminal α-helix. In addition, many PTB domains contain a basic phospholipid binding “crown” located on the opposite site of the peptide binding pocket (22Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains contain two additional α-helices, one located N-terminally and one inserted between the strands β1 and β2. Shc-like PTB domains contain also a large loop insertion between helix α2 and strand β2(α2/β2 loop). Here we report the first structure of a Fe65-PTB domain, Fe65-PTB1, in its apo- and in a phosphate-bound form at 2.2 and 2.7 Å, respectively. Although Fe65-PTB1 has been classified as a Dab-like PTB-domain, its structure reveals characteristics of different PTB domain subfamilies. The data presented here set the stage for an atomic understanding of a molecular crossroad of APP metabolism and Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Structure Determination—Expression, purification, and crystallization of Fe65-PTB1 (residues Gly-366 to Glu-505) as well as X-ray data collection were performed as described (23Radzimanowski J. Ravaud S. Beyreuther K. Sinning I. Wild K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2008; 64: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The structure of Fe65-PTB1 was determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction collected on a mercury derivative crystal (P212121 space group) (23Radzimanowski J. Ravaud S. Beyreuther K. Sinning I. Wild K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2008; 64: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Phasing was performed with the program suite PHENIX (Python-based Hierarchical Environment for Integrated Xtallography) (24Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar, 25Adams P.D.

Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). After density modification, phases were of sufficient quality for automatic model building. The PHENIX-AUTOBUILD routine was able to build 230 residues (and the C-α traces of 22 additional amino acids) of the two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The model was completed using iterative cycles of model building in COOT (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC5 (27Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The refined model was used as a search model to solve the native structure (H3 space group) (23Radzimanowski J. Ravaud S. Beyreuther K. Sinning I. Wild K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Model building and refinement were performed as for the derivative structure (Table 1). Fe65-PTB1 complexed with phosphate was obtained by soaking native crystals (H3 space group) for 10 min in the crystallization buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4. Data collection statistics are presented in supplemental Table S1. The phosphate-bound structure was subsequently solved by difference Fourier technique using the native structure and refined as the other models (Table 1). The quality of all models was validated with programs PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

The secondary structure was analyzed with program DSSP (32Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar). Surface potentials were calculated with program GRASP (33Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B.

Fe65-PTB1 and the respective peptides were extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. Solutions were degassed immediately before measuring, and all binding experiments were performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) equilibrated at the desired temperature (15 or 25 °C). For all measurements the cell was filled with 20 μm peptide or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and 200 μm of purified Fe65-PTB1 was used as the titrant in the syringe. A typical titration consisted of injections of 12-μl aliquots of the titrant into the solution in the cell under constant stirring at 300 rpm at time intervals of 5 min to ensure that the titration peak returned to the base line. For data analysis the Origin 7.0 software was used. Immobilized Peptide Libraries—Immobilized peptide libraries representing residues Met-229 to Trp-513 of the histone acetyltransferase domain of human Tip60 (10- and 15-mer peptides both tyrosine-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated with either one or three residue shifts) were synthesized as described previously (36Groves M.R.

Peptide Arrays on Membrane Supports. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2002: 83-96Crossref Google Scholar). After 2 h blocking with 4% (w/v) skim milk (Sigma) in the incubation buffer (20 mm K2HPO4, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with 0.25 μm purified Fe65-PTB1 in the incubation buffer for 1 h at 20 °C. Bound Fe65-PTB1 was detected with an anti-His antibody (Qiagen) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Incubations with the antibodies were performed in the incubation buffer supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) skim milk. All incubation steps were followed by three consecutive wash steps of 10 min in the incubation buffer. Phospholipid Binding Assays—A membrane lipid strip (PIP-strip, Echelon) pre-spotted with a solvent blank control and 15 different biologically abundant lipids found in cell membranes was blocked at 20 °C for 1 h in PBST buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.2) supplemented with 3% (w/v) skim milk (Sigma) and afterward incubated at 20 °C for 1 h in the same buffer containing 1–100 μg/ml Fe65-PTB1. Bound Fe65-PTB1 was detected with an anti-His antibody (Qiagen) and visualized using an ECL anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Structure Determination of Fe65-PTB1—The N-terminal PTB domain of human Fe65 (Fe65-PTB1, residues Gly-366 to Glu-505) crystallized in the two space groups H3 (native crystals; four molecules per asymmetric unit) and P212121 (derivative crystals; two molecules per asymmetric unit). The orthorhombic space group was metal-induced as the result of co-crystallization experiments with methyl mercury chloride as described previously (23Radzimanowski J. Ravaud S. Beyreuther K. Sinning I. Wild K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2008; 64: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was determined at 2.2 Å resolution by single wavelength anomalous diffraction using a mercury derivative crystal. The native structure (H3 space group) was determined by molecular replacement at 2.8 Å resolution. Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. In the P212121 space group, the two molecules of the asymmetric unit are well ordered except two residues (Gly-460 and Arg-461) in a loop region. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the P212121 and the H3 structures has an average of 0.74 Å for all C-α atoms. The main differences occur in a loop region comprising residues Gln-400 to Lys-420 (see below). In the H3 space group this region is mostly not visible in the electron density. Overall Structure of Fe65-PTB1—The structure of the Fe65-PTB1 domain reveals the folding pattern of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfold (Fig. 1A). The core of this fold consists of seven antiparallel β-strands (β1–β7) arranged in two orthogonal β-sheets. This β-sandwich is capped by a C-terminal α-helix (α3). Additional structural features of the PH domain superfold are also present in Fe65-PTB1. These include the peptide binding pocket formed by strand β5, helix α3, and the β1/α2 loop, and a putative phospholipid-binding site next to the α2/β2 loop (see below). On an evolutionary basis, Fe65-PTB1 has been grouped into the Dab-like PTB domain subfamily (22Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Consistent with this classification, an analysis of the Fe65-PTB1 structure using the Dali server (38Holm L. Sander C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 653-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified Dab-like PTB domains as the closest structural relatives (for details see supplemental Table S2). However, sequence identities are relatively low (below 25%), and the r.m.s.d. values of about 2.0 Å indicate significant structural differences between Fe65-PTB1 and Dab-like PTB domains. The α1-helix located at the N terminus of Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2) is not present in the Fe65-PTB1 structure and is not predicted on the sequence level. Like most PTB domains, Fe65-PTB1 includes one additional helix (α2) located between the β1- and β2-strands (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Fe65-PTB1 reveals a unique β1/α2 loop (residues Met-380 to Arg-389) with an inserted 310 helix (310A, residues Glu-382 to Leu-385) as part of the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. The α2/β2 loop is extended (residues Gln-400 to Lys-420), which is a characteristic feature of the Shc subfamily of PTB domains where this loop has accordingly been termed as Shc loop (22Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, this extended loop is also present in the Dab-like X11-PTB domain (39Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the P212121 space group this loop is involved in crystal contacts and is part of the model. However, in the structures derived from the H3 space group, the α2/β2 loop is not present indicating a high conformational flexibility. Phosphate Binding to Fe65-PTB1 Suggests Phosphotyrosine-dependent Peptide Interactions—The overall mode of peptide binding is conserved in all PTB domain structures determined so far (Fig. 2). PTB-binding peptides fold in trans as an anti-parallel β-strand on top of strand β5 and are aligned parallel to the C-terminal helix α3. The consensus sequence fingerprint of PTB-binding peptides consists of the NPXpY motif. NPXpY motifs are typical internalization signals for membrane-associated receptor proteins (40Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence has a high propensity of forming a β-turn structure, which in all PTB domains is specifically read out by an “anchoring” binding pocket harboring most of the peptide binding energy especially in the Tyr(P)-dependent interactions (43Farooq A. Plotnikova O. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6114-6121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The three PTB domain subfamilies differ significantly in (phospho)-tyrosine recognition (Fig. 2). In Dab-like PTB domains, the anchoring pocket has only a minor role in peptide recognition, and tyrosine phosphorylation often decreases the binding affinity (39Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the contrary, IRS-like and Shc-like PTB domains require phosphorylated tyrosines for high affinity binding (46Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Shc-like PTB domains use three basic residues (two arginines and one lysine) to accommodate the Tyr(P) residue (46Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The IRS-1 structure reveals two other arginine residues at different locations, which create a basic pocket for the negatively charged phosphate moiety (48Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fe65-PTB1 contains two equivalent arginine residues (Arg-451 and Arg-470) at the same position as IRS-1. Arg-451 is involved in a tight salt bridge with Glu-382, which is located in the unique 310 helix (310A) of the β1/α2 loop (Fig. 3A). To test for a phosphorylation dependence of peptide binding to Fe65-PTB1, we soaked native Fe65-PTB1 crystals with phosphate and determined the structure at 2.7 Å resolution (see supplemental Table S1 for data collection statistics and Table 1 for refinement statistics). The binding of phosphate into the pocket could be confirmed by prominent difference densities in the unbiased difference density maps (Fig. 2). The occupancy for the phosphate is 75%, and together with the phosphate concentration of 50 mm used in the soaking experiments a Kd value in the range of 20 mm can be estimated. Phosphate binding in the Fe65-PTB1 structure is exclusively performed by the two arginine residues Arg-451 and Arg-470 (Fig. 3A). Although the terminal nitrogen N-ϵ2 of Arg-451 forms a single hydrogen bond to phosphate oxygen, Arg-470 orients the phosphate by two hydrogen bonds with its guanidinium group. Although the charge of Arg-451 is partially neutralized by the interaction with Glu-382, it will contribute to phosphate binding due to the nondirected character of Coulomb interactions. In addition to phosphate binding, the conserved Arg-451 is perfectly located to stabilize a putative phosphotyrosine binding by a π-cation stacking interaction of the aromatic ring with the planar guanidinium group. When phosphate-bound Fe65-PTB1 is superposed on the IRS-1 PTB domain complexed with a phosphorylated interleukin-4 receptor peptide (48Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the phosphate groups are found to bind in the same position and orientation (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we assume the bound phosphate group in Fe65-PTB1 to mimic the phosphate moiety of a phosphorylated peptide indicating a phosphorylation dependence of peptide recognition. The binding mode of the two arginines to the phosphate moiety of Tyr(P) is, however, slightly different. In IRS-1 the arginine residue (Arg-212) equivalent to Arg-451 in Fe65-PTB1 is not stabilized by a salt bridge, and the whole binding pocket is more open compared with Fe65-PTB1. Interestingly, the corresponding arginine to Arg-470 (Arg-227) is not involved in direct hydrogen bonding with the phosphate in the IRS-1 structure. The tighter binding of the phosphate moiety suggests at least an equal preference of Fe65-PTB1 for phosphorylated substrates. Similarly, when the Dab1 structure in complex with an unphosphorylated APP peptide (49Yun M. Keshvara L. Park C.G. Zhang Y.M. Dickerson J.B. Zheng J. Rock C.O. Curran T. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36572-36581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is overlaid on Fe65-PTB1, the hydroxyl of the bound APP tyrosine matches with the phosphate oxygen that is hydrogen-bonded to Arg-451 (Fig. 3C). In Dab1, however, the binding pocket lacks the two arginine residues, and the binding of a nonphosphorylated tyrosine is favored (49Yun M. Keshvara L. Park C.G. Zhang Y.M. Dickerson J.B. Zheng J. Rock C.O. Curran T. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36572-36581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 50Stolt P.C. Jeon H. Song H.K. Herz J. Eck M.J. Blacklow S.C. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The β1/α2 loop in Dab1 also contributes to the binding pocket but via an alanine residue. The Fe65-PTB1 residue Glu-382 located on helix 310A is not conserved in Dab1. In summary, peptide binding to Fe65-PTB1 is likely to be Tyr(P)-dependent as deduced from the conservation of the binding pocket and the binding mode of the bound phosphate moiety. The conservation of the binding pocket reveals a relationship in peptide binding to IRS-like PTB domains. Interaction with Putative Binding Partners—The histone acetyltransferase Tip60 was identified as a Fe65-PTB1 binding partner in a study performed by Cao and Sudhof (7Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

Several mutants for Asp-354, Asp-466, and Lys-493, located close to PQQ, that were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis were characterized by enzymatic, pulse radiolysis, and EPR analyses. These mutants retained almost no dehydrogenase activity or ability of PQQ reduction.

Subsequently, intramolecular electron transfer from the bound UQ semiquinone to PQQ occurred. In K493R, the rate of UQ to PQQ electron transfer is about 4-fold slower than that of the wild enzyme. With D354N and D466N mutants, on the other hand, transient species with an absorption maximum at 440 nm, a characteristic of the formation of a UQ anion radical, appeared in the reaction of eaq-, although the subsequent intramolecular electron transfer was hardly affected. This indicates that D354N and D466N are prevented from protonation of the UQ semiquinone radical. Moreover, EPR spectra showed that mutations on Asp-466 or Lys-493 residues changed the semiquinone state of bound UQ. Taken together, we reported here for the first time the existence of a semiquinone radical of bound UQ in purified mGDH and the difference in protonation of ubisemiquinone radical because of mutations in two different amino acid residues, located around PQQ.

A single bound UQ was found in the crystal structures in succinate dehydrogenase (15Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Tornroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Leger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S.

The yeast mitochondrial type II NADH dehydrogenase has been demonstrated to have two UQ-binding sites (21Yamashita T. Nakamura E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but the tertiary structure still remains to be resolved. The E. coli cytochrome bo ubiquinol oxidase has two UQ-binding sites with high (QH) and with low (QL) affinity for UQ (23Sato-Watanabe M. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Iwamura H. Matsushita K. Adachi O.

The crucial amino acid residues interacting with UQ at QH have been identified and shown to be conserved in cytochrome bo or bd ubiquinol oxidases (25Abramson J. Riistama S. Larrson G. Jasaitis A.

The UQ-binding site adopts a binding conformation similar to that of UQ-binding sites (QI and Qo) of the cytochrome bc1 complex in bovine mitochondria (26Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M.

Amino acid residues interacting with bound UQ in the E. coli cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase (27Matsumoto Y. Murai M. Fujita D. Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Yoshida M. Mogi T. J. Biol.

Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K. Cell. 2006; 127: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have also been reported. However, little information on the local structure or physiological function of bound UQ in primary components of respiratory chains has so far been available. Although more than a dozen quinoprotein dehydrogenases have been discovered, little is known about their intramolecular electron transfer pathways. The E. coli mGDH has been demonstrated to have two UQ-binding sites, one (QI) for bound UQ and the other (QII) for bulk UQ (29Elias M.D. Nakamura S. Migita C.T. Miyoshi H. Toyama H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3078-3083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is near the membrane surface rather than in the hydrophobic interior (30Miyoshi H. Niitome Y. Matsushita K. Yamada M. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In succession to the catalytic reaction, electrons from PQQH2 would be transferred directly to UQ in the QII site or via bound UQ. Our previous study revealed that a eaq- produced by pulse radiolysis caused rapid reduction of a bound UQ, followed by intramolecular electron transfer to PQQ in mGDH. The interdomain electron transfer from UQ to PQQ occurs in both directions, and the distance, 11-13 Å, between PQQ and bound UQ (31Kobayashi K. Mustafa G. Tagawa S. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is similar to the two redox centers of copper-containing nitrate reductase (37Kobayashi K. Koppenhöer A. Ferguson S.J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of the local structure of the bound UQ site has so far been limited. The E. coli mGDH is a good model for primary dehydrogenases in terms of occurrence as a single protein and as an apoprotein, which can be easily purified and reconstituted with its coenzyme PQQ (5Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ameyama M. Nonobe M. Hayashi M. Shinagawa E. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 1227-1231Google Scholar). This model might provide valuable information on the physiological function of bound UQ and on the intramolecular electron transfer. In this study, we identified amino acid residues interacting with bound UQ and proposed their functions in intramolecular events of the enzyme. Clues for this issue have been obtained by previous studies that revealed very close location of the bound UQ to PQQ (31Kobayashi K. Mustafa G. Tagawa S. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the position and functions of Asp-466 and Lys-493 flanking PQQ (11Elias M.D. Tanaka M. Izu H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7321-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants of Asp-354, Asp-466, and Lys-493 had significant effects on the characteristics of UQ semiquinone radicals or UQ EPR signals and/or the affinity for UQ. Therefore, these amino acid residues seem to be crucial not only for the catalytic reaction but also for the function of bound UQ. We discuss the possible interaction between the catalytic reaction and the intramolecular electron transfer in mGDH. Materials—UQn was kindly provided by Eizai Co., Ltd. (Japan).

Construction of D354N Mutant—To construct the D354N mGDH mutant, site-specific mutagenesis was carried out using the Mutan™-Super Express Km kit (Takara Shuzo) as described previously (11Elias M.D. Tanaka M.

The mutagenic primer used for the mutant was 5′-CAGTTACCaatAACTTCTC-3′. Purification of Wild-type and Mutant mGDHs—YU423 cells harboring the wild-type pUCGCD1 or harboring one of the pUCGCDs encoding mutant mGDH were grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) for 12 h at 30 °C under aerobic conditions. Harvesting of cells and preparation of membrane fractions were carried out as described by Yamada et al. (5Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

In particular, to improve the recovery of UQ-containing mGDH, we avoided using chloride-containing buffer and Triton X-100, and dialysis after the first column chromatography was eliminated. Membrane fractions (∼10 mg/ml of protein) were treated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.04% DM and centrifuged 86,000 × g for 90 min, and the resultant membrane fractions were subjected to solubilization for 60 min in the presence of 100 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.2% DM. The suspension was centrifuged at 86,000 × g for 90 min, and the supernatant obtained was dialyzed against the 10 mm KPB buffer (pH 7.0) without DM. The dialysate was applied onto a DEAE-Toyopearl column (1-ml bed volume/about 10 mg of protein) equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% DM. The column was washed with 10-bed volumes of the same buffer and successively with 10-bed volumes of 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient composed of 10-bed volumes of 25 mm KPB buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM and 10-bed volumes of 130 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. Active fractions eluted were pooled and directly applied onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (1-ml bed volume/about 5 mg of protein) equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. The column was washed with 10-bed volumes of 200 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. mGDH was eluted by a linear gradient composed of 10-bed volumes of 200 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM and 10-bed volumes of 1 m KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. Active fractions at about 700 mm KPB were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0). The active fractions dialyzed were concentrated by a DEAE-Toyopearl column (1-ml bed volume/about 10 mg of protein), in which the enzyme adsorbed was eluted with a small volume of 150 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% DM. These concentrated materials were found to have homogeneity of more than 95%, judging from SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and were used as purified mGDHs. Measurement of Protein and Enzyme Activities—Protein content was determined according to the Dulley and Grieve method (35Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Holoenzyme formation was performed by incubating membrane fractions or purified mGDH in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 30 μm PQQ and 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C. Using the holoenzyme thus prepared, the following enzyme activities were measured. PMS reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically (U-2000A, Hitachi) with PMS and 2,4-dichlorophenol indophenol as an electron mediator and acceptor, respectively, as described previously (3Van Schie B.J.

The contents of mGDH protein in membrane fractions were compared by Western blot analysis using an antibody against E. coli mGDH (36Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD Analysis—Far-ultraviolet (200-260 nm) circular CD (far-UV CD) spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a J-600 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) with a 1.0-cm cuvette, by which the conformation of purified mutant mGDHs (2.3 μm) in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) was compared with that of the wild-type mGDH. Determination of UQ Content in Mutant mGDHs—Three nmol of enzyme was treated with 10 volumes of 100% ethanol in the presence of 3 nmol of UQ6 as an internal standard and incubated for 30 min by mild shaking at 30 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove denatured protein molecules. The supernatant was mixed with 2.5 volumes of n-hexane for 1 min. The upper phase was collected and dried, and the residue was then resolved in 0.2 ml of HPLC solvent (ethanol/methanol/acetonitrile, 4:3:3 v/v). The resolved materials were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC using a Zorbax ODS column (Mitsuitoatsu, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 278 nm by using an SPD-M6A photodiode array detector (Shimadzu, Japan). UQ from purified mGDH samples was identified by comparison of its migration with those of standard UQs (UQ8 and UQ6), and the content was estimated from the ratio of the peak area to that of the internal standard UQ6. Pulse Radiolysis Analysis of Mutant mGDHs—Pulse radiolysis experiments with purified mutant and wild-type mGDHs were performed on a linear accelerator at the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University (37Kobayashi K.

Samples for pulse radiolysis were prepared in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.1 m of tert-butyl alcohol (for scavenging OH radicals) and subjected to repeated deaeration followed by flushing with argon gas. Each sample was placed in a quartz cell with an optical path length of 1 cm. The temperature of the sample was maintained at 25 °C. The light source for the spectrophotometer was a 200-watt xenon lamp. After passing through an optical path, the transmitted light intensities were analyzed and monitored by a fast spectrophotometric system composed of a Nikon monochromator, a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics, R-928), and a Unisoku data analyzing system. For time-resolved transient absorption spectral measurement, the monitor light was focused into quartz optical fiber, which transported the electron pulse-induced transmittance changes to a gated spectrometer (Unisoku, TSP-601-02). The concentration of eaq- generated by pulse radiolysis was determined by absorbance change at 650 nm using an extinction coefficient of 14.1 mm-1 cm-1 (41Gordon S. Hart E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 5343-5344Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and was adjusted by varying the dose of the electron beam. EPR Spectroscopy—Two hundred μl of concentrated enzyme solution (60-80 μm) in an extra high quality quartz tube (5 mm in outer diameter) was frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR experiments were carried out on a Bruker E500 spectrophotometer equipped with an hsw10106 resonator and an Oxford E900 cryostat under the same conditions as those described by Elias et al. (29Elias M.D. Nakamura S. Migita C.T. Miyoshi H. Toyama H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3078-3083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that PQQ was not added for detection of the semiquinone radical of bound UQ. Structural Integrity and Enzyme Activity of Purified Mutant mGDHs—In our previous study, it was shown that Asp-466 and Lys-493, located in close proximity to PQQ, are crucial for a successive process of catalytic reactions from glucose oxidation to UQ reduction. Therefore, we assumed that these amino acid residues interact directly or indirectly with bound UQ, and mutation of these residues appears to impair electron transfer between the bound UQ and PQQ. This assumption was tested with five mutants, D354N, D466E, D466N, K493A, and K493R. Of these, D354N mutant was constructed in this study. Western blot analysis with membrane fractions from cells expressing each mutant mGDH revealed that all mutant mGDHs were expressed at a level similar to that of the wild-type mGDH (11Elias M.D. Tanaka M. Izu H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7321-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (data not shown for D354N). In the purification process with two column chromatographies, elution patterns of these mutant mGDHs were found to be almost the same as that of the wild-type mGDH. We further checked effects of mutations on the protein structure by CD analysis with the purified mutant proteins. The results showed that there was almost no difference from that of the wild-type mGDH in the five mutants (Fig. 2 and data not shown), suggesting that these mutants retained a conformation almost unaltered compared with that of the wild-type mGDH. PMS reductase activity reflecting glucose dehydrogenase activity of purified mGDH mutants was then compared with that of the purified wild-type mGDH (Table 1). As reported previously (10Yamada M.

Consistent with the level of dehydrogenase activity, UQ2 reductase activities of these mutants were remarkably reduced. No significant increase both in reductase activities was observed under saturation conditions of electron acceptors in any mutant or wild-type mGDHs. These data suggest that the mutants examined maintain an intrinsic structure of the protein but lose almost all of catalytic activity, which agrees with results of previous studies (10Yamada M.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Mutations on UQ Content in Purified mGDHs—If Asp-354, Asp-466, or Lys-493 occurs close to or directly interacts with bound UQ, it is possible that the corresponding mGDH mutants alter the affinity for UQ. To examine this possibility, the content of UQ in each purified mutant mGDH was estimated by reverse-phase HPLC after elution of bound UQ from purified enzymes (Table 1). A compound corresponding to the position of UQ8 was detected at 19 min of retention time, with an absorption spectrum having a peak at 278 nm as reported previously (29Elias M.D. Nakamura S.

Programmed cell death is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, which have been identified within mammalian cells, although several lines of evidence suggest that the intrinsic pathway predominately regulates the death of motor neurons following acute injury in vivo. We have tested this hypothesis by performing facial axotomies on cytochrome c knock-in mice containing a point mutation in the genomic locus of cytochrome c resulting in a lysine to alanine conversion at position 72 of the protein. The introduced mutation inhibits the ability of cytochrome c to induce the formation of the apoptosome, a protein complex that is principally required for the activation of the intrinsic pathway, but does not alter its function in oxidative phosphorylation. Homozygous cytochrome c knock-in mutants displayed a significant enhancement in motor neuron survival following injury when compared with littermate controls, thus establishing the apoptosome as a viable target for protecting motor neurons from neural injury. However, protection of facial motor neurons differs from that previously reported in mice either overexpressing anti-apoptotic or lacking pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, which are thought to regulate several aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction including the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Therefore, these results directly demonstrate for the first time the influence of the apoptosome on injury-induced neuronal programmed cell death in vivo isolated from upstream Bcl-2 family-mediated effects.

A substantial body of literature on the signal transduction of PCD over the past 25 years has demonstrated the central integrative role of the mitochondrion in regulating this process. Principle among these mitochondrial events is the interaction of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (such as Bax and Bcl-2, respectively), which integrate a wide array of stimuli including the loss of trophic support, genotoxic DNA damage, excitotoxic glutamate injury, and death receptor-mediated signaling (9Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The balance of these interactions dictates the activation of the intrinsic pathway through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Binding of holo-cytochrome c to Apaf-1 in the presence of ATP promotes Apaf-1 oligomerization into a tripartite structure known as the apoptosome (10Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Cytochrome c, Smac (second mitochondrial activator of caspases), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) have all been shown to be released following mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and each has the ability to alter the progression of PCD (22Ekert P.G.

To analyze the contributions made by the intrinsic pathway in primary motor neurons, we examined PCD in mice containing a point mutation in cytochrome c following axotomy of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The introduced point mutation (lysine to alanine at position 72, denoted KA) does not inhibit oxidative phosphorylation but rather prevents the binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1 (32Hao Z. Duncan G.S. Chang C.C. Elia A. Fang M. Wakeham A. Okada H. Calzascia T. Jang Y. You-Ten A. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P. Wang X. Mak T.W.

These results thus directly identify the component of injury-induced apoptosis that is regulated through apoptosome activation alone. Animals—cyt c [+/+], [KA/+], and [KA/KA] mice were examined on both inbred (C57BL/6J) and outbred (mixed 129 Ola and C57BL/6J) genetic backgrounds and genotyped by PCR as previously described (32Hao Z. Duncan G.S. Chang C.C. Elia A. Fang M. Wakeham A. Okada H. Calzascia T. Jang Y. You-Ten A. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P. Wang X. Mak T.W.

Although cyt c [KA/KA] mutants were recovered at a higher frequency on the outbred background, no other significant differences in the effects described herein were observed between these genetic backgrounds. The results reported were obtained from the outbred genetic background. In addition, no significant differences between cyt c [+/+] and [KA/+] mice were observed for any of the analyses performed. The number of outbred cyt c [KA/KA] animals that survived to P3.5 were recovered at less than half of the expected Mendelian frequency (11%) with approximately half of these displaying hydrocephalus and exencephaly as previously described (32Hao Z. Duncan G.S. Chang C.C. Elia A. Fang M. Wakeham A. Okada H. Calzascia T. Jang Y. You-Ten A. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P. Wang X. Mak T.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); animals that did not display overt cranial defects were able to survive past P10.5 into adulthood. All of the procedures were in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the University of Toronto Faculty Advisory Committee on Animal Services. Facial Nerve Axotomy—Axotomy of the left facial nerve was performed on P3.5 cyt c [+/+], [KA/+], and [KA/KA] mouse pups. Briefly, a 5-mm incision was made caudal to the left ear under hypothermia anesthesia, and the musculature was separated to expose the facial nerve. A 1-mm segment of the left facial nerve distal to the stylomastoid foramen was resected, and the incision was sutured closed (Ethicon, 6.0; 0.7 metric; C1). The animals were allowed to recover for a period of 24 h, 48 h, or 7 days, at which time they were sacrificed, and the brainstem was removed and fixed at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Tail samples were collected prior to perfusion for genotyping, and the brainstems were processed for paraffin embedding. Motor Neuron Counts—For quantification of survival, brainstems containing the facial nucleus were processed as serial sets of 7-μm paraffin sections. Following dewaxing, the sections were stained with 0.1% thionin, dehydrated, and mounted according to standard procedures. Stereologic counts were performed on every 9th section, and total motor neuron numbers were assessed by the method of physical dissector (33Coggeshall R.E. Lekan H.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 364: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) (frame interval, 63 μm). Only motor neurons with intact nucleus and distinct nucleoli were counted. For quantification of motor neuron numbers within the cervical (C6-T1) and lumbar (T13-L1) spinal cord, stereologic counts were performed as described above every 11th section. A statistical analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was performed on the counts, and the p values <0.001 were assessed as significant. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Cytochrome c (1:20, Promega, G7421), SMI32 (1:200, Sternberg Biochemicals), islet-1 (1:1000, K5, kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Jessell, Columbia University), p75 (1:1000, kindly provided by Dr. Louis Reichardt, University of California, San Francisco), activated caspase-3 (1:200, NEB, 9661), phosphorylated c-Jun (1:200, serine 73, Upstate, 06-659), and AIF (1:200, Chemicon, AB16501) were utilized to examine cytochrome c mutant and control littermates. The tissues were cryoprotected in sucrose overnight at 4 °C and then embedded in OCT the next day. 15-micron frozen sections were collected every 5th section and incubated in permeabilization solution (0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature with agitation. The sections were then washed three times for 5 min and blocked in 5% goat sera, 0.2% Tween 20 (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h prior to overnight incubation in primary antibody at 4 °C with agitation. The sections were then incubated in secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature with agitation, after which they were either counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and directly visualized on a Nikon E1000 fluorescent microscope or post-processed for diamino benzidine-based horseradish peroxidase detection (Vector Labs). For phospho-c-Jun, the sections were co-incubated with neuronal marker NeuN (1:200, Chemicon, MAB377). Secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse 488 (Molecular Probes, A11001, 1:200) anti-rabbit Alexa 546 (1:200, Molecular Probes, A11010), anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:200, Molecular Probes, A11008), and anti-rabbit biotin (1:200, Vector labs, BA-1000). Imaging and Analysis—The images were captured by Simple-PCI (version 5.3, Compix Inc.) on a Nikon Eclipse E1000 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 camera for fluorescence microscopy and a Nikon DS-Fi1 color camera for brightfield analysis. The images were assembled and adjusted for brightness and contrast using Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems). Statistical ANOVA was performed using GraphPad PRISM (version 3.0). Analysis of Facial and Somatic Motor Neurons in cyt c [KA/KA] Mice following the Period of Developmental PCD—To first examine the role of cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in developmental PCD, we performed stereologic counts of motor neuron numbers in the cervical (C6-T1), lumbar (T13-L1), and facial motor pools at P10.5. Although post-natal cyt c [KA/KA] mutants were noted to exhibit some perturbation of the forebrain structure, the organization and morphology of the brainstem and spinal cord of cyt c [KA/KA] mice was overtly normal. For each population, cyt c [KA/KA] mice exhibited motor neuron numbers comparable with control littermates (Figs. 1 and 2, A, C, and H). These findings demonstrate that motor neurons in cyt c [KA/KA] mice showed wild-type levels of naturally occurring PCD, in agreement with previous studies performed in Apaf-1 and caspase-9 null mice (34Oppenheim R.W.

The numbers above the columns represent the mean numbers of motor neurons observed within serial sections taken through the full extent of the facial nucleus at P10.5 for that group. An analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA; all pairwise multiple comparison procedures: Tukey test; p < 0.001; p < 0.05) demonstrated that the number of surviving motor neurons in the ipsilateral nuclei of cyt c [KA/KA] animals differed significantly from the ipsilateral nuclei of cyt c [KA/+] and the contralateral nuclei of cyt c [KA/+] and [KA/KA] animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Facial Motor Neurons in cyt c [KA/KA] Mice following Neonatal Facial Axotomy—To determine whether apoptosome activation is involved in regulating PCD of motor neurons following injury, motor neurons were counted in facial nuclei at 1 week post-lesion (P10.5). In comparison with control littermates, cyt c [KA/KA] mice demonstrated a considerable enhancement of motor neuron survival in the injured nucleus (Fig. 2, B and D, respectively). By 1 week post-injury nearly all cyt c [KA/+] facial motor neurons had degenerated completely (Fig. 2F), with subsequent gliosis, relative to the contralateral uninjured side (Fig. 2E). In contrast, the surviving cyt c [KA/KA] motor neurons demonstrated a relatively healthy cytostructure (Fig. 2G). The percentage of surviving facial motor neurons increased from 17.5% in cyt c [+/+](n = 5; data not shown) and [KA/+](n = 11) mice to 56% in cyt c [KA/KA] (n = 9) animals (summarized in Fig. 2H), indicating that impairment of apoptosome function downstream of the mitochondria leads to the protection of approximately half of those motor neurons normally fated to die following axotomy. As shown in Fig. 3, cyt c [KA/KA] neonatal facial motor neurons were delineated by the local expression of p75 (Fig. 3A, red) and islet-1 (Fig. 3B, red). Within this neural population, the cellular distribution of cytochrome was examined 24 h following facial axotomy. In uninjured motor neurons, cytochrome c exhibited a punctate distribution, consistent with a mitochondrial localization in both cyt c [KA/+] and [KA/KA] mice (Fig. 3, C and E, respectively). Following axotomy, the majority of cytochrome c was redistributed to the cell cytoplasm in lesioned motor neurons of both cyt c [KA/+] and [KA/KA] mice (Fig. 3, D and F, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the relative proportion of facial motor neurons displaying cytosolic cytochrome c localization 24 h post-axotomy in cyt c [KA/KA] mice in comparison with littermate controls (Fig. 3G). These data demonstrate that introduction of the lysine to alanine point mutation (at position 72) to cytochrome c does not significantly alter its release from the mitochondria following the initiation of programmed cell death. Because the level of motor neuron rescue following apoptosome inhibition was not complete, we examined the pattern of caspase-3 activation in cyt c [KA/KA] and control (cyt c [KA/+]) mice 48 h post-axotomy. A significant elevation in caspase-3 activation was observed in the lesioned (ipsilateral) facial nucleus of cyt c [KA/+] mice at 48 h following axotomy (Fig. 4B). However, no significant increase in caspase-3 activation was seen in cyt c [KA/KA] mice following axotomy (Fig. 4D; summarized in Fig. 4E). The number of motor neurons positive for activated caspase-3 in the injured facial nucleus of cyt c [KA/KA] mice was comparable with the level in the unlesioned (contralateral) facial nuclei of cyt c [KA/+] and [KA/KA] mice (Fig. 4, A and C, respectively), which occurs as a result of developmental PCD that continues into the early postnatal period within lesioned and unlesioned facial nuclei. Thus, despite substantially reduced but still significant levels of motor neuron loss in lesioned cyt c [KA/KA] facial nuclei, caspase-3 activation does not appear to be elevated at 48 h post-injury. These data suggest that those motor neurons that do die following facial axotomy in cyt c [KA/KA] mice do so through a process that is independent of caspase-3 activity (35Houde C. Banks K.G. Coulombe N. Rasper D. Grimm E. Roy S. Simpson E.M. Nicholson D.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The level of motor neuron protection seen in cyt c [KA/KA] mutants is less than that previously described for Bax knock-out mice (20Deckwerth T.L. Elliott J.L. Knudson C.M. Johnson Jr., E.M.

However, it is similar to that previously reported in combinatorial mutants deficient in the c-Jun N-terminal kinases, JNK2 and JNK3 (36Davis R.J.

Transcriptional activation of c-Jun is mediated by JNK2 through the phosphorylation of conserved serine residues at position 63 and 73 (36Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar, 37Keramaris E. Vanderluit J.L. Bahadori M. Mousavi K. Davis R.J. Flavell R. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1132-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether apoptosome inhibition affected JNK activity by determining the pattern of c-Jun phosphorylation in facial motor neurons following axotomy. Both cyt c [KA/+] and [KA/KA] mice showed minimal levels of c-Jun phosphorylation within motor neurons of the unlesioned facial nuclei (Fig. 5, A–C and G–I, respectively), whereas the majority of lesioned facial nuclei displayed a substantial up-regulation of c-Jun phosphorylation both in cyt c [KA/+] (Fig. 5, D–F) and cyt c [KA/KA] (Fig. 5, J–L) mice (summarized in Fig. 5M). Thus, in contrast to JNK2/3 double knock-out mice, apoptosome inhibition has no effect on the induction of c-Jun phosphorylation, indicating that the anti-survival effects mediated by JNKs lie either upstream of the apoptosome (39Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), perhaps by initiating the pro-apoptotic activity of Bax (40Papadakis E.S. Finegan K.G. Wang X. Robinson A.C. Guo C.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) or alternatively through the induction of PCD via an independent mechanism. Subsequent to the loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity, AIF translocates from the intramitochondrial space to the nucleus, where it promotes large scale DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation (38Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3450) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of AIF in mediating motor neuron PCD has not been previously addressed. In uninjured motor neurons from the contralateral facial nucleus of cyt c [KA/+] and [KA/KA] mice, AIF immunoreactivity showed a punctate distribution consistent with a mitochondrial localization (Fig. 6, A and C, respectively). In contrast, nuclear localization of AIF was observed in nearly all of the lesioned cyt c [KA/+] motor neurons, but not cyt c [KA/KA] facial motor neurons at 48 h following axotomy (Fig. 6B and high magnification overview in Fig. 6E versus Fig. 6D and high magnification overview in Fig. 6F, respectively; summarized in Fig. 6G). These results demonstrate that AIF is normally released from the mitochondria of motor neurons following injury and translocates to the cell nucleus. Inhibition of apoptosome activation, however, prevents AIF translocation, suggesting that cytochrome c and AIF release occurs sequentially in motor neurons in vivo. Apoptosome Inhibition Prevents PCD in Motor Neurons following Injury but Not during Development—Early post-natal axotomy of cranial nerve VII in mice has been shown to result in a well characterized pattern of PCD in facial motor neurons because of the removal of target-derived trophic support (44Snider W.D. Elliott J.L. Yan Q. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1231-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 45Moran L.B. Graeber M.B. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 44: 154-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Depending upon the strain of mice utilized, 80–90% of facial motor neurons die via PCD by 7 days following axotomy when performed at P2–3 (37Keramaris E. Vanderluit J.L. Bahadori M. Mousavi K.

Local application of neurotrophic factors, such as glial-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, to the resected nerve stump results in an almost complete protection of motor neurons following facial axotomy (46Zhao Z.
