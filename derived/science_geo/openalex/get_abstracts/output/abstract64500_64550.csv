https://openalex.org/W2053549370,"As a communications system, the network of journals that play a paramount role in the exchange of scientific and technical information is little understood. Periodically since 1927, when Gross and Gross published their study (1) of references in 1 year’s issues of the Journal of the American Chemical Socie/y, pieces of the network have been illuminated by the work of Bradford (2), Allen (3), Gross and Woodford (4), Hooker (5), Henkle (6), Fussier (7), Brown (8), and others (9). Nevertheless, there is still no map of the journal network as a whok. To date, studies of the network and of the interrelation of its components have been limited in the number of journak, the areas of scientific study, and the periods of time their authors were able to consider, Such shortcomings have not been due to any lack of purpose, insight, or energy on the part of investigators, but to the practical difficulty of compiling and manipulating manually the enormous amount of necessary data. A solution to this problem of data is available in the data base used to produce the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) (10). The coverage of the SCI is international and multidisciplinary; it has grown from 600 journals in 1964 to 2400 journals in 1972, and now includes the world’s most important scientific and technical journals in mow disciplines. The SCI is published quarterly and is cumulated annually and quinquennially, but the data base from which the volumes are compiled is maintained on magnetic tape and is updated weekly. At the end of 1971, this data base contained more than 27 mi[tion references to about 10 million different published items. These references appeared over the past decade in the footnotes and bibliographies of more than 2 million journal articles, communications, letters, and so on. The data base is, thus, not only multidisciplinary, it covers a substantial period of time and, being in machine-readable form, is amenable to extensive manipulation by computer. In 1971, the Institute for Scientfic Information (1S1) decided to undertake a systematic analysis of journal citation patterns across the whole of science and technology. It began by extracting from the data base all references pobIished during the last quarter of 1969 in the 2200 journals then covered by the SCL The resultant sample was about 1 million citations of journals, books, reports, theses, and so forth. To test whether this 3-month sample was representative of the year as a whole, it was matched against another sample made by selecting every 27th reference from the approximately 4 million references collected over the entire year. The two samples were similar enough in scope (number of diflerent items cited) and detail (relative frequency of their citation by different journals) to"

The main determinant of brain tryptophan and serotonin concentrations does not appear to be plasma tryptophan alone, but the ratio of this amino acid to other plasma neutral amino acids (that is, tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine) that compete with it for uptake into the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2046771292,"Mouse embryos survived freezing to -196 degrees C. Survival required slow cooling (0.3 degrees to 2 degrees C per minute) and slow warming (4 degrees to 25 degrees C per minute). Depending on the specific rates used, 50 to 70 percent of more than 2500 frozen and thawed early embryos developed into blastocysts in culture after storage at -196 degrees C for up to 8 days. When approximately 1000 of the survivors, including some frozen to -269 degrees C (4 degrees K), were transferred into foster mothers, 65 percent of the recipients became pregnant. More than 40 percent of the embryos in these pregnant mice gave rise to normal, living full-term fetuses or newborn mice."
https://openalex.org/W1661541811,The relationship between material starvation during pregnancy and the mental status of the offspring in adult life is examined using as the touchstone the famine in Holland in the winter of 1944-1945. 7 famine-stricken cities in Western Holland were compared with 11 control Dutch cities that were not affected. A retrospective cohort study was made of 125000 males born between January 1 1944-December 31 1946 who were inducted into the army when they were about 19 years old. It is inferred that 20000 were exposed to the famine through maternal starvation. The men were divided into 9 cohorts by month of conception and month of birth. The dependent variables used are 1) severe mental retardation; 2) mild mental retardation; and 3) intelligent quotient. 2 postulated moderator variables are 1) fetal age of cohort at time of exposure; and 2) birth weight. 2 confounding variables--fertility and social class--have been controlled in the analysis. Despite several reservations which are discussed it was concluded that 1) starvation during pregnancy had no detectable effects on the adult mental performance of surviving male offspring; 2) mental performance in surviving adult males from a total population had no clear association w ith changing levels of mean birth weight; and 3) the association of social class with mental performance was strong. However 2 alternative hypotheses are presented to explain the absence of detectable effects from the famine: 1) survivors might have been selected from fetuses unimpaired by maternal starvation while those impaired suffered early death; and 2) postnatal learning might have compensated for neurological impairment. The results seem positive in 2 respects. They point to a high order of protection to the fetus in utero or to great resiliency or both. And they affirm the association between social environment and mental performance.

https://openalex.org/W2051858746,"Spatial contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency was measured in patients with cerebral lesions. In most of these patients visual acuity, as measured by the Snellen chart, was 20/30 or better, yet marked departures from normal contrast sensitivity were found. The greatest loss in contrast sensitivity occurred at high frequencies, but in one patient the loss was greatest in the midfrequency range. This finding lends support to the channel hypothesis of spatial contrast discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2114799248,"Abstract Palmitoyl-CoA (100 µm), in the presence of albumin (24 mg per ml), inhibited the incorporation of [14C]citrate into fatty acids in a cytosol fraction of chick liver and inhibited the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase purified from chick liver. Under similar incubation conditions, palmitoyl-CoA (200 µm) did not inhibit fatty acid synthetase, ATP-citrate lyase, malic enzyme, NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, or glutamate dehydrogenase. The high concentration of albumin was used to ensure that the free concentration of palmitoyl-CoA was very low and relatively independent both of the concentration of the enzyme tested and of its affinity for palmitoyl-CoA. In the presence of 0.26 mg of albumin per ml and 1 mm citrate, 1 µm palmitoyl-CoA inhibited the activity of the partially purified acetyl-CoA carboxylase by about 75%. This inhibition was reversed after 9 min of incubation by increasing the albumin concentration to 11 mg per ml or by increasing the citrate concentration to 6 mm or by adding 10 µm (+) -palmitoylcarnitine. At both high and low albumin concentrations, inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA was competitive with respect to citrate. Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by palmitoyl-CoA occurred immediately and did not increase with time of incubation. It is concluded that palmitoyl-CoA inhibition of acetylCoA carboxylase is reversible and competitive with citrate and, therefore, may play an important role in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1546981807,"Abstract Administration of estradiol to immature chicks triggers the cytodifferentiation of tubular gland cells which synthesize the major egg white proteins, ovalbumin, conalbumin, ovomucoid, and lysozyme, and modulates the rate at which oviduct proteins are synthesized. Estradiol has three modulatory effects. (a) It produces a 2- to 3-fold increase in the extent of polypeptide initiation, as evidenced by the increase in polysome sizes in the absence of a significant change in the average molecular weight of the proteins being synthesized. Furthermore, the size of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes changes significantly after cessation of hormonal treatment. (b) There is about a 40% increase in the rate of polypeptide elongation. The rate of elongation changes more slowly than initiation and is probably rate-limiting for protein synthesis in the estrogen-stimulated chick, whereas initiation is limiting in chicks withdrawn from estrogen treatment. (c) Previous data on polysome accumulation can now be interpreted to indicate that there is a 2- to 3-fold increase in translatable mRNA concentration during hormonal treatment. The product of these three modulatory effects account for the 7-fold increase in the rate of protein synthesis previously reported. The rates of initiation and elongation of ovalbumin and conalbumin were compared after several hormonal treatments known to change their relative rates of synthesis. No differential translational effects were noted indicating that the differences in synthesis of these proteins most likely reflect differences in mRNA concentration. The measured mRNA transit times for egg white proteins at 35° are approximately: 2 min, ovalbumin; 3.6 min, ovomucoid; and 5 min, conalbumin. The ovomucoid transit time is longer than expected considering the size of this polypeptide; however it includes both the time for polypeptide synthesis and assembly of about 25 carbohydrate moieties. Estimates of the number of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes and rate of ovalbumin elongation allow a calculation of the amount of ovalbumin synthesized per day. The values obtained are in close agreement with the amount known to be secreted in eggs."

These particles, 18 to 20 nanometers in diameter, were found in mononuclear cells related to the central vein and infiltrating the zone of active demyelination. It is suggested that multiple sclerosis lesions may be initiated by seeding of lymphocytes bearing latent paramyxovirus to white matter of the central nervous system."

After gas chromatographic separation, the ion density of specific fragments of each indole was measured with mass spectrometry. Sensitivity of this indole assay is of the order of 10(-12) to 10(-13) mole. Routinely, specificity is based on gas chromatographic retention time and the recording of the ion density generated by specific fragments. Absolute identification of the extracted indoles was based on multiple ion detection."
https://openalex.org/W1547057654,Abstract The major products of the acyl-CoA-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase system of rat liver mitochondria were identified as mono- and diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. The monoacyl derivative was demonstrated to be a precursor of the diacyl compound. Pronounced substrate and positional specificity during the acylation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate has been shown. Palmitic acid was found esterified exclusively in position 1 of the sn-glycerol molecule. Oleyl- and linoleyl-CoA failed to show significant activity as donors in the acylation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate but linoleyl-CoA competes effectively with palmityl-CoA in the acylation of 1-palmityl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Additional experiments distinguished the mitochondrial from the microsomal acylation system and localized the activity in the outer mitochondrial membrane. The combined properties of the mitochondrial acyltransferase system are consistent with the possibility that it may contribute to the asymmetrical distribution of fatty acids found in glycerolipids.

Cycle lengths of 24 and 48 hours resulted in testicular regression, whereas testicular weight was maintained by cycle lengths of 36 and 60 hours. Our data demonstrate a circadian rhythm of sensitivity to the effects of light on the photoperiodic testicular response of the hamster. The position of light relative to the circadian system (as measured by the locomotor rhythm) is critical in the response."
https://openalex.org/W2029012997,"A vertical slit of light illuminated during horizontal saccadic eye movements appeared as a horizontally extended smear when stimulation was terminated before the saccade ended. However, on trials for which duration of illumination of the slit was extended into the period after the saccade, the smear appeared shorter and dimmer, and a clear image of the slit was seen. With further increases in duration, no smears were seen at the highest luminance of the slit employed, although smears were more than 2 log units above threshold when flashes were brief. This saccadic suppression is discussed in terms of metacontrast, with the accumulated luminance in the period after the saccade primarily responsible for masking the effects of the stimulation received during the movement of the eye."

Leukocytes from healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin, a mitogen.

In the absence of a mitogenic agent, 3-methylcholanthrene stimulation of increased enzymatic activity did not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1544339897,"Abstract The binding of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acids to defatted human plasma albumin was measured by equilibrium dialysis at 37° in a calcium-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The results were analyzed in terms of multiple stepwise equilibria. For each of the albumin binding sites, the magnitude of the equilibrium constants increased as the chain length of the acid increased: decanoate g octanoate g hexanoate. The first six equilibrium constants ranged from 1.5 x 104 to 4.7 x 10 for hexanoate, from 3.4 x 104 to 1.2 x 103 for octanoate, and from 105 to 3.4 x 103 for decanoate. In each case, the equilibrium constants occurred in a generally descending order, suggesting that major cooperative binding effects do not occur over the physiologically important range of fatty acid-albumin molar ratios. The equilibrium constants calculated for each of the three acids could not be grouped in a common way in terms of classes of binding sites, indicating that a single, uniform class-site binding model cannot be applied to these medium chain fatty acids. Octanoate binding was relatively insensitive to pH changes over the range of 6.0 to 8.2. Decanoate binding also was similar at pH 6.5 and 7.4. A decrease in octanoate binding occurred when the albumin was acetylated or when the medium contained 6 m urea. Octanoate binding also was decreased when either palmitate or oleate was added to albumin, suggesting that medium chain fatty acid transport may be influenced by changes in the plasma long chain free fatty acid concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1604647115,"Abstract Asparagine synthetase, purified from an asparaginase-resistant mouse leukemia (RADA1), catalyzes the formation of l-asparagine, AMP, PPi, and l-glutamate from l-aspartate, l-glutamine, and ATP. l-Glutamine may be replaced by NH4+ as the amide nitrogen donor. The postulated intermediate, β-l-aspartyl adenylate, was prepared by organic synthesis. The enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from PPi and β-l-aspartyl adenylate. Asparagine synthetase was found to exhibit glutaminase activity both in the presence and absence of the other substrates needed for asparagine synthesis. Both the glutaminase and glutamine-dependent (but not the NH4+-dependent) synthetase activities require chloride ions; Cl- can be replaced by Br- or I-, but with much less activity. The enzyme is inhibited by l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (which binds, probably covalently, to the enzyme), aminomalonic acid, N-methyl-dl-aspartic acid, and several other compounds. These compounds or similar ones may be useful in augmenting asparaginase therapy of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1581159509,"Abstract A subunit structure for human superoxide dismutase has been demonstrated by sedimentation equilibrium, agarose gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic studies. This protein appears to be composed of 2 subunits, not linked by covalent bonds, each with a molecular weight about 16,000. Dissociation of the subunits is facilitated by alkylation of the two sulfhydryl groups in the protein, by removal of the copper and zinc, by reduction and alkylation of the protein, or by succinylation. The two free sulfhydryl groups were labeled with [14C]iodoacetate and isolated in two nonidentical peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1491107611,"Abstract Multiple hemoglobins from a fish (Catostomus clarkii) were separated and characterized by electrophoresis, column chromatography, ultracentrifugation, end group analysis, and oxygen equilibria studies. The hemoglobins were all tetramers of α and β chains. Two different α chains were detected in unfractionated hemoglobins. Two major β chains were isolated from the hemoglobin components which migrated electrophoretically toward the anode at pH 8.6. Two additional β chains, which were constituents of hemoglobins that migrated toward the cathode, could not be separated from the α chains. The β chains of the anodal and cathodal hemoglobin components of an individual fish were subjected to amino end group analyses with a sequenator. The partial sequences of the βa and βb chains of the anodal components differed by l10%, a finding consistent with the presence of mixed α2βaβb tetramers among the hemoglobins. The NH2-terminal segments of the two β chains of the cathodal hemoglobins were also similar to each other, but differed from the β chains in the anodal components by the same order of magnitude (40 to 45%) as the α and β chains of mammalian hemoglobins. Unlike the anodal components, the cathodal hemoglobins showed no Bohr effect. The chemical groups responsible for most of the Bohr effect were absent in the α and β chains of the cathodal components. These observations were used to propose a possible role for the cathodal hemoglobins in helping to maintain intrastream niche segregation of sympatric catostomid species."

The application of IR interferometry or of NMR pulse methods, followed by Fourier transformation of the resultant interferogram, permits acquisition of spectral data in a time that is orders of magnitude less than by conventional spectroscopic methods. This reduction in time permits the study of transient species, or by ""time-averaging"" procedures S/N may be improved without the expenditure of inordinate amounts of time. The FT method finds especially important application in the study of NMR spectra of nuclei of low sensitivity and low abundance, such as 13C."
https://openalex.org/W1521884330,"Abstract 1. The properties of rat brain lysophospholipase were investigated. Three subcellular fractions were employed: a particulate preparation which sedimented at 26,000 x g, a microsomal preparation which sedimented at 100,000 x g, and the supernatant of the above. The soluble enzyme represented only a small fraction of the total activity; it was further purified by treatment with protamine and ammonium sulfate and by gel filtration through Sephadex G-50. Attempts to solubilize the particulate or microsomal enzymes yielded only 1% or less of their activity as a soluble enzyme. 2. When reaction rates were plotted as a function of enzyme concentration, straight lines were obtained with the soluble enzyme. With the particulate or microsomal enzymes, these curves were straight lines only at lysolecithin concentrations below 0.05 to 0.1 mm. Above these concentrations, the curves were parabolic. 3. When reaction rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration, the curves were biphasic. Assymmetrical bell-shaped curves were obtained with the particulate or microsomal enzymes. When using the soluble enzyme, the curve ascended as a hyperbola, but reached a maximal value above which the reaction rates were constant. With the particulate or microsomal enzymes the concentration of substrate at which the maximal activity was obtained increased with increasing protein concentrations. 4. Albumin increased the reaction rates catalyzed by the particulate or microsomal enzymes at all substrate concentrations. It changed the parabolic V/E curves into straight lines and the biphasic V/S curves into rectangular hyperbolas. When using the soluble enzyme, low concentrations of albumin had no effect, while higher concentrations decreased the reaction rates. 5. Lysolecithin was adsorbed onto the particulate or microsomal enzymes; this was counteracted by serum albumin. 6. These data are discussed in light of the hypothesis that rat brain lysophospholipase utilizes monomers but probably not micelles of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1595078971,"Abstract δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthetase extracted from porphyric liver mitochondria by sonication or freeze-drying was found to be excluded from Sephadex G-200, and other studies revealed that activity was associated with a large aggregate. In contrast, aminoacetone synthetase behaved as a soluble enzyme with a molecular weight of 64,000. By treating the aggregate with both sodium chloride and dithioerythritol, δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity was released to yield a soluble form of enzyme of molecular weight 77,000, as determined by Sephadex gel chromatography. This form of the enzyme was purified 40-fold from rat liver mitochondria by a method involving affinity chromatography. Antibodies prepared against the purified mitochondrial enzyme cross-react with the cytosol enzyme, although Sephadex chromatography indicates its molecular weight to be 178,000. No enzymically inactive, immunologically reactive precursor of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase could be detected in normal rat liver. End product inhibition by hemin was found to be 50% at 10 µm."

These grooves, located opposite each other, give the raphide cross section an H-shape."
https://openalex.org/W1572436872,"Abstract The effect of antibiotics and other agents on peptide bond synthesis by mammalian polyribosomes was determined by studying peptidyl-puromycin synthesis. Sparsomycin, anisomycin, cycloheximide, gougerotin, blasticidin S, and cryptopleurine inhibited the reaction. Sparsomycin and anisomycin inhibited the peptidyl-puromycin synthesis competitively with respect to puromycin. Arabinose analogs of puromycin as well as many other antibiotics were ineffective as inhibitors of this reaction. In addition, the results demonstrated that antibiotics and other agents influence peptide bond formation on polyribosomes differently than peptide bond synthesis as measured by acetyl-phenylalanyl-puromycin synthesis. It is thus suggested that the former assay is probably more representative of the mode of action of these agents in the intact cell than the latter."

The subsequent rates of (22)Na(+) and (45)Ca(2+) efflux parallel the course of the bacterial fever but in a reciprocal fashion.

https://openalex.org/W1488217219,"Abstract Argininosuccinase from bovine liver with a molecular weight of 202,000 completely dissociates at pH 9 or 10 to 5.6 S subunits. The catalytically active tetramer can be reconstituted by bringing the pH back to 7.5. Determined by sedimentation equilibrium the subunit molecular weight is 100,000 ± 2,500, corresponding to that of a dimer. Sedimentation velocity experiments show that initially the dissociated preparation consists of primarily dimer. Polymerization, apparently through the participation of dimers, is observed after long periods as sedimentation equilibrium analyses show the presence of small amounts of tetramer not in chemical equilibrium with the dimer, and some hexamer. In concentrated solutions of urea or guanidine hydrochloride, the molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium is 50,400 ± 1,100. A similar value was estimated by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate in the presence or absence of reducing agent. The four polypeptide chains are, therefore, identical in size. The enzyme is devoid of disulfide bonds; in guanidine hydrochloride 16 moles of free sulfhydryl groups were determined with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), and this value is equal to the number of half-cystine residues per mole of protein. End group analyses showed that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid is glutamine, the penultimate residue is leucine, and there are four identical terminal sequences per mole. Cyanogen bromide cleavage produced 13 to 14 peptides, one-fourth of the expected number of fragments based on a methionine content of 51 residues per mole of protein. In accord with these results, tryptic peptide patterns showed only one-fourth of the total number of peptides predicted from the lysine and arginine content of the enzyme. The number of peptides containing several other specific amino acid residues was also consistent with the number predicted from an average distribution of residues among four polypeptide chains. These data show that argininosuccinase is composed of four subunit polypeptide chains that are apparently identical, or very similar, in amino acid sequence. The distribution of the 16 sulfhydryl groups was related to quaternary structure from studies with sulfhydryl reagents. In the active tetramer, four sulfhydryl groups are readily accessible; presumably, they are located on or near the surface of the enzyme and are remote from the active sites, as disulfide or mercaptide formation with sulfhydryl reagents does not affect catalytic activity. A second group of four is masked within the regions of bonding between dimeric subunits; they are released concomitantly with dissociation of the tetramer to dimers. The remaining eight sulfhydryl groups only become accessible as the dissociation of dimers to monomers proceeds in the presence of strong dissociating agents. From the results of dissociation behavior and sulfhydryl reactivity, at least two modes of subunit interactions can be distinguished. Electron micrographs of negatively stained argininosuccinase support this four-subunit model. The model is discussed with respect to modes of dissociation, geometric arrangement, and symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W1517529383,"Abstract The kinetics of activation of saturated fatty acids by long chain acyl-CoA synthetase from rat liver microsomes has been studied with a method of selective extraction of free fatty acids based on the insolubility of acyl-CoA in diethyl ether. Saturated fatty acids with a chain length ranging from C18 to C6 were assayed at concentrations varying from 0.5 to 10 µm. Under these conditions, Vmax is maximum for palmitic, myristic, and lauric acids, and decreased drastically with octanoic and hexanoic acids. As judged by the values of Km, the affinity of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase is greatest with palmitic acid and decreases very progressively as the chain length of the fatty acids decreases. Finally, palmitic acid is a competitive inhibitor of the activation of octanoic acid. From these results, it has been concluded that there is evidence for only one long chain acyl-CoA synthetase in rat liver microsomes, and that this enzyme has a rather broad chain length specificity."

In contrast, the distributions of individual galactokinase activities differed significantly in blacks and whites, the mean for the black population being 30 percent lower than the mean for the white population. The same racial difference was found when red cell galactokinase activity was examined in males and in newborns. Because low-, intermediate-, and high-galactokinase activities appear to segregate within several black families, this observed difference suggests a new, racially determined enzyme polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1965082224,The ability of the human eye to detect nitrogen nuclei that enter the retina at speeds just above the Cerenkov threshold has been confirmed in an experiment at the Princeton Particle Accelerator. A system for beam transport and subject alignment delivered individual nitrogen nuclei onto a spot 3 millimeters in diameter on the retina at a visual angle of 7 degrees on the temporal side of the fovea. The beam particles entered the retina within 25 degrees of normal and induced visual sensations that had the appearance of streaks for three out of four subjects.

The light-initiated potential change is associated with an increase of membrane conductance. It reverses sign at the potassium equilibrium potential (about -83 millivolts), which was determined from direct measurements of internal potassium activity. The membrane hyperpolarization is produced entirely by a light-induced increase in potassium permeability."

https://openalex.org/W1542662729,"The ""drunk driver"" represents one social problem that medicine and the exact sciences have been asked to help solve. Once the decision to employ the criminal justice system for that purpose was made, they were asked to provide both a more precise measure of intoxication, in order that criminal sanctions might be brought into play, and means of determining that measure in individual defendants. The use of breath tests in the courtroom to determine alcohol in the blood, along with evidence of related scientific issues, thus serves well to illustrate the mechanisms by which these scientific contributions may enter into the social scheme."
https://openalex.org/W1586818075,"Microsomes of the yeast, Hansenula ciferri NRRL Y-1031, F-60-10, contain an enzyme (long chain base-acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1) which catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl moiety of acetyl coenzyme A to both the amino and hydroxyl groups of the sphingosine bases; a separation of these two transfer reactions could not be achieved. The enzyme also catalyzed an acetyl transfer to the hydroxyl groups of N-acetylated sphingosine bases and to the amino groups of normal aliphatic primary amines of 6 to 18 carbon atoms, but not to compounds such as p-nitroaniline, glucosamine, secondary amines, or primary alcohols. A similar enzyme was not found in rat organs nor in extracts of pigeon liver acetone powder. The reaction rates were directly proportional to enzyme concentration and time of incubation. The optimal pH depended on the type of buffer used. The reaction rates could be correlated to the charge conferred upon the micelles of the bases by the various buffers. The reaction was not reversible and an exchange between the products and substrates could not be shown. It was inhibited by coenzyme A but not by the lipid products."
https://openalex.org/W1542350703,"Abstract The reaction of phosphorylase b with pyridoxal-P results in partial inactivation of the enzyme and a change in enzymic characteristics. The reaction of enzyme with pyridoxal-P is reversible; it can be changed to an irreversible reaction by reduction of the pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b complex with sodium borohydride. Subsequent analysis of the pyridoxalP-phosphorylase b derivative shows that the major changes in enzymic characteristics are primarily due to modification of one group per monomer at a specific site on the enzyme. The unreduced pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b complex shows a difference spectrum with a maximum at 432 nm, which is characteristic for the Schiff base formation that follows phosphorylase b-pyridoxal-P interaction. After reduction with sodium borohydride the absorption spectrum shows a maximum at 325 nm, which is typical for e-phosphopyridoxallysine. Fluorescence spectrometry was used to measure the initial rate of reaction of pyridoxal-P with phosphorylase b to form the Schiff base. This rate as a function of pyridoxal-P concentration was a rectangular hyperbola, indicating that the reagent was initially absorbed to a site on the enzyme with an apparent dissociation constant of 8 x 10-4 m. Schiff base formation followed. AMP plus glucose-1-P and ATP show protective effects against the modification by pyridoxal-P, whereas AMP, glucose-1-P, Pi, and glycogen showed little effect. Pyridoxal and other analogs tested for their effect on phosphorylase b have not been found as effective as pyridoxal-P. Imidazole citrate, which causes dissociation of phosphorylase b, does not affect the rate of reaction of pyridoxal-P and phosphorylase b. The pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b derivative, which is still active at high substrate concentration, can be treated to remove the original native pyridoxal-P coenzyme without affecting the extra covalently attached pyridoxal-P. This apo form of the pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b derivative is inactive. Phosphorylase a may also incorporate 1 to 2 molecules of pyridoxal-P per monomer, resulting in a partially inactivated enzyme with properties somewhat different from the pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b derivative. The chemical binding site for pyridoxal-P in the latter derivative has been identified as the e-amino group of a lysine residue."

The seasonal trend of lead aerosols at White Mountain and Laguna Mountain shows a summer maximum and a winter minimum. This is because both mountain sampling sites are well above the thermal (radiation) inversion, which normally occurs in the winter, trapping pollutants below the inversion boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1486710736,"The isolation and crystallization of thermostable alkaline proteinases (A and B) from a thermophilic Streptomyces by sulfoethyl-Sephadex and diethyl-(2-hydroxypropyl)aminoethyl-Sephadex column chromatography are described. The purified preparations were essentially homogeneous by such criteria as sedimentation analysis in the ultracentrifuge and disc electrophoresis. The physicochemical properties of the proteinase B are as follows: the molecular weight determined by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium, 21,500; the sedimentation coefficient, s20,w = 3.00 S; the intrinsic viscosity, [η] = 0.030 dl per g; the isoelectric point, pH 9.5; the partial specific volume, v = 0.719 ml per g; the nitrogen content, 16.3%; E1%1 cm at 280 nm, 18.2. The enzyme is composed of 210 residues of amino acid per molecule (Lys8, His3, Arg4, ½Cys1, Asp26, Thr17, Ser22, Glu10, Pro9, Gly25, Ala33, Val16, Met1, Ile10, Leu7, Tyr11, Trp5, amide-N25). The enzyme contains 1 cysteine residue, but no disulfide bond. The NH2- and COOH-terminal residues were found to be tyrosines. Optical rotatory dispersion studies showed that the enzyme was a compact globular protein having 10 to 15% α helix. The properties of the A component were largely identical with those of the B component, except for the amide content."
https://openalex.org/W1592802617,"A nucleotide with a syn configuration is shown to participate readily in regular helical structures. 8-Bromo-5′-guanylic acid (8BrpG) forms a regularly ordered self-structure in neutral solution. This BrG·BrG complex prevents extensive interaction of the nucleotide with poly(C). Poly-5-bromoribocytidylic acid (poly(BrC)) and 8BrpG, however, form a two-stranded helix having essentially the same stability as the complex pG·poly(BrC) formed by poly(BrC) with normal 5′-guanylic acid (pG). Poly(8NH2A) forms a three-stranded helix with poly(U). Although the purine nucleotide residues in this complex are presumably in a syn configuration, the stability of the helix is similar to that of poly(A)·2poly(U)."

https://openalex.org/W1569617334,"Abstract Reaction of phosphorylase b with pyridoxal-P followed by reduction with sodium borohydride results in a derivative which shows a homogeneous band upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This modified enzyme has a dimeric form with an average Sobs of 8.5. Unlike the native phosphorylase b, the aggregation state of this derivative is not affected by the presence of AMP. The evidence suggests that pyridoxal-P reacts with one specific site per monomer, and further reactions show only minimal effects on the properties of the enzyme. Imidazole citrate, which causes dissociation of phosphorylase b, has the same effect on the pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b derivative. Absorption spectra of the reduced pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b show an increased absorbance at 325 nm. Fluorescence spectra show two peaks upon excitation at 325 nm, one peak at 535 nm found in the native enzyme, and a peak at 400 nm characteristic of pyridoxamine derivatives. Crystals of the reduced pyridoxal-P-iodoacetamide-phosphorylase a have been prepared in the presence and absence of AMP. The reduced pyridoxal-P-phosphorylase b derivative shows different kinetic and allosteric properties from the native enzyme, most notably in that the Km values for substrate and activator have been greatly increased with no change in Vmax. In addition, the nature of the homotropic interactions between substrate sites has been altered, whereas that between activator sites has been abolished."
