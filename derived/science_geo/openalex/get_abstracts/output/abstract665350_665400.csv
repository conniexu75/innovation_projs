https://openalex.org/W3108666979,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic, and safe, effective vaccines are urgently needed1. Strong, Th1-skewed T cell responses can drive protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses2 and might reduce the potential for disease enhancement3. Cytotoxic T cells clear virus-infected host cells and contribute to control of infection4. Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. 5,6). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)7 given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8+ T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced. Taken together, these results suggest a favorable immune profile induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, supporting the progression of this vaccine candidate to ongoing phase 2/3 trials to assess vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3111128314,"More than 190 vaccines are currently in development to prevent infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3112082202,"Background Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), school openings were postponed worldwide as a way to stop its spread. Most classes are moving online, and this includes medical school classes. The authors present their experience of running such online classes with offline clinical clerkship under pandemic conditions, and also present data on student satisfaction, academic performance, and preference. Methods The medical school changed every first-year to fourth-year course to an online format except the clinical clerkship, clinical skills training, and basic laboratory classes such as anatomy lab sessions. Online courses were pre-recorded video lectures or live-streamed using video communication software. At the end of each course, students and professors were asked to report their satisfaction with the online course and comment on it. The authors also compared students’ academic performance before and after the introduction of online courses. Results A total of 69.7% (318/456) of students and 35.2% (44/125) of professors answered the questionnaire. Students were generally satisfied with the online course and 62.2% of them preferred the online course to the offline course. The majority (84.3%) of the students wanted to maintain the online course after the end of COVID-19. In contrast, just 13.6% of professors preferred online lectures and half (52.3%) wanted to go back to the offline course. With the introduction of online classes, students' academic achievement did not change significantly in four subjects, but decreased in two subjects. Conclusions The inevitable transformation of medical education caused by COVID-19 is still ongoing. As the safety of students and the training of competent physicians are the responsibilities of medical schools, further research into how future physicians will be educated is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3117579002,"Objectives To explore coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related stigma and its associated factors among Egyptian physicians. Methods A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online questionnaire was conducted from 7 to 21 June 2020. The survey was distributed via social media and email to physicians working in Egypt through convenience sampling. Results 509 physicians participated in the study (mean age: 41.5±10.2). 138 (27.1%) participants were directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. 159 (31.2%) participants reported severe level of COVID-19-related stigma. Participants’ mean overall COVID-19-related stigma score was 40.6±8.0. The mean subscale scores were: personalized stigma 26.0±5.7, disclosure concerns 9.3±2.2, negative self-image 6.9±1.6, and concern with public attitudes 24.4±4.9. In the multivariable regression analyses, the overall COVID-19-related stigma score was higher in participants with lower qualifications (β = -0.19, 95% CI: 2.32, -0.64, p = 0.001), and in those working in a quarantine hospital (β = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01, 7.14, p = 0.050). Conclusions A considerable proportion of Egyptian physicians in this exploratory study experienced COVID-19-related stigmatization. These preliminary findings highlight the need for specific research and targeted interventions particularly addressing COVID-19-related stigmatization among healthcare workers."
https://openalex.org/W3110673557,"Knowledge of genetic diversity in plant germplasm and the relationship between genetic factors and phenotypic expression is vital for crop improvement. This study's objectives were to understand the extent of genetic diversity and population structure in 60 common bean genotypes from East and Southern Africa. The common bean genotypes exhibited significant (p&lt;0.05) levels of variability for traits such as days to flowering (DTF), days to maturity (DTM), number of pods per plant (NPP), number of seeds per pod (NSP), and grain yield per hectare in kilograms (GYD). About 47.82 per cent of the variation among the genotypes was explained by seven principal components (PC) associated with the following agronomic traits: NPP, NFF (nodes to first flower), DTF, GH (growth habit) and GYD. The SNP markers revealed mean gene diversity and polymorphic information content values of 0.38 and 0.25, respectively, which suggested the presence of considerable genetic variation among the assessed genotypes. Analysis of molecular variance showed that 51% of the genetic variation were between the gene pools, while 49% of the variation were within the gene pools. The genotypes were delineated into two distinct groups through the population structure, cluster and phylogenetic analyses. Genetically divergent genotypes such as DRK57, MW3915, NUA59, and VTTT924/4-4 with high yield and agronomic potential were identified, which may be useful for common bean improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3113510813,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less prevalent among men than women, but more men than women initiate kidney replacement therapy. Differences in CKD awareness may contribute to this gender gap, which may further vary by race/ethnicity. We aimed to investigate trends in CKD awareness and the association between individual characteristics and CKD awareness among US men versus women.We conducted a serial, cross-sectional analysis of 10 cycles (1999-2018) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Adult participants with CKD stages G3-G5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73m2) were included, unless they were on dialysis or medical information was missing. Serum creatinine was measured during NHANES medical exams. CKD stage was classified by eGFR, based on the CKD-EPI formula. CKD awareness was assessed with the question: ""Have you ever been told by a health care professional you had weak or failing kidneys"", asked in standardized NHANES questionnaires on each survey. Using logistic regression models, we evaluated the association between sex and CKD awareness, adjusting for potential confounders including age, race/ethnicity and comorbidities. We stratified CKD awareness by 5 pre-defined calendar-year periods and conducted all analyses for the complete study population as well as the Caucasian and African American subpopulations. We found that among 101871 US persons participating in NHANES, 4411 (2232 women) had CKD in stages G3-G5. These participants were, on average, 73±10 years old, 25.3% reported diabetes, 78.0% reported hypertension or had elevated blood pressure during medical examinations and 39.8% were obese (percentages were survey-weighted). CKD awareness was more prevalent among those with higher CKD stage, younger age, diabetes, hypertension and higher body mass index. CKD awareness was generally low (<22.5%), though it increased throughout the study period, remaining consistently higher among men compared to women, with a decreasing gender gap over time (adjusted odds ratio [men-to-women] for CKD awareness = 2.71 [1.31-5.64] in period 1; = 1.32 [0.82-2.12] in period 5). The sex difference in CKD awareness was smaller in African American participants, in whom CKD awareness was generally higher. Using serum creatinine rather than eGFR as the CKD-defining exposure, CKD awareness increased with rising serum creatinine, in a close to identical fashion among both sexes during 1999-2008, while during 2009-2018, CKD awareness among women increased earlier than among men (i.e. with lower serum creatinine levels).CKD awareness is lower among US women than men. The narrowing gap between the sexes in more recent years and the results on CKD awareness by serum creatinine indicate that health care professionals have previously been relying on serum creatinine to inform patients about their condition, but in more recent years have been using eGFR, which accounts for women's lower serum creatinine levels due to their lower muscle mass. Additional efforts should be made to increase CKD awareness among both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W3111587271,"Growth differentiating factor-15 (GDF15) is an emerging target for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease partly due to its ability to suppress food intake. GDF15 expression and secretion are thought to be regulated by a cellular integrated stress response, which involves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. AMPK is another cellular stress sensor, but the relationship between AMPK, ER stress, and GDF15 has not been assessed in vivo. Wildtype (WT), AMPK β1 deficient (AMPKβ1-/- ), and CHOP-/- mice were treated with three distinct AMPK activators; AICAR, which is converted to ZMP mimicking the effects of AMP on the AMPKγ isoform, R419, which indirectly activates AMPK through inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, or A769662, a direct AMPK activator which binds the AMPKβ1 isoform ADaM site causing allosteric activation. Following treatments, liver Gdf15, markers of ER-stress, AMPK activity, adenine nucleotides, circulating GDF15, and food intake were assessed. AICAR and R419 caused ER and energetic stress, increased GDF15 expression and secretion, and suppressed food intake. Direct activation of AMPK β1 containing complexes by A769662 increased hepatic Gdf15 expression, circulating GDF15, and suppressed food intake, independent of ER stress. The effects of AICAR, R419, and A769662 on GDF15 were attenuated in AMPKβ1-/- mice. AICAR and A769662 increased GDF15 to a similar extent in WT and CHOP-/- mice. Herein, we provide evidence that AMPK plays a role in mediating the induction of GDF15 under conditions of energetic stress in mouse liver in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3113884570,"Background Early initiation of breast feeding has great importance for both mothers and newborns. Despite, recommendations for exclusive and early initiation of breast feeding within one hour of birth, Ethiopia reports that 58% of infants under six months of age are exclusively breastfed. Cesarean deliveries may affect timing of breastfeeding initiation, establishment of milk supply and infant breastfeeding interest compared to vaginal deliveries. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cesarean delivery on breastfeeding initiation. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 7115 study participants from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS). Both descriptive and analytical statistical analysis was employed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify anyassociations between variables. Odds ratios with its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. During multivariable analysis, variables with p -value &lt; 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results The prevalence of late initiation of breast feeding among women with their last live birth was 25.03% (95%CI; 20.5–32.2). Significant factors associated with late initiation of breastfeeding were cesarean delivery [AOR = 4.06 (95%CI, 2.66–6.2)], primipara mother [AOR = 1.45(95%CI, 1.13–1.7)], and having an unplanned pregnancy [AOR = 1.35(95%CI, 1.1–1.65)]. Positively associated with early initiation of breastfeeding was the mother’s age, for women between 20–34 years-old. This association, reported as a negative association of late initiation of breast feeding was [AOR = 0.77(95%CI, 0.61–0.98)]. Conclusion Cesarean delivery adversely affects the initiation of breast feeding. Cesarean delivery, unplanned pregnancy, and being primiparous, were associated with late initiation of breastfeeding. Women between the ages of 20–34 years of age had a reduced chance of late initiation of breastfeeding. Providing counseling regarding the strategy and importance of early initiation of breast feeding, could have crucial importance for the mother and her newborn."
https://openalex.org/W3111388919,"Objectives To describe the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at Clinique Ngaliema, a public hospital, in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Methods This retrospective study analyzed medical records including socio-demographics, past medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment and disease outcome of 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Results The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR: 38–64), and there was no significant gender difference (51% of male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (55 [34%]), diabetes (31 [19%]) and obesity (13 [8%]). Fever (93 [58%]), cough (92 [57%]), fatigue (87 [54%]), shortness of breath (72 [45%]) and myalgia (33 [21%]) were the most common symptoms, upon admission. Patients were categorized into mild (92 [57%]), moderate (19 [12%]) and severe (49 [31%]). Severe patients were older and were more likely to have comorbidities, compared to mild ones. The majority of patients (92% [147 of 160]) patients received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate. Regression model revealed that older age, lower SpO2, higher heart rate and elevated AST at admission were all risk factors associated with in-hospital death. The prevalence of COVID-19 and malaria co-infection was 0.63% and 70 (44%) of all patients received antimalarial treatment before hospitalization. Conclusion Our findings indicated that the epidemiological and clinical feature of COVID-19 patients in Kinshasa are broadly similar to previous reports from other settings. Older age, lower SpO2, tachycardia, and elevated AST could help to identify patients at higher risk of death at an early stage of the illness. Plasmodium spp co-infection was not common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3111811461,"Background Vietnam applied strict quarantine measures to mitigate the rapid transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus. Central questions were how the COVID-19 pandemic affected health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the Vietnamese general population, and whether there is any difference in HRQOL among people under different quarantine conditions. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 April– 30 May 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in Vietnam. Data was collected via an online survey using Google survey tool. A convenient sampling approach was employed, with participants being sorted into three groups: people who were in government quarantine facilities; people who were under self-isolation at their own place; and the general population who did not need enforced quarantine. The Vietnamese EQ-5D-5L instrument was used to measure HRQOL. Differences in HRQOL among people of isolation groups and their socio-demographic characteristics were statistically tested. Results A final sample was made of 406 people, including 10 persons from government quarantine facilities, 57 persons under self-isolation at private places, and the rest were the general population. The mean EQ-VAS was reported the highest at 90.5 (SD: 7.98) among people in government quarantine facilities, followed by 88.54 (SD: 12.24) among general population and 86.54 (SD 13.69) among people in self-isolation group. The EQ-5D-5L value was reported the highest among general population at 0.95 (SD: 0.07), followed by 0.94 (SD: 0.12) among people in government quarantine facilities, and 0.93 (SD: 0.13) among people who did self-isolation. Overall, most people, at any level, reported having problems with anxiety and/or depression in all groups. Conclusion While there have been some worries and debates on implementing strict quarantine measures can hinder people’s quality of life, Vietnam showed an opposite tendency in people’s HRQOL even under the highest level of enforcement in the prevention and control of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3110792188,"Abstract Smoker patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have poorer prognosis and survival than those without smoking history. However, the mechanisms underlying the low response rate of those patients to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are not well understood. Here we report that exposure to cigarette smoke extract enhances glycolysis and attenuates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent inhibition of mTOR; this in turn reduces the sensitivity of NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR (EGFR WT ) to EGFR TKI by repressing expression of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a master kinase of the AMPK subfamily, via CpG island methylation. In addition, LKB1 expression is correlated positively with sensitivity to TKI in patients with NSCLC. Moreover, combined treatment of EGFR TKI with AMPK activators synergistically increases EGFR TKI sensitivity. Collectively, the current study suggests that LKB1 may serve as a marker to predict EGFR TKI sensitivity in smokers with NSCLC carrying EGFR WT and that the combination of EGFR TKI and AMPK activator may be a potentially effective therapeutic strategy against NSCLC with EGFR WT ."
https://openalex.org/W3114041131,"CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing shows cogent potential for the genetic modification of helminth parasites. We report successful gene knock-in (KI) into the genome of the egg of Schistosoma mansoni by combining CRISPR/Cas9 with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs). We edited the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene of S. mansoni targeting two guide RNAs (gRNAs), X5 and X7, located on exon 5 and exon 7 of Smp_154600, respectively. Eggs recovered from livers of experimentally infected mice were transfected by electroporation with a CRISPR/Cas9-vector encoding gRNA X5 or X7 combining with/ without a ssODN donor. Next generation sequencing analysis of reads of amplicon libraries spanning targeted regions revealed that the major modifications induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in the eggs were generated by homology directed repair (HDR). Furthermore, soluble egg antigen from AChE-edited eggs exhibited markedly reduced AChE activity, indicative that programed Cas9 cleavage mutated the AChE gene. Following injection of AChE-edited schistosome eggs into the tail veins of mice, an significantly enhanced Th2 response involving IL-4, -5, -10, and-13 was detected in lung cells and splenocytes in mice injected with X5-KI eggs in comparison to control mice injected with unmutated eggs. A Th2-predominant response, with increased levels of IL-4, -13, and GATA3, also was induced by X5 KI eggs in small intestine-draining mesenteric lymph node cells when the gene-edited eggs were introduced into the subserosa of the ileum of the mice. These findings confirmed the potential and the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing for functional genomics in schistosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3111292187,"Cellular senescence is a state of permanent growth arrest that can ultimately contribute to aging. Senescence can be induced by various stressors and is associated with a myriad of cellular functions and phenotypic markers. Alternative splicing is emerging as a critical contributor to senescence and aging. However, it is unclear how the composition and function of the spliceosome are involved in senescence. Here, using replicative and oxidative stress-induced senescence models in primary human fibroblasts, we report a common shift in the expression of 58 spliceosomal genes at the pre-senescence stage, prior to the detection of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. Spliceosomal perturbation, induced by pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of splicesomal genes, triggered cells to enter senescence, suggesting a key role as a gatekeeper. Association analysis of transcription factors based on the 58 splicesomal genes revealed Sp1 as a key regulator of senescence entry. Indeed, Sp1 depletion suppressed the expression of downstream spliceosomal genes (HNRNPA3, SRSF7, and SRSF4) and effectively induced senescence. These results indicate that spliceosomal gene sets, rather than a single spliceosomal gene, regulate the early transition into senescence prior to SA-β-gal expression. Furthermore, our study provides a spliceosome signature that may be used as an early senescence marker."
https://openalex.org/W3112219624,"Agent-based modeling of artificial societies allows for the validation and analysis of human-interpretable, causal explanations of human behavior that generate society-scale phenomena. However, parameter calibration is insufficient to conduct data-driven explorations that are adequate in evaluating the importance of causal factors that constitute agent rules that match real-world individual-scale generative behaviors. We introduce evolutionary model discovery, a framework that combines genetic programming and random forest regression to evaluate the importance of a set of causal factors hypothesized to affect the individual’s decision-making process. With evolutionary model discovery, we investigated the farm plot seeking behavior of the Ancestral Pueblo of the Long House Valley simulated in the Artificial Anasazi model. We evaluated the importance of causal factors unconsidered in the original model, which we hypothesized to have affected the decision-making process. Our findings, concur with other archaeological studies on the Ancestral Pueblo communities during the Pueblo II period, which indicate the existence of cross-village polities, hierarchical organization, and dependence on the viability of the agricultural niche. Contrary to the original Artificial Anasazi model, where closeness was the sole factor driving farm plot selection, selection of higher quality land, distancing from failed farm plots, and desire for social presence are found to be more important. Finally, models updated with farm selection strategies designed by incorporating these insights showed significant improvements in accuracy and robustness over the original Artificial Anasazi model."
https://openalex.org/W3115194206,"Background Maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) systems aim to understand and address key contributors to maternal and perinatal deaths to prevent future deaths. From 2016–2017, the US Agency for International Development’s Maternal and Child Survival Program conducted an assessment of MPDSR implementation in Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Methods A cross-sectional, mixed-methods research design was used to assess MPDSR implementation. The study included a desk review, policy mapping, semistructured interviews with 41 subnational stakeholders, observations, and interviews with key informants at 55 purposefully selected facilities. Using a standardised tool with progress markers defined for six stages of implementation, each facility was assigned a score from 0–30. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed from the 47 facilities with a score above 10 (‘evidence of MPDSR practice’). Results The mean calculated MPDSR implementation progress score across 47 facilities was 18.98 out of 30 (range: 11.75–27.38). The team observed variation across the national MPDSR guidelines and tools, and inconsistent implementation of MPDSR at subnational and facility levels. Nearly all facilities had a designated MPDSR coordinator, but varied in their availability and use of standardised forms and the frequency of mortality audit meetings. Few facilities (9%) had mechanisms in place to promote a no-blame environment. Some facilities (44%) could demonstrate evidence that a change occurred due to MPDSR. Factors enabling implementation included clear support from leadership, commitment from staff, and regular occurrence of meetings. Barriers included lack of health worker capacity, limited staff time, and limited staff motivation. Conclusion This study was the first to apply a standardised scoring methodology to assess subnational- and facility-level MPDSR implementation progress. Structures and processes for implementing MPDSR existed in all four countries. Many implementation gaps were identified that can inform priorities and future research for strengthening MPDSR in low-capacity settings."
https://openalex.org/W3111604531,"Background The high level of medical spending at the end of life is well-documented, but whether there is any real potential for cost reductions there is still in question, and studies have tended to overlook the costs of care. Aim To identify the most common health care spending trajectories over the last five years of life among older Danes, as well as the determinants of following a given trajectory. Methods We linked Danish health registries to obtain data on all health care expenditure (including hospital treatment, prescription drugs, primary care and costs of communal care) over the last five years of life for all Danish decedents above age 65 in the period 2013 through 2017. A latent class analysis identified the most common cost trajectories, which were then related to socio-economical characteristics and health status at five years before death. Results Total health care expenditures in the last five years of life were largely independent of age and cause of death. Costs of home care and residential care increased steeply with age at death whereas hospital costs decreased correspondingly. We found four main spending trajectories among decedents: 3 percent followed a late-rise trajectory, 11 percent had accelerating costs, and two groups of 43 percent each followed moderately or consistently high trajectories. The main predictor of total expenditure was the number of chronic diseases. Interpretation Spending at the end of life is largely determined by chronic disease, and age and cause of death only determine the distribution of expenses into care and cure."
https://openalex.org/W3110809788,"Background Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) represent a morphologically distinct subset of cancer cells, which aid the metastatic spread. The ExPeCT trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of a structured exercise programme in modulating levels of CTCs and platelet cloaking in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Methods Participants (n = 61) were randomised into either standard care (control) or exercise arms. Whole blood was collected for all participants at baseline (T0), three months (T3) and six months (T6), and analysed for the presence of CTCs, CTC clusters and platelet cloaking. CTC data was correlated with clinico-pathological information. Results Changes in CTC number were observed within group over time, however no significant difference in CTC number was observed between groups over time. Platelet cloaking was identified in 29.5% of participants. A positive correlation between CTC number and white cell count (WCC) was observed (p = 0.0001), in addition to a positive relationship between CTC clusters and PSA levels (p = 0.0393). Conclusion The presence of platelet cloaking has been observed in this patient population for the first time, in addition to a significant correlation between CTC number and WCC.

https://openalex.org/W3111189641,"Pierce’s disease (PD) caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is a deadly disease of grapevines. This study used 20 SSR markers to genotype 326 accessions of grape species collected from the southeastern and southwestern United States, Mexico and Costa Rica. Two hundred sixty-six of these accessions, and an additional 12 PD resistant hybrid cultivars developed from southeastern US grape species, were evaluated for PD resistance. Disease resistance was evaluated by quantifying the level of bacteria in stems and measuring PD symptoms on the canes and leaves. Both Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analyses identified two groups with an east-west divide: group 1 consisted of grape species from the southeastern US and Mexico, and group 2 consisted of accessions collected from the southwestern US and Mexico. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range appeared to be a phylogeographic barrier. The state of Texas was identified as a potential hybridization zone. The hierarchal STRUCTURE analysis on each group showed clustering of unique grape species. An east-west divide was also observed for PD resistance. With the exception of Vitis candicans and V . cinerea accessions collected from Mexico, all other grape species as well as the resistant southeastern hybrid cultivars were susceptible to the disease. Southwestern US grape accessions from drier desert regions showed stronger resistance to the disease. Strong PD resistance was observed within three distinct genetic clusters of V . arizonica which is adapted to drier environments and hybridizes freely with other species across its wide range."

https://openalex.org/W3113081025,"Synapses are the fundamental structural unit by which neurons communicate. An orchestra of proteins regulates diverse synaptic functions, including synapse formation, maintenance, and elimination-synapse homeostasis. Some proteins of the larger C1q super-family are synaptic organizers involved in crucial neuronal processes in various brain regions. C1Q-like (C1QL) proteins bind to the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B3 (ADGRB3) and act at synapses in a subset of circuits. To investigate the hypothesis that the secreted C1QL proteins mediate tripartite trans-synaptic adhesion complexes, we conducted an in vivo interactome study and identified new binding candidates. We demonstrate that C1QL3 mediates a novel cell-cell adhesion complex involving ADGRB3 and two neuronal pentraxins, NPTX1 and NPTXR. Analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data from the cerebral cortex shows that C1ql3, Nptx1, and Nptxr are highly co-expressed in the same excitatory neurons. Thus, our results suggest the possibility that in vivo the three co-expressed proteins are presynaptically secreted and form a complex capable of binding to postsynaptically localized ADGRB3, thereby creating a novel trans-synaptic adhesion complex. Identifying new binding partners for C1QL proteins and deciphering their underlying molecular principles will accelerate our understanding of their role in synapse organization."
https://openalex.org/W3112953543,"This study examined the association between the use of social networking sites (SNS), perceived social support (PSS), and life satisfaction (LS), focusing on the mediating effect of PSS on the association between SNS use and LS. To this end, we used data ( N = 15,574) obtained from a population-based, nationwide internet survey conducted in Japan. First, we confirmed that the number of SNS friends was positively associated with life satisfaction for all age groups: young (15–29 years), middle-aged (30–59 years), and old (60–86 years). However, the association was mixed if there were 100 or more SNS friends. Second, our structural equation modeling analysis underscored the mediating effect of PSS on the association between the number of SNS friends and LS for all age groups. Specifically, PSS mediated 36.5% (standard error [SE]: 8.6%), 39.8% (SE: 6.3%), and 40.3% (SE: 11.4%) of the association for the young, middle-aged, and old groups, respectively, if we defined SNS use as having 10 or more SNS friends. The mediating effect of PSS consistently contributed to the positive association between SNS use and LS regardless of the number of SNS friends, suggesting that SNS use has the potential to enhance subjective well-being via its positive impact on PSS."
https://openalex.org/W3117356697,"Despite the recent increase in interest in indoor air quality regarding mould, there is no universally accepted standard media for the detection of airborne fungi, nor verification of many commonly used techniques. Commonly used media including malt-extract agar (MEA), Sabouraud dextrose agar (Sab), potato dextrose agar (PDA) with and without antibiotics chloramphenicol &amp; gentamycin (CG) were compared for their suitability in detecting a range of airborne fungi by collecting 150 L outdoor air on a number of different days and seasons via an Anderson 400-hole sampler in suburban Melbourne, Australia. There was relatively little variation in mean numbers of colony forming units (CFU) and types of fungi recovered between MEA, PDA, Sab media groups relative to variation within each group. There was a significant difference between Sab, Dichloran-18% glycerol (DG18) and V8® Original juice agar media, however. Antibiotics reliably prevented the growth of bacteria that typically interfered with the growth and appearance of fungal colonies. There was no significant evidence for a growth enhancing factor from potato, mineral supplements or various vegetable juices. Differing glucose concentrations had modest effects, showing a vague ideal at 2%-4% with peptone. Sanitisation of the aluminium Andersen 400-hole sampler top-plate by flame is possible, but not strictly required nor advisable. The use of SabCG as a standard medium was generally supported."
https://openalex.org/W3113664643,"Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), a pleiotropic chromosomal breakage syndrome, is caused by the loss of the kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). ATM is not only involved in the response to DNA damage, but also in sensing and counteracting oxidative stress. Since a disturbed redox balance has been implicated in the pathophysiology of A-T lung disease, we aimed to further explore the interplay between ATM and oxidative stress in lung cells. Using a kinetic trapping approach, we could demonstrate an interaction between the trapping mutant TRX1-CS and ATM upon oxidative stress. We could further show that combined inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and ATM kinase activity, using Auranofin and KU55933 respectively, induced an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and protein oxidation in lung cells. Furthermore, ATM inhibition sensitized lung cells to Auranofin-induced cell death that could be rescued by ROS scavengers. As a consequence, targeted reduction of ATM by TRX1 could serve as a regulator of oxidative ATM activation and contribute to the maintenance of the cellular redox homeostasis. These results highlight the importance of the redox-active function of ATM in preventing ROS accumulation and cell death in lung cells."
https://openalex.org/W3015032338,"Collective behavior, and swarm formation in particular, has been studied from several perspectives within a large variety of fields, ranging from biology to physics. In this work, we apply Projective Simulation to model each individual as an artificial learning agent that interacts with its neighbors and surroundings in order to make decisions and learn from them. Within a reinforcement learning framework, we discuss one-dimensional learning scenarios where agents need to get to food resources to be rewarded. We observe how different types of collective motion emerge depending on the distance the agents need to travel to reach the resources. For instance, strongly aligned swarms emerge when the food source is placed far away from the region where agents are situated initially. In addition, we study the properties of the individual trajectories that occur within the different types of emergent collective dynamics. Agents trained to find distant resources exhibit individual trajectories with L\'evy-like characteristics as a consequence of the collective motion, whereas agents trained to reach nearby resources present Brownian-like trajectories."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between C3 regulation and constipation development using a C3 deficiency model. To achieve these, alterations in stool excretion, transverse colon histological structure, and mucin secretion were analyzed in FVB/N-C3em1Hlee /Korl (C3 knockout, C3 KO) mice with the deletion of 11 nucleotides in exon 2 of the C3 gene. The stool excretion parameters, gastrointestinal transit, and intestine length were remarkably decreased in C3 KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, although there was no specific change in feeding behavior. Furthermore, C3 KO mice showed a decrease in mucosal and muscle layer thickness, alterations in crypt structure, irregular distribution of goblet cells, and an increase of mucin droplets in the transverse colon. Mucin secretion was suppressed, and they accumulated in the crypts of C3 KO mice. In addition, the constipation phenotypes detected during C3 deficiency were confirmed in FVB/N mice treated with C3 convertase inhibitor (rosmarinic acid (RA)). Similar phenotypes were observed with respect to stool excretion parameters, gastrointestinal transit, intestine length, alterations in crypt structure, and mucin secretion in RA-treated FVB/N mice. Therefore, the results of the present study provide the first scientific evidence that C3 deficiency may play an important role in the development of constipation phenotypes in C3 KO mice."
https://openalex.org/W3114793031,"Simplified prediction of the interactions of plant tissue culture media components is of critical importance to efficient development and optimization of new media. We applied two algorithms, gene expression programming (GEP) and M5’ model tree, to predict the effects of media components on in vitro proliferation rate (PR), shoot length (SL), shoot tip necrosis (STN), vitrification (Vitri) and quality index (QI) in pear rootstocks (Pyrodwarf and OHF 69). In order to optimize the selected prediction models, as well as achieving a precise multi-optimization method, multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms using genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques were compared to the mono-objective GA optimization technique. A Gamma test (GT) was used to find the most important determinant input for optimizing each output factor. GEP had a higher prediction accuracy than M5’ model tree. GT results showed that BA (Γ = 4.0178), Mesos (Γ = 0.5482), Mesos (Γ = 184.0100), Micros (Γ = 136.6100) and Mesos (Γ = 1.1146), for PR, SL, STN, Vitri and QI respectively, were the most important factors in culturing OHF 69, while for Pyrodwarf culture, BA (Γ = 10.2920), Micros (Γ = 0.7874), NH 4 NO 3 (Γ = 166.410), KNO 3 (Γ = 168.4400), and Mesos (Γ = 1.4860) were the most important influences on PR, SL, STN, Vitri and QI respectively. The PSO optimized GEP models produced the best outputs for both rootstocks."
https://openalex.org/W3115130111,"Porcine cysticercosis and associated human infections are endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Poor agricultural practices, sanitary practices, and lack of knowledge increase the burden of the diseases in susceptible populations. This study investigates the seroprevalence of Taenia spp. in township pigs in Gauteng, South Africa and describes knowledge and farming practices of pig farmers regarding T . solium infections. Blood samples were collected from 126 pigs in three Gauteng township areas, and analyzed for active Taenia spp. infection using the B158/B60 Ag-ELISA. Farmer questionnaire surveys were conducted in four township areas to investigate the level of knowledge and practices associated with porcine cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis. Logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between predictor variables and the outcome variable, knowledge of porcine cysticercosis or knowledge of neurocysticercosis. Overall, 7% of the pigs were seropositive for active Taenia spp. infection. 46% of farmers practiced a free-ranging system, while 25% practiced a semi-intensive system. Latrines were absent on all farms; however, 95% of farmers indicated that they have access to latrines at home. Most farmers had no knowledge of porcine cysticercosis (55%) or neurocysticercosis (79%), and this was not associated with any of the factors investigated. The prevalence of active Taenia spp. infection was reasonably low in this study, yet the knowledge level was also low, thus calling for further educational and training programmes to prevent Taenia spp. transmission in these communities."
https://openalex.org/W3111048504,"Background There are limited contemporary data on the influence of primary payer status on the management and outcomes of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Objective To assess the influence of insurance status on STEMI outcomes. Methods Adult (&gt;18 years) STEMI admissions were identified using the National Inpatient Sample database (2000–2017). Expected primary payer was classified into Medicare, Medicaid, private, uninsured and others. Outcomes of interest included in-hospital mortality, use of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), hospitalization costs, hospital length of stay and discharge disposition. Results Of the 4,310,703 STEMI admissions, Medicare, Medicaid, private, uninsured and other insurances were noted in 49.0%, 6.3%, 34.4%, 7.2% and 3.1%, respectively. Compared to the others, the Medicare cohort was older (75 vs. 53–57 years), more often female (46% vs. 20–36%), of white race, and with higher comorbidity (all p &lt;0.001). The Medicare and Medicaid population had higher rates of cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. The Medicare cohort had higher in-hospital mortality (14.2%) compared to the other groups (4.1–6.7%), p&lt;0.001. In a multivariable analysis (Medicare referent), in-hospital mortality was higher in uninsured (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.14 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.11–1.16]), and lower in Medicaid (aOR 0.96 [95% CI 0.94–0.99]; p = 0.002), privately insured (aOR 0.73 [95% CI 0.72–0.75]) and other insurance (aOR 0.91 [95% CI 0.88–0.94]); all p &lt;0.001. Coronary angiography (60% vs. 77–82%) and PCI (45% vs. 63–70%) were used less frequently in the Medicare population compared to others. The Medicare and Medicaid populations had longer lengths of hospital stay, and the Medicare population had the lowest hospitalization costs and fewer discharges to home. Conclusions Compared to other types of primary payers, STEMI admissions with Medicare insurance had lower use of coronary angiography and PCI, and higher in-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3111781068,"Background Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of direct maternal mortality globally and in Suriname. We aimed to study the prevalence, risk indicators, causes, and management of PPH to identify opportunities for PPH reduction. Methods A nationwide retrospective descriptive study of all hospital deliveries in Suriname in 2017 was performed. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify risk indicators for PPH (≥ 500ml blood loss). Management of severe PPH (blood loss ≥1,000ml or ≥500ml with hypotension or at least three transfusions) was evaluated via a criteria-based audit using the national guideline. Results In 2017, the prevalence of PPH and severe PPH in Suriname was 9.2% (n = 808/8,747) and 2.5% (n = 220/8,747), respectively. PPH varied from 5.8% to 15.8% across the hospitals. Risk indicators associated with severe PPH included being of African descent (Maroon aOR 2.1[95%CI 1.3–3.3], Creole aOR 1.8[95%CI 1.1–3.0]), multiple pregnancy (aOR 3.4[95%CI 1.7–7.1]), delivery in Hospital D (aOR 2.4[95%CI 1.7–3.4]), cesarean section (aOR 3.9[95%CI 2.9–5.3]), stillbirth (aOR 6.4 [95%CI 3.4–12.2]), preterm birth (aOR 2.1[95%CI 1.3–3.2]), and macrosomia (aOR 2.8 [95%CI 1.5–5.0]). Uterine atony (56.7%, n = 102/180[missing 40]) and retained placenta (19.4%, n = 35/180[missing 40]), were the main causes of severe PPH. A criteria-based audit revealed that women with severe PPH received prophylactic oxytocin in 61.3% (n = 95/155[missing 65]), oxytocin treatment in 68.8% (n = 106/154[missing 66]), and tranexamic acid in 4.9% (n = 5/103[missing 117]). Conclusions PPH prevalence and risk indicators in Suriname were similar to international and regional reports. Inconsistent blood loss measurement, varied maternal and perinatal characteristics, and variable guideline adherence contributed to interhospital prevalence variation. PPH reduction in Suriname can be achieved through prevention by practicing active management of the third stage of labor in every birth and considering risk factors, early recognition by objective and consistent blood loss measurement, and prompt treatment by adequate administration of oxytocin and tranexamic acid according to national guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3112589345,"Infant-adult synchrony has been reported through observational and experimental studies. Nevertheless, synchrony is addressed differently in both cases. While observational studies measure synchrony in spontaneous infant-adult interactions, experimental studies manipulate it, inducing nonspontaneous synchronous and asynchronous interactions. A still unsolved question is to what extent differ spontaneous synchrony from the nonspontaneous one, experimentally elicited. To address this question, we conducted a study to compare synchrony in both interactional contexts. Forty-three 14-month-old infants were randomly assigned to one of two independent groups: (1) the spontaneous interaction context, consisting of a storytime session; and (2) the nonspontaneous interaction context, where an assistant bounced the infant in synchrony with a stranger. We employed an optical motion capture system to accurately track the time and form of synchrony in both contexts. Our findings indicate that synchrony arising in spontaneous exchanges has different traits than synchrony produced in a nonspontaneous interplay. The evidence presented here offers new insights for rethinking the study of infant-adult synchrony and its consequences on child development."
https://openalex.org/W3116220786,"Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between concurrent physician-based mental health services, all-cause mortality, and acute health service use for individuals enrolled in Opioid Agonist Treatment in Ontario, Canada. Methods A cohort study of patients enrolled in opioid agonist treatment in Ontario was conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015, in Ontario with an inverse probability of treatment weights using the propensity score to estimate the effect of physician-based mental health services. Treatment groups were created based on opioid agonist treatment patients’ utilization of physician-based mental health services. Propensity score weighted odds ratios were calculated to assess the relationship between the treatment groups and the outcomes of interest. The outcomes included all-cause mortality using data from the Registered Persons Database, Emergency Department visits from the National Ambulatory Care Database, and hospitalizations using data from the Discharge Abstract Database. Encrypted patient identifiers were used to link across databases. Results A total of 48,679 individuals in OAT with mental disorders. Opioid agonist treatment alone was associated with reduced odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3–0.4). Patients who received mental health services from a psychiatrist and primary care physician while engaged in OAT, the estimated rate of ED visits per year was higher (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.4) and the rate of hospitalizations (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.4–0.6) than in the control group. Conclusion Our findings support the view that opioid agonist treatment and concurrent mental health services can improve clinical outcomes for complex patients, and is associated with enhanced use of acute care services."
https://openalex.org/W3116906197,"Parents of children with physical or mental health problems are at higher risk for experiencing parental stress. However, mothers and fathers may experience parental stress differently. The aim was to examine whether mothers and fathers of children with physical and/or mental health problems are equally inclined within the couples to experience different aspects of parental stress when considering child and parent couple characteristics. Single aspects of Parental stress were assessed with nine items from the Parental Stress Scale in 197 parent couples of children aged 1–18 years with physical and/or mental health problems. Agreement within parent couples for each item was tested using two tests of marginal homogeneity for dependent data: a nominal G 2 -test and an ordinal γ-test. Analyses were conditioned on child gender, child age, couple educational level, and overall parental stress. For seven aspects of parental stress, differences in agreement within the couples were found with at least one of the conditioning variables. For five aspects (item 3, 4, 9, 10, 13) addressing specific personal experience of daily stressors related to having children and feeling inadequate as a parent, the differences were systematic. Mothers were more inclined to experience these aspect of parental stress than fathers, specially mothers of boys, a younger child, in couples with an education above high school or with a higher stress level. Agreement was found for two aspects (item 14 and 16) of parental stress. This study suggests that mothers’ and fathers’ experience of most aspects of parental stress vary within the couples. Knowledge on systematic difference between parents’ experience of parental stress may inform future interventions. For aspects where mothers generally experience the highest degree of stress, fathers may be involved as support. Future studies may explore the role of diagnoses, coping strategies and examine concordance in parental stress symptoms in other subgroups."

Although numerous strategies have tried to reduce inadequate antibiotic prescribing, antibiotics are still prescribed in 60% of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) cases in Catalonia (Spain). This study aims to explore service users’ experiences of ALRTIs, the quality and access to healthcare services, and health education. Selective purposive sampling was carried out, based on a prior definition of participant characteristics. These were sex, age, ethnicity, date of the last ALRTI, number of ALRTIs in the last year, and treatments received. Participants with a previous diagnosis of ALRTIs were recruited from three primary health care centres in Barcelona and one in Tarragona. Twenty-nine interviews were conducted between April and June 2019. A content thematic analysis was performed. Three themes were identified: 1) risk perceptions and help-seeking; 2) treatment preferences and antibiotic use; and 3) relationship dynamics and communication with healthcare professionals. Accounts of service users’ sense of autonomy towards their health and power dynamics within the healthcare system were apparent. Supporting service users to become reliable, subjective and agentic experts of their health and bodies could help them to voice their healthcare agendas. Power structures embedded within healthcare, political and economic institutions should be challenged so that healthcare services can be co-developed (with service users) and based on service users’ autonomy and horizontal relationships. Special consideration should be paid to the intersection of social vulnerabilities. A concordance approach to prescribing could be key to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and to contribute to the prevention of AMR in primary healthcare. The marketisation of health, and the increased demands of private healthcare in Spain due to the financial pressures on public healthcare as a consequence of the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic, are a risk for promoting adequate antibiotic prescribing and use.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the economic impact of genetic testing services provided by the Center for Medical Genomics (CMG) in Thailand. Methods Cost-benefit analysis was conducted from provider and societal perspectives. Cost and output data of genetic testing services provided by the CMG during 2014 to 2018 and published literature reviews were applied to estimate the costs and benefits. Monetary benefits related to genetic testing services were derived through human capital approach. Results The total operation cost was 126 million baht over five years with an average annual cost of 21 million baht per year. The net benefit, benefit-to-cost ratio, and return on investment were 5,477 million baht, 43 times, and 42 times, respectively. Productivity gain was the highest proportion (50.57%) of the total benefit. Conclusions The provision of genetic testing services at the CMG gained much more benefits than the cost. This study highlighted a good value for money in the establishment of medical genomics settings in Thailand and other developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3110796960,"Background Few studies demonstrate delayed recovery after exercise in children and adults with heart disease. We assess the recovery patterns of gas exchange parameters and heart rate (HR) in children with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rToF) compared to healthy peers and investigate the correlation with ventricular function and QRS duration. Methods 45 children after rToF and 45 controls performed a maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test. In the subsequent recovery period, patterns of VO 2 , VCO 2 and HR were analysed. Half-life time (T 1/2 ) of the exponential decay and drop per minute (Rec min ) were compared between groups. In the rToF group, correlations were examined between the recovery parameters and QRS-duration and ventricular function, described by fractional shortening (FS) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measured at baseline prior to exercise. Results Recovery of VO 2 and VCO 2 was delayed in rToF patients, half-life time values were higher compared to controls (T 1/2 VO 2 52.51 ±11.29 s vs. 44.31 ± 10.47 s; p = 0.001 and T 1/2 VCO 2 68.28 ± 13.84 s vs. 59.41 ± 12.06 s; p = 0.002) and percentage drop from maximal value was slower at each minute of recovery (p&lt;0.05). Correlations were found with FS (T 1/2 VO 2 : r = -0.517; p&lt;0.001; Rec 1min VO 2 : r = -0.636, p&lt;0.001; Rec 1min VCO 2 : r = -0.373, p = 0.012) and TAPSE (T 1/2 VO 2 : r = -0.505; p&lt;0.001; Rec 1min VO 2 : r = -0.566, p&lt;0.001; T 1/2 VCO 2 : r = -0.466; p = 0.001; Rec 1min VCO 2 : r = -0.507, p&lt;0.001), not with QRS-duration. No difference was found in HR recovery between patients and controls. Conclusions Children after rToF show a delayed gas exchange recovery after exercise.

Objective To identify the ADRs associated with the use of biological drugs in Colombia. Methods This was a retrospective study of ADR reports from 2014 to 2019, contained in the database of Audifarma SA pharmacovigilance program. The ADRs, groups of associated drugs, and affected organs were classified. Results In total, 5,415 reports of ADRs associated with biological drugs were identified in 78 Colombian cities. A total of 76.1% of the cases corresponded to women. The majority were classified as type A (55.0%) and B (28.9%), and 16.7% were serious cases. The respiratory tract was the most affected organ system (16.8%), followed by the skin and appendages (15.6%). Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs accounted for 70.6% of the reports, and the drugs related to the greatest number of ADRs were adalimumab (12.2%) and etanercept (11.6%). Conclusions The reporting of ADRs has increased in recent years and these reactions are mostly classified as tyoe A or B, categorized as serious in almost one-fifth of the reported cases and associated mainly with immunomodulators and antineoplastic agents.

https://openalex.org/W3111723669,"Background Family-centered care of ICU patients is increasingly recommended as it is believed to have effect on family members’ psychosocial status and patient outcomes. Defining the nature and extent of families’ involvement in a given health care environment for different stakeholders is a challenge. Understanding the lived experiences of families of ICU patients would help strategize on how to better engage family members for improved ICU care processes and outcomes. Objectives The aim of this study is to explore the lived experiences of families of patients in the ICUs of hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods The study adopted a qualitative approach and a phenomenological research design. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve (12) family members who were purposively sampled from two government hospitals and four private hospitals. Thematic approach with the application of hermeneutic circle of interpretation was applied to understand the meanings of their experiences. Results The study revealed the following major themes: financial burden, challenge in decision making, shattered family integrity and expectations, information and communication gap between family members and health professionals, lack of confidence in the service delivery of hospitals, social pressure against patient families, and families being immersed in an unfriendly environment. Though they do not explicitly mention it to the health care tram, further interpretation of the main themes elucidated that family’s need the intensive care process be cut shorter irrespective of the outcome of the patient condition. Conclusion The study gave an insight on the multiple and interrelated challenges faced by families of ICU patients admitted in the hospitals of Addis Ababa. Further contextualized interpretation of their experiences revealed that families were somehow in a state of despair and they implicitly need the ICU care for their family member be ended irrespective of the potential clinical consequences on the patient. The philosophy of family-centered care be advocated in hospitals. The study result affirms the need to include family members during nursing assessment of patients in ICUs and also offers the basis for guidelines development on informational support to the families of the patients hospitalized in ICUs."

Objective This study was designed to assess differences in MD-only and dual degree MD applicants with respect to applicant characteristics and match outcomes. Methods Utilizing the voluntarily-reported publicly available 2017–2019 Texas STAR database, we assessed applicants from 115 medical schools. Texas STAR indicates that over this time period, there were 18,224 responses for a response rate of 43.8%. Comparisons were made between groups using student’s t-test and chi-squared analysis. Results Compared to MD only students, MD/MPH applicants had a higher propensity towards primary care specialties. MD/PhD applicants did not differ versus MD only applicants in their selection of primary care specialties, or of competitive specialties. MD/MBA applicants chose more competitive specialties and less primary care specialties. Despite all these differences, match rates were not different comparing MD only and dual-degree students. Conclusions Despite the growing popularity of combined MD programs, such programs do not appear to increase applicant match competitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3116509917,"The causative agent of Asiatic citrus canker, the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (XAC), produces more severe symptoms and attacks a larger number of citric hosts than Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii XauB and XauC, the causative agents of cancrosis, a milder form of the disease. Here we report a comparative proteomic analysis of periplasmic-enriched fractions of XAC and XauB in XAM-M, a pathogenicity- inducing culture medium, for identification of differential proteins. Proteins were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the 12 proteins identified from the 4 unique spots from XAC in XAM-M (p&lt;0.05) were phosphoglucomutase (PGM), enolase, xylose isomerase (XI), transglycosylase, NAD(P)H-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA synthetase β subunit, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and conserved hypothetical proteins XAC0901 and XAC0223; most of them were not detected as differential for XAC when both bacteria were grown in NB medium, a pathogenicity non-inducing medium. XauB showed a very different profile from XAC in XAM-M, presenting 29 unique spots containing proteins related to a great diversity of metabolic pathways. Preponderant expression of PGM and XI in XAC was validated by Western Blot analysis in the periplasmic-enriched fractions of both bacteria. This work shows remarkable differences between the periplasmic-enriched proteomes of XAC and XauB, bacteria that cause symptoms with distinct degrees of severity during citrus infection. The results suggest that some proteins identified in XAC can have an important role in XAC pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W3117722279,"Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental contaminant that causes renal toxicity. We have previously demonstrated that Cd induces renal toxicity by altering transcriptional activities. In this study, we show that Cd markedly inhibited the activity of transcription factor MEF2A in HK-2 human proximal tubule cells, which generated significant cytotoxicity in the cells. This reduction in the nuclear levels of MEF2A protein may be involved in the Cd-induced inhibition of MEF2A activity. We also demonstrate that one of the glucose transporters, GLUT4, was downregulated not only by Cd treatment but also by MEF2A knockdown. Knockdown of SLC2A4, encoding GLUT4, eliminated both cell viability and Cd toxicity. Cd treatment or SLC2A4 deficiency reduced the cellular concentration of glucose. Therefore, the suppression of SLC2A4 expression, which mediates the reduction in cellular glucose, is involved in Cd toxicity. The Cd toxicity induced by the reduction in GLUT4 may be associated with a reduction of cellular ATP levels in HK-2 cells. The levels of Slc2a4 mRNA in the kidney of mice exposed to Cd for 6 or 12 months were significantly lower than those in the control group. These results demonstrate that Cd exerts its cytotoxicity through the suppression in SLC2A4 expression and the subsequent inhibition of MEF2A transcriptional activity. Cd-induced suppression of SLC2A4 expression also reduces cellular ATP levels, partly by reducing glucose levels. This study suggests that the glucose transporter plays an important role in the renal toxicity of Cd, and provides a crucial breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of Cd toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3117842966,"Studies of neuroglial interaction largely depend on cell-specific gene knockout (KO) experiments using Cre recombinase. However, genes known as glial-specific genes have recently been reported to be expressed in neuroglial stem cells, leading to the possibility that a glia-specific Cre driver results in unwanted gene deletion in neurons, which may affect sound interpretation. 2',3'-Cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) is generally considered to be an oligodendrocyte (OL) marker. Accordingly, Cnp promoter-controlled Cre recombinase has been used to create OL-specific gene targeting mice. However, in this study, using Rosa26-tdTomato-reporter/Cnp-Cre mice, we found that many forebrain neurons and cerebellar Purkinje neurons belong to the lineages of Cnp-expressing neuroglial stem cells. To answer whether gene targeting by Cnp-Cre can induce neuron-autonomous defects, we conditionally deleted an essential autophagy gene, Atg7, in Cnp-Cre mice. The Cnp-Cre-mediated Atg7 KO mice showed extensive p62 inclusion in neurons, including cerebellar Purkinje neurons with extensive neurodegeneration. Furthermore, neuronal areas showing p62 inclusion in Cnp-Cre-mediated Atg7 KO mice overlapped with the neuronal lineage of Cnp-expressing neuroglial stem cells. Moreover, Cnp-Cre-mediated Atg7-KO mice did not develop critical defects in myelination. Our results demonstrate that a large population of central neurons are derived from Cnp-expressing neuroglial stem cells; thus, conditional gene targeting using the Cnp promoter, which is known to be OL-specific, can induce neuron-autonomous phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3112003564,"MiRNAs have attracted more attention in recent years as regulators of sleep and circadian rhythms after their roles in circadian rhythm and sleep were discovered. In this study, we explored the roles of the miR-276a on daily sleep in Drosophila melanogaster, and found a regulatory cycle for the miR-276a pathway, in which miR-276a, regulated by the core CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC) transcription factor upstream, regulates sleep via suppressing targets TIM and NPFR1. (a) Loss of miR-276a function makes the flies sleep more during both daytime and nighttime, while flies with gain of miR-276a function sleep less; (b) MiR-276a is widely expressed in the mushroom body (MB), the pars intercerebralis (PI) and some clock neurons lateral dorsal neurons (LNds), in which tim neurons is important for sleep regulation; (c) MiR-276a promoter is identified to locate in the 8th fragment (aFrag8) of the pre-miR-276a, and this fragment is directly activated and regulated by CLK/CYC; (4) MiR-276a is rhythmically oscillating in heads of the wild-type w1118 , but this oscillation disappears in the loss of function mutant clkjrk ; (5) The neuropeptide F receptor 1 (npfr1) was found to be a downstream target of miR-276a. These results clarify that the miR-276a is a very important factor for sleep regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3112326554,"Background Women involved in repetitive, fatiguing, jobs develop more neck and/or shoulder musculoskeletal disorders than men. Sex differences in the pain response to exercise could contribute to the higher prevalence of neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders in women. The objective of this study was to assess sex differences in pain sensitivity following a fatiguing upper limb task. Relationships between measures of fatigue and of the sensitivity to nociceptive and to non-nociceptive stimulations were also explored. Methods Thirty healthy adults (15 women) performed a fatiguing repetitive pointing task with their dominant arm. Upper limb electromyography was recorded from the dominant upper trapezius, anterior deltoid and bicep brachii and from the contralateral tibialis anterior. Before and immediately after the repetitive pointing task, pressure pain and light touch sensitivity thresholds were measured over the same muscles. Results Electromyographic signs of fatigue were observed only in the anterior deltoid and biceps brachii muscles. Pressure pain thresholds over both muscles increased slightly (effect size ≤ 0.34), but no changes occurred over the upper trapezius and the tibialis anterior. Light touch thresholds increased moderately to importantly after the repetitive pointing task over all four muscles (effect sizes = 0.58 to 0.87). No sex differences were observed in any sensory variable. Moreover, no or weak correlations (r = -0.27 to 0.39) were observed between electromyographical signs of fatigue, light touch threshold and pressure pain threshold variables. Conclusions We observed sex-independent effects of a repetitive upper limb task on the sensitivity to painful and to nonpainful stimuli. Moreover, the hypoalgesia induced by the repetitive pointing task was weak and localized, and did not directly correlate with the induced muscle fatigue. Results suggest that fatigue-related changes in the sensitivity to noxious and innocuous stimuli could not explain women’s greater prevalence of neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3113276147,"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides millions of low-income Americans food benefits and other forms of nutrition assistance. Evidence indicates that SNAP reduces food insecurity. However, there is a concern that the food benefit may increase the demand for less healthy foods more than healthier foods, thereby reducing the overall nutritional quality of the participant’s food basket. This paper aims to examine the association of SNAP participation with the nutritional quality of food-at-home purchases of low-income households and to investigate the potential heterogeneity among consumers with different levels of nutrition attitude. This analysis used food purchase data from the USDA National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). Our study sample included 2,218 low-income households, of which 1,184 are SNAP participants, and 1,034 are income-eligible nonparticipants. Multivariate regressions were performed to explore the SNAP-nutritional quality association. A household’s nutrition attitude was measured using its response to a question on whether the household searched for nutrition information online in the last 2 months. Households that affirmed they had an online nutrition search were treated as nutrition-oriented households (21.2% of the low-income sample), and households that did not were considered less nutrition-oriented households (78.8%). For robustness, we also created an alternative nutrition attitude measure based on reported use of the nutrition facts label. We found that among less nutrition-oriented households, SNAP participants had a statistically significant 0.097 points ( p = 0.018) lower Guiding Stars rating than low-income nonparticipants. However, there was no significant SNAP-nutritional quality association among nutrition-oriented households. In conclusion, SNAP participation was associated with lower nutritional quality of food purchases among less nutrition-oriented households, but not among nutrition-oriented households. The results suggest that the intended nutritional benefits of restrictions on purchases of healthy foods may not reach the subgroup of nutrition-oriented SNAP participants."
https://openalex.org/W3114600509,"Asthmatic airways feature increased ASM mass that is largely attributable to hyperplasia, and which potentially contributes to excessive airway narrowing. T cells induce ASMC proliferation via contact-dependent mechanisms in vitro that may have importance for asthmatic ASM growth, as CD4+ T cells infiltrate ASM bundles in asthmatic human airways. In this study, we used an in vitro migration assay to investigate the pathways responsible for the trafficking of human CD4+ T cells to ASM. ASMCs induced chemotaxis of activated CD4+ T cells, which was inhibited by the CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 and neutralizing antibodies against its ligands CXCL10 and 11, but not CCR3 or CCR5 antagonists. CXCR3 expression was upregulated among all T cells following anti-CD3/CD28-activation. CD4+ T cells upregulated CXCL9, 10, and 11 expression in ASMCs in an IFN-γ/STAT1-dependent manner. Disruption of IFN-γ-signaling resulted in reduced T cell migration, along with the inhibition of CD4+ T cell-mediated STAT1 activation and CXCR3 ligand secretion by ASMCs. ASMCs derived from healthy and asthmatic donors demonstrated similar T cell-recruiting capacities. In vivo CXCL10 and 11 expression by asthmatic ASM was confirmed by immunostaining. We conclude that the CXCL10/11-CXCR3 axis causes CD4+ T cell recruitment to ASM that is amplified by T cell-derived IFN-γ."
https://openalex.org/W3110867264,"Cellular differentiation is a tightly regulated process under the control of intricate signaling and transcription factors interaction network working in coordination. These interactions make the systems dynamic, robust and stable but also difficult to dissect. In the spinal cord, recent work has shown that a network of FGF, WNT and Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling factors regulate neural maturation by directing the activity of a transcription factor network that contains CDX at its core. Here we have used partial and ordinary (Hill) differential equation based models to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the FGF/WNT/RA and the CDX/transcription factor networks, alone and in combination. We show that in both networks, the strength of interaction among network partners impacts the dynamics, behavior and output of the system. In the signaling network, interaction strength determine the position and size of discrete regions of cell differentiation and small changes in the strength of the interactions among networking partners can result in a signal overriding, balancing or oscillating with another signal. We also show that the spatiotemporal information generated by the signaling network can be conveyed to the CDX/transcription network to produces a transition zone that separates regions of high cell potency from regions of cell differentiation, in agreement with most in vivo observations. Importantly, one emerging property of the networks is their robustness to extrinsic disturbances, which allows the system to retain or canalize NP cells in developmental trajectories. This analysis provides a model for the interaction conditions underlying spinal cord cell maturation during embryonic axial elongation."
https://openalex.org/W3113377349,"In recent years, several studies of human predictive learning demonstrated better learning about outcomes that have previously been experienced as consistently predictable compared to outcomes previously experienced as less predictable, namely the outcome predictability effect . As this effect may have wide-reaching implications for current theories of associative learning, the present study aimed to examine the generality of the effect with a human goal-tracking paradigm, employing three different designs to manipulate the predictability of outcomes in an initial training phase. In contrast to the previous studies, learning in a subsequent phase, when every outcome was equally predictable by novel cues, was not reliably affected by the outcomes’ predictability in the first phase. This lack of an outcome predictability effect provides insights into the parameters of the effect and its underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3110810962,"Homing pigeons ( Columba livia domestica ) were used to test whether clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging disrupts orientation of animals that sense the earth’s magnetic field. Thirty young pigeons were randomly separated into three groups (n = 10/group). Two groups were anaesthetized and exposed to either a constant (no sequence) or a varying (gradient echo and echo planar sequences) magnetic field within a 3 Tesla MR unit for 15 minutes. The control group was not exposed to the MR field but shared all other aspects of the procedure. One day later, animals were released from a site they had never visited, 15 km from the home loft. Three weeks after the procedure, animals were released from a different unfamiliar site 30 km from the loft. Measured variables included the time to disappear from sight (seconds), vanishing bearing (angle), and the time interval from release to entering the home loft (hours). On first release, the group exposed to varying field gradients during image acquisition using 2 different standard sequences showed more variability in the vanishing bearing compared to the other groups (p = 0.0003 compared to control group), suggesting interference with orientation. Other measures did not show significant differences between groups. On second release, there were no significant differences between groups. Our results on homing pigeons show that regular clinical MR imaging exposure may temporarily affect the orientation of species that have magnetoreception capabilities. If exposure to MR imaging disrupted processes that are not specific to magnetoreception, then it may affect other species and other capabilities as well."
https://openalex.org/W3111305939,"It is known that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is disproportionately affecting the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, and the poor. What is the effect of informing the public about these inequalities on people’s perceptions of threat and their sensitivity to the outbreak’s human toll? This study answers this question using a novel survey experiment and finds that emphasis on the unequal aspect of the pandemic, especially as it relates to the elderly and those with medical conditions, could be causing the public to become less concerned about the outbreak and its human toll. Discussion situates this finding in the literature on scientific communication and persuasion and explains why language that emphasizes the impact of the virus on all of us —rather than singling out certain groups—could be more effective in increasing caution among the general public and make them take the situation more seriously."
