However, the effect of mechanical stimuli on cell proliferation is less well understood. Here we examined the effect of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (US), which is used to promote wound healing, on the proliferation of primary human foreskin fibroblasts and the underlying signaling mechanisms. We show that a single 6-11-min US stimulation increases bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. In addition, an increase in the total cell number is observed after sequential US stimulation. US induced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation via activation of Rho. We further observed that US selectively induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) prevented US-induced ERK1/2 activation, demonstrating that the Rho/ROCK pathway is an upstream regulator of ERK activation in response to US. Consequently, activation of ROCK and MEK-1 was required for US-induced DNA synthesis. Finally, an integrin β1 blocking antibody as well as a RGD peptide prevented US-induced DNA synthesis. In addition, US slightly increased phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416, and Src activity was found to be required for ERK1/2 activation in response to US. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that US promotes cell proliferation via activation of integrin receptors and a Rho/ROCK/Src/ERK signaling pathway.

Signal transduction mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinase or heptahelical receptors have been studied extensively over the last years. However, the effect of acoustic pulsed energy on cell growth and the signal transduction mechanisms induced by this type of mechanical stimulation are not well understood. Previous studies have shown that mechanical stress such as stretch and shear stress can induce DNA synthesis in certain cell types and that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; US, low intensity pulsed ultrasound; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ROCK, Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, MAPK-ERK kinase; BrdU, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI, phosphatidylinositol. 1/2 can be activated by mechanical stress (1Numaguchi K.

Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (US) is a special type of acoustic pulsed energy that is increasingly used as a supplementary therapy to promote bone and wound healing (5Rubin C. Bolander M.

US, transmitting as an acoustic pressure wave and applying mechanical stress indirectly to the tissues, has been reported to promote osteogenesis and protein synthesis, calcium uptake, and DNA synthesis in different cells (6Chen Y.J.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which US induces DNA synthesis or even cell proliferation are largely unknown. There is growing evidence that integrins are promising candidates for sensing extracellular matrix-derived mechanical stimuli and converting them into biochemical signals (13Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1472-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Integrin-associated signaling pathways include an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, activation of serine/threonine kinases, and alterations in cellular phospholipid and calcium levels (15Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar, 16Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-261PubMed Google Scholar). These events are associated with the formation of focal adhesions, which contain structural proteins such as talin and vinculin, the signaling molecules focal adhesion kinase and Src, and the adaptor proteins paxillin, p130CAS, and Shc. Focal adhesions act as a bridge to link integrin cytoplasmic domain to the cytoskeleton and activate integrin-associated signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (17Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and the Rho pathway (18Riveline D. Zamir E. Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Ishizaki T.

Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar, 22Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J.

Res. 1999; 85: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 24Zhao Z. Rivkees S.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Integrin-dependent adhesion can also trigger ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation to transduce downstream signaling (25Cabodi S. Moro L. Bergatto E. Boeri Erba E. Di Stefano P. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effect of US on cell proliferation and the signaling mechanism mediating this effect in primary human foreskin fibroblasts. We report that US activates ERK1/2 by a ROCK-dependent mechanism. Both ERK1/2 and ROCK are required for US-induced cell proliferation. Furthermore, integrins were found to be responsible for US-induced cell proliferation. We suggest that integrins act as mechanotransducers to transmit acoustic pulsed energy into intracellular biochemical signals inducing cell proliferation.

Cell Isolation and Culture—Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated by the outgrowth method using foreskin tissues. Full-thickness foreskin tissues were placed directly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm l-glutamine and then cut into small pieces of 0.5-1 mm3 using a scalpel under sterile conditions. The small tissue pieces were seeded in 6-well plates (5-10 pieces/well) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 125 ng/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The medium was changed after 12 and 24 h; the small tissue pieces were then transferred to new culture plates. During the next 3-5 days, the cells grew out from the tissue pieces and gradually formed a confluent layer. After reaching confluence, the cells were subcultured by trypsinization using a 0.25% trypsin solution containing 0.01% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The medium was changed the day after seeding and each second or third day thereafter. The experiments were performed using cell populations between passages 2 and 10. Stimulation with US—To stimulate the cultured cells with US, a modified SAFHS® apparatus (Model 2A, Exogen Inc., Piscataway, NJ) was used, which produces a 1.5-MHz ultrasound wave, 200-μs pulse modulated at 1 kHz, with an output intensity of 30 mW/cm2. To enable cultured cells to be treated by ultrasound, six ultrasound transducers are fitted on a plastic frame and connected to the control panel of the signal generator via six independent cables. Therefore, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates for all the experiments. The operation of the transducers was checked before each experiment. The plates were placed on ultrasound transducers using a coupling gel. The untreated plates were always put in a separate incubator for control purposes. BrdU Incorporation Assay—BrdU incorporation was visualized by immunostaining as described (26Luttenberger T. Schmid-Kotsas A. Menke A. Siech M. Beger H. Adler G. Grunert A. Bachem M.G. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in 6-well plates and serum-starved for 24-36 h. 6 h after stimulation with US, 50 μm BrdU in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the cultures. After additional incubation for 18 h, the cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with ice-cold ethanol/acetic acid (95/5, v/v) at 4 °C. Thereafter 0.05 m HCl was added to the fixed cells (4 °C for 20 min). After washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), DNA was cleaved by incubation for 45 min at 80 °C with formamide/trisodium citrate (88 mg of trisodium citrate in 38 ml of formamide). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with serum (diluted 1:1 with PBS). Mouse anti-BrdU diluted 1:200 in Tris-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% albumin bovine fraction V) was added and incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:100 in Tris-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin) was added and incubated for 2 h. Finally, after washing, the cells were stained using diaminobenzimidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate as substrate and 0.3% hydrogen peroxide with nickel- and cobalt-chloride as intensifier. Total cell number and BrdU-positive nuclei were counted. BrdU incorporation presented as the percentage of positive nuclei to total cell number. Total Cell Number Assay—The total cell number for each sample was estimated by quantitation of lactate dehydrogenase after cell lysis using the CytoTox 96® nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit according to the manufacturer instructions. Western Blotting—Skin fibroblasts were lysed at 4 °C in 250 μl of solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate (30-40 μg) was mixed with 2× Laemmli reducing sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBST for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody, phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) monoclonal antibody, or phospho-Src (Tyr416) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After further incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, the bound antibodies were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with P42 MAPK monoclonal antibody, EGFR polyclonal antibody, and Src polyclonal antibody for total ERK1/2, EGFR, and Src, respectively. Immune Complex Kinase Assay for p42/44 MAPK—Quiescent and confluent skin fibroblasts were lysed as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a polyclonal anti-p42 MAPK antibody. The samples were incubated on a rotator for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl, 1:1 slurry) were added for the second hour. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2). The kinase reaction was performed by resuspending the pellet in 25 μl of kinase assay mixture containing kinase buffer, 100 μm ATP, 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml myelin-binding protein peptide (APRTPGGRR) for the p42 MAPK assays. Incubations were performed for 10 min (linear assay conditions) at 30 °C and terminated by spotting 20 μl of the supernatant onto P81 chromatography paper (Whatman). The filters were washed four times for 5 min in 0.5% orthophosphoric acid, immersed in acetone, and dried before Cerenkov counting. The specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP used was 900-1200 cpm/pmol. Rho Activation Assay—The activation of Rho was determined by affinity precipitation using a Rho activation assay kit. The skin fibroblasts were lysed with Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the cell lysates (1 mg of protein in 1 ml) were mixed with 30 μl of the rhotekin RBD-agarose slurry, and the mixture was rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer. The beads were dried with a Hamilton syringe and resuspended in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli reducing sample buffer, and the suspension was heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting using 3 μg/ml of monoclonal anti-Rho. Loading controls were taken from each lysate sample prior to affinity precipitation. Immunofluorescence—Serum-starved cells were preincubated with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (20 μm) or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) for 1 h and stimulated by US for 11 min. The cultures were stopped at 45 min after US and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with FCS in PBS (1:1) for 30 min. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, the cells were then incubated with monoclonal anti-paxillin (5H11) (1:100, 1 h), horseradish peroxidase-anti-mouse IgG (1:100, 1 h), biotin-tyramid signal amplification reagent (1:500, 15 min), and streptavidin-Texas Red (1:200, 30 min). Thereafter, F-actin was labeled with Alexa-phalloidin 488 (2.5 unit/ml) for 30 min. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. Tris-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin buffer was used for dilution. The cells were thoroughly washed after each step in PBST buffer three times each for 5 min. Digital fluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus microscope. Statistical Analysis—The data were presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance for comparison between the control and test groups. The values were considered to be statistically different when p < 0.05. US Induces DNA Synthesis and Cell Proliferation in Human Skin Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts are the major cell type in connective tissue and are critical for tissue restoration and remodeling after injury. Therefore, we used primary skin fibroblasts as a model to understand the mechanism of US to promote tissue repair. To examine the effect of US on DNA synthesis, the cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 5% FCS and stimulated with US for 6 min or 11 min, and BrdU incorporation was determined after 24 h of incubation. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with US for 6 or 11 min significantly increased the BrdU labeling index both in the absence and the presence of 5% FCS. Next, we examined the effect of US on actual cell proliferation by quantifying the total cell number using the CytoTox 96® assay. In accordance with US-induced DNA synthesis, seven sequential US stimulations (once per day for 6 or 11 min over 7 days) significantly increased the total cell number in the absence of FCS by 2- and 2.8-fold, respectively, compared with control (Fig. 1B, left columns). Even in the presence of 5% FCS, US induced 1.48-fold (6 min) and 1.7-fold (11 min) increases of cell number (Fig. 1B, right columns). Both the BrdU incorporation assay and total cell number analysis showed that the effect of 11 min of US stimulation on cell proliferation was more pronounced than 6 min of stimulation. Therefore, 11 min of US stimulation was used in all of the subsequent experiments. US Induces Rho-mediated Stress Fiber and Focal Adhesion Formation—Mechanical stimulation may induce formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (27Pavalko F.M. Chen N.X. Turner C.H. Burr D.B. Atkinson S. Hsieh Y.F. Qiu J. Duncan R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1591-C1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether US has any effect on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, in particular, on stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Actin was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and formed a thin cortical ring in control skin fibroblasts. Paxillin was also distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, panels a, e, and i). 30 and 60 min after US, we observed an intense formation of actin stress fibers, and paxillin immunofluorescence was strikingly redistributed by US to focal adhesions with similar kinetics (Fig. 2A, panels b, f, and j and data not shown). The small G-protein Rho and its downstream target Rho kinase/ROCK modulate the organization of actin stress fibers and the formation of focal adhesions as well as the redistribution of cytoskeletal components (21Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar, 22Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Rho/ROCK in US-induced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation in primary skin fibroblasts, the cells were treated with 20 μm of the selective ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (28Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar) for 60 min and subsequently analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Y27632 completely prevented both US-induced stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly (Fig. 2A, panels d, h, and i), indicating that Rho/ROCK plays a pivotal role in US-stimulated stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Using a rhotekin RBD affinity precipitation assay (29Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that US induces a strong activation of RhoA, which was comparable with that induced by the bioactive lipid lysophosphatic acid, a potent activator of RhoA (30Moolenaar W.H. Van Meeteren L.A. Gerpmans B.N. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The Rho/ROCK Pathway Is Involved in US-induced DNA Synthesis—The Rho/ROCK signaling pathway has also been implicated in the G1-S phase progression of the cell cycle (1Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 24Zhao Z. Rivkees S.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether activation of the Rho pathway could be involved in US-stimulated DNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 2B, BrdU incorporation in response to US was substantially inhibited in the presence of Y27632. Thus, activation of Rho/ROCK is required for DNA synthesis induced by US stimulation. US-induced ERK1/2 Activation Mediates DNA Synthesis— The ERK cascade is a potent mediator of cell cycle progression in response to a variety of stimuli. Indeed, ERK1/2 phosphorylation slightly increased directly at the end of US stimulation, peaked between 10 and 20 min (2.26 ± 0.41-fold of control) after US stimulation, and gradually decreased to base-line levels within 60 min (Fig. 3A). There was no change in the total ERK1/2 protein content (Fig. 3A). In addition to Western blotting analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we performed ERK in vitro kinase assays in primary skin fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3B, the kinetics of ERK1/2 activation in response to US was similar to that of ERK phosphorylation, showing a peak activity 20 min after US (1.70 ± 0.23-fold of control). MEK-1 is an upstream regulator of the ERK cascade. Incubation of cells with a selective MEK-1 inhibitor abolished US-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) and decreased the percentage of BrdU-labeled nuclei in response to US from 19.8 to 8.7% (Fig. 3D). This demonstrates that the activation of the ERK cascade is crucial for US-induced DNA synthesis. ROCK Is an Upstream Mediator of US-induced ERK Activation—Next we examined whether Rho/ROCK and the ERK cascade were independent regulators of US-induced DNA synthesis or parts of a linear signaling cascade. The MEK-1 inhibitor was not able to block US-induced F-actin polymerization and paxillin focal adhesion formation (Fig. 4A, panels c, d, g, h, k, and l), suggesting that ERK1/2 activation is not required for US-induced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. However, treatment of cells with the ROCK inhibitor prevented phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to US (Fig. 4B), whereas activation of the ERK cascade by transforming growth factor α was not affected by Y27632 in skin fibroblasts (data not shown). Thus, Rho/ROCK is a specific upstream regulator of ERK1/2 activation upon exposure of cells to acoustic pulsed energy. Effect of Integrin β1 Blocking Antibody and RGD Peptide on US-induced DNA Synthesis—It has been suggested that integrins serve as mechanotransducers (13Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1472-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The classical ligand for integrins on fibroblasts is fibronectin, which contains the integrin-recognition sequence RGD (31Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). Specific integrin blocking antibodies or RGD peptides have been widely used to verify involvement of integrins in mechanotransduction (32Weyts F.A. Li Y.S. van Leeuwen J. Weinans H. Chien S. J. Cell.

To determine whether integrins could mediate the signaling events in response to acoustic pulsed energy, skin fibroblasts were treated with an integrin β1 blocking antibody (P4C10) as well as a RGD peptide. Both treatments reduced US-induced BrdU incorporation to base-line levels (Fig. 5). In striking contrast, pretreatment of the cells with an unspecific mouse IgG as a control had no inhibitory effect on US-induced BrdU incorporation (Fig. 5). Thus, integrins are mediators of acoustic pulsed energy-induced BrdU incorporation in primary skin fibroblasts. US-induced ERK Activation Is Independent of EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Activity in Primary Skin Fibroblasts—The data above demonstrate that integrins mediate US-induced DNA synthesis in skin fibroblasts by an ERK-dependent mechanism. It has been demonstrated that integrin-dependent adhesion can trigger ligand-independent EGFR activation to transduce downstream signaling (25Cabodi S. Moro L. Bergatto E. Boeri Erba E. Di Stefano P. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined whether US-induced ERK activation required EGFR activity. As shown in Fig. 6A, the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 did not prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to acoustic pulsed energy. However, the inhibitor abolished ERK1/2 phosphorylation and EGFR phosphorylation in response to transforming growth factor α, a ligand of the EGFR. In accordance with these data, we could not detect an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in response to US (Fig. 6B). Thus, intracellular signaling induced by acoustic pulsed energy is independent of EGFR signaling and does not induce EGFR transactivation. Src Is an Upstream Regulator of US-induced ERK Activation, Whereas PI 3-Kinase/Akt Pathway Is Not Involved in US-triggered Signaling—The tyrosine kinase Src has also been implicated in the activation of the ERK cascade by integrins (36Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Indeed, US induced a slight increase in phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416 in the activation loop with similar kinetics as ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). The selective Src inhibitor PP1 blocked US-induced Src activation. In addition, PP1 also inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that Src is an upstream regulator of US-induced ERK activation in primary human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 7B). β1 integrins have also been demonstrated to activate the PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway, which is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression (37Armulik A. Velling T. Johansson S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2558-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, we detected neither an inhibition of US-induced DNA synthesis by the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 nor an increase in phosphorylation of the PI 3-kinase downstream target Akt in response to US stimulation (data not shown). Thus, the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is not involved in the signaling cascade induced by acoustic pulsed energy in primary skin fibroblasts. Tissue repair is a complex process involving different cell types and biochemical reactions. It is usually divided into three overlapping phases, the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase, and the remodeling phase (38Clark R.A. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1985; 13: 701-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Acoustic pulsed energy is increasingly used as a supplementary therapy to promote bone and wound healing (5Rubin C. Bolander M. Ryaby J.P. Hadjiargyrou M. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2001; 83A: 259-270Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Fibroblasts are the major cell type in connective tissue and are critical for tissue restoration and remodeling after injury. Therefore, primary skin fibroblasts are a useful model to understand the mechanism of US to promote tissue repair. In the present report, we show that a single low intensity pulsed US treatment is able to promote DNA synthesis in quiescent primary skin fibroblasts. Daily repeated US stimulation, which resembles the clinical schedule, substantially increases cell numbers. These experiments demonstrate that a physical stimulus, acoustic pulsed energy, can promote cell proliferation, which is a prerequisite of wound healing. Mechanical stimuli can affect both the actin cytoskeleton and cell cycle progression (39Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases and downstream targets such as ROCK regulate cytoskeletal organization (40Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), in particular the formation of stress fiber and focal adhesion complexes (19Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M.

Our data show that US activates RhoA, induces the formation of F-actin stress fibers, and recruits paxillin to focal adhesions by a ROCK-dependent pathway. In addition, the activation of Rho/ROCK is required for US-induced BrdU incorporation. Direct mechanical stimulation such as stretching of cells can activate the ERK cascade in different cell systems (2Hashimoto D. Maruoka S. Gon Y. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Komuro I. Horie T.

Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Acoustic pulsed energy can be regarded as a form of nonphysiological mechanical energy applying mechanical stress indirectly to the cultured cells. US induced an approximately 2-fold transient increase in ERK1/2 activation in primary human foreskin fibroblasts, which is comparable with direct mechanical stimulation (2Hashimoto D. Maruoka S. Gon Y. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Komuro I. Horie T. Allergol. Intern. 2001; 50: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32Weyts F.A. Li Y.S. van Leeuwen J. Weinans H. Chien S. J. Cell.

Dermatol. 2000; 114: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore activation of ERK1/2 by US was required to trigger DNA synthesis in primary human skin fibroblasts. It has been suggested that Rho could be involved in integrin-induced activation of ERK2 in fibroblasts (43Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data further establish that RhoA/ROCK acts as an upstream regulator of the ERK cascade to induce cell proliferation in response to US stimulation in primary human skin fibroblasts. Integrins act as mechanotransducers in response to shear stress (32Weyts F.A. Li Y.S. van Leeuwen J. Weinans H. Chien S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), mechanical stretch (33Kippenberger S. Bernd A. Loitsch S. Guschel M. Muller J. Bereiter-Hahn J. Kaufmann R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and cycled magnetic fields (4Schmidt C. Pommerenke H. Durr F. Nebe B. Rychly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5081-5085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our results show that β1 integrins mediate US-induced BrdU incorporation, indicating that integrin receptors on skin fibroblasts serve as mechanotransducers for acoustic pulsed energy. It has become apparent that the EGFR participates in signaling networks activated by multiple extracellular stimuli such as adhesion, lymphokines, or stress signals in the absence of EGFR ligands (44Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). Direct mechanical stimulation of cells by cyclic stretching induces ERK1/2 activation via transactivation of the EGFR (45Iwasaki H. Eguchi S. Ueno H. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H521-H529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Correa-Meyer E. Pesce L. Guerrero C. Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 82: L883-L891Google Scholar). Our data show that acoustic pulsed energy, which employs integrins as mechanotransducer in skin fibroblasts, activates ERK pathway without participation of EGFR activity. The tyrosine kinase Src and PI 3-kinase/Akt have been shown to play a role in integrin-stimulated signaling (36Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 37Armulik A. Velling T. Johansson S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2558-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that acoustic pulsed energy triggers Src activation, which in turn regulates the activation of the ERK signaling pathway in primary skin fibroblasts. In contrast, PI 3-kinase/Akt is not involved in US-induced intracellular signaling. In conclusion, this report establishes that acoustic pulsed energy induces proliferation of primary skin fibroblasts and provides a molecular basis for the clinical observation that ultrasound treatment of wounds can promote tissue repair. In addition, we delineate the complex network of signaling pathways that is triggered by acoustic pulsed energy in primary fibroblasts, demonstrating that US-induced proliferation involves the activation of β1 integrins and RhoA/ROCK- and Src-ERK signaling cascade. However, integrin activation and cell proliferation in response to acoustic pulsed energy does not involve transactivation of the EGFR, demonstrating that this type of mechanical stimulus triggers a specific signaling platform.

https://openalex.org/W2156864264,"Histones and transcription factors are regulated by a number of post-translational modifications that in turn regulate the transcriptional activity of genes. These modifications occur in large, multisubunit complexes. We have reported previously that mSin3A can recruit <i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) along with histone deacetylase into such a corepressor complex. This physical association allows OGT to act cooperatively with histone deacetylation in gene repression by catalyzing the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modification on specific transcription factors to inhibit their activity. For rapid, reversible gene regulation, the enzymes responsible for the converse reactions must be present. Here, we report that <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase, which is responsible for the removal of <i>O</i>-GlcNAc additions on nuclear and cytosolic proteins, possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity <i>in vitro</i>. Free as well as reconstituted nucleosomal histones are substrates of this bifunctional enzyme. This protein, now termed NCOAT (nuclear cytoplasmic <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase and acetyltransferase) has a typical HAT domain that has both active and inactive states. This finding demonstrates that NCOAT may be regulated to reduce the state of glycosylation of transcriptional activators while increasing the acetylation of histones to allow for the concerted activation of eukaryotic gene transcription."

Recently, a new family of protein kinases has been identified, with prototypical members being mammalian eEF-2 kinase and Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinases, which display no homology to conventional eukaryotic protein kinases (1Futey L.M.

We identified and cloned several other mammalian putative protein kinases with the catalytic domains homologous to that of eEF-2 kinase (4Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr.

This novel family of protein kinases was named α-kinases, since the existing evidence suggested that these kinases phosphorylate their substrates within α-helices (4Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas conventional protein kinases phosphorylate their substrates within β-turns, loops, or irregular structures (7Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Sequencing of various genomes revealed the presence of α-kinases in diverse organisms including animals, protists, and fungi (8Drennan D. Ryazanov A.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

However, the exact physiological function of the kinase domain of TRPM7/ChaK1 is not known and endogenous substrates of this kinase had not been determined yet.

The N-terminal region plays a crucial role in interaction of annexin 1 with other proteins and membranes. Therefore, phosphorylation of annexin 1 by TRPM7 kinase may modulate function of annexin 1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Radioisotopes were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Expression and purification of recombinant ChaK1 kinase domain was performed as described (20Ryazanova L.V. Dorovkov M.V. Ansari A. Ryazanov A.G. J.

Human recombinant annexin II was a kind gift of Dr. Valery Alakhov (Supratek Pharma, Inc.).Fractionation of Cell Lysates and Analysis of Fractions for Phosphorylated Proteins—Mouse C2C12 cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 800 μl/L β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol (w/v), complete protease inhibitor (Roche), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared twice by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate (containing 20 mg of total protein) was then fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using 20–500 mm NaCl gradient. 40 fractions were collected (1 ml each). 10 μl of each fraction were incubated with [γ-33P]ATP in phosphorylation mixture (as described below) with or without the addition of recombinant ChaK1.Protein Phosphorylation Assay—Protein samples were incubated in phosphorylation mixture consisting of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (unless stated otherwise), 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol) with 0.1 μg of purified recombinant ChaK1. In assays involving annexin 0.5 μg of annexin was used. The reactions were run at 30 °C for 5 min and were terminated by incubation in an ice/water bath and addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Preparation of Samples for MALDI-TOF Analysis—Coomassiestained polypeptide was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and digested with trypsin as described (24Jimenez C.R. Huang L. Qiu Y. Burlingame A.L. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 16.3.1-16.3.6Google Scholar). The samples were prepared according to manufacturers protocol (Applied Biosystems). The samples were analyzed using mass spectrometer Voyager-DE PRO Workstation (Applied Biosystems) in reflector mode. The obtained monoisotopic peptide masses were run against NCBI and Swiss-Prot data bases using MS-Fit (Protein Prospector) and PetIdent programs.Expression and Purification of Annexin 1—Human annexin 1 was expressed as a fusion with maltose-binding protein in Escherichia coli. A DNA fragment corresponding to annexin 1 was produced by PCR using HeLa marathon ready cDNA library (Clontech) and the following primers: GCGGATCCATGGCAATGGTATCAGAATTCCTCAAG (containing BamHI restriction site) and GCTCTAGATTAGTTTCCTCCACAAAGAGCCACC (containing XbaI restriction site).The PCR fragment was inserted into a pMAL-c2x vector (New England Biolabs) using BamHI and XbaI restriction sites to produce the pMcAn1–4 expression construct. Expression and purification of annexin 1 was performed as described for the ChaK1-cat (long form) (20Ryazanova L.V. Dorovkov M.V. Ansari A. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3708-3716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein was cleaved with 2 μg/ml of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) for 24 h at room temperature to remove maltose-binding protein tag from annexin 1. After cleavage, annexin 1 contained 6 additional amino acids on its N terminus (Ile-Ser-Glu-Phe-Gly-Ser).Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphorylation of annexin 1 was performed as described above. Sample preparation was performed as described (20Ryazanova L.V. Dorovkov M.V. Ansari A. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3708-3716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on TLC plates 10 × 10 cm (cellulose on glass, Merck). First dimension was performed in pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer containing 0.58 m formic acid and 1.36 m acetic acid at 1000 V for 20 min and second dimension in pH 3.5 electrophoresis buffer containing 0.87 m acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine, and 0.5 mm EDTA at 1000 V for 8 min. The TLC plates were stained with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Phosphopeptide Mapping—Phosphorylated protein was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was digested with trypsin as described (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). The obtained peptides were resolved by two-dimensional separation on TLC plates (Merck). In the first dimension peptides were separated by electrophoresis for 7 min at 1 kV in pH 1.9 buffer containing 0.58 m formic acid and 1.36 m acetic acid and in second dimension by ascending chromatography with n-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/H2O, 75:50: 15:60 (v/v). The phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography.Digestion of Annexin 1 with Trypsin and Cathepsin D—Phosphorylated protein was incubated with different amounts of sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 60 μg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Samples were diluted with Laemmli sample buffer and boiled. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Phosphorylated proteins were digested with 2 μg of cathepsin D (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 4.5) (50 μl of total reaction volume) for 30 min at 37 °C. As a control the same reactions were curried out in the presence of 2 μm of pepstatin A (Sigma). The reactions were stopped by boiling the samples in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of Mutant Proteins—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in accordance with manufacturer's protocol using the pMcAn1–4 expression construct as a template. The wild type and mutant annexin 1 were expressed and purified as described above.RESULTSRecently we expressed TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase domain (ChaK1) in bacteria and analyzed in detail the activity of purified kinase (20Ryazanova L.V. Dorovkov M.V. Ansari A. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3708-3716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To identify substrates for TRPM7/ChaK1 we used cell lysate fractionation, phosphorylation with purified recombinant ChaK1, and subsequent peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. By analysis with antibodies against TRPM7/ChaK1 of various cell lines we found the highest level of TRPM7/ChaK1 in C2C12 mouse myoblasts (data not shown). C2C12 cell lysate was fractionated by chromatography on Mono Q column using 20–500 mm NaCl gradient. A sample from each fraction was incubated with [γ-33P]ATP in phosphorylation mixture with or without addition of purified recombinant ChaK1. Fraction number 2 contained a polypeptide with the molecular mass of ∼37 kDa that was intensively phosphorylated by ChaK1 (Fig. 1A).The Coomassie-stained 37-kDa polypeptide was excised from the gel and subjected to digestion with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The obtained masses of tryptic peptides were scanned against NCBI and Swiss-Prot protein data bases using MS-Fit (Protein Prospector) and PeptIdent programs. The set of peptide masses matched to annexin 1. To confirm that phosphorylated protein of 37 kDa was annexin 1, we analyzed whether recombinant human annexin 1 and purified bovine annexin 1 can be phosphorylated by ChaK1. Indeed, we found that both recombinant human annexin 1 and bovine annexin 1 were phosphorylated by ChaK1 (Fig. 1A).Next, we analyzed time dependence of annexin 1 phosphorylation by ChaK1 (Fig. 1B) and performed phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated annexin 1 (Fig. 1C). We found that ChaK1 phosphorylates annexin 1 exclusively on serine residues. Since annexin 1 is a Ca2+-regulated protein, we analyzed the effect of Ca2+ on phosphorylation of annexin 1 by ChaK1. We found that Ca2+ significantly stimulated phosphorylation of annexin 1, while addition of 2 mm EGTA reduced this phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). We also examined whether other members of the annexin family, annexin II and annexin V, can be phosphorylated by ChaK1. No phosphorylation was detected (data not shown) indicating that phosphorylation activity of ChaK1 is specific for annexin 1.We further investigated phosphorylation of annexin 1 in crude lysates obtained from cells overexpressing TRPM7/ChaK1. We used HEK293 cell line, in which TRPM7/ChaK1 expression can be induced by addition of tetracycline (11Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). We found that phosphorylation of annexin 1 was greatly increased in lysates obtained from cells overexpressing TRPM7/ChaK1 (Fig. 1E). This indicates that annexin 1 can be phosphorylated by native full-length TRPM7/ChaK1. We also observed intensively phosphorylated 210-kDa band in cell extracts overexpressing TRPM7/ChaK1 (see Fig. 1E, lanes 2 and 4). This band most likely represents autophosphorylated TRPM7/ChaK1.Next, we determined the site of annexin 1 phosphorylation by ChaK1. First, annexin 1 was phosphorylated by ChaK1 and subjected to complete trypsin digestion, with subsequent two-dimensional separation of phosphopeptides on TLC plates. We detected one major phosphopeptide indicating that annexin 1 contains one major site of phosphorylation for ChaK1 (data not shown).To locate the site of phosphorylation within annexin 1, partial proteolysis of phosphorylated annexin 1 was performed using different concentrations of trypsin. Annexin 1 contains a dense core and a flexible N-terminal region, which could be removed by partial proteolysis. The partial proteolysis produced a band of ∼33 kDa that did not retain radioactive label (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the site of phosphorylation is located within the N-terminal region of annexin 1. The region of annexin 1, which could be cleaved off by trypsin, contains 7 serine residues that could possibly be phosphorylated by ChaK1 (Fig. 2B). Four mutants (one protein with single mutation and three proteins with two mutations) in which Ala was substituted for Ser were produced using QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutants were produced: (i) S5A, (ii) S27A,S28A, (iii) S34A,S37A, and (iv) S45A,S46A. The wild type and mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria, affinity-purified, and analyzed for phosphorylation with ChaK1. We found that S5A substitution dramatically reduced phosphorylation of annexin 1 by ChaK1, while intensity of phosphorylation of other mutants were similar to wild type protein (Fig. 2C), suggesting that ChaK1 phosphorylates annexin 1 at Ser5. To confirm the location of phosphorylated residue in annexin 1, phosphorylated annexin 1 was digested with cathepsin D, which has been shown to cleave annexin 1 specifically at Trp12 producing a band with molecular mass of ∼35.5 kDa (26Ando Y. Imamura S. Hong Y.M. Owada M.K. Kakunaga T. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6948-6955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang W. Creutz C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this digestion experiment we used human recombinant annexin 1 as well as purified bovine annexin 1. Treatment of phosphorylated human recombinant or bovine annexin 1 with cathepsin D produced a 35.5-kDa band, which lost virtually all radioactive label (Fig. 2D). As a control, to account for possible phosphatase activity in the reaction, the treatment of annexin 1 with cathepsin D was carried out in the presence of pepstatin A (an inhibitor of cathepsin D). In the presence of pepstatin A, annexin 1 was not cleaved and remained radioactively labeled (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we found that ChaK1 phosphorylates annexin 1 specifically at Ser5. This serine residue is evolutionarily conserved and present in all mammalian and avian species (Fig. 3A). Ser5 is located within the N-terminal α-helix, which specifically interacts with S100A11 protein (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2Identification of site of phosphorylation in annexin 1.

Phosphorylation occurs specifically at Ser5, which is evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 3A). According to x-ray and NMR analysis Ser5 is located within the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix of annexin 1 (28Rety S. Osterloh D. Arie J.P. Tabaries S. Seeman J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Lewit-Bentley A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Yoon M.K. Park S.H. Won H.S. Na D.S. Lee B.J.

This result is consistent with the hypothesis that TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase like other α-kinases can recognize and phosphorylate amino acids located within α-helices.Annexin 1 is a member of annexin family of Ca2+-regulated phospholipid-binding proteins (reviewed in Refs. 21Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar and 22Rescher U. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of annexin 1 has been solved (30Rosengarth A. Gerke V. Luecke H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Rosengarth A. Luecke H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and was found to consist of a Ca2+ and membrane-binding compact core and N-terminal domain of 41 residues preceding the core. The N-terminal domain can interact with other proteins and also regulate membrane binding properties of annexin 1. From the x-ray studies of annexin 1, it was found that, in the absence of calcium, its N-terminal domain is buried within the core domain of the protein but gets expelled from the core upon Ca2+ binding (31Rosengarth A. Luecke H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).A number of protein kinases were shown to phosphorylate annexin 1: annexin 1 is phosphorylated within the N-terminal domain by epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase at Tyr21 and by protein kinase C at Thr24, Ser27, Ser28, and Thr41 and in the core domain by PKA at Thr216 (reviewed in Ref. 32Rothhut B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was shown that some of these phosphorylations could modulate functional properties of annexin 1 (reviewed in Ref. 32Rothhut B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser5 by any protein kinase has not been previously reported and it is likely to be specific for TRPM7/ChaK1 protein kinase. In contrast to the sites in annexin 1 that are phosphorylated by other protein kinases, Ser5 is absolutely conserved in mammalian and avian annexin 1 (see Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in vivo evidence was provided suggesting that annexin 1 is phosphorylated at Ser5 in bovine chromaffin cells upon stimulation with nicotine (27Wang W. Creutz C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is tempting to suggest that TRPM7 kinase is responsible for this phosphorylation.Annexin 1 was originally discovered as a mediator of the actions of glucocorticoids and was also shown to play a pleiotropic role in processes such as proliferation and inflammation (reviewed in Ref. 21Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (23Arur S. Uche U.E. Rezaul K. Fong M. Scranton V. Cowan A.E. Mohler W. Han D.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of annexin 1 plays a particularly important role by mediating the interaction of annexin 1 with other proteins and membranes.Annexin 1 can specifically interact with its intracellular target, S100A11, another Ca2+-binding protein (34Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structure and NMR spectroscopy analysis of S100A11 show that, upon calcium binding, S100A11 exposes a hydrophobic surface, which can interact with the N-terminal α-helix of annexin 1 (28Rety S. Osterloh D. Arie J.P. Tabaries S. Seeman J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Lewit-Bentley A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Dempsey A.C. Walsh M.P. Shaw G.S. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 887-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By solving the crystal structure of the complex of S100A11 and the N-terminal peptide of annexin 1, it was found that Ser5 of annexin 1 forms a hydrogen bond with Glu9 of S100A11 (28Rety S. Osterloh D. Arie J.P. Tabaries S. Seeman J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Lewit-Bentley A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the cell annexin 1 exists as a protein modified by cleavage of the N-terminal methionine and subsequent N-acetylation. This acetylation of annexin 1 can be important for the stability of the N-terminal α-helix and annexin 1 lacking N-acetylation fails to bind to S100"

The integrin superfamily contains up to five collagen receptors, but we have determined that α1β1 is the primary receptor utilized by both fetal and adult β-cells. Cultured β-cells adhered to and migrated on collagen type IV (Col-IV), and these responses were mediated almost exclusively by α1β1. The migration of cultured β-cells to Col-IV significantly exceeded that to other matrix components suggesting that this substrate is of unique importance for β-cell motility. The interaction of α1β1 with Col-IV also resulted in significant insulin secretion at basal glucose concentrations. A subset of β-cells in developing islets was confirmed to express α1β1, and this expression co-localized with Col-IV in the basal membranes of juxtaposed endothelial cells. Our findings indicate that α1β1 and Col-IV contribute to β-cell functions known to be important for islet morphogenesis and glucose homeostasis.

Collagens are ubiquitous structural proteins responsible for maintaining the mechanical resilience of multicellular organisms (1Hulmes D.J. Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). To date more than 20 genetically distinct collagen types have been described (1Hulmes D.J. Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bosman F.T. Stamenkovic I. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Collagens not only provide structural support but also serve as signaling molecules that control a myriad of cellular responses from migration and morphogenesis to proliferation and differentiation (3Vogel W.F. Eur. J. Dermatol. 2001; 11: 506-514PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ortega N. Werb Z. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4201-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 5Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Communication between collagens and cells is achieved through the intermediary of receptors that include members of the integrin superfamily and discoidin domain receptors (3Vogel W.F. Eur. J. Dermatol. 2001; 11: 506-514PubMed Google Scholar, 5Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The integrin superfamily currently contains 24 integrin heterodimers, 5 of which function as collagen receptors (5Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These collagen receptors consist of the β1 integrin subunit paired with α1, α2, α3, α10, or α11 (6White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Four of these integrins, namely α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1, comprise a distinct subgroup by virtue of sharing an extra “inserted” domain, which serves as the main collagen-binding region (αI domain) (6White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 7Gullberg D.E. Lundgren-Akerlund E. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 37: 3-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite structural similarities, these integrins all differ in their individual collagen subtype specificities, and variations in their cytoplasmic domains suggest distinct signaling functions (6White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Tulla M. Pentikainen O.T. Viitasalo T. Kapyla J. Impola U. Nykvist P.

Adding to such complexity, all four of these collagen receptors have different patterns of expression in vivo (5Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although integrin α3β1 is described as a collagen receptor it does not have an αI domain and may only play an accessory role in collagen recognition (9DiPersio C.M. Shah S. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have described the distribution of common collagen subtypes in the human pancreas (10Kadono G. Ishihara T. Yamaguchi T.

The expression of α10β1 and α11β1 in human pancreas remains to be determined; however, existing studies suggest that these integrins are primarily involved in the metabolism or formation of bone and cartilage (6White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Prior reports suggest that collagens can have a significant impact on β-cell development and function. Several studies have shown that hydrogels composed of Col-I can promote β-cell proliferation (18Metrakos P. Yuan S. Qi S.J. Duguid W.P. Rosenberg L. Transplant Proc. 1994; 26: 3349-3350PubMed Google Scholar) or maintain long term islet viability and insulin secretion (19Nagata N. Gu Y. Hori H. Balamurugan A.N. Touma M. Kawakami Y. Wang W.

Such responses may ultimately depend on the pliant three-dimensional environment of collagen gels because a more recent study has shown that monolayer culture on Col-I results in a loss of insulin secretion (23Edamura K. Nasu K. Iwami Y. Ogawa H. Sasaki N. Ohgawara H. Cell Transplant. 2003; 12: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gels composed of rat Col-I have also been reported to promote the transdifferentiation of islets into ductal cysts (24Yuan S. Paraskevas S. Duguid W.P. Rosenberg L. Transplant Proc. 1995; 6: 3364Google Scholar, 25Yuan S. Rosenberg L. Paraskevas S. Agapitos D. Duguid W.P. Differentiation. 1996; 61: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Kerr-Conte J.

Despite these studies little is known about collagen receptor utilization by β-cells, and the functional outcome of ligating individual receptors remains to be determined. Studies indicate that Col-IV, the main structural component of BMs, is a major peri-insular matrix component, yet the functional significance of β-cell-Col-IV interaction remains to be determined. In this study we assess the impact of Col-IV and individual collagen receptors on human β-cell functions including adhesion, motility, and insulin secretion. Our findings indicate that α1β1 is the primary collagen receptor utilized by cultured β-cells and demonstrate that an interaction between this integrin and Col-IV is uniquely important for β-cell motility. Based on the observation that α1β1 ligation potentiates insulin secretion, it is proposed that this collagen receptor may also contribute to glucose homeostasis. Immunohistochemical studies indicate that restricted α1β1 expression and Col-IV availability will serve to regulate the activity of these molecules in developing islets. Reagents—Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to human integrin subunits α1 (MAB1973Z), α2 (MAB1950Z), and α3 (MAB1952Z) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). A polyclonal antibody (pAb) to human Col-IV (AB748) was also from Chemicon. A mAb to human insulin (2D11-H5) and a goat pAb to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) (C-20) were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Guinea pig pAb to insulin (A0564) was from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA). Secondary donkey anti-guinea pig, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, biotin, or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Streptavidin conjugated to R-phycoerythrin (PE) and all normal animal sera were also from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Mouse PE- or FITC-conjugated mAbs to human integrin α1 (SR84), α2 (12F1-H6), and fluor-conjugated isotype controls were obtained from Pharmingen. Purified human vitronectin (Vn) and fibronectin (Fn) were from Chemicon. Mouse Col-IV and ultrapure (entactin-free) laminin-1 (Lm-1) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Rat-tail collagen type-I (Col-I) was from Upstate Cell Signaling (Lake Placid, NY). Fibronectin α and plasminogen-free fibrinogen (Fbg) was from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH). Matrigel™ (reconstituted BM) was from BD Biosciences. Tissue Procurement, Processing, and Cell Culture—Institutional approval was obtained for the use of fetal and adult human pancreata. Human adult cadaveric pancreata (ages 45–72 years) were obtained via the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Human Islet Distribution Program, and human fetal pancreata (12–24 weeks gestational age) were provided by Advanced BioResources (Alameda, CA). Fetal islet-like cell cluster (ICCs) were generated by mincing pancreata with scissors and digesting them with collagenase (2.5 mg/ml Hanks' balanced salt solution; collagenase-P, Sigma) essentially as described (27Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Resulting cell clusters were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% normal human serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). These cells were subsequently incubated overnight on non-tissue culture-treated plastic to allow the formation of ICCs (28Beattie G.M. Levine F. Mally M.I. Otonkoski T. O'Brien J.S. Salomon D.R. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1232-1240PubMed Google Scholar). ICCs derived from individual pancreata (∼100–200) were seeded into Petri dishes (140 mm, Nalge Nunc) coated with a HTB-9 matrix as described (27Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These cells were then cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (Genentech, San Francisco, CA). Cells were expanded for 3–4 days prior to use and were confirmed to contain 85–90% pancreatic epithelial cells (PEC) and 1–2% insulin-positive β-cells. Human adult islet preparations were isolated in-house using a modified semiautomated method essentially as described (29Ricordi C. Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Olack B.J. Scharp D.W. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 413-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Islet clusters were subsequently expanded on HTB-9 matrix for 4–5 days as described for fetal ICC preparations. These cells typically contained 30–50% insulin-positive β-cells and 50–60% PEC. Migration Assays—Migration was assessed using 6-well Transwell migration plates from Costar essentially as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The underside of the insert membranes (8.0 μm pore size) were coated with 75 nm Col-I, Col-IV, Fn, Fbg, Lm-1, or Vn for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Adult or fetal pancreatic cells expanded on HTB-9 matrix (70–80% confluence) were harvested with 0.025% trypsin/Versene and were resuspended in fibroblast basal media (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 0.4 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.4). The cells were then added to migration plates at 5 × 105 cells per insert. Directed migration from the upper to lower chamber of the transwell was determined after 8 h. The contribution of integrins to migration to Col-IV was assessed using function-blocking antibodies as specified in the text. The cells were pretreated with the antibodies (40 μg/ml) for 20 min prior to the addition of both cells and antibodies to migration plates. Migrant β-cells on the underside of the membrane inserts were detected by staining for insulin as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The top side of the membrane inserts was swabbed extensively to remove cells that failed to migrate, and the entire underside of the insert was then scanned and counted for insulin-positive cells using a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a 10× objective. Migrant pancreatic epithelial cells (PEC) on the underside of the inserts were identified and counted after staining with 1% toluidine blue as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PEC were counted per 20× field, and a minimum of 8 fields were scored per membrane. Percent β-cell migration was calculated based on the number of β-cells migrating ÷ total β-cells added ×100 as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion Assays—The adhesion of β-cells to extracellular matrix components was assessed as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Adult and fetal pancreatic cell monolayers, expanded on HTB-9 matrix (70–80% confluence), were harvested with a 0.025% trypsin/Versene solution. Single cell populations were then added to non-tissue culture-treated 96-well high binding enzyme immunoassay plates (Costar, Corning, NY) coated with equimolar amounts of Col-I, Col-IV, Fn, Fbg, Lm-1, or Vn (75 nm) for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Wells were blocked with 5% BSA for 45 min prior to use. Control wells received BSA alone. Fetal or adult cells were added at 5 × 104 and 1 × 104 cells/well, respectively, in serum-free fibroblast basal media supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 0.4 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.4). Cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 90 min, and at the end of the assay the wells were carefully washed, and non-adherent cells were removed under a constant vacuum. Remaining adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The contribution of integrins to cell adhesion on Col-IV was assessed using function-blocking antibodies as specified in the text. The cells were pretreated with the antibodies (40 μg/ml) for 20 min prior to the addition of both cells and antibodies to precoated wells. Adherent β-cells were visualized by staining for insulin as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Insulin-positive cells per field were counted using a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a 20× objective and an ocular grid. Treatments were performed in triplicate, and the entire well surface area was counted for β-cells. Percent β-cell adhesion was calculated based on the number of β-cells adhering ÷ total β-cells added × 100 as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Analysis of Insulin Release—Fetal pancreatic cells expanded on HTB-9 matrix for 4 days were harvested, and single cell preparations were added to non-tissue culture-treated 96-well high binding enzyme immunoassay plates (Costar, Corning, NY) previously coated with 75 nm Col-IV, Fn, Lm-1, or poly-d-lysine at 5 μg/ml. Cells were added at 5 × 104 cells/well in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm glucose (Sigma), 0.5% BSA, and 0.4 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.4). Culture supernatants were collected 1.5, 5, and 12 h after adhesion. Culture supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove cells and debris and then assayed for insulin using a Mercodia insulin ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ALPCO, Windham, NH). The contribution of α2β1 or α1β1 to insulin secretion following adhesion to Col-IV or poly-d-lysine was assessed using mAbs to α2 or α1 (MAB1973Z and MAB1950Z, Chemicon). The cells were pretreated with the mAbs (40 μg/ml) for 20 min prior to the addition of both cells and antibodies to coated wells. Culture supernatants were harvested after 1.5 h. Immunofluorescence Staining and Flow Cytometry—Double immunofluorescence staining was performed on fetal pancreatic cells grown on HTB-9 matrix or Matrigel™ for 4 days or on freshly isolated pancreatic cells (22–28 h postpancreatectomy). Cells were cultured on HTB-9 matrix as described (27Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or were cultured under identical conditions on 6-well plates precoated with Matrigel™ at 78 μg/ml according to the manufacturer's recommendations (BD Biosciences). Further cells were maintained in suspension for 4 days as ICCs without seeding onto HTB-9 matrix or Matrigel™. Cell monolayers on HTB-9 matrix or Matrigel™ were harvested with a 0.025% trypsin/Versene solution (1:5000, Invitrogen) as described (30Kaido T. Perez B. Yebra M. Hill J. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17731-17737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated cells were generated from minced pancreata digested with collagenase-P (Sigma) at 2.5 mg/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Digestion was performed three times for 10 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Large cell clumps were removed using a 70-mm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). Single cell populations from the different treatments were incubated for 45 min on ice with anti-α1 or -α2 mAbs (MAB1973Z and MAB1950Z, Chemicon) at 1 μg/106 cells in PBS containing 0.02% NaN3 and 0.1% BSA. These cells were subsequently fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated in a blocking buffer (2% normal donkey serum, 1% BSA in PBS) for 30 min prior to incubation with guinea pig anti-insulin pAb (A0564 at 1:40, DakoCytomation) for 45 min. After washing the cells were incubated for 45 min with a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig-Ig antibody (Jackson) and a PE-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig antibody (Jackson). Cells were photographed using an inverted Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope and a 20× or 40× objective. Single and double staining cells were counted in order to determine the percentage of insulin-positive cells expressing either α2β1 or α1β1. Two-color flow cytometric (FACS) analysis was performed on fetal pancreatic cell monolayers grown on HTB-9 matrix for 4 days. Cells were stained as described above except they were incubated with directly labeled PE-conjugated mAbs to α1 (SR84) or α2 (12F1-H6) or with fluor-conjugated isotype controls (Pharmingen). FACS was performed using a FACscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Staining of Tissue Sections—Fetal pancreata (12 to 24 weeks) were snap-frozen immediately upon receipt (22–28 h postpancreatectomy). Cryostat sections (10 μm thick) were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 30 s and were then blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA, 2% normal donkey serum, 50 mm glycine, and 1% cold water fish gelatin (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, sections were incubated for 1–2 h with a combination of three different primary antibodies. Some sections were stained with a guinea pig pAb to insulin (1:40) (A0564, DakoCytomation), a goat pAb to PECAM (1:200) (C-20, Santa Cruz), and a mouse mAb to either the α1 integrin subunit (5 μg/ml) (MAB1973Z, Chemicon) or the α2 integrin subunit (5 μg/ml) (MAB1950Z, Chemicon). Other sections were stained similarly except that they were incubated with a rabbit pAb to Col-IV (1:100) (AB748, Chemicon) in lieu of the pAb to PECAM. Adjacent serial sections were incubated with control antibodies including isotype-matched mouse IgG1 (5 μg/ml) (PP100, Chemicon), normal guinea pig IgG, and normal goat or rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with F(ab′) fragments of Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig Ig, FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat or anti-rabbit Ig, and biotin-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig (all at 1:250) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Binding of biotin-labeled antibodies to tissue was visualized by further incubating sections for 10 min in PE-conjugated avidin (1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing sections were examined and photographed using an inverted Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope. Type IV Collagen Is a Unique Substrate for the Migration of Cultured β-Cells—Provisional matrix components (Vn and Fbg) and primary constituents of the extracellular matrix (Fn, Col-IV, Lm-1, Col-1) were assessed for their ability to support fetal and adult β-cell migration. Transwell migration inserts were precoated with equimolar concentrations of the individual matrix components (75 nm), and the migration of β-cells previously cultured on HTB-9 matrix was assessed after 8 h. In a direct comparison, fetal β-cell migration to Col-IV was 8–10-fold greater than migration observed to the other substrates tested including Vn, Lm-1, Fbg, and Fn (Fig. 1A). Intermediate, but variable, migration to Col-I was observed (Fig. 1A). Adult β-cells also displayed preferential migration to Col-IV (Fig. 1B). Despite this preference, adult β-cells were significantly less motile to Col-IV than their fetal counterparts. Thus, the percentage of adult β-cells migrating to Col-IV was only 2–3% compared with 40–50% by fetal β-cells (Fig. 1C). Adhesion assays were performed to determine if enhanced β-cell migration to Col-IV is a result of preferential attachment to this substrate. Adult and fetal β-cells attached equally to Col-IV, Col-I, Vn, and Fn (Fig. 1, D and E). Enhanced migration to Col-IV relative to these substrates must, therefore, depend on a mechanism other than initial attachment. Lm-1 and Fbg were relatively poor substrates for β-cell adhesion (Fig. 1, D and E), and this could account for reduced motility to these constituents. Adult and fetal β-cells attached equally well to Col-IV (Fig. 1F). The marked discrepancy in Col-IV migration observed between adult and fetal β-cells (Fig. 1C) cannot, therefore, be attributed to a failure of adult β-cell attachment. Together these data demonstrate that Col-IV is a uniquely important substrate for fetal β-cell motility and suggest that there is maturational loss of adult β-cell motility to Col-IV and other substrates. It is important to note that the predilection of β-cells for Col-IV is an attribute of the cells rather than a function of the assay. Using the same Transwell migration assay, other cell types have been shown to preferentially migrate to alternative substrates such as Fn or Lm (31Rooprai H.K. Liyanage K. Robinson S.F.

Integrin α1β1 Is Responsible for Enhanced β-Cell Migration to Col-IV—The receptor responsible for β-cell adhesion and migration to Col-IV was determined using function-blocking antibodies to known collagen receptors (i.e. α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1). Antibodies to the α1 or the β1 integrin subunit markedly reduced β-cell adhesion and migration to Col-IV (Fig. 2, A–D). In contrast, antibodies to α2β1 or α3β1 were either ineffective"

Global fitting of sedimentation equilibrium data under native solution conditions (without GdnHCl or TCEP) demonstrate that both the apo- and metal-bound forms of SOD1 are stable dimers. Sedimentation velocity experiments show that apo-SOD1 dimers dissociate cooperatively over the range 0.5-1.0 m GdnHCl. In contrast, metal-bound SOD1 dimers possess a more compact shape and dissociate at significantly higher GdnHCl concentrations (2.0-3.0 m).

Cellular superoxide concentrations must be regulated carefully, because excess levels can inactivate enzymes containing iron-sulfur clusters and can lead to the formation of other highly oxidizing species that are damaging to other cellular constituents (4Valentine J.S.

The prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes demonstrate significant sequence similarity, and both are characterized by the Greek key β-barrel fold. Many bacterial SOD1 proteins, such as that from Photobacterium leiognathi, are also dimeric, although they often possess distinct dimer interfaces and have incorporated different strategies for the electrostatic recognition of the negatively charged superoxide substrate (12Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Bordo D. Matak D. Djinovic-Carugo K.

In contrast, the SOD1 protein from Escherichia coli is monomeric (13Pesce A. Capasso C. Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Rotilio G. Desideri A. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 408-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Battistoni A. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and possesses catalytic activity and heat stability comparable to the dimeric eukaryotic SOD1 proteins (17Battistoni A.

J. 1996; 320: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The existence of both monomeric and dimeric Greek key β-barrel SOD1 proteins led to the suggestion that the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes diverged from one ancient monomeric ancestor and then subsequently converged to their distinct dimeric enzymes (12Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In terms of those SOD1 proteins that are dimers, the dimeric architecture appears necessary to maintain catalytic efficiency through the proper positioning of charged residues that guide the negatively charged superoxide substrate into the active site channel (12Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Ferraroni M. Rypniewski W.

J. 1994; 23: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by the fact that an engineered monomeric human SOD1 protein created by site-directed mutagenesis of interface residues possesses disorder in the regions responsible for electrostatic guidance resulting in a substantial decrease in catalytic activity (20Banci L. Bertini I. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The dimeric architecture of eukaryotic SOD1 proteins could also arise from the need for these enzymes to acquire reactive copper from the copper chaperone for SOD1 (21Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The copper chaperone for SOD1 contains an SOD1-like domain (domain 2) that facilitates recognition of its target, presumably through the formation of a copper chaperone-SOD1 complex (22Hall L.T. Sanchez R.J. Holloway S.P. Zhu H. Stine J.E. Lyons T.J. Demeler B. Schirf V. Hansen J.C. Nersissian A.M. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J.

Recently, there has been intense renewed interest in the physical properties of the human enzyme because of its linkage to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, motor neuron disease, Lou Gehrig's disease) (24Deng H.X.

Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. A subset of inherited ALS (familial ALS, FALS) cases are caused by dominantly inherited mutations in SOD1. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that the pathogenic mutations lead to aggregation of SOD1 proteins and that this propensity for self-association is somehow toxic to motor neurons (reviewed in Refs. 26Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar and 27Hart P.J. Valentine J.S. Sessler J.L. Doctrow S.R. McMurray T.S. Lippard S.J. Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry. ACS Books, Washington, D. C.2004Google Scholar). Indeed, high molecular weight, insoluble protein complexes containing FALS SOD1 are observed in spinal cord neurons of ALS patients, and in transgenic mice expressing these mutant proteins (28Shibata N.

Nevertheless, the detailed composition of the FALS SOD1-containing aggregates formed in vivo is currently unknown, and it is possible that the aggregating species is a monomeric form of pathogenic SOD1, particularly because many of the FALS mutations fall directly at the dimer interface, at the intrasubunit disulfide bond, and in regions that affect metal binding. Thus, defining the molecular mechanisms and determinants that control dissociation of wild type and pathogenic human SOD1 dimers is of keen interest. A wide range of studies have demonstrated qualitatively that both metal binding and the presence of an intact intrasubunit disulfide bond are contributors to the stability to the SOD1 homodimer (31Fridovich I.

However, a rigorous quantitative analysis of the interrelationships between the molecular determinants of SOD1 dimer stability has yet to be described. In this report we demonstrate using analytical ultracentrifugation that both the apo- and metal-bound forms of SOD1 fall into the class of stable protein dimers that do not dissociate by mass action at the very low concentrations used in a sedimentation equilibrium experiment. Sedimentation velocity experiments in the presence of chaotrope or reductant allow characterization of the additional stability imparted by metal binding and the intrasubunit disulfide bond. The solution results have been combined with crystallographic data to provide a molecular explanation for the existence of different SOD1 macromolecular shapes and multiple SOD1 dimeric species with different stabilities. Materials–Monobasic and dibasic potassium phosphate, acetonitrile (Optima grade), formic acid, sodium chloride, glacial acetic acid, ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride, sodium hydroxide, yeast extract, peptone, dextrose (glucose), and sodium acetate were obtained from Fischer Scientific. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl) was purchased from Hampton Research. Ammonium sulfate and Tris base were purchased from U.S. Biologicals. EDTA was acquired from Mallinckrodt. Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Agarose was obtained from Sigma. Pfu DNA polymerase and deoxynucleotides came from Stratagene. Glass beads were purchased from Biospec. All solutions unless otherwise noted in the text were prepared using de-ionized water passed through a Millipore ultrapurification system.

Site-directed mutagenesis of human wild type SOD1 was performed similarly to previously published methods (50Hough M.A. Grossmann J.G. Antonyuk S.V. Strange R.W. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A.

SOD1 proteins were expressed in the EGy118 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks the endogenous yeast sod1 gene (52Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S.

SOD1 proteins expressed in this system are N-acetylated and have high metal content. After growth on selective medium, cells were cultured in ∼30 liters of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) at 30 °C for 36 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in three volumes of chilled lysis buffer (200 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl), and lysed using a blender with 0.5-mm glass beads. Because SOD1 loses its metal ions at low pH in the presence of chelators (6Valentine J.S. Pantoliano M.W. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology. 3. Wiley, New York1981: 291-358Google Scholar, 53Carrico R.J. Deutsch H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 723-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the lysate was maintained at pH 7.0 during the lysis procedure by adjusting with 1 m sodium hydroxide when necessary. The lysate was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was slowly brought to 60% ammonium sulfate saturation while stirring on ice. The mixture was stirred on ice for an additional 30 min and then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (∼800 ml) was filtered through glass wool and applied to ∼200 ml of fast flow phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) packed in a low pressure sealed column (Amersham Biosciences C26/40 column) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of ∼8 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with at least two column volumes of Buffer A and eluted with a step gradient of decreasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate (0.1 m every 45 ml, ∼8 ml/min flow rate). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing SOD1 were combined and concentrated. The protein was dialyzed into 2.25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 160 mm NaCl and subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 superfine (Sigma) column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. If required, some fractions were exchanged into 2.25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and subjected to an additional chromatographic step using DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Sigma) or DEAE-cellulose (U.S. Biologicals) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The proteins were eluted from these columns using a step gradient with increasing concentrations of potassium phosphate. The purity and correct molecular weight of the SOD1 proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thornhill, Canada). Positive ion mass spectra were collected for all samples after dilution to ∼20 pmol/μl in 50:50:1 water/acetonitrile/formic acid (v/v). Data analysis was performed using BioMultiView version 1.3.1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Sciex, Canada). “Metal-bound” SOD1 was protein that was not subjected to the dialysis procedure described below and was used in these centrifugation experiments as purified. Apo-SOD1 proteins were generated by dialysis at low pH in the presence of EDTA using methods similar to those previously published (6Valentine J.S. Pantoliano M.W. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology. 3. Wiley, New York1981: 291-358Google Scholar). Spectra/Por 1 dialysis tubing with a molecular mass cutoff range of 6000-8000 Da (Spectrum Laboratories Inc.) was rinsed with distilled water before adding the metal-bound protein. The protein solution was dialyzed five times at 4 °C against 10 mm EDTA and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.8, followed by dialysis three times against 100 mm NaCl and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.8, to remove SOD1-bound EDTA (54Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4229-4234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was then dialyzed five times in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, to remove NaCl. All dialysis buffers were filter sterilized using a 1000-ml Stericup Filter (Millipore), and those that did not contain EDTA were passed through a column containing ∼150 ml of Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove trace metals. All glassware and equipment that came into contact with the apoprotein solutions were treated with a solution containing EDTA and rinsed with metal-free water. Inductively coupled plasma, atomic emission mass spectrometry was performed at the Elemental Analysis Facility (UCLA, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry) using a Thermo Jarrel Ash (Thermo Electron) IRIS 1000 inductively coupled plasma, atomic emission instrument to quantify metal ions that were present and to confirm that apo-SOD1 was metal-free. Three readings were taken per wavelength (three wavelengths per element) and averaged. Metal ion concentrations were converted from parts per billion to molarity and compared with protein concentration to calculate equivalents of metal ions bound per SOD1 dimer. Metal-bound wild type SOD1 in these studies contained, on average, ∼2.9 equivalents of zinc and ∼0.6 equivalents of copper per dimer, whereas the C57S mutant contained ∼2.53 equivalents of zinc and ∼0.13 equivalents of copper per dimer. All apo-SOD1 proteins contained <0.05 equivalents of both copper and zinc. Analytical Ultracentrifugation–All sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-I at the Center for Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Macromolecular Assemblies (The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Department of Biochemistry). Buffer density and viscosity corrections were made according to data published by Laue et al. (55Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

All solutions were made metal-free using a batch preparation with Chelex 100 resin and filtered using a Steriflip Filter system (Millipore Corp.). TCEP was dissolved in metal-free buffer and adjusted to pH 5.5 using sodium hydroxide. All SOD1 samples were prepared at the same time before each run by diluting a ∼10 mg/ml (∼300 μm) protein solution to the specified concentrations. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed at 20 °C using an eight-hole AN-50 rotor and double-sector charcoal/Epon filled centerpieces. SOD1 samples with an initial absorbance at 280 nm of 0.8 (∼2.4 mg/ml; ∼74 μm) were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm. Scans were collected using absorbance optics and analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (58van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C using a four-hole AN-60 rotor and double-sector charcoal/Epon-filled centerpieces. Three 120-μl samples of protein with an initial absorbance at 280 nm of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were sedimented to equilibrium at 24,000, 27,500 and 31,000 rpm. Scans were collected with absorbance optics at 230 and 280 nm. The radial step size was 0.001 cm, and each c versus r datapoint was the average of 20 independent measurements. Points exceeding 0.9 A were excluded from the fits. Data spanning the concentration range of 2-100 μm SOD1 were examined by global fitting and Monte Carlo analyses using UltraScan.

To better understand the molecular events involved in γ-secretase cleavage of APP, in this study we report the identification of a new intracellular long Aβ species containing residues 1–46 (Aβ46), which led to the identification of a novel ζ-cleavage site between the known γ- and ϵ-cleavage sites within the transmembrane domain of APP. Our data clearly demonstrate that the new ζ-cleavage is a presenilin-dependent event. It is also noted that the new ζ-cleavage site at Aβ46 is the APP717 mutation site. Furthermore, we show that the new ζ-cleavage is inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitors known as transition state analogs but less affected by inhibitors known as non-transition state γ-secretase inhibitors. Thus, the identification of Aβ46 establishes a system to determine the specificity or the preference of the known γ-secretase inhibitors by examining their effects on the formation or turnover of Aβ46. γ-Secretase cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, because it is the decisive step in the formation of the C terminus of β-amyloid protein (Aβ).

A New Species of Amyloid Peptide♦Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 49PreviewOne of the characteristic features of Alzheimer disease is the aggregation and eventual deposition of amyloid peptides in the brain. These amyloid deposits are generally composed of 39-43-amino acid residue amyloid β-peptides that are derived from a large amyloid precursor protein through a series of cleavage events.

In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved at the N terminus of Aβ sequence by β-secretase, to produce a soluble ectodomain, sAPPβ, and a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment, CTFβ. CTFβ is then subsequently cleaved within the transmembrane domain by γ-secretase to produce the full-length Aβ and the intracellular domain (AICD) (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). β-Secretase has been identified as a type I membrane aspartyl protease (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A.

The findings that knockout of presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 results in the abolishment of the γ-secretase cleavage of APP and that two aspartate residues in two transmembrane domains of presenilin have been identified as critical for the γ-secretase activity suggest that presenilin may be the γ-secretase (4De Strooper B.

Recently, several other molecules, namely nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, have been identified as essential components of the γ-secretase complex of which presenilin may function as the catalytic subunit (8Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most of the Aβ species contain 40 or 42 amino acids. Recently, sequence analysis revealed that the N terminus of AICD starts at residue 50 of the Aβ sequence, which is 7–9 amino acids away from the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42. This led to the finding of the ϵ-cleavage site between Aβ49 and Aβ50 (9Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Now the cleavage at Aβ40/42 has been specifically referred to as γ-cleavage site (12Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, neither the intermediate Aβ peptide, which ends at the ϵ-cleavage site, nor the C-terminal fragment, which starts with an N terminus generated by γ-cleavage, has ever been detected. One possibility is that γ- and ϵ-cleavages occur simultaneously. The other possibility is that there may be additional cleavages(s) between γ- and ϵ-cleavages. Here we report that, in our effort to determine these possibilities, we identified a new cleavage site at Aβ46, which we designated as ζ-cleavage site. γ-Secretase inhibitors, DAPT, compound E, γ-secretase inhibitor XIX (XIX), L-685,458, and WPE-III-31C (31C), were from Calbiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Aβ40 was from Biopeptide. Aβ42 and Aβ43 were from American Peptide. Cell Lines—Human neuroblastoma M17 cells, glioma HS683 cells, and embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from American Type Cell Collection. All stably transfected N2a cell lines were established as described previously (13Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Eight hours after treatment with inhibitors, cells were harvested and lysed in Western blot lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Secreted Aβ was immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium (CM) using a Aβ-specific antibody 6E10 (Senetek). Both cell lysates and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 10% Bicine/urea SDS-PAGE or 10–18% regular SDS-PAGE. After being transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed with specific antibodies, the immunoreactivity bands were visualized using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometric Analyses—N2a cells cultured in the presence of DAPT were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was diluted with equal amounts of IP buffer to bring down the concentration of Nonidet P-40 to 0.5%. The intracellular Aβ species were immunoprecipitated using 6E10. The immunoprecipitate was eluted from beads with a buffer of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and 45% acetonitrile and then subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric (MALDI-MS) analysis performed on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer as described previously (14Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Identification of a New Intracellular Aβ Species—N2a cells stably expressing wild type PS1 (PS1wt) and the myc-tagged Swedish mutant APP (APPsw), which have been used in previous studies (13Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Ikeuchi T. Dolios G. Kim S.H. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7010-7018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were treated with or without γ-secretase inhibitors: DAPT, DAPM, compound E, and XIX. The cell lysates were analyzed by 10–18% Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, using either 6E10, a monoclonal antibody specific to residues 1–17 of human Aβ, or C15, an antibody raised against the C-terminal 15 amino acids of APP. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with these inhibitors resulted in the accumulation of the C-terminal fragments of APP, namely CTFβ and CTFα, generated by β- and α-secretases, respectively, as detected by C15 (compare lanes 2–5 with lane 1, top panel). Surprisingly, when the same samples were probed by 6E10, a band, which is tentatively labeled as Aβ46 (lane 1, second panel) and has a migration rate much faster than that of CTFβ but slightly slower than those of synthetic Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ43 (compare lane 1 with lanes 6 and 7, second panel), was detected in untreated cells. More interestingly, this band was markedly increased in cells treated with γ-secretase inhibitors (compare lanes 2–5 with lane 1, second panel). The fact that this band was not detected by C15 but was detected by 6E10 suggests that it is more likely a novel intracellular Aβ-containing peptide with a higher molecular mass than Aβ43. The same samples were also analyzed by 10% Bicine/urea SDS-PAGE as described previously (16Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As shown in the third panel, this new Aβ species (lanes 1–5) migrated much faster than Aβ40/42 and Aβ43 (lanes 6 and 7), indicating that this new Aβ species is more hydrophobic than Aβ43. Next, we examined the effects of these inhibitors on the formation of secreted Aβ. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1A, secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected in CM of untreated cells (lane 1) but not detected in CM of cells treated with inhibitors (lanes 2–5), a result consistent with many previous studies. To determine the physiological relevance of this new Aβ species, we examined its presence in other types of cells. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 1B, in the presence of 3 nm compound E, this new Aβ species was also detected in human glioma HS683 cells (lane 2) and human neuroblastoma M17 cell (lane 4) without overexpressing APP. This Aβ species was also detected in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (data not shown). When analyzed by a Bicine/urea SDS-PAGE (bottom panel), as expected, the new Aβ species migrated much faster than Aβ40/42 (compare lanes 2, 4, and 6 with lane 7). The detection of this new Aβ species in different types of cells, and specifically, in cells without overexpressing APP indicates that this new Aβ species is a normal metabolic product of APP. Identification of a New ζ-Cleavage Site at Aβ46 —To determine the identity of the novel Aβ-containing peptide, mass spectrometric analysis was carried out. The new Aβ species was immunoprecipitated with 6E10 from the lysates of cells treated with DAPT and analyzed by MALDI-MS. As shown in Fig. 2, a major spectral peak with a mass of 4927.53 Da, which is in agreement with the expected mass of 4926 for Aβ46, was observed. Thus, we determined the new Aβ species as Aβ46 and identified a new cleavage site at Aβ46 within the transmembrane domain of APP between the known γ-cleavage site at Aβ40/42 and the ϵ-cleavage site at Aβ49. We named this new cleavage site as “ζ-cleavage” site, following the tradition by which other APP processing sites were named. It is noted that in addition to Aβ46, a weak spectral peak corresponding to Aβ43 (measured mass = 4614.86 Da; expected mass = 4615 Da) was detected in the immunoprecipitate. ζ-Cleavage Is PS1-dependent—The novel finding that the new ζ-cleavage product Aβ46 was not inhibited but rather increased by the known γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT etc. prompted us to determine whether ζ-cleavage is dependent on presenilin. To this end, we examined the effect of the dominant negative aspartate mutant PS1 on the formation of Aβ46. In addition to the cells that stably express both APPsw and PS1wt, another line of cells, APPsw/PS1(D385A), which stably expresses both APPsw and the dominant negative mutant PS1(D385A) and has been used in a previous study (13Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was employed. Cells were treated with or without 0.5 μm DAPT for 8 h. The cell lysates and the secreted Aβ immunoprecipitated from CM were analyzed by 10–18% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, full-length PS1 was detected in all cells. The PS1 processing product, the N-terminal fragment of PS1, was detected in cells expressing wild type PS1 (lanes 1 and 2, top panel) but not in cells expressing the dominant negative PS1(D385A) mutant (lanes 3 and 4, top panel), which has been shown not to undergo endoproteolytic processing (7Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). As shown in the middle panel, in the presence of DAPT, Aβ46 was detected in cells expressing wild type PS1 (lane 2) with concomitant decrease in secreted Aβ (bottom panel, lane 2). Interestingly, Aβ46, as well as secreted Aβ, was not detected in cells expressing dominant negative PS1 mutant, regardless of the presence or absence of DAPT (lanes 3 and 4), indicating that Aβ46 formation is PS1-dependent. Transition State Analogs Inhibit ζ-Cleavage—The data presented in Fig. 1 show that the known γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT etc. at the concentrations used, completely inhibited the formation of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 produced by γ-cleavage but had less effect on the formation of Aβ46 produced by ζ-cleavage. This observation raises a possibility that these inhibitors may have differential effects on γ- and ζ-cleavages. In this regard, it was noted that the inhibitors tested, namely DAPT, DAPM, compound E, and XIX, are known as non-transition state inhibitors. This prompted us to determine the effect of the inhibitors known as transition state analogs on the new ζ-cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4, in cells treated with DAPT, DAPM, compound E, and inhibitor XIX (lanes 10–17 and lanes 20–27), a dose-dependent decrease in secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 in CM (compare with samples from untreated control cells in lanes 9 and 19, lower panel) and, specifically at the lower range of concentrations of these inhibitors, a concomitant increase in CTFβ and Aβ46 (upper panel) were observed for all these inhibitors. Surprisingly, it was found that Aβ46 was not detected in the cells treated with transition state analogs, L-685,458 and 31C (lanes 2–8, upper panel), although these inhibitors caused a marked and dose-dependent decrease in secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 in CM (compare lanes 2–8 with lane 1, lower panel). This result reveals an important notion that ζ-cleavage, which is responsible for the formation of Aβ46, is specifically inhibited by inhibitors known as transition state analogs and is less affected by inhibitors known as non-transition state inhibitors. All inhibitors examined at the ranges of concentrations used were found to have no effect on the cell growth and the expression and processing of PS1 (data not shown). In this study we detected a new intracellular Aβ-containing peptide, Aβ46. The presence of Aβ46 in intact cells was confirmed in different types of cells. The finding of this new intracellular Aβ46 is also supported by recent observations that Aβ species ending at residue 46 can be detected in human tissue of subjects with and without AD (17Kuo Y.M. Kokjohn T.A. Watson M.D. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Sue L.I. Kalback W.M. Emmerling M.R. Beach T.G. Roher A.E. Am. J.

It is noted that Aβ46 exists at very low concentration in the absence of inhibitors. This may accounts for the difficulty in detecting it in living cells. The identification of this new Aβ46 offers several novel insights into the mechanism of the normal and pathogenic intramembranous processing of APP and the formation of Aβ. First, the identification of Aβ46 reveals a novel cleavage site, ζ-cleavage site between the two known γ- and ϵ-cleavage sites. Our data also clearly reveal that this new ζ-cleavage occurs as a presenilin-dependent event, indicating that it is a new intramembranous cleavage of APP by γ-secretase or related protease activity. Moreover, the facts that Aβ46 can be detected in the absence of inhibitors and it is the predominant intracellular Aβ species as determined by both Western blot and mass spectrometry analyses strongly indicate that the cleavage site at Aβ46 is another major cleavage site in APP, besides the known γ-cleavage site at Aβ40/42 and the ϵ-cleavage site at Aβ49. It is also noted that the new ζ-cleavage site at Aβ46 is the site at which the AD-linked APP mutation, APP717 mutation also known as London mutation, occurs (19Goate A. Chartier-Harlin M.C. Mullan M. Brown J. Crawford F. Fidani L. Giuffra L. Haynes A. Irving N. James L. Nature. 1991; 349: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar, 20Hardy J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding reveals an interesting fact that the well characterized AD-linked APP717 mutation actually occurs at a major APP processing site, the ζ-site near the C terminus of Aβ. Also the other well characterized AD-linked APP mutation, the Swedish mutation occurs at another major cleavage site, the β-site at the N terminus of Aβ. Second, our dose-curve experiments clearly demonstrate that, at the lower range of concentrations, DAPT, DAPM, compound E, and XIX cause a dose-dependent decrease in secreted Aβ40/42 and a concomitant increase in Aβ46, suggesting a possible precursor-product relationship between Aβ46 and Aβ40/42. However, the observation that ζ-cleavage can be differentially inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitors known as transition state analogs but less affected by the inhibitors known as non-transition state inhibitors also raises a possibility that ζ-cleavage may be catalyzed by a γ-secretase-like activity. According to this model, the dose-dependent decrease in secreted Aβ40/42 and the concomitant increase in Aβ46 caused by non-transition state inhibitors at the lower range of concentrations may be related to the substrate availability, i.e. when the true γ-secretase, which cleaves APP at Aβ40/42, is inhibited, it makes more CTFβ available for the putative γ-secretase-like activity, which produces Aβ46. At higher ranges of concentrations, these inhibitors also caused a dose-dependent increase of CTFβ, suggesting an allosteric mechanism of the inhibitory effects of these inhibitors on the turnover of Aβ46 and CTFβ. Third and more importantly, the identification of Aβ46 made it possible to determine the specificity of the known γ-secretase inhibitors. Our experiment examining the effects of the known inhibitors on the formation and turnover of the newly identified Aβ46 led to a novel finding that the newly identified ζ-cleavage is specifically inhibited by inhibitors known as transition state analogs and is less affected by inhibitors known as non-transition state inhibitors. According to the amyloid hypothesis (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar), the longer and more hydrophobic and more amyloidogenic Aβ is more toxic and pathogenic. In this regard, it is notable that DAPT, DAPM, compound E, and XIX, which were previously known to inhibit the formation of secreted Aβ, cause an intracellular accumulation of an even longer Aβ species, Aβ46. This finding provides information important for the strategy of prevention and treatment of AD aimed at the design of γ-secretase inhibitors. Therefore, the observation that ζ-cleavage is differentially inhibited by so called transition state inhibitors and is less affected by non-transition state inhibitors is significant because it establishes, for the first time, a system to determine the specificity or the preference of the known γ-secretase inhibitors by examining their effects on the formation or turnover of Aβ46. In general, the identification of the intracellular Aβ46 and the new ζ-cleavage site may provide a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of AD.

In the present study we report that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2 VD)3induces OCa cell apoptosis by down-regulating telomerase. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis shows that 1,25(OH)2VD3 decreases the level of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA, the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The decrease is not due to transcriptional repression through the putative vitamin D response element present in the 5′ regulatory region of hTERT gene. Instead, 1,25(OH)2 VD3 decreases the stability of the hTERT mRNA. Stable expression of hTERT in OCa cells decreases their response to 1,25(OH)2VD3-induced growth suppression.

Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The ends of chromosomes, telomeres, are subject to progressive shortening in normal somatic cells, leading ultimately to irreversible growth arrest, known as senescence (8Kolquist K.A. Ellisen L.W. Counter C.M. Meyerson M. Tan L.K. Weinberg R.A. Haber D.A. Gerald W.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In contrast, the telomere length in cancer cells is stabilized by telomerase, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex containing three essential components, the telomerase RNA, which contains a sequence complementary to the telomeric TTAGGG repeat, the catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase, which catalyzes the reverse transcription of TTAGGG repeats in the telomerase RNA, and the telomerase-associated protein 1, which helps the reverse transcription. Whereas all human somatic cells express the telomerase RNA constitutively (9Cech T.R. Cell. 2004; 116: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Newbold R.F. Mutagenesis. 2002; 17: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the level of hTERT is increased in most human cancers, and its expression determines the cellular activity of telomerase (11Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of the hTERT gene appears to be the rate-limiting factor for telomerase activity in human cancer cells. The reactivation of telomerase has been shown to be one of the three events required to transform a normal human epithelial cell into a cancer cell (12Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). An anti-apoptotic function of telomerase has been described in human fibroblasts and neuronal cells (13Ren J.G. Xia H.L. Tian Y.M. Just T. Cai G.P. Dai Y.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Gorbunova V. Seluanov A. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 14: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in epidermoid tumor cells indicate that inhibition of telomerase in tumor cells, whose telomeres are already short, leads to chromosomal damage, which in turn triggers apoptotic cell death (16Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Thus, telomerase activation is most likely a causal event for tumorigenesis instead of just a marker for neoplasia, making telomerase an attractive target for discovery of anticancer drugs. Similar to other cancer cells, there was a significant correlation of telomerase activity in OCa cells with the expression hTERT mRNA but not with the expression of the other two components of telomerase (17Park T.W. Riethdorf S. Riethdorf L. Loning T. Janicke F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 84: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Kyo S. Kanaya T. Takakura M. Tanaka M. Yamashita A. Inoue H. Inoue M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). OCa cells containing wild type hTERT are highly tumorigenic, whereas cells expressing dominant negative hTERT fail to form tumors in nude mice (12Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), supporting hTERT as a potential target for anti-OCa drugs. The work presented here provides experimental evidence that 1,25(OH)2VD3 induces apoptosis in OCa cells, which involves the down-regulation of telomerase activity through degradation of hTERT mRNA. Further studies show that the down-regulation of hTERT and associated apoptosis are major contributors to suppression of OCa cell growth induced by 1,25(OH)2VD3 as well as to the suppressive effect of the hormone on the ability of OCa cells to resume proliferation after hormonal withdrawal. Materials—pBabe-hTERT (19Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), hTERT reporter construct pGL3–3328Luc (20Kyo S.

Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have been described previously. 1,25(OH)2VD3 was from Calbiochem. Baculovirus-expressed human VDR protein, human RXRβ, protein and anti-RXRβ antibody were from Affinity BioReagents Inc. (Golden, CO). Anti-VDR antibody was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and anti-β-actin antibody were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The sequence of the oligonucleotides in sense orientation for producing complementary double-strand oligos for electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) is 5′-cacccactggtaaggAGTTCAtggAGTTCAat-3′ (putative hTERT VDRE); capital letters are used to indicate the hexameric core binding motifs in the VDRE primers. Human OC and VDRE-C has been described in a previous study (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The sequences of PCR primers for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays are 5′-ccatgttggtcaggctgatc-3′ (upstream) and 5′-tgtcaagagacggtgtatcc-3′ (downstream). Colorimetric Methylthiazole Tetrazolium (MTT) Assays and Flow Cytometry—To measure cell growth, OVCAR3 cells or the hTERT stable clones were plated at 1 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates and treated with 1,25(OH)2VD3 or vehicle. MTT assays were performed as described (21Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20444-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A595 was read on a MRX microplate reader (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, VA). To determine the apoptosis, cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspensions were incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide for 15 min and then subjected to flow cytometry. Cell cycle analyses were done as described (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using the t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Telomerase Activity Assays—Telomerase activity was measured by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assays using the telomerase PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Telomerase activity was expressed as absorbance values at 450 nm, measured by a microtiter reader with a reference wavelength of 595 nm. All assays were performed in duplicate, and a series of dilutions of control telomerase extracts was examined in parallel to obtain a titration curve used to normalize experimental variations. A PCR-TRAP assay performed with various amounts of protein indicated that 100 ng of protein extract was optimal for quantitative and reproducible assay for telomerase activity in OVCAR3 cells. PCR Analyses—PCR primers and probes were chosen with the assistance of the Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA in reverse transcription-coupled PCR (RT-PCR), upstream and downstream primers were placed in different exons. The forward primer of hTERT probe set 1 (1909F) and FAM/TAMRAprobe1 are in exon 4, whereas the reverse primer (2017R) spans exons 4 and 5 junction. The forward primer of hTERT probe set 2 (3081F) spans the junction of exons 13 and 14, TAM/TAMRAprobe2, and the reverse primer (3162R) is in exon 14. The nucleotide sequences are as follows: 1909F, 5′-gtccagactccgcttcataa-3′; 2017R, 5′-gagacgctcggccctctt-3′; FAM/TAMRAprobe1, 5′-ttctggctcccacgacgtagtccatg-3′; 3081F, 5′-cgtacaggtttcacgcatgtg-3′; 3162R, 5′-atgacgcgcaggaaaaatg-3′; TAM/TAMRAprobe2, 5′-agctcccatttcatcagcaagtttggaag-3′. Analyses of hTERT and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression by RT-PCR were performed as previously described (22Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J. Harley C.B. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. hTERT primers 1784 (5′-cggaagagtgtctggagcaa-3′) and 1910 (5′-ggatgaagcggagtctgga-3′) were chosen to amplify a 145-bp region present in all transcripts of hTERT. GAPDH transcript was amplified in parallel using primers 5′-ctcagacaccatggggaaggtga-3′ and 5′-atgatcttgaggctgttgtcata-3′. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYBR green. For real-time PCR analyses, RNA was prepared using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and digested with DNase on-column using RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). An RNA pool was generated by mixing aliquots of RNA from cells treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2VD3 for various time points. Concentrations of the pooled RNA ranging from 0 (buffer alone) to 50 ng/μl were used in the PCR analysis to generate the standard curve for each gene. The cycle threshold value was generated by the ABI PRISM 7700 SDS software version 1.7 and then exported to an Excel spreadsheet where equations from the standard curve were generated. Using the cycle threshold values, concentrations of the hTERT and GAPDH mRNAs were calculated from the equations. Each sample was analyzed at two different concentrations (50 and 2 ng/μl), and the result from the linear portion of the standard curve was presented. Samples were analyzed in triplicate at each concentration, and hTERT levels were normalized to the corresponding GAPDH. EMSA, ChIP Assays, and Transcriptional Analysis—EMSA and ChIP assays were performed as described (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For transfection studies, OVCAR3 cells were plated in 12-well plates in 15% fetal bovine serum RPMI 1640 medium at 1 × 105 cells/well. On the next day OVCAR3 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus following the protocol from Invitrogen. 4-h post-transfection cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2VD3 or vehicle in fresh medium for 36 h. Cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (23Lee H. Bai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5835-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Establishment of hTERT Stable Clones and Measurement of the Length of Telomere—For the establishment of stable clones expressing hTERT or reporter genes, OVCAR3 cells were transfected with 10 μgof pBabe-hTERT or pGL3–3328Luc plasmids together with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3. The stable clones were obtained through selection with 100 μg/ml G418 for a period of about 4 weeks and isolated by cloning using glass cylinders. Telomere length was measured using a nonradioactive chemiluminescent assay (Roche Applied Science). 5 μg of genomic DNA was digested overnight with 20 units of HinfI and RsaI and separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. After denaturation and neutralization, DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled (TTAGGG)4 oligonucleotides (Roche Applied Science). The signal was visualized by the digoxigenin luminescence detection. The average telomere length was determined by comparing the signals relative to a molecular weight standard. Prolonged 1,25(OH)2VD3 Treatment Causes Apoptosis of OCa Cells and Diminishes Their Ability to Re-grow after Withdrawal of Hormone—Recent studies from our laboratories have shown that the growth of multiple OCa cell lines is suppressed by 1,25(OH)2VD3 through cell cycle arrest at both G1/S (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and G2/M (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) checkpoints. Abrogation of the cell cycle arrest at specific checkpoints only partially relieves the growth-suppressing activity of the hormone (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms. To determine whether 1,25(OH)2VD3 induces apoptosis in OCa cells, OVCAR3 cells were treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2VD3 at 10–7m for 9 days, and cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V. As shown in the representative profiles (Fig. 1, panel A), 1,25(OH)2VD3 increased the fraction of apoptotic cells. The quantification, based on flow cytometry in two independent experiments, showed that 1,25(OH)2VD3 increased the apoptotic index of OVCAR3 cells by more than 3-fold (from about 20–70%) (Fig. 1B). Preliminary time course analysis showed that 1,25(OH)2VD3 did not induce apoptosis until the cells were treated for a minimum of 6 days (data not shown), indicating that apoptotic induction, similar to G2/M arrest (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), is also a late event. These analyses suggest that the growth suppression by 1,25(OH)2VD3 is likely due to the combined effect of the hormone on both cell cycle progression and cell death. To test whether 1,25(OH)2VD3 exerts a long-lasting effect on the growth potential OCa cells, OVCAR3 cells were pretreated with the vehicle or the hormone for different numbers of days and re-plated, and their ability to grow in the absence of 1,25(OH)2VD3 was tested in MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 1, panel C, the ability of OVCAR3 cells to re-grow was decreased as the time of pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2VD3 increased. Pre-treatment for 1 or 3 days had minor effects, whereas treatments for more than 6 days diminished the ability of the cells to re-grow after 1,25(OH)2VD3 withdrawal. These data suggest that 1,25(OH)2VD3 exerts a long-lasting effect in OCa cells. Because the loss of ability to re-grow correlates with apoptosis, it is likely that these two processes are related. 1,25(OH)2VD3 Decreases Telomerase Activity and the Level of hTERT mRNA in OCa Cells—Because an anti-apoptotic function of telomerase has been described for other cells and the cells undergoing apoptosis are associated with decreased telomerase activity (24Saretzki G. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that 1,25(OH)2VD3 may induce apoptosis in OCa cells by down-regulating telomerase. To determine whether 1,25(OH)2VD3 decreases telomerase, OVCAR3 cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2VD3, and the telomerase activity was measured by the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol. As shown in Fig. 2, panel A, OVCAR3 cells expressed a constitutive level of telomerase activity that was decreased by 1,25(OH)2VD3 treatment in a time-dependent manner. The activity was decreased to about 50% of the control after 3 days of treatment. Only about 15% of the activity was retained in cells treated for 6 and 9 days. Because telomerase down-regulation preceded the apoptotic induction, the data are consistent with the idea that decreased telomerase activity might be responsible for the cell death induced by the hormone. Because the level of hTERT is rate-limiting for the telomerase activity in cancer cells and the VDR is a ligand-regulated transcription factor, it is conceivable that the decreased telomerase activity is due to the down-regulation of the hTERT transcription by 1,25(OH)2VD3. To test this idea, the level of hTERT mRNA in OVCAR3 cells treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2VD3 was determined by RT-PCR. Compared with vehicle control, 1,25(OH)2VD3 at 10–7m decreased the level of hTERT mRNA in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The decrease began after 1 day of treatment and became significant after treatment for 3 days or longer (Fig. 2B), which correlated to the decrease in telomerase activity (Fig. 2A). The level of GAPDH mRNA was not altered, demonstrating the specificity for hTERT mRNA. To quantify the degree of the decrease in hTERT mRNA, real-time PCR was performed using total RNA from OVCAR3 cells treated with vehicle or 10–7m 1,25(OH)2VD3. As shown in Fig. 2, panel C, hTERT mRNA was decreased by half after treatment for 3 days and to one-fourth after 9 days. The down-regulation of hTERT mRNA persisted in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (Fig. 2D), indicating that the down-regulation does not require new protein synthesis. Thus, hTERT is, thus, potentially a primary target regulated by 1,25(OH)2VD3 in OCa cells. The Putative VDRE in the hTERT Promoter Is Not Functional in OCa Cells—A recent study reported the identification of a putative VDRE in the 5′ regulatory region upstream of the hTERT promoter (25Ikeda N. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Hori M. Hosaka M. Kyo S. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Kubota Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 739-746PubMed Google Scholar). This element mediated the down-regulation of hTERT in prostate cancer cells by 1,25(OH)2VD3 in combination with 9-cis-retinoic acid but not by 1,25(OH)2VD3 alone. To test the possibility that the down-regulation of hTERT mRNA by 1,25(OH)2VD3 in OCa cells is mediated through this putative VDRE, the in vitro binding of VDR and RXR to such a response element was tested in EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 3, panel A, the putative VDRE of hTERT bound recombinant VDR/RXR proteins in vitro. The binding is specific for the VDR/RXR heterodimer since neither VDR nor RXR alone formed a detectable complex with the VDRE probes. The complex formation was blocked by excess amounts of cold VDRE derived from human osteocalcin gene but not by a non-specific DNA element as shown in our previous studies (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The complex was super-shifted by the addition of an anti-RXR antibody but not by an unrelated antibody, M2, showing that the binding is specific for the receptors. To determine whether the VDRE mediates the down-regulation of hTERT expression in OCa cells, OVCAR3 cells were transfected with a reporter gene containing a 3.3-kb 5′ regulatory region of hTERT including the putative VDRE (25Ikeda N. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Hori M. Hosaka M. Kyo S. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Kubota Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 739-746PubMed Google Scholar) and treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2VD3. Contrary to our expectation, 1,25(OH)2VD3 slightly increased the activity of the reporter (Fig. 3B). To test whether the lack of repression was an artifact of the transient transfection assay, the reporter was stably transfected into OVCAR3 cells. Similar to the result from transient transfection, 1,25(OH)2VD3 did not decrease the reporter activity in the stable clones after treatment for 6 days (Fig. 3C). The results from EMSA and the reporter analyses necessitated further investigation as to whether the putative VDRE interacts with the VDR in vivo. ChIP assays were performed with soluble chromatin prepared from OVCAR3 cells treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2VD3. As shown in Fig. 3, panel D, in response to 1,25(OH)2VD3, the anti-VDR antibody precipitated the GADD45 exonic region containing the functional VDRE (7Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It did not precipitate the hTERT fragment containing the putative VDRE, showing that the VDR is not recruited by the hormone to the putative VDRE of hTERT in vivo. From these experiments we concluded that the putative VDRE in hTERT promoter is not functional in response to 1,25(OH)2VD3 in OVCAR3 cells, although it binds the VDR/RXR in vitro in EMSA assays. Because 1,25(OH)2VD3 has been shown to inhibit the c-myc oncogene (26Saunders D.E. Christensen C. Wappler N.L. Schultz J.F. Lawrence W.D. Malviya V.K. Malone J.M. Deppe G. Anticancer Drugs. 1993; 4: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which in turn can activate telomerase through two c-Myc binding sites in the hTERT promoter (27Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that the repression of telomerase by 1,25(OH)2VD3 is mediated by c-Myc. However, this is not likely because the reporter constructed with the 3.3-kb hTERT region containing the c-Myc regulatory elements did not respond to inhibition by 1,25(OH)2VD3 (Figs. 3, B and C). Overall, the data suggest that the decreased hTERT mRNA is not due to transcriptional repression through either the putative VDRE or the c-Myc sites. 1,25(OH)2VD3 Decreases the Stability of hTERT mRNA— Because the putative VDRE is not functional in OCa cells, the down-regulation of hTERT mRNA may be due to increased degradation of the mRNA. To examine whether 1,25(OH)2VD3 alters the stability of hTERT mRNA, real-time PCR analyses were performed in the presence of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D. As evaluated by two sets of probes and normalized by GAPDH, the level of hTERT mRNA decreased more rapidly in the cells treated with 1,25(OH)2VD3 than in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3E). In comparison to vehicle-treated cells, 1,25(OH)2VD3 decreased the half-life of hTERT mRNA from 29.7 to 10.8 h and from 22.6 to 6.5 h as measured with probe sets close to the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the hTERT mRNA, respectively. Similar data were obtained with two different amounts of total RNA in two independent real-time PCR experiments. These analyses show that the decrease in the level of hTERT mRNA induced by 1,25(OH)2VD3 is due at least in part to a decrease in mRNA stability. Stable Expression of hTERT in OCa Cells Increases Telomerase Activity, Prolongs Telomere Length, and Selectively Affects 1,25(OH)2VD3-induced Apoptosis over Cell Cycle Arrest—We next evaluated the contribution of the down-regulation of telomerase to the induction of apoptosis. Because hTERT is the limiting factor for telomerase activity, a hTERT expression vector (19Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) was stably transfected into OVCAR3 cells to increase telomerase activity. As shown in Fig. 4, panel A, telomerase activity in OVCAR3 cells stably expressing hTERT was 2∼4-fold higher than the"

Using specific antibodies, we found at least five septins, Sept2, Sept7, Sept8, Sept9b, and Sept11, in septin complexes affinity-purified with anti-Sept7 antibody-conjugated column from rat embryonic fibroblast REF52 cells. Immunofluorescence studies revealed co-localization of Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 along stress fibers in REF52 cells. Biochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the three septins directly bind with each other through their N- or C-terminal divergent regions. These septins per se formed distinct and characteristic filament structures when transiently expressed in COS7 cells. When two of the three septins were co-expressed in COS7 cells, combination-dependent filament elongation, bundling, or disruption was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that septin filament structures may be affected by interactions with other septins included in the complex.

Although septins have a 25% or closer identity over their entire length, sequence similarity is greatest in the central domain, which contains guanine nucleotide interactive motifs homologous to those of ras-related small GTPases. In addition to the conserved central domain, each septin has a divergent N terminus and, with a few exceptions, a C terminus predicted to form a coiled-coil region.The septins were originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a group of cell division cycle regulatory genes (7Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Thereafter, many septins have been identified and extensively studied with genetic analyses using lower eukaryotes such as yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Some septins in these organisms play an essential role in cytokinesis (for a review, see Refs. 1Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. De Virgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin.

On the other hand, accumulating genetic and cell biological observations on yeast septins indicate that they are also required for localized chitin deposition, bud site selection, cell cycle control, and plasma membrane compartmentalization and for regulating some kinases (for a review, see Refs. 2Field C.M.

Some septin transcripts are likely to undergo complex splicing, showing the presence of numerous members of mammalian septin family proteins (for a review, see Refs. 6Kinoshita M. J. Biochem.

Septins form filament structures, which are most likely to be essential to their function. In yeast and fruit fly, isolated septin polypeptides are found in tight complexes with defined stoichiometries (26Field C.M. Al-Awar O.S. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 27Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a recent study revealed that Sept2/6/7 is predominant in septin complexes affinity-purified from brain tissues or HeLa cells with anti-Sept2 antibody (28Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recombinant Sept2/6/7 complex resembles endogenous septin complexes in their morphological and biochemical properties (28Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of mammalian septin genes and their splicing patterns suggests that septin complexes with a different composition from Sept2/6/7 are likely to exist.We now report identification of Sept2, Sept7, Sept8, Sept9b, and Sept11 in septin complexes immunoisolated from rat embryonic fibroblast REF52 cells with anti-Sept7 antibody. Among these septins, we focused on three members with different characters, Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 for the following reasons. First, Sept7 is a component of the well characterized Sept2/6/7 complex and may not be replaceable with other septins in the complex (6Kinoshita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role in the septin filament framework. Second, Sept9b appears to lack a predicted coiled-coil region and thus to have a unique character in septin complexes. In addition, Sept9b is most likely to be involved in cell signaling by interacting with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for a small GTPase Rho, SA-RhoGEF. 1K. Nagata and M. Inagaki, submitted for publication.1K. Nagata and M. Inagaki, submitted for publication. Finally, Sept11 is homologous to Sept6 and thus possibly replaceable with Sept6 in the septin complexes in REF52 that do not contain Sept6 (6Kinoshita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Based on the in vivo and in vitro results obtained in this study, we provide evidence for a septin complex similar to but distinct from Sept2/6/7, and we propose the possibility that septin complex structures may be influenced by the combination of septin components included in the complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Expression plasmids of human Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 were produced as described (28Kinoshita M.

The cDNA fragments of Sept9b-N1 (aa 2The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acids; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholami-dopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein. 1-258), Sept9b-N2 (aa 1-146), Sept9b-N3 (aa 147-258), Sept9b-Cent (aa 259-543), Sept9b-C (aa 544-568), Sept7-N (aa 1-31), Sept7-Cent (aa 32-298), Sept7-C1 (aa 244-418), Sept7-C2 (aa 318-418), Sept11-N (aa 1-147), Sept11-Cent (aa 148-329), Sept11-C1 (aa 290-429), and Sept11-C2 (aa 364-429), obtained using PCR, were subcloned into pGEX-4T3 or pMAL (see Fig. 5). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Preparation and Characterization of Antibodies—The GST-fused Sept9b fragment (aa 1-258), Sept7 fragment (aa 244-418), and Sept8 fragment (aa 291-508) expressed in E. coli served as antigens. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Sept7, anti-Sept8, and anti-Sept9-N, specific for Sept7, Sept8, and Sept9a/b, respectively, were generated and affinity-purified. Anti-Sept11-C was prepared as described (29Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y. Murakami S. Inagaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Anti-Sept2 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. M. Kinoshita (Kyoto University) (11Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was done, and immunoreactive bands were visualized as described (13Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Matsui S. Takagishi M. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Izawa I. Kiyono T. Itoh J.T. Hotani H.

To confirm specificity of the purified antibodies, they were preabsorbed by respective recombinant proteins used as antigens.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—REF52, COS7, and HeLa cells were grown as described (29Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y. Murakami S. Inagaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out using the Lipofectamine method (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence analysis was done as described (13Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Matsui S. Takagishi M. Shiromizu T.

To detect the septins, affinity-purified anti-septin antibodies were used as the primary antibody. To visualize Myc tag, Flag tag, actin, or tubulin, cells were reacted with 9E10, M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.), rhodaminephalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), respectively. Polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody was used where indicated. Alexa 488- or Alexa 350-labeled IgG or FluoroLink Cy3-linked IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody. When analyzing the cells, we used a confocal microscope (LSM-GB200; Olympus).Septin Complex Isolation from REF52 Cells—REF52 cells were harvested with the extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Chaps, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm chymostatin, and 1 mm pepstatin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cell supernatant was obtained by centrifuging this extract at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Affinity-purified anti-Sept7 antibody was adsorbed to Affi-Gel Hz beads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were then added to the cell supernatant and incubated with gentle agitation for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were sedimented and washed four times with 20 volumes of the extraction buffer. The beads were then poured into a column and drained by gravity. One column volume of elution buffer, 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5), was then added. The column was then allowed to drain by gravity and eluted with seven more column volumes of the elution buffer followed by neutralization. The majority of the septin complex was found in fractions 2-4. The contents of individual septins were estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the specific antibodies.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 and their truncated mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST or MBP fusion. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad), and purity of the protein preparations was confirmed on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels.In Vitro Binding Analyses of Purified Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11—Binding of a GST- or MBP-fused septin or its truncated mutants with other septins was determined in a pull-down assay. Each septin or its mutants (3 μg) were incubated with another septin, GST, or MBP (3 μg), in 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% Chaps and 0.1% Triton-X 100 at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads. After a 45-min incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with incubation buffer, and precipitated samples were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis using anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs) for detecting MBP-fused proteins.RESULTSProduction of Antibodies Specific for Sept7, Sept8, and Sept9—To characterize mammalian septins, we first prepared rabbit polyclonal antibodies against septins, including Sept7, Sept8, and Sept9a/b, and affinity-purified them on a column to which respective antigens had been conjugated. Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed with COS7 cell lysates in which various septin proteins were overexpressed. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the anti-Sept7 and anti-Sept8 antibodies specifically recognized Sept7 and Sept8, respectively, in Western blot analyses. Anti-Sept9-N antibody specifically recognized Sept9a and Sept9b in Western blot analyses, since the polypeptide used as an antigen contained a region common between these two splicing variants (Fig. 1C). In these experiments, the specific antibodies did not recognize endogenous septins in COS7 cell lysates expressing tagged septins, since the expression levels of the exogenous septins are very high. We next carried out Western blot analyses to detect endogenous Sept7, Sept9a/b, and Sept11 proteins in lysates of mammalian cell lines, including REF52, COS7, HeLa, and human mammary gland HMEC cells. In REF52 and COS7 lysates, anti-Sept7 and anti-Sept8 antibodies detected single bands of 48 and 50 kDa, respectively, consistent with the predicted molecular masses of these septins (Fig. 1, D and E). Anti-Sept9-N antibody recognized Sept9a and Sept9b as 76- and 73-kDa proteins, respectively, in HeLa cells (Fig. 1F). Sept9a was highly expressed in HMEC cells, whereas Sept9b was detected in COS7 and REF52 cells (Fig. 1F). Preincubation of each antibody with the recombinant protein used as an antigen selectively inhibited the immunoreactivty (Fig. 1, D-F).Fig. 1Characterization of affinity-purified antibodies for Sept7, Sept8, and Sept9. A-C, lysates from COS7 cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged Sept9a, Sept9b, Sept9c, Sept4, Sept2, Sept7, Sept11, Sept8, and Sept6 were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then subjected to Western blotting, using anti-Sept7 (A, top), anti-Sept8 (B), or anti-Sept9-N (C). Expression of each septin was confirmed by reprobing the blotting membranes with 9E10 (A, bottom; data not shown). D-F, detection of endogenous septins. Lysates of REF52 (50 μg), COS7 (30 μg), HeLa (30 μg), or HMEC (4 μg) cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using an anti-Sept7 (D, left), anti-Sept8 (E, left), or anti-Sept9-N (F, left). Western blotting with the antibodies preabsorbed by each antigen was also done (D-F, right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isolation of Septin Complexes from REF52 Cells—Like yeast and Drosophila, mammalian septins also form heteropolymeric filament structures (28Kinoshita M.

In the present study, we tried to immunoisolate septin complexes from REF52 cells using anti-Sept7. The cell lysate was incubated with Affi-Gel Hz-beads coupled with the anti-Sept7. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), neutralized, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with anti-Sept2, anti-Sept7, anti-Sept8, anti-Sept9-N, and anti-Sept11-C. As shown in Fig. 2, Sept2, Sept7, Sept8, Sept9b, and Sept11 were detected in the eluted fraction. Co-purification of the five septins using an antibody specific for one of them may suggest that some of the detected septins form a complex through direct binding. In a previous study (29Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y. Murakami S. Inagaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we identified Sept11 in the Sept9-enriched septin complexes purified from porcine brain, suggesting direct binding of Sept11 with Sept9. On the other hand, Sept7 was also identified in the above septin complexes. Sept7 has been reported to constitute a main framework of mammalian septin complex as Sept2/6/7, and the reconstituted septin complex composed of the three septins was indistinguishable from the endogenous one, indicating that Sept2/6/7 may represent a physiological complex (28Kinoshita M.

Taken together, it is worth analyzing biochemical and cell biological properties of possible interaction among Sept7, Sept9, and Sept11. In addition, characterization of septin complexes containing Sept9b is essential, since it may provide a clue to elucidate a yet unidentified septin function in Rho-mediated signal transduction pathways (31Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Identification of the components of the in vivo septin complex immunoisolated from REF52 cells. Western blot analyses of the septin complexes eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) from the anti-Sept7/Affi-Gel Hz beads (right lane in each panel) or rabbit IgG/Affi-Gel Hz beads (left lane in each panel) were done with anti-Sept2, anti-Sept7, anti-Sept8, anti-Sept9-N, or anti-Sept11-C.

As shown in Fig. 3A, a-i, the three septins were present in filamentous structures along with actin stress fibers. Sept7 was also detected in the nucleus of the cell (Fig. 3A, a-c). We next asked whether septin filaments co-localize with other major cytoskeletal filaments, such as microtubules and vimentin. Double-staining immunofluorescent analyses using a confocal microscope showed no apparent co-distribution of Sept9b with microtubules (Fig. 3B, a-c). When Sept9b and vimentin filaments were co-stained, apparent co-localization was observed at the perinuclear region, where vimentin filaments were condensed (Fig. 3B, d-f). However, further analyses are required to determine whether the septin is associated with vimentin there or co-localizes with other cellular components such as the Golgi apparatus, since some septins have been reported not to be filamentous (23Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Parks W.T. Gottfried Y. Reffey S.B. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J.

The structural relationship between actin stress fibers and septin filaments containing Sept7/9b/11 was further examined using a reagent known to disrupt actin filaments. When growing REF52 cells were treated for 15 min with 5 μm cytochalasin B, a specific inhibitor of actin polymerization, the fibrous distribution of Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 as well as stress fibers was disrupted (Fig. 3C, a-d) (29Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y. Murakami S. Inagaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of REF52 cells for 100 min with 10 ng/ml demecolcine, a specific inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, had little effect on the fibrous distribution of Sept9b and Sept11 along actin stress fibers, under conditions where microtubules were severely disrupted (Fig. 3C, g and h) (29Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y. Murakami S. Inagaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the filament structure of Sept7 was affected to some extent by demecolcine treatment (Fig. 3C, i and j), suggesting that the localization of Sept7 may partly depend on the integrity of microtubules.Fig. 3Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 are co-localized along with actin stress fibers in REF52 cells.

We first asked whether Sept7 forms a complex with Sept9b and Sept11 in COS7 cells. When Myc-Sept9b or -Sept11 was expressed with FLAG-Sept7 into COS7 cells, Myc-Sept9b and -Sept11 were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Sept7 (Fig. 4, A and B). Myc-Sept11 was also co-precipitated with FLAG-Sept9b with a good stoichiometry in the same analysis as above (Fig. 4C). These results suggest the possible in vivo interaction among Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11.Fig. 4Interaction of Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 with each other in COS7 cells.

We thus tested whether Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 associate directly with each other by a pull-down assay using GST- and MBP-fused proteins. As shown in Fig. 5A, Sept9b interacted with Sept7 (left) and Sept11 (middle) in vitro. Sept7 also formed an in vitro complex with Sept11 (Fig. 5A, right).

https://openalex.org/W2049260257,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a pivotal role in extracellular matrix deposition by stimulating collagen production and other extracellular matrix proteins and by inhibiting matrix degradation. The present study was undertaken to define the role of sphingosine kinase (SphK) in TGF-β signaling. TGF-β markedly up-regulated SphK1 mRNA and protein amounts and caused a prolonged increase in SphK activity in dermal fibroblasts. Concomitantly, TGF-β reduced sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase activity. Consistent with the changes in enzyme activity, corresponding changes in sphingolipid levels were observed such that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) was increased (∼2-fold), whereas sphingosine and ceramide were reduced after 24 h of TGF-β treatment. Given the relatively early induction of SphK gene expression in response to TGF-β, we examined whether SphK1 may be involved in the regulation of TGF-β-inducible genes that exhibit compatible kinetics, e.g. tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). We demonstrate that decreasing SphK1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of TIMP-1 protein suggesting that up-regulation of SphK1 contributes to the induction of TIMP-1 in response to TGF-β. The role of SphK1 as a positive regulator of TIMP-1 gene expression was further corroborated by using ectopically expressed SphK1 in the absence of TGF-β. Adenovirally expressed SphK1 led to a 2-fold increase of endogenous S1P and to increased TIMP-1 mRNA and protein production. In addition, ectopic SphK1 and TGF-β cooperated in TIMP-1 up-regulation. Mechanistically, experiments utilizing TIMP-1 promoter constructs demonstrated that the action of SphK1 on the TIMP-1 promoter is through the AP1-response element, consistent with the SphK1-mediated up-regulation of phospho-c-Jun levels, a key component of AP1. Together, these experiments demonstrate that SphK/S1P are important components of the TGF-β signaling pathway involved in up-regulation of the TIMP-1 gene.

Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling plays a pivotal role in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in fibroblasts by stimulating the production of collagens and other ECM proteins and inhibiting matrix degradation (3Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). The negative effects of TGF-β on ECM degradation are mediated via direct inhibition of the principal matrix-degrading proteinase, metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) (4Yuan W. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38502-38510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and stimulation of endogenous inhibitors of MMP-1, including TIMP-1 (5Hall M.C. Young D.A.

In healthy tissues, a balance between matrix synthesis and degradation precisely controls ECM homeostasis, and shifting this balance can lead to pathological ECM turnover (6Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). Excessive matrix degradation occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, periodontitis, and tumor invasion (6Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). An imbalance between the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and matrix metalloproteinases is believed to be one of the mechanisms contributing to these pathologies. Recent observations on the role of TIMPs in tumorigenesis suggest that these factors have additional MMP-independent functions, including growth stimulatory and anti-apoptotic effects (7Jiang Y. Goldberg I.D. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2245-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Thus, TIMPs may enhance tumor growth during the early stages of tumorigenesis, although inhibiting tumor progression through their inhibitory effects on MMPs. Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is a ubiquitously expressed, evolutionary conserved enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (8Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). To date, two mammalian isoforms of SphK (types 1 and 2), including their splice variants, have been identified. In addition, sphingosine kinase activity that was not attributable to SphK1 or SphK2 was detected in selected mouse tissues (9Fukuda Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, because the search of the human genome did not reveal any additional proteins with the SphK homology (10Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47408-47415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), this activity may be due to the presence of proteins with overlapping functions not related to SphK. SphK1 and SphK2 differ in their relative tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and biochemical activities, consistent with distinct biologic functions for these two enzymes (11Saba J.D. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). SphK1 is primarily localized in the cytosol and has been shown to translocate to the membrane upon activation with selected agonists (12Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whereas SphK2 has a predominantly nuclear localization (13Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). SphK1 is slightly more efficient than SphK2 in phosphorylating their primary intracellular substrate, sphingosine, whereas SphK2 is significantly more efficient toward unnatural substrates such as the immunomodulatory drug FTY720 (10Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47408-47415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). SphK1 has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including promotion of cell proliferation, survival, and motility (8Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). In contrast, SphK2 has been shown to inhibit DNA synthesis and also to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (13Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 14Liu H. Toman R.E. Goparaju S.K. Maceyka M. Nava V.E. Sankala H. Payne S.G. Bektas M. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40330-40336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Significantly, nuclear localization was essential for the antiproliferative effects of SphK2. SphK appears to have a dual role in regulating cellular function. At the basal catalytic level, SphK is involved in sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipid turnover and is responsible for clearing the cell of sphingosine and ceramide (11Saba J.D. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Upon activation with agonists, SphK1 functions as a component of the signal transduction cascades. For example, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activation of SphK1 is required for the TRAF2-dependent activation of NF-κB (15Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of SphK1 and its translocation to the membrane is mediated by the ERK1/2-induced phosphorylation at Ser-225 (16Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of SphK1 by ERKs was dependent on its association with TRAF2. SphK1 is not only an effector of ERK1/2, but it is also involved in signaling cascades leading to ERK1/2 activation. It has been shown that activation of ERK1/2 by tumor necrosis factor-α (16Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor (17Shu X. Wu W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7758-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and 17β-estradiol (18Sukocheva O.A. Wang L. Albanese N. Pitson S.M. Vadas M.A. Xia P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) requires SphK1. Because intracellular receptors for S1P have not been described, it is unclear at this point how SphK1 couples to intracellular signaling cascades. Our previous study (19Sato M. Markiewicz M. Yamanaka M. Bielawska A. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in dermal fibroblasts revealed a cross-talk between the sphingolipids and the TGF-β signaling pathways. We have shown that TGF-β treatment leads to a rapid and transient induction of ceramide. Furthermore, changes in the intracellular levels of ceramide due to the overexpression of the yeast sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase (YSR2) resulted in potentiation of TGF-β signaling, including Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Recent studies (20Xin C. Ren S. Kleuser B. Shabahang S. Eberhardt W. Radeke H. Schafer-Korting M. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35255-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated cooperation between TGF-β and S1P signaling. Stimulation of mesangial cells with S1P led to phosphorylation of Smads1–3 and mimicked some of the TGF-β downstream effects. It was also shown that S1P effects on Smad phosphorylation were dependent on the presence of TGF-β receptor type II and the S1P3 receptor subtype, suggesting transactivation of TGF-β receptors by S1P. Thus, it appears that interactions between sphingolipid and TGF-β pathways occur at many levels with both exogenous and endogenous sphingolipids capable of modulating TGF-β signaling. In the present study, we describe an additional mode of interaction between these two pathways. We demonstrate for the first time that TGF-β induces SphK synthesis. Furthermore, we show that SphK mediates TIMP-1 up-regulation by TGF-β via an AP1-dependent mechanism. Materials—Sphingosine 1-phosphate and PD98059 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for phospho-c-Jun and c-Jun were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture—Human fibroblasts were obtained from the foreskins of healthy newborns from the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital. Dermal fibroblasts were established from biopsy specimens obtained from the dorsal forearm of healthy volunteers after informed consent. Tissue was dissociated enzymatically by 0.25% collagenase type I (Sigma), and 0.05% DNase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) overnight at 37 °C. Primary fibroblast cultures were established in 25-cm2 culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine. Monolayer cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 until confluence. Cells were then passaged and used for experiments. Measurement of Sphingosine Kinase Activity—SphK activity was determined as described previously by Olivera et al. (21Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.4), EDTA (1 mm), 20% glycerol, deoxypyridoxine (0.5 mm), NaF (15 mm), β-glycerophosphate (40 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (1 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Sphingosine kinase activity was determined in the presence of sphingosine (50 μm) complexed with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 1 mm) containing MgCl2 (10 mm). The labeled S1P was separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G60 with 1-butanol/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10: 20, v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. The labeled S1P was quantified with a PhosphorImager. Bands corresponding to S1P were also scraped from the plates and counted in a scintillation counter. Measurements of Phosphatase Activity—Phosphatase activity was performed as described previously (22Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed on ice in Buffer A containing Hepes (100 mm, pH 7.5), EDTA (10 mm), 1mm dithiothreitol, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were freeze-thawed seven times and spun for 10 min at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellet (membrane fraction) was dissolved in Buffer A. 32P-Labeled S1P (10,000 cpm) was incubated with 2 μg of membrane fraction in Buffer A for 30 min at 37 °C followed by chloroform/methanol extraction and TLC analysis. The TLC plate was autoradiographed, and sphingosine was scraped and counted in a scintillation counter. S1Pase activity was determined by subtracting background blank counts. Measurments of S1P/Sphingosines/Ceramides by Multiple Reaction Monitoring Method—Electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous sphingoid bases, sphingoid base 1-phosphates, and ceramide species was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode using a modified version of a published protocol (23Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;2001/PL1)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets corresponding to ∼2–3 × 106 cells were fortified with the internal standards (IS) (C17 base d-erythrosphingosine: 17CSph, C17 sphingosine 1-phosphate: 17CSph-1P, N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-C13 sphingosine: 13C/C16-Cer and N-heptadecanoyl-d-erythro-C17 sphingosine: 17C/C17-Cer) and extracted into a one-phase solvent system with ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/water (60:30:10 v/v). After evaporation and reconstitution in 100 μl of methanol, samples were injected on the Surveyor/TSQ 7000 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system, and the gradient was eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3 μm particle size column, with 1.0 mm methanolic ammonium formate, 2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. Peaks corresponding to the target analytes and IS were collected and processed using the Xcalibur software system. Quantitative analysis was based on the calibration curves generated by spiking an artificial matrix with the known amounts of the target analyte synthetic standards and an equal amount of the IS. The target analyte peak area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective IS and compared with the calibration curves using a linear regression model. Adenoviral Constructs—Adenoviral vectors expressing human SphK1 were generated using the method described by He et al. (24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA encoding full-length human SphK1 (12Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) was cloned into the shuttle vector, pAdTRACK-CMV, which contains a GFP expression cassette driven by a separate cytomegalovirus promoter. The shuttle vector containing SphK1 was cotransformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with the AdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone plasmid, which lacks the E1 and E3 regions of the adenoviral genome. Linearized recombinant plasmid DNA was then transfected into 293 cells, an adenoviral packaging cell line, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) to generate the recombinant adenovirus expressing SphK1 and GFP (AdSphK1). Western Blot Analysis—Confluent foreskin fibroblast cultures were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0), NaCl (150 mm), 1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm NaF, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human SphK1 (12Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Polyclonal phospho-Jun, c-Jun, phospho-Smad2, and Smad2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Bands were detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR for SphK1 and Sphk2 Expression— Confluent cultures of foreskin fibroblasts were serum starved for 24 h, followed by stimulation with TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) for the indicated time. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was converted to cDNA using a random hexamer primer. The following primers were used for SphK1: forward, 5′-CGC CGC AGG GAA TGA CAC C-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCC TGT CCC CCC AAA GCA TAA C-3′, and the PCR product size was 1492 bp; for SphK2: forward, 5′-CCA AGG CAG CTC TAC ACT CAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA CAC CCC CTA GCT CAA G-3′, and the product size was 634 bp. Control products (18 S rRNA) were amplified using the QuantumRNA Classic 18 S Standards (Ambion, Austin, TX) to yield a 488-bp product. Northern Blot Analysis—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h followed by transduction with AdGFP or AdSphK1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100. The cells were incubated for 24 h and then treated with TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h. Total RNA was extracted, and 3.5 μg was analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (26Yamakage A. Kikuchi K. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nylon membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for TIMP-1 (as described in Ref. 27Levy M.T. Trojanowska M. Reuben A. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and normalized with 18 S rRNA 5′-ACG GTA TCT GAT CGT CGA ACC-3′ as described in Ref. 28O'Neill L. Holbrook N.J. Fargnoli J. Lakatta E.G. Cardioscience. 1991; 2: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar. The membranes were scanned and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) or NIH image densitometry software. Inhibition of SphK1 Expression by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)— Inhibition of SphK1 expression in fibroblasts with SphK1-specific siRNA reagents was performed as described previously (29Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) by using a human SphK1-specific 21-nucleotide siRNA directed at a target sequence 70 nucleotides downstream of the start codon (5′-GG CAA GGC CTT GCA GCT C-3′). Cells were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes or a 21-nucleotide long scrambled siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfection—The TIMP-1-CAT constructs used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. D. A. Mann (Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK) and were described previously (30Sohara N. Trojanowska M. Reuben A. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, 60–80% confluent cells in 6-well plates were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommendations. CAT activities were measured as described previously (31Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SphK Activity Is Up-regulated by TGF-β in Human Fibroblasts—Previous reports have shown that SphK can be activated acutely by a number of agonists including growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors (32Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), but whether TGF-β regulates SphK has not been investigated. We examined the effects of TGF-β on activity and expression levels of SphK in human fibroblasts. A pronounced increase in SphK activity was consistently observed in fibroblasts after 24 h of TGF-β stimulation, with the earliest effects observed starting at 3 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, unlike growth factor signaling, TGF-β results in sustained induction of SphK activity. To determine whether TGF-β stimulation resulted in corresponding increases of S1P, sphingolipid amounts were quantitated by mass spectrometry in confluent serum-starved cells treated for 30 min or for 24 h with TGF-β. Two independently isolated foreskin fibroblast and one adult dermal fibroblast lines were used in these experiments. Both foreskin and adult cell lines responded similarly to TGF-β treatment. Intracellular amounts of S1P were very low in dermal fibroblasts under our experimental conditions and varied from 0.17 to 0.29 pmol/106 cells. In agreement with our previously published data using the diacylglycerol kinase assay (19Sato M. Markiewicz M. Yamanaka M. Bielawska A. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), after 30 min of stimulation with TGF-β we observed an increase in ceramide, whereas the amounts of S1P were further decreased below detection levels (data not shown). In contrast, after 24 h stimulation with TGF-β, S1P amounts were consistently increased (0.26–0.95 pmol/106 cells) (Fig. 1C). We did not detect any measurable changes in the secreted S1P amounts after TGF-β stimulation. Concomitant with S1P increases, the amounts of sphingosine were decreased from 8 to 3.7 pmol/106 cells (Fig. 1C). The basal level of C16-ceramide was higher in adult fibroblasts (264 pmol/106 cells) than in foreskin fibroblasts lines (101 pmol/106 cells), but in all cell lines ceramide decreased about 15% after 24 h of TGF-β treatment. Other ceramide subspecies, including C14, C18, and C24 showed inconsistent changes in different primary cell lines (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that 24-h TGF-β treatment leads to the generation of S1P and sustained changes in sphingolipid content, consistent with other prolonged effects of TGF-β on ECM synthesis in dermal fibroblasts. SphK mRNA and Protein Levels Are Induced by TGF-β in Human Fibroblasts—The TGF-β-mediated increase in SphK activity may be a result of SphK protein up-regulation or a direct effect on its activity. To examine these possibilities, human SphK1 protein was measured by using Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, TGF-β (24 h) treatment markedly up-regulated SphK1 protein amounts (2.13 ± 0.39-fold increase, n = 3). We next examined the effects of TGF-β on SphK1 mRNA synthesis by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, TGF-β rapidly stimulated SphK1 mRNA steady-state levels. Stimulation was observed at 20 min (data not shown), increasing after 1 h (3.7 ± 0.67-fold increase, n = 3), with a maximal increase after 3 h (14 ± 0.55-fold increase, n = 3). Elevated levels persisted for at least 24 h (11.4 ± 0.40-fold increase, n = 3). Together, these data demonstrate that SphK1 is a novel TGF-β-inducible gene in fibroblasts. SphK2 expression levels are low in quiescent dermal fibroblasts as compared with MOLT4 cells and were not affected by TGF-β treatment. In contrast to TGF-β, connective tissue growth factor had no appreciable effect on SphK activity (data not shown), suggesting divergent pathways for these two pro-fibrotic cytokines on sphingolipid metabolism in dermal fibroblasts. TGF-β Down-regulates Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Phosphatase (SPPase)—Our findings of SphK1 up-regulation by TGF-β are in agreement with a recent comprehensive TGF-β array study, which identified 360 TGF-β target genes in fibroblasts (33Yang Y.C.

Re-secretion of apoE is accompanied by the concomitant association of apoE and cellular cholesterol with high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Since epidemiological data showed that apoE3 and apoE4 have differential effects on HDL metabolism, we investigated whether the intracellular processing of TRL-derived apoE4 differs from apoE3-TRL. In this study, we demonstrated by radioactive and immunofluorescence uptake experiments that cell-surface binding and internalization of TRL-derived apoE4 are increased compared with apoE3 in hepatoma cells. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that HDL-induced recycling, but not disintegration and degradation, of apoE4-enriched TRL is strongly reduced in these cells. Furthermore, impaired HDL-induced apoE4 recycling is associated with reduced cholesterol efflux. Studies performed in Tangier fibroblasts showed that apoE recycling does not depend on ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 activity.

Lipoprotein lipase-mediated hydrolysis of TRL at the luminal side of endothelial cells resulted in the formation of TRL remnants, which are rapidly cleared by the liver (for review see Refs. 1Mahley R.W.

Lipoprotein lipase remained associated with these remnants, which simultaneously became enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-derived apoprotein E (apoE). Both lipoprotein lipase and apoE then facilitated the internalization of TRL remnants via the LDL receptor-related protein 1 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (3Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G.

In human hepatoma cells and fibroblasts, the majority of TRL lipids is targeted to the lysosomal compartment, whereas TRL-derived apoE is found in peripheral recycling endosomes (9Heeren J. Weber W.

This new link between TRL-derived apoE and HDL metabolism is associated with cholesterol efflux and involves the internalization of HDL particles to preexisting endosomes containing TRL-derived apoE (13Heeren J.

ApoE has many different functions in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. Besides its role in the clearance of TRL-remnants (6Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar), apoE very effectively stimulates cholesterol efflux from macrophages (15Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Maeda N. Assmann G.

ApoE exists in three isoforms, which differ at two positions in the protein (apoE2, Cys112 and Cys158; apoE3, Cys112 and Arg158; and apoE4, Arg112 and Arg158). These variations resulted in different metabolic properties of apoE isoforms, which are linked to an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (20Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Roses A.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). ApoE2 exhibits strongly reduced binding affinity to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the LDL receptor (22Schneider W.J. Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Utermann G. Weber W. Havel R.J. Kotite L. Kane J.P. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 68: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This results in the accumulation of remnant particles in plasma and most probably contributes to the observed association of apoE2 with familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia (23Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). ApoE4 correlates with high plasma LDL cholesterol levels and is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (20Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Roses A.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, despite the importance of apoE4 as a risk factor, the cellular mechanisms, which are responsible for the differences between apoE3 and apoE4, are yet unclear. The binding of apoE4 to lipoprotein receptors and clearance of TRL remnants are comparable or even higher in comparison with apoE3 (24Bohnet K. Pillot T. Visvikis S. Sabolovic N. Siest G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1316-1324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mamotte C.D. Sturm M. Foo J.I. van Bockxmeer F.M. Taylor R.R. Am. J.

Investig. 1999; 103: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, the dissimilar behavior of apoE isoforms on the intracellular metabolism of apoproteins and lipids could contribute to the development of disease. Compared with apoE3, apoE4 is less efficient in promoting cholesterol efflux in fibroblasts and astrocytes (28Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Assmann G. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Michikawa M. Fan Q.W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), indicating that apoE isoforms differentially affect the mobilization of cellular cholesterol. Therefore, we investigated whether there are potential differences in the intracellular processing of internalized TRL-derived apoE3 and apoE4 that could explain these findings. In this study, we demonstrated that HDL-induced recycling, but not internalization, degradation, or disintegration of TRL-derived apoE4, is impaired compared with apoE3. This process does not depend on the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) activity. Most importantly, reduced apoE4 recycling is associated with a decrease in cholesterol efflux. Thus, impaired apoE4 recycling could explain the low apoE protein and cholesterol content of HDL, which is associated with the human apoE4 allele (20Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F.

Niemeier A. Merkel M. Beisiegel U. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ApoE3 and apoE4 from human VLDL were isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE (35Mann W.A. Meyer N. Berg D. Greten H. Beisiegel U. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 145: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Human recombinant apoE3 and apoE4 were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli (constructs were provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber, Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA) and purified by gel filtration chromatography (36Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TRL and VLDL were radiolabeled by the iodine monochloride method. ApoE isoforms were radiolabeled with Iodogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 μg of unlabeled or 125I-labeled apoE isoforms (native and recombinant) were associated with TRL (0.5 mg of protein) to prepare apoE3-TRL, apoE4-TRL (final concentration 0.23 mg protein/ml) or 125DiI-apoE3-TRL, and 125I-apoE4-TRL (13Heeren J.

The protein concentrations of the 125I-TRL and the 125I-apoE-TRL preparations were 0.22 ± 0.1 mg/ml, whereas 125I-VLDL was 0.41 ± 0.13 mg/ml and the specific radioactivity was 90–140 cpm/ng protein, respectively. Radiolabeling of TRL and VLDL apoproteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (10Heeren J. Grewal T. Jackle S. Beisiegel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, 100 μg of recombinant apoE3 and apoE4 were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, associated with TRL, and re-isolated by ultracentrifugation to obtain Cy3-apoE3-TRL and Cy5-apoE4-TRL, respectively. Fluorescent label was exclusively found in apoE as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel fluorescence analysis (data not shown). Incorporation of DiI into apoE3-TRL and apoE4-TRL was performed as described previously (9Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-incorporated DiI was removed by PD10 (Amersham Biosciences) gel chromatography. To analyze the apolipoprotein composition of TRL particles, 2–10 μg of the different lipoprotein preparations were delipidated by chloroform/methanol extraction and apoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels (NuPAGE®, Invitrogen). Apoproteins were visualized with a Coomassie Blue protein stain. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, hepatoma cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml apoE3, apoE3-TRL, apoE4-TRL, DiI-apoE3-TRL, or DiI-apoE4-TRL in DMEM + 2% BSA for 15–60 min at 37 °C. For uptake experiments, cells were washed in DMEM, treated with heparin at 4 °C for 5 min, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. To study apoE recycling, cells were treated as above and incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C in DMEM (0.1% BSA) ± 50 μg/ml HDL3 before fixation. Supernatants were harvested for subsequent Western blot analysis (see below). Indirect immunofluorescence against apoE and nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were performed as described previously (9Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full cell images were taken with an Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam. Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 (version 3.0). For living cell microscopy, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml Cy3-apoE-TRL, Cy5-apoE4-TRL, and 1 μm LysoTracker in DMEM + 2% BSA for 0–30 min at 37 °C. Confocal images were taken every minute in the multitrack mode using optimized pinhole adjustment for each fluorochrome. Western Blotting—Hepatoma cells were incubated with TRL, apoE3-TRL, or apoE4-TRL for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min with 13,000 × g at 4 °C, supernatants were harvested and protein concentrations were determined. In another set of experiments, hepatoma cells were incubated with TRL, apoE3-TRL, or apoE4-TRL for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C ± 50 μg/ml HDL3 in DMEM + 0.1% BSA. The media were harvested, filtered (0.45 μm), and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Cellular proteins (5 μg/lane) and supernatants were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and 10% SDS-PAGE, respectively, and immunoblotted against apoE. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the reaction product was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Surface Binding, Uptake, Degradation, and Recycling Assays— For radioactive cell-surface binding and uptake experiments, hepatoma cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 125I-apoE3-VLDL or 125I-apoE4-VLDL (2.5–10 μg/ml) for 60 min at 4 °C on ice or at 37 °C in DMEM + 5% BSA, pH 7.4, respectively. Cells then were washed with ice-cold PBS. To exclusively measure internalized radioactivity in uptake experiments, cells were washed with 100 units/ml heparin to remove surface-bound material (9Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J.

Finally, cells were solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH to determine the amount of cell-surface bound (4 °C) or internalized (37 °C) radioactivity. Values were normalized to total cellular protein (9Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For degradation experiments, hepatoma cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-apoE3-VLDL or 125I-apoE4-VLDL for 60 min at 37 °C in DMEM and 5% BSA, pH 7.4. Cells were washed as described above and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30–300 min. The media were harvested, the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was removed, and the amount of degraded (125I-tyrosine) radioactivity in the supernatants was determined. Values were normalized to total cellular protein. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml 125I-TRL, 125I-apoE3-TRL, or 125I-apoE4-TRL, washed, and treated with heparin as described above. To promote recycling, radiolabeled cells were incubated for 60–240 min at 37 °C with DMEM + 0.1% BSA supplemented with 50 μg/ml HDL3. The content of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable recycled radioactivity in the harvested media was then determined (9Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—To induce ABCA1 expression, human hepatoma cells were treated overnight with 5 mm OH-Chol and 5 mm RA (38Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated, and ABCA1 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (39Laatsch A. Ragozin S. Grewal T. Beisiegel U. Heeren J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The values obtained for ABCA1 were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. The primers to determine ABCA1 (123-bp cDNA fragment) and GAPDH (242 bp) expression were as follows: ABCA1 (position 4522–4644; NM005502) (forward, 5′-ACTCTTAAACGCCCTCACCAAAGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCTGGGGAACTGGGGCAGT-3′); GAPDH (position 619–860, NM002046) (forward, 5′-ACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTGT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCACCTTCTTGATGTCATCATA-3′). Cholesterol Efflux Experiments—To achieve cholesterol loading, 100,000 cpm/ml 3H-cholesterol in ethanol were incubated with cells overnight at 37 °C as described previously (40Wang N. Lan D. Chen W. Matsuura F. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9774-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The cells then were washed and incubated with TRL, apoE3-TRL, or apoE4-TRL for 60 min at 37 °C. After heparin treatment (see above), cells were incubated in DMEM + 0.1% BSA in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml HDL3 for an additional 60 and 240 min at 37 °C. The media were harvested, and cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH. The amount of 3H-cholesterol in the media and cells was determined and normalized to total cellular protein content. Accumulation of Internalized TRL-derived ApoE4—Epidemiological studies have clearly shown that apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms have differential effects on lipoprotein metabolism. Some observations have indicated that the internalization and intracellular processing of TRL-derived apoE isoforms may help to explain the differences of apoE isoforms in lipid metabolism. The inheritance of apoE4 is associated with increased internalization of VLDL in hepatocytes but not in fibroblasts (25Mamotte C.D. Sturm M. Foo J.I. van Bockxmeer F.M. Taylor R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E553-E557PubMed Google Scholar). These findings correlated with the enhanced plasma clearance of VLDL in apoE4 compared with apoE3 mice (27Knouff C. Hinsdale M.E. Mezdour H. Altenburg M.K. Watanabe M. Quarfordt S.H. Sullivan P.M. Maeda N. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, initial experiments addressed the effects of enhanced internalization of apoE4 on the intracellular processing of TRL-associated apoproteins. First, the internalization of lipid-free and TRL-associated apoE3 and apoE4 into hepatoma cells was compared. TRL-associated apoE3 accumulated in peripheral endosomes (Fig. 1B), whereas after incubation with lipid-free apoE3 only a weak staining was observed (Fig. 1A). This staining represents endogenous apoE in perinuclear compartments, because it was also present in cells incubated without any exogenous apoE (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with lipid-free apoE4 (data not shown). To exclude that the enrichment of TRL particles with apoE3 or apoE4 could differentially alter the overall TRL apoprotein composition, possibly affecting the internalization of apoE3-TRL and apoE4-TRL, the apoprotein composition of TRL, apoE3-TRL, and apoE4-TRL was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Coomassie Blue staining revealed that TRL isolated from apoCII-deficient patients contained apoB100 and apoB48, indicating that both chylomicrons and VLDL were present. The other major apoproteins of native TRL were apoE and apoC (Fig. 2A, lane 1). TRL enriched with recombinant apoE3 or apoE4 contained comparable amounts of apoE3 and apoE4 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). When higher apoprotein amounts were analyzed, similar amounts of apoB100 and apoB48 were detected in apoE3-TRL and apo4-TRL (data not shown). We then compared the internalization of TRL-associated apoE isoforms by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). HuH7 hepatoma cells were incubated with TRL alone as well as with apoE3- and apoE4-enriched TRL (Fig. 2B). Enrichment of TRL with the two apoE isoforms led to a more pronounced accumulation of apoE4 in peripheral endosomes as compared with apoE3. The uptake experiments using TRL enriched with a 1:1 mixture of apoE3 and apoE4 revealed an intermediate accumulation of apoE (data not shown).Fig. 2Isoform-dependent cell-surface binding, internalization, and degradation of TRL and VLDL. A, SDS-PAGE analysis of TRL (10 μg, lane 1), apoE3-TRL (2 μg, lane 2), or apoE4-TRL (2 μg, lane 3). TRL particles were delipidated and re-solubilized, and apoproteins were separated on a 4–12% gradient gel using a MES-based buffer system. Apoproteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. B, HuH7 hepatoma cells were incubated with TRL alone (a) or TRL enriched with 5 μg/ml apoE3 (b) or apoE4 (c) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cell surface-bound lipoproteins were removed with heparin, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy for apoE as described above. Bar is 10 μm. To determine cell-surface binding (C) and uptake (D), hepatoma cells were incubated with 2.5–10 μg/ml 125I-apoE3-VLDL and 125I-apoE4-VLDL for 60 min at 4 or 37 °C, respectively. After washing, cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH and binding (4 °C) and internalized (37 °C) radioactivity was determined.

E, for degradation assays, HuH7 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-apoE3-VLDL and 125I-apoE4-VLDL for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed at 4 °C, and cell-bound radioactive material was removed by heparin. This was followed by a second incubationat 37 °C for 30–300 min as indicated. To determine protein degradation, the media were harvested, the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was removed, and the content of 125I-tyrosine in the supernatant was determined. Cells were washed and lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and the remaining internalized radioactivity was determined. Values of specific degradation for 125I-apoE3-VLDL (white bars) and 125I-apoE4-VLDL (gray bars) are given as the percentage of total metabolized radioactivity and represent the mean ± S.D. of four separate experiments with triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using radiolabeled VLDL from patients homozygous for apoE3 or apoE4, similar results were obtained in radioactive cell-surface binding (Fig. 2C) and uptake experiments (Fig. 2D), respectively.

GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes isolated from cells contain one of several hsp90-binding immunophilins that link the complex to cytoplasmic dynein, a molecular motor that processes along microtubular tracks to the nucleus. The immunophilins link to dynein indirectly via the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex (Galigniana, M. D., Harrell, J. M., O'Hagen, H. M., Ljungman, M., and Pratt, W. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22483–22489). Although it is known that rapid, hsp90-dependent GR movement requires intact microtubules, it has not been shown that the movement is dynein-dependent. Here, we show that overexpression of dynamitin, which blocks movement by dissociating the dynein motor from its cargo, inhibits ligand-dependent movement of the GR to the nucleus. We show that native GR·hsp90·immnunophilin complexes contain dynamitin as well as dynein and that GR heterocomplexes isolated from cytosol containing paclitaxel and GTP to stabilize microtubules also contain tubulin. The complete movement system, including the dynein motor complex and tubulin, can be assembled under cell-free conditions by incubating GR immune pellets with paclitaxel/GTP-stabilized cytosol prepared from GR- L cells. This is the first evidence that the movement of a steroid receptor is dynein-dependent, and it is the first isolation of a steroid receptor bound to the entire system that determines its retrograde movement.

This is the first evidence that the movement of a steroid receptor is dynein-dependent, and it is the first isolation of a steroid receptor bound to the entire system that determines its retrograde movement. As the initial step in their action, transcription factors, such as steroid receptors, p53, and HSF1, must move in a targeted manner through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Until recently, there has been little mechanistic understanding of how protein solutes (i.e. non-vesicle-associated proteins) undergo such retrograde trafficking. Because the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; hsp, heat shock protein; PP5, protein phosphatase 5; FKBP, FK506 binding protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; PPIase, peptidylprolyl isomerase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. moves rapidly and quantitatively from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a ligand-dependent manner, it has been a useful model for studying the movement process (reviewed in Refs. 1Pratt W.B.

Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Like other steroid receptors, the GR forms heterocomplexes with hsp90, and experiments testing the effects of molybdate and geldanamycin on GR trafficking have led to the concept that a dynamic process of receptor·hsp90 complex assembly-disassembly is required for rapid nuclear translocation (3Yang J.

Walker D.A. Romere G. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Hagen G.L. DeFranco D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2876-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Retrograde hsp90-dependent movement of the GR in the cytoplasm occurs along cytoskeletal tracts (6Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol.

GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from cell lysates contain cytoplasmic dynein (13Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renior J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Gee M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 490-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes contain one of several immunophilins possessing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that bind to a TPR acceptor site on hsp90 (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). The signature domain of the immunophilins is the peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain, which is the binding site for immunosuppressant drugs of the FK506 or cyclosporine A class. The immunophilins link the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex to the dynein·dynactin movement machinery via their PPIase domains (16Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renior J.M.

GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes contain one of three TPR domain immunophilins (FKBP52, FKBP51, and cyclophilin 40) or protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a protein phosphatase that contains TPR and PPIase homology domains (reviewed in Ref. 1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Immunoadsorption of FKBP52, cyclophilin 40, or PP5 is accompanied by coimmunoadsorption of dynein, and coimmunoadsorption of dynein is competed by a purified PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 (16Silverstein A.M.

The PPIase domain fragment also competes for the presence of dynein in GR·hsp90·immunophilin complexes (13Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renior J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Thus, there is both in vitro and in vivo evidence that GR·hsp90 complexes are linked via TPR domain immunophilins to cytoplasmic dynein. However, it has not been demonstrated that receptor movement is dynein-dependent. The tumor suppressor protein p53, which also forms hetero-complexes with hsp90 (19Sepehrnia B. Pas I.B. Dasgupta G.

Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Dynein dependence was determined by showing that overexpression of dynamitin abrogates p53 nuclear accumulation (21Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Dynamitin is a 50-kDa subunit of the dynein-associated dynactin complex, and its overexpression blocks movement by dissociating the motor protein from cargo (22Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 139: 469-484Google Scholar, 23Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Here, we show that dynamitin overexpression inhibits ligand-dependent GR nuclear translocation in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts to the same extent as treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin or overexpression of the PPIase domain fragment. We show that immunoprecipitation of GR from cytosol containing paclitaxel and GTP to stabilize microtubules yields coprecipitation of tubulin as well as dynein. Both tubulin and dynein are uncoupled from the GR·hsp90·immunophilin complex by competition with a purified PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52, consistent with the immunophilin forming the bridge linking the receptor to the movement system.

Opti-MEM-1 transfection medium was from Promega (Madison, WI). The E82.A3 subline of mouse L cells was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Housley (University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, SC). Cell Culture and Transfection—For immunoadsorption experiments, L929 mouse fibroblasts were grown in a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. The cells were harvested by scraping into Earle's balanced saline, suspended in HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) with 20 mm Na2MoO4 supplemented with one tablet protease inhibitor mix/3 ml of buffer and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The cell homogenates were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant from this centrifugation is referred to as the cytosol. For visualization by indirect immunoflourescence, 3T3 fibroblasts were grown on 11 × 22-mm coverslips in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with bovine calf serum. When cells were ∼50% confluent, the culture medium was replaced by Opti-MEM transfection medium containing 5% bovine calf serum, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The medium was aspirated and replaced by a transfection mixture (at 3 μl of liposome/μg of DNA) preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in Opti-MEM, which contained 0.4 μg of pCMVH50m or pCMV. After 1.5 h of transfection, the mixture was replaced by regular medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h, prior to the addition of 1 μm dexamethasone to initiate nuclear translocation of the GR. Indirect Immunoflourescence—At various times after dexamethasone addition, the cells were fixed, permeabilized by immersion in cold (-20 °C) methanol, and immunostained by inverting the coverslip on 50 μl of a solution of phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 1 μl of FiGR mouse monoclonal IgG against the GR or 0.5 μl of rabbit polyclonal IgG against the myc tag of dynamitin.

Significance was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni t test. Immunoadsorption—For immunoadsorption of tubulin-containing GR complexes, L cells were incubated for 20 min with 10 μm paclitaxel prior to homogenization in HE buffer containing 20 mm Na2MoO4, 20 μm paclitaxel, and 100 μm GTP to stabilize the microtubules. Prior to GR immunoadsorption, 0.04% Nonidet P40 was added to the cytosol, and it was centrifuged for 15 min in an Airfuge. GR was immunoadsorbed from air centrifuged cytosol by incubating 250-μl aliquots for 3 h with rotation at 4 °C with 7 μl of FiGR antibody and 16 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% v/v glycerol, and protease inhibitors) containing 20 mm Na2MoO4. Immune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR2 for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 0.1% MAB1618 for dynein, 0.1% A-14 for myc-dynamitin, 0.2% anti-dynamitin serum for endogenous dynamitin, 0.1% UPJ56 for FKBP52, 0.1% anti-PP5, or 0.1% anti-tubulin. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counter antibody to visualize immunoreactive bands. For immunoadsorption of FKBP52, 300 μl of L cells were immunoadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose with 10 μl of UPJ56, and the immunoblot was probed with 1 μg/ml EC1 or 2 μg/ml anti-dynactin p50 for dynamitin or 2 μg/ml anti-p150Glued. Reconstitution of GR Heterocomplexes Containing Tubulin—Mouse GR was overexpressed in Sf9 cells as described previously (25Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), cytosol was prepared, and receptors were immunoadsorbed from 60-μl aliquots as described above. The immune pellets were washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer and then stripped of insect hsp90 by incubating for 2 h with 300 μl of TEG buffer containing 0.7 m NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The immune pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer containing 0.7 m NaCl and twice with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes were assembled by incubating these stripped GR immune pellets with 50 μl of cytosol from the GR- subline (E82.A3) of L929 cells containing 20 mm paclitaxel, 100 μm GTP, and 5 μl of an ATP-generating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, with suspension of the pellets by shaking of the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold TEG buffer with 20 mm Na2MoO4 and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Atomic Force Microscopy—To prepare samples for microscopy, FiGR-bound protein A-Sepharose pellets were incubated with 200 μl of L cell cytosol, and the immunoadsorbed GR was stripped of associated chaperones by incubating the immunopellet for 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The immunopellets were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system and washed once with TEG buffer and once with Hepes buffer. The GR and GR-bound proteins were released into the supernatant by incubating the pellets with 1 mm of epitope peptide in 50 μl of HE buffer with 20 mm Na2MoO4 for 5 min at 30 °C as described by Murphy et al. (26Murphy P.J.M. Morishima Y. Chen H. Galigniana M.D. Mansfield J.F. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34764-34773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, 16.7 μl of buffer was added, the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged, and 50 μl of the supernatant was collected for analysis by atomic force microscopy. All of the atomic force images were made with a Nanoscope IIIa Extended Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope from Digital Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA) using a 120 × 120 μm “JV” scanner and were conducted under fluid in tapping mode. NP-S oxide-sharpened silicon nitride probes with a spring constant of 0.32 N/m and a cantilever length of 100 μm were used for imaging. Nominal radius of curvature for tips was reported to be ≤40 nm by the manufacturer. Fresh mica substrates were prepared by cleaving the mica surface immediately preceding sample deposition. Ten μl of GR and associated proteins released from the FiGR-protein A-Sepharose pellet by peptide competition was deposited on the mica substrate and allowed to absorb for 2 min, and 120 μl of buffer was added to the fluid cell to ensure tip immersion. Scan parameters were optimized for each sample, with a typical tapping drive frequency of 9 kHz and a scan rate of 1 Hz. Images for each sample were obtained with a scan size of 1 × 1 μm. Because the theoretical width of the proteins is significantly smaller than the nominal tip radius, the height of each identified particle is used as a measure of its relative size. This makes it possible to limit the error associated with tip convolution artifacts. The heights of all identified particles were determined with Digital Instruments off-line section analysis routines. Previous studies have identified the relative height distortion caused by mica substrate surface interactions (27Betley T.A. Banaszak Holl M.M. Orr B.G. Swanson D.R. Tomalia D.A. Baker J.R. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 2768-2773Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and molecular mass was determined by comparing calculated particle size to known dendrimer and protein complex standards (27Betley T.A.

Methods. 2003; 29: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GR Transport by Expression of Dynamitin—To determine whether cytoplasmic dynein is required for rapid translocation to the nucleus, dexamethasone-dependent movement of the endogenous GR was examined in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts expressing myc-dynamitin. As shown in Fig. 1A, GRs (red) in cells not expressing myc-dynamitin have translocated to the nucleus within 10 min of exposure to dexamethasone. However, in the cell expressing myc-dynamitin (green), the liganded GR remains cytoplasmic. The time course in Fig. 1B shows that the rate of GR translocation is slowed from a t½ of ∼ 4 min in control cells (open squares) to a t½ of ∼40 min in cells overexpressing myc-dynamitin (solid squares). For purpose of comparison, Fig. 1C presents data from Galigniana et al. (13Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renior J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) showing inhibition of receptor translocation in 3T3 cells by treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (solid squares) and by overexpression of the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 (open circles). It is clear that dynamitin overexpression, geldanamycin treatment, and PPIase domain overexpression inhibit ligand-dependent GR translocation to the same extent. Dynamitin Is a Component of GR Heterocomplexes—Cytoplasmic dynein links to vesicles and organelles indirectly through dynactin (23Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), and it may be that nonvesicular proteins, such as the GR, link to dynein via dynactin as well. Dynamitin is a component of the dynactin complex, and we have shown previously that it binds directly to the PPIase domain of FKBP52, an hsp90-binding immunophilin component of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (11Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our interpretation of the dynamitin inhibition of GR movement shown in Fig. 1 is that the overexpressed myc-dynamitin is binding the immunophilin PPIase domain, and because myc-dynamitin is in great excess of dynein·dynactin, the great majority of the GR·hsp90·immunophilin complexes will bind to free myc-dynamitin that is not associated with the dynein·dynactin motor system. If this is the case, then myc-dynamitin should be present in GR heterocomplexes. We tested this proposal by immunoadsorbing GR from cytosol of L cells expressing myc-dynamitin and probed Western blots of the immunoadsorbate with anti-myc antibody to detect the presence of myc-dynamitin. L cells were chosen because they have a much higher level of GR (∼3-fold) than 3T3 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 2A, myc-dynamitin is present in GR·hsp90·immunophilin heterocomplexes. There are also GR heterocomplexes containing dynein, as shown by the presence of the dynein intermediate chain. It should be noted that myc-tagged dynamitin is present only in the low percentage of cells that are transfected, and the dynein shown in Fig. 2A is in GR heterocomplexes present in the great majority of cells that are not expressing myc-dynamitin. If the GR is linking to dynein via dynactin, then GR hetero-complexes immunoadsorbed from cytosol of untransfected L cells should contain endogenous dynamitin. Fig. 2B shows that immunoadsorption of the GR is accompanied by coadsorption of endogenous dynamitin as well as dynein. If proteins link to the dynein·dynactin motor system via hsp90-binding immunophilins, then immunoadsorption of an immunophilin should be accompanied by coadsorption of both dynein and dynactin proteins. Fig. 2C shows that immunoadsorption of FKBP52 from L cell cytosol yields coadsorption of the dynactin components dynamitin and p150Glued as well as dynein. GR Heterocomplexes Bind to Microtubules—Giannakakou et al. (21Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) ruptured cells in buffer containing paclitaxel and GTP to stabilize microtubules, and under those conditions, p53 immunoadsorption was accompanied by coimmunoadsorption of tubulin. In Fig. 3, GR was immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol prepared without and with these microtubule-stabilizing agents. Although dynein is present in GR immune pellets prepared under either condition, tubulin is present only in GR heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from cytosol prepared under microtubule stabilizing conditions. Inasmuch as the immunophilins link the GR·hsp90 complex to the dynein·dynactin motor complex via the immunophilin PPIase domain and dynein binds to microtubules, the presence of microtubules in the GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes should be PPIase domain-dependent. To determine whether this was the case, GR immune pellets were incubated with concentrated cytosol from E82.A3 cells. The E82 subline of L929 fibroblasts was selected for glucocorticoid resistance, and E82 cells do not contain any GR mRNA or GR protein (29Housley P.R. Forsthoefel A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of GR immune pellets with E82 cytosol containing paclitaxel and GTP to stabilize microtubules yielded assembly of GR·hsp90 complexes containing dynein and tubulin (lane 6). When the E82 cytosol was preincubated with the purified PPI-ase domain fragment of FKBP52, neither dynein nor tubulin were present in the heterocomplex (lane 4). This supports a model in which GR heterocomplexes are bound to microtubules through dynein. In Fig. 4B, GR heterocomplexes were assembled in microtubule-stabilized E82 cytosol in the presence or absence of the TPR domain fragment of PP5. As shown in lane 5, the TPR domain fragment competes for the presence of both FKBP52 and tubulin in the assembled GR heterocomplexes. Visualization of GR·hsp90·Immunophilin·Dynein Complexes by Atomic Force Microscopy—We have previously imaged both the GR and GR·hsp70 complexes by atomic force microscopy (26Murphy P.J.M. Morishima Y. Chen H. Galigniana M.D. Mansfield J.F. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34764-34773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the event that at least some of the very large receptor complexes with the movement machinery remain intact through the sample preparation procedure, we wanted to use this technique to visualize GR associated with the dynein motor protein complex. As we have previously reported, GR·hsp90·immunophilin·dynein complexes can be assembled by incubating stripped GR immune pellets with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (13Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renior J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The complexes can be released from the immune pellet by competition with epitope peptide (26Murphy P.J.M. Morishima Y. Chen H. Galigniana M.D. Mansfield J.F. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34764-34773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and Fig. 5A shows an immunoblot of three states of the GR released from the immunopellets: the stripped GR (Str) and the stripped GR that was incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence (-) or presence (+) of the PPIase domain fragment to compete for immunophilin association with the dynein·dynactin complex. Fig. 5 (C–F) shows the atomic force microscopy images of the no GR control (C), the stripped GR (D), the GR·hsp90·immunophilin complexes (E), and GR·hsp90·immunophilin complexes containing dynein (F). The heights of over 100 individual particles in each sample were determined, and a summary is presented in Fig. 5B, where the solid line shows complexes formed in the presence of the PPIase domain fragment to prevent GR heterocomplex association with dynein, and the dashed line represents the dynein-containing GR complexes distributing in multiple peaks. The largest complexes shown in white in Fig. 5F distribute between 16 and 20 nm in height (Fig. 5B, dashed line) and have a calculated molecular mass of ∼2.5 MDa. A GR·hsp90·immunophilin complex of 1:2:1 stoichiometry has a molecular mass of ∼350 kDa, which is the calculated mass of the smaller of the two peaks defined by the solid line in Fig. 5B. Dynein has a mass of ∼1.2 MDa (23Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The molecular composition of an associated dynactin complex in this case is not known, but assuming a minimum complex of only p150Glued, p135Glued, and dynamitin with a stoichiometry of 1:1:4 (30Schroer T.A. Bingham J.B. Gili S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 212-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the molecular mass would be ∼500 kDa. Thus, a predicted minimal size for GR·hsp90·immunophilin complexes containing dynein would be at least 2.05 MDa, which approaches the calculated molecular mass of the large white particles (Fig. 5F) of 16–20 nm in height (Fig. 5B, dashed line). Fig. 6 illustrates the GR movement system and the tools we have used to uncouple the movement system in vitro and to inhibit GR movement in vivo. As shown in Fig. 1, preventing the receptor from binding to hsp90 with geldanamycin, preventing the GR·hsp90·immunophilin complex from binding to dynamitin by overexpression of a PPIase domain fragment, and preventing the whole cargo complex from binding to dynein by overexpressing dynamitin all inhibit the rate of GR translocation to the nucleus to the same extent. When rapid, hsp90-dependent movement is inhibited by any of these methods, slow movement can occur. This slow movement apparently reflects diffusion, and in neurites where proteins cannot move by diffusion, geldanamycin blocks retrograde movement of the GR (31Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Housley P.R. Patterson C. Fisher S.K. Pratt W.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 123: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that hsp90 is required for rapid GR movement. We have previously reported a very weak interaction between the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 and the purified expressed intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein (18Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J.M. Chinkers M. Radanyi C. Renior J.M. Zhang M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PPI-ase domains engage in weak interactions with peptidyl prolines, and this binding could be nonspecific in this way. Subsequently, we showed that purified FKBP52 binds purified myc-dynamitin to form a complex that withstands rigorous washing conditions (11Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FKBP52 binding to dynamitin is blocked by competition with a purified PPIase domain fragment, suggesting that the PPIase domain directly interacts with dynamitin (11Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that dynamitin is present in GR heterocomplexes containing immunophilins. Thus, in the model of Fig. 6, we have suggested that dynamitin is the component of the dynein·dynactin complex with which the immunophilin in the GR heterocomplex interacts. Consistent with this model, immunoadsorption of FKBP52 is accompanied by coadsorption of the dynactin proteins dynamitin and p150Glued as well as dynein (Fig. 2C) Although immunolocalization studies with most antireceptor antibodies in most cells have found the GR to be diffusely located throughout the cytoplasm, in several reports, the Gustafsson laboratory was able to demonstrate colocalization of the GR with microtubules (reviewed in Ref. 32Akner G. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The vitamin D receptor has also been reported to colocalize with microtubules (33Barsony J. McKoy W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24457-24465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But the data of Fig. 3 present the first biochemical evidence of steroid receptor linkage to microtubules. In 1993, we reported that GRs in L cell cytosol were converted to particulate form under conditions that promote microtubule polymerization (34Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10879-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the particulate contained large amounts of actin and vimentin as well as tubulin, and the system did not permit analysis of how the GR was linked to the cytoskeleton. Thus, for the last decade we have focused on defining the proteins that are present in GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and the linkages involved (reviewed in Ref. 2Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, we see that immunoadsorption of GR from L cell cytosol prepared under conditions that stabilize microtubules yields coimmunoadsorption of tubulin. When GR heterocomplexes containing tubulin are assembled in stabilized cytosol, the presence of both tubulin and dynein in the heterocomplex is competed by the PPIase domain of FKBP52 (Fig. 4A), showing that the presence of tubulin is immunophilin-dependent. Consistent with this model, when GR heterocomplexes are assembled in the presence of a TPR domain fragment to compete for immunophilin binding to hsp90, the presence of both tubulin and FKBP52 in the complex is reduced. In that both dynein and tubulin are present in an immunophilin-dependent manner, it is reasonable to indicate in Fig. 6 that the dynein motor links the receptor heterocomplex to the microtubules. At this time, we are clearly at an early stage of understanding the role of hsp90 in signaling protein trafficking through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Whether hsp90 plays a general role in the targeted movement of proteins or a more specific role in the role in the movement of a limited number of transcription factors is not known. What we propose is that one function of the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery in forming client protein·hsp90 complexes is to “capture” proteins into multichaperone complexes that, through the hsp90-bound immunophilins, can link them to motor systems for their movement along cytoskeleton. An important concept is that the chaperone machinery can interact with proteins in their native, least energy state without regard to the size, shape, amino acid sequence, or function of a protein (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). This ability to interact with a wide variety of client proteins combined with the diversity that arises from the various TPR domain proteins that associate with the client protein and hsp90 may provide an integrated system for targeted movement of proteins to diverse sites of action within the cell.

Little is known concerning the mechanisms of target cell activation in this disease. The present study shows that NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways contribute to chemokine synthesis by lung epithelial cells in response to pneumococci. In infected lungs of mice pneumococci stimulate expression of the interleukin (IL)-8 homolog keratinocyte-derived chemokine and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, as well as activate p38 MAPK. Human bronchial epithelium was chosen as a cellular model, because it establishes the first barrier against pathogens, and little is known about its function in innate immunity. Pneumococci infection induces expression of IL-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as well as activation of p38 MAPK in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by SB202190 and SB203580 blocks pneumococci-induced cytokine release. In mouse lungs in vivo as well as in cultured cells, pneumococci activate NF-κBinanIκB kinase-dependent manner. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by chemical inhibitors or by RNA interference targeting p38α reduces pneumococci-induced NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. Blockade of p38 activity did not affect inducible nuclear translocation and recruitment of NF-κB/RelA to the IL-8 promotor but did reduce the level of phosphorylated RelA (serine 536) at IL-8 promotor and inhibited pneumococci-mediated recruitment of RNA polymerase II to IL-8 promotor.

Pneumonia is the most common infectious disease leading to death in industrialized countries (1Garibaldi R.A. Am. J. Med. 1985; 78: 32-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Over 40% of cases are due to infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, and high mortality has been reported (2Finch R. Clin. Microbiol.

Considering the medical relevance of these perilous bacteria, an increase in the knowledge and insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of pneumococci-host interaction appears expedient.

Under certain conditions, these transcription factors may be activated by a complex kinase pathway centered around p38 MAPK (11Koch A. Giembycz M. Ito K. Lim S. Jazrawi E. Barnes P.J. Adcock I. Erdmann E. Chung K.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 30: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, four isoforms of p38 MAPK (α, β, γ, and δ) with either activating or inhibiting activity on gene transcription have been characterized (12Pramanik R. Qi X. Borowicz S. Choubey D. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, their distinct roles in infectious disease pathogenesis remain to be clarified. Increasing evidence pointed to a critical role of transcription factor modification for the regulation of gene transcription. p38 MAPK-stimulated pathways may phosphorylate p65/RelA, thereby regulating NF-κB-dependent gene transcription (14Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 15Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Minhajuddin M. Bijli K.M. Javaid K. True A.L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, there are no reports addressing the role of these important regulation pathways during infection by intact bacteria. In this study we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci directly activate gene expression of lung epithelial cells by combined stimulation of p38 MAPK and of NF-κB. We report here that transcriptome analysis of isolated lungs obtained from a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia by DNA microarray revealed elevated mRNA levels of two cytokines KC, a functional murine IL-8 homolog (16Nick J.A. Young S.K. Arndt P.G. Lieber J.G. Suratt B.T. Poch K.R. Avdi N.J. Malcolm K.C. Taube C. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and GM-CSF. In addition, activation of p38 MAPK and of NF-κB pathway was noted in infected lungs. Pneumococci also induced IL-8 and GM-CSF gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Blocking of both the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and the canonical NF-κB pathway reduced pneumococci-dependent cytokine secretion. Subsequent studies demonstrated that pneumococci activated NF-κB in a p38 MAPK-independent manner, whereby p38 apparently regulates IL-8 transcription at the promotor level. Actually, both p38 MAPK and NF-κB are required to modulate the host response at the transcriptional level in response to pneumococci infection. Materials—SB202190, SB203580, and SB202474 were purchased from Calbiochem (Merck), TNFα from R & D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany), IKK-NBD from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and Pam 3-Cys from Invitrogen. Peptidoglycan was a kind gift from R. R. Schumann (Berlin, Germany). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources. Cell Lines—Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were a kindly gift of C. Harris (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (17Reddel R.R. Ke Y. Gerwin B.I. McMenamin M.G. Lechner J.F. Su R.T. Brash D.E. Park J.B. Rhim J.S. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1904-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Bacterial Strains—Pneumonia in mice was induced by the encapsulated S. pneumoniae type 3 (NCTC 7978). S. pneumoniae R6x is the unencapsulated derivative of type 2 strain D39 (18Tiraby J.G. Fox M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A pneumolysin-negative mutant of R6x (R6xply–) was generated by insertion-duplication mutagenesis using the pJDC9::ply construct (19Zysk G. Schneider-Wald B.K. Hwang J.H. Bejo L. Kim K.S. Mitchell T.J. Hakenbeck R. Heinz H.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After transformation of the plasmid into S. pneumoniae strain R6x, erythromycin-resistant transformants were selected. Insertion of the plasmid into pneumolysin encoding gene ply was confirmed by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Loss of function was analyzed using the hemolysis assay as described previously (20Benton K.A. Paton J.C. Briles D.E. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 23: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Single colony isolates of R6x and its corresponding mutant R6xply– were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. For cell culture stimulation studies, single colonies were expanded by resuspension in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and incubation at 37 °C for 3–4 h to midlog phase (A600 0.2–0.4), harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in cell culture medium without antibiotics. Plasmids, RNA Interference, and Transient Transfection Procedures—HEK293 cells were cultured in 12-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cells were co-transfected by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with 0.2 μg of NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter (21Krull M. Klucken A.C. Wuppermann F.N. Fuhrmann O. Magerl C. Seybold J. Hippenstiel S. Hegemann J.H. Jantos C.A. Suttorp N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4834-4841PubMed Google Scholar), 0.2 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase plasmid, 0.1 μg of hTLR2 (generously provided by Tularik Inc., San Francisco, CA (22Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar)) expression vectors, or control vector, respectively. The cells were incubated with R6xply– for 6 h, because pneumolysin is cytotoxic for Hek293 cells. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by using a luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and the results were normalized for transfection efficiency with values obtained by Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase (Roche Applied Science). For RNA interference experiments, the cells were transfected with p38α-specific Smartpool® or nonsense siRNA (both from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) using RNAiFect® (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions for 96 h and then processed as described above. IL-8 and GM-CSF ELISA—Confluent BEAS-2B cells were stimulated for 15 h as indicated in a humidified atmosphere. After the incubation, the supernatants were collected and processed for IL-8 or GM-CSF quantification by sandwich ELISA as described previously (23Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot—For determination of p38α expression or p38 MAPK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells, the cells were stimulated as indicated, washed twice, and harvested. For analysis of p38 phosphorylation pneumococci-infected mice, lungs were snap-frozen in fluid nitrogen and pulverized. BEAS-2B cells or lung homogenates were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted on Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection of p38α or phosphorylated p38 MAPK was carried out with p38α-specific antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling, Frankfurt, Germany) respectively (23Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of IκBα was analyzed in BEAS-2B cell lysates or lung homogenates using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (24Hippenstiel S. Schmeck B. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Suttorp N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In all of the experiments, ERK2 kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was detected simultaneously to confirm equal protein load. The proteins were visualized by incubation with secondary IRDye 800- or Cy5.5-labeled antibodies, respectively (Odyssey infrared imaging system, LI-COR Inc.) (24Hippenstiel S. Schmeck B. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Suttorp N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Hippenstiel S. Witzenrath M. Schmeck B. Hocke A. Krisp M. Krull M. Seybold J. Seeger W. Rascher W. Schutte H. Suttorp N. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—For analysis of IL-8, GM-CSF, and GAPDH gene expression in BEAS-2B cells, total RNA was isolated with RNEasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Generated cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific intron-spanning specific primers for IL-8, GM-CSF, and GAPDH. In isolated mice lungs, KC, GM-CSF, and GAPDH were analyzed after isolation of total cellular RNA. Frozen lung tissue was crushed using a sterile, nitrogen-cooled plate homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted using a RNEasy mini isolation kit. All of the primers were purchased from TIB MOLBIOL (Berlin, Germany). After 35 amplification cycles, the PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and subsequently visualized. To confirm use of equal amounts of RNA in each experiment, all of the samples were checked for GAPDH mRNA expression. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—After stimulation of BEAS-2B cells, nuclear protein was isolated and analyzed by EMSA as described previously (21Krull M. Klucken A.C. Wuppermann F.N. Fuhrmann O. Magerl C. Seybold J. Hippenstiel S. Hegemann J.H. Jantos C.A. Suttorp N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4834-4841PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hippenstiel S. Schmeck B. Seybold J. Krull M.

Inflammation. 2003; 27: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IRDye800-labeled consensus NF-κB oligonucleotides were purchased from Metabion (Planegg-Martinsried, Germany). Briefly, EMSA binding reactions were performed by incubating 2 μg of nuclear extract with the annealed oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% native gel and analyzed by an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Inc.). NF-κB Transcription Factor Assay Kit (TransAM™)—The NF-κB TransAM™ assay (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was used to detect DNA binding of p65/RelA containing NF-κB dimers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, BEAS-2B cells were stimulated, and 10 μg of nuclear cell extract (containing activated transcription factor) were given in oligonucleotide-coated wells. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature with mild agitation, the plate was washed, and 100 μl/well of the diluted p65/RelA antibody (1:1000) was incubated for 1 h. The plate was washed three times and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000) was added for 1 h. Developing solution was incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—BEAS-2B cells were stimulated, culture medium was removed, and 1% formaldehyde was added. After 1 min, the cells were washed in ice-cold 0.125 m glycin in PBS, then rapidly collected in ice-cold PBS, centrifuged, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% desoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin), and the chromatin was sheared by sonication. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were stored in aliquots at –80 °C until further use. Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) (p65-Pser536) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (p65/RelA and polymerase II). Immunoprecipitations from soluble chromatin were carried out overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose for 60 min and washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with high salt buffer (2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% desoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA) followed by another wash in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and one wash with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were extracted in elution buffer (1 TE buffer containing 1% SDS) by shaking the lysates for 15 min at 1200 rpm, 30 °C. They were then digested with RNase (1 μg/20 μl) for 30 min at 37 °C. After proteinase K digestion (1 μg/8 μl for 6 h at 37 °C and 6 h at 65 °C) DNA was extracted using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). IL-8 promotor DNA was amplified by PCR using Hotstart Taq (Qiagen) polymerase. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 15 min and 33–35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 20 s. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining of gels. Equal amounts of input DNA was controlled by gel electrophoresis. The following promotor-specific primers for IL-8 were used: sense, 5′-AAG AAA ACT TTC GTC ATA CTC CG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGG CTT TTT ATA TCA TCA CCC TAC-3′. Mouse Pneumonia Model—Pathogen-free, female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The animals were kept with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to food and water. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the care of animal subjects. The mice were challenged at 10 weeks of age and 19–20 grams of weight. Pneumonia was induced by use of encapsulated S. pneumoniae type 3 (NCTC 7978). The bacteria were grown as described above and resuspended in sterile PBS at ∼2.5 × 108 cfu/ml. The mice were lightly anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine and inoculated intranasally with 20 μl of bacterial suspension (5 × 106 cfu). The control mice were challenged with 20 μl of sterile PBS. Groups of three mice were sacrificed 6, 12, 24, or 48 h postinfection, and the lungs were removed aseptically and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The control mice were sacrificed 6 h postinfection (n = 3). Microarray Transcriptome Analysis—Microarray experiments were done as two-color hybridizations. Total RNA was extracted from whole lungs of at least three C57BL/6 mice at 12, 24, and 48 h after infection and from at least three noninfected C57BL/6 control mice by lysis in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) per lung using an Ultraturrax T8 (IKA) homogenisator. Homogenates from each group were pooled, shock-frozen, and stored at –70 °C. An amount of 4 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with an oligo(dT)-T7-promotor primer by a fluorescent linear amplification reaction (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and cDNA was labeled either with cyanine 3-CTP or cyanine 5-CTP (New England Biolabs Life Science Products, Beverly, MA). To compensate specific effects of dyes, e.g. incorporation, and to ensure statistically relevant data analysis, a color swap was performed. The RNA samples were labeled vice versa with the two fluorescent dyes (fluorescence reversal). After precipitation, purification, and quantification, 1.25 μg of each labeled cRNA was mixed, fragmented, and hybridized to the 8.4 K custom in situ mouse array according to the supplier's protocol (Agilent Technologies). Scanning of microarrays was performed with 5-μm resolution using a DNA microarray laser scanner (Agilent Technologies). The features were extracted with an image analysis tool (version A4.045) from Agilent Technologies using default settings. The data analysis was carried out on the Rosetta Inpharmatics platform Resolver Built 3.0.0.3.22. Statistical Methods—A one-way analysis of variance was used for data of Figs. 1 (B and D), 3(A, C, and D), 5, 6 (A and B), and 7A, and the data are shown as the means ± S.E. for one representative experiment of three. The main effects were then compared by an F probability test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant and indicated by asterisks (if not indicated otherwise, the test was performed versus control).Fig. 3p38 MAPK inhibition blocked pneumococci-induced IL-8 and GM-CSF expression. BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with indicated doses of specific p38 inhibitor SB202190, SB203580, or non-active control compound SB202474 for 20 min and then infected with R6x or stimulated with TNFα/IL-1β for 15 h, and release of IL-8 (A) and GM-CSF (C) was assessed by ELISA. B, BEAS-2B were pretreated with 10 μm SB202190 for 20 min and then infected with 107 cfu/ml R6x for 3 h, and IL-8 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. One representative gel of three is shown.

In transcriptome analysis of infected lungs, we found a time-dependent increase in mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokines KC (12 h, 13.79-fold; 24 h, 10.39-fold; and 48 h, 10.72-fold) and GM-CSF (12 h, 2.13-fold; 24 h, 1.35-fold; and 48 h, 1.16-fold) with p values smaller than 0.01. Using RT-PCR we verified increased mRNA expression of KC and GM-CSF in pneumococcal-infected lungs and noted strongly elevated KC and GM-CSF mRNA levels 6 and 12h post infection (Fig. 1A). These data cannot be assigned to one single cell type. We have picked human bronchial epithelium as an interesting cellular model, because it establishes the first barrier against pathogens, including pneumococci entering the lung by the airways. Moreover, little is known about its function in innate immunity. Pneumococci-stimulated expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by tracheobronchial epithelium may contribute significantly to the prominent leukocyte recruitment observed in pneumococci-pneumonia. S. pneumoniae NCTC 7978 revealed massive cytotoxic effects in vitro (data not shown). Therefore, we stimulated human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with S. pneumoniae R6x and analyzed IL-8 (the functional human KC homolog (16Nick J.A. Young S.K. Arndt P.G. Lieber J.G. Suratt B.T. Poch K.R. Avdi N.J. Malcolm K.C. Taube C. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)) and GM-CSF expression. Pneumococci infection of BEAS-2B cells dose-dependently induced the release of IL-8 (Fig. 1B) and GM-CSF (Fig. 1D) by these cells. Onset of IL-8 mRNA expression was noted as early as 2 h post-infection (Fig. 1C). Pneumococcal infection was at least as effective as cell stimulation of BEAS-2B cells by TNFα/IL-1β. Inhibition of p38 MAPK Blocked Pneumococci-induced Expression of IL-8 and GM-CSF in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells—Activation of p38 MAPK is considered to participate in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. We noted phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in mice lungs 6–48 h post infection with pneumococci, indicating kinase activation (Fig. 2A). Moreover, exposure of BEAS-2B cells to 106 cfu/ml of S. pneumoniae for 2 h strongly induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by pneumococcal infection of epithelial cells was detected after 1 h of cell infection and increased up to 3 h (Fig. 2C). To test the role of p38 MAPK activation for IL-8 and GM-CSF expression, we made use of specific chemical inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580 and its nonfunctional homolog SB202474. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in BEAS-2B cells by pre-incubation of cells with SB202190 or SB202580 20 min before pneumococcal infection dose-dependently blocked release of IL-8 (Fig. 3A) and significantly decreased liberation of GM-CSF, whereas the nonfunctional homolog SB202474 or solvent alone had no effect (Fig. 3, A and C). All three compounds or their solvents had no effect on spontaneous or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated IL-8 release in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 3D). Moreover, inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced expression of IL-8 mRNA by BEAS-2B cells after 3 h of incubation with 107 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae (Fig. 3B). Therefore, pneumococci-dependent p38"
https://openalex.org/W1964162519,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases play a pivotal role in the macrophages in the production of proinflammatory cytokines triggered by lipopolysaccharides. However, their function in the responses of macrophages to Gram-positive bacteria is poorly understood. Even less is known about the attenuation of MAP kinase signaling in macrophages exposed to Gram-positive bacteria. In the present study, we have investigated the regulation of MAP kinases and the role of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines using murine RAW264.7 and primary peritoneal macrophages after peptidoglycan stimulation. Treatment of macrophages with peptidoglycan resulted in a transient activation of JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Most interestingly, MKP-1 expression was potently induced by peptidoglycan, and this induction was concurrent with MAP kinase dephosphorylation. Triptolide, a diterpenoid triepoxide, potently blocked the induction of MKP-1 by peptidoglycan and prolonged the activation of JNK and p38. Overexpression of MKP-1 substantially attenuated the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced by peptidoglycan, whereas knockdown of MKP-1 by small interfering RNA substantially increased the production of both TNF-α and interleukin-1β. Finally, we found that in primary murine peritoneal macrophages, MKP-1 induction following peptidoglycan stimulation also coincided with inactivation of JNK and p38. Blockade of MKP-1 induction resulted in a sustained activation of both JNK and p38 in primary macrophages. Our results reveal that MKP-1 critically regulates the expression of TNF-α and interleukin-1β in RAW264.7 cells and further suggest a central role for this phosphatase in controlling the inflammatory responses of primary macrophages to Gram-positive bacterial infection.

Sepsis represents a major challenge to the health care system, affecting about 751,000 people, causing ∼215,000 deaths, and costing nearly $17 billion annually in the United States (1Martin G.S. Mannino D.M. Eaton S. Moss M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar).

For decades, group B Streptococcus has been the single most frequent cause of sepsis in newborns, and it remains a primary cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality (3Schrag S.J. Zywicki S.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading agent causing invasive bacterial infections in children and is among the most common bacteria causing meningitis in children and young adults (5Hoffman J.A. Mason E.O. Schutze G.E. Tan T.Q. Barson W.J. Givner L.B. Wald E.R. Bradley J.S. Yogev R. Kaplan S.L. Pediatrics. 2003; 112: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, multidrug-resistant species of Gram-positive bacteria have emerged, further exacerbating the threat to public health (6Canton R. Coque T.M. Baquero F. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sepsis is associated with important hemodynamic alterations, including decreased central blood volume, systolic alterations of ventricular function, and severe peripheral vasodilatation leading to profound alterations in blood distribution (7Vieillard-Baron A. Prin S. Chergui K. Dubourg O. Jardin F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 1270-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms leading to hemodynamic disturbances and organ failure in patients with severe sepsis are not yet fully understood, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TLR, Toll-like receptor; PepG, peptidoglycan; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MK2, MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 or MAPKAPK-2; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; JIP, JNK-interacting protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; IL, interleukin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TLR, Toll-like receptor; PepG, peptidoglycan; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MK2, MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 or MAPKAPK-2; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; JIP, JNK-interacting protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; IL, interleukin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-1β, and IL-6, appear to play an important role in mediating the pathophysiological process (8Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 9Dinarello C.A. Chest. 1997; 112: S321-S329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 10Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). As critical constituents of the antimicrobial arsenal produced primarily by macrophages, these inflammatory cytokines induce local inflammation and recruit neutrophils to the infection site, thereby containing the invading pathogens (11Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 12Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines are vital for the initiation of the acute-phase responses in the liver and contribute to the induction of adaptive immunity mediated by lymphocytes (13Suffredini A.F. Fantuzzi G. Badolato R. Oppenheim J.J. O'Grady N.P. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Although these cytokines play a critical role in host defense against pathogenic infection, their overproduction can cause septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and even death (14Beutler B. J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar). The critical roles of TNF-α in immune defense and in the pathogenesis of sepsis are highlighted by findings illustrating that mice lacking a TNF-α receptor gene are resistant to septic shock but unable to control local bacterial infection (15Rothe J.

In addition to acute inflammatory disorders, excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is also implicated in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, asthma, and systemic lupus erythematosus (17O'Shea J.J. Ma A. Lipsky P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, both the induction and termination of pro-inflammatory cytokine production are crucial for maintaining an appropriate immune defense while avoiding potentially devastating pathological consequences. Cytokine biosynthesis in macrophages relies on a series of signal transduction cascades initiated by microbial components through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (18Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 19Takeuchi O. Akira S. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 20Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These pathways are most thoroughly studied with regard to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria (18Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Recognition of LPS by TLR-4 triggers a cascade of signaling events that lead to activation of transcription factor NF-κB and the MAP kinase pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK, and p38 subfamilies (18Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 21Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase family plays a crucial role in mediating the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, through multiple mechanisms involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory events (18Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 21Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp.

Peptidoglycan (PepG) and lipoteichoic acid are two major cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria (23Foster K.D. Conn C.A. Kluger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: R211-R215PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kengatharan K.M. De Kimpe S. Robson C. Foster S.J. Thiemermann C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Unlike LPS that is recognized by TLR-4, both PepG and lipoteichoic acid are recognized by TLR-2 (20Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 25Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol.

Both PepG and lipoteichoic acid have been reported to activate MAP kinases and induce production of inflammatory cytokines (2Wang J.E. Dahle M.K. Yndestad A. Bauer I. McDonald M.C. Aukrust P.

Immun. 2000; 68: 3965-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), yet the roles of MAP kinases in this process are still not well defined. Also poorly understood are the mechanisms responsible for terminating the MAP kinase cascades during the macrophage responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Previously, we have demonstrated that MKP-1 acts as a feedback control mediator and serves to restrain the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages (30Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have studied the role of MKP-1 during the macrophage responses to Gram-positive bacteria by using PepG and murine RAW264.7 or primary macrophages as a model system. We found that MKP-1 was highly induced by PepG, and its induction coincided with the inactivation of both JNK and p38. MKP-1 overexpression inhibited the production of TNF-α induced by PepG, whereas down-regulation of MKP-1 by siRNA increased the production of both TNF-α and IL-1β. By using thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages, we demonstrated that MKP-1 induction occurred concomitantly with inactivation of p38 and JNK, whereas suppressing MKP-1 induction with triptolide delayed the inactivation of these MAP kinases. Our results suggest that MKP-1 plays an important role in controlling the inflammatory responses of macrophages to Gram-positive bacterial infection. Mice—Pathogen-free female C57BL6 and C3H/HeN mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). The TLR-4-deficient female C3H/HeJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice were maintained at 24 °C in an atmosphere with relative humidity between 30 and 70% on a 12-h day-night rhythm on Harlan Tecklad irradiated diet (Harlan Sprague-Dawley). All animals received humane care in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Reagents—PepG, isolated from S. aureus (Sigma), was dissolved in PBS through sonication and added to the culture medium to the indicated concentrations. Triptolide (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the culture medium to the indicated concentrations. The MEK inhibitor U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the medium 30 min before the addition of PepG. Polymyxin B (Sigma) was dissolved in serum-free medium. Plasmids—The mammalian expression vector pSRα-FLAG and pSRα-FLAG-MKP-1 are as described previously (30Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C.

The JIP-1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Davis (32Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To construct a vector expressing a hairpin small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mouse MKP-1, a pair of complementary oligonucleotides (5′-TCGAGGTCTTCTTTCTCCAAGGAGTTCAAGAGACTCCTTGGAGAAAGAAGACTTTTT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAAAAGTCTTCTTTCTCCAAGGAGTCTCTTGAACTCCTTGGAGAAAGAAGACC-3′) was designed, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and annealed. The resultant double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned between the SalI and XbaI sites of pSuppressorNeo (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) using standard molecular biology techniques (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The authenticity of the plasmid construct was confirmed by sequencing. Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ, or C57BL6 mice by peritoneal lavage as described previously (34Handel-Fernandez M.E. Lopez D.M. Paulnock D.M. Macrophages. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 1-30Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally (2 ml/mouse) with 3% Brewer Thioglycollate Medium (BD Diagnostic, Sparks, MD). Four days later, cells were harvested by lavage with cold RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Peritoneal cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS, and plated into tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h, washed free of nonadherent cells, and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS. Cell Culture and Transfection—RAW264.7 cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) together with either the pSRα-FLAG-MKP-1, or the empty vector pSRα, or with the MKP-1 siRNA expression plasmid, using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's specifications. After transfection, cells were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml of G418 (Roche Diagnostics) for 2 weeks, and individual G418-resistant clones were isolated. These clones were propagated and screened for MKP-1 expression by Western blot analyses either using a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Sigma) or using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MKP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Stable RAW264.7 clones expressing either FLAG-tagged MKP-1 or an MKP-1 siRNA or carrying the empty vector were maintained in medium containing 120 μg/ml G418. To examine the effect of JIP-1 overexpression on PepG-stimulated TNF-α production, RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with pDsRed2 (encoding a red fluorescent protein) together with either pcDNA3 or the JIP-1 expression vector at a ratio of 1:10 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Sixteen hours later, cells were trypsinized, and DsRed-positive cells were isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These DsRed-positive cells were plated into 6-well plates and stimulated with 10 μg/ml PepG on the next day. Western Blotting and ELISA—To isolate total lysate protein, cells were harvested in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Western blot analysis was essentially conducted as described previously by using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) (30Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J.

MKP-1 levels were assessed by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylated ERK, JNK, and p38 were detected using rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Total JNK1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total p38 was detected using a monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The levels of active MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (hereafter referred to as MK2) were determined by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling). FLAG-tagged MKP-1 was detected using a monoclonal antibody (clone M2) against FLAG (Sigma). β-Actin was detected using a monoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. IL-1β in the cell lysates was detected by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse IL-1β (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). TNF-α concentrations in the culture medium were measured using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immune Complex Kinase Assays—JNK1 and MK2 activities were measured by immune complex kinase assays as described previously (36Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, endogenous MK2 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of RAW264.7 lysate protein using 3 μg of rabbit polyclonal antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Jacques Landry, l'Université Laval, Quebec, Canada) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell lysates using 1 μg of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose (36Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the kinase activity in the MK2 immune complexes was assayed using [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) as a substrate (37Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Chen P. Hutter D. Liu P. Liu Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). JNK1 activity was assayed using recombinant GST-c-Jun-(1–143) as a substrate (39Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Northern blot analysis was performed using a mouse MKP-1 cDNA as a probe, as described previously (30Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 40Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an oligonucleotide corresponding to 18 S rRNA to normalize for differences in sample loading (30Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 40Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Statistics—The results from the experiments assessing the effects of MAP kinase or MKP-1 modulation on TNF-α production were analyzed by one-, two-, or three-way analysis of variance with the least significant difference post hoc test, using an SPSS statistical software program (Aspire Software International, Leesburg, VA). The TNF-α values were transformed to a logarithmic scale to normalize the variances. All comparisons are interpreted as being statistically significant at p < 0.05. Stimulation of RAW264.7 Macrophages with PepG Causes a Transient Activation of MAP Kinases—To investigate the effect of PepG on MAP kinases in macrophages, subconfluent RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml PepG, and cell lysates were harvested after specified periods. The activities of ERK and p38 were assessed by Western blot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies that recognize either active ERK or active p38 (Fig. 1A). Both ERK and p38 were activated rapidly in response to PepG, with peak activities attained at about 30 min after the addition of PepG. p38 activity then gradually decreased, returning to close to basal levels by 2 h. In contrast, ERK activity induced by PepG was sustained, although slight decreases in phospho-ERK levels were observed after 2 h. Western blot analysis of these blots with housekeeping protein β-actin confirmed equivalent protein loading among all the samples. The kinetics of JNK1 activation was examined by immune complex kinase assays, using a recombinant GST-c-Jun protein as a substrate. As observed with p38, JNK1 was rapidly activated in response to PepG treatment, as indicated by the incorporation of 32P into GST-c-Jun (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Although significant activation of JNK1 was detected as early as 15 min after PepG treatment, maximal activity of JNK1 was observed between 30 and 45 min. As with p38, JNK1 activity was rapidly attenuated after the initial peak (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of the cell lysates indicated that the total JNK1 protein levels did not change with PepG treatment (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Inactivation of JNK and p38 in PepG-stimulated RAW264.7 Macrophages Correlates with Accumulation of MKP-1 Protein—MKP-1 is a dual specificity protein phosphatase, widely expressed in a variety of cell types (41Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 42Sun J.B. Rask C. Olsson T. Holmgren J. Czerkinsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies have indicated that MKP-1 protein preferentially inactivates p38 and JNK (44Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MKP-1 plays a role in the dephosphorylation of JNK and p38 after PepG stimulation, the kinetics of MKP-1 protein induction after PepG stimulation was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). MKP-1 protein levels were practically undetectable in control cells. Upon PepG treatment, MKP-1 protein levels gradually increased, becoming detectable by 45 min and reaching peak levels between 1 and 2 h. The reciprocal relationship between MKP-1 induction and inactivation of both JNK and p38 supported the notion that MKP-1 may be involved in the dephosphorylation of these kinases, thereby contributing to the termination of the signaling pathways driving cytokine synthesis. To understand the mechanisms of MKP-1 induction by PepG, MKP-1 mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Mirroring the pattern of MKP-1 protein expression, basal MKP-1 mRNA levels were essentially undetectable in control cells. Upon PepG stimulation, the MKP-1 mRNA levels rapidly increased, reaching maximum peak by 1 h. These levels substantially decreased by 2 h, but remained elevated compared with base line for at least 6 h. It has been shown that in response to LPS stimulation, MK2 is phosphorylated by p38 and plays an important role in mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (45Rouse J. Cohen P.

https://openalex.org/W2121713067,"Recent work has shown that Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic proteins partially deplete the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ store and that this alteration of Ca2+ signaling reduces cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. We expressed in HeLa cells Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-2/Bax chimeras in which the putative pore-forming domains of the two proteins (α5-α6) were mutually swapped, comparing the effects on Ca2+ signaling of the two proteins and relating them to defined molecular domains. The results showed that only Bcl-2 reduces ER Ca2+ levels and that this effect does not depend on the α5-α6 helices of this oncoprotein. Soon after its expression, Bax increased ER Ca2+ loading, with ensuing potentiation of mitochondrial Ca2+ responses. Then the cells progressed into an apoptotic phenotype (which included drastic reductions of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses and alterations of organelle morphology).

These results provide a coherent scenario that high-lights a primary role of Ca2+ signals in deciphering apoptotic stimuli. In recent years, great attention has been placed on the possible correlation between the effects of members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins on Ca2+ homeostasis and their role in the control of apoptosis (1Demaurex N. Distelhorst C. Science. 2003; 300: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 was the first family member proposed to have the ability to alter intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (2Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific localization of Bcl-2 in the membranes of ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; AEQ, aequorin probe; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; Dox, doxycycline; BH, Bcl-2 homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and mitochondria and the demonstration that Bcl-2 acts as an ion channel when inserted into lipid bilayers (3Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) suggest that Ca2+ signaling could be a target of the action of this anti-apoptotic oncoprotein. In previous work, we and others (4Pinton P. Ferrari D. Magalhaes P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 5Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C. Kelley W.L. Tschopp J. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) reported that Bcl-2 reduces the state of filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores (ER and Golgi apparatus). Consequently, [Ca2+] increases caused by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-generating agonists are blunted in both the cytosol and mitochondria in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (4Pinton P. Ferrari D. Magalhaes P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 5Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C.

This alteration of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis reduces the efficacy of apoptotic mediators such as ceramide (6Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The interference of other members of Bcl-2 family with Ca2+ signaling has been described in different models. Lymphocytes from mice lacking Bim do not undergo apoptosis when Ca2+ homeostasis is disrupted by ionophores (7Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 homologue Bcl-XL has been shown to prevent apoptosis of cells at a stage downstream of ER Ca2+ release and capacitative Ca2+ entry (8Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, the proapoptotic proteins Bax, Bak, and Bad were also implicated in regulating Ca2+ dynamics. Bax/Bak overexpression is reported to favor the transfer of Ca2+ from ER to mitochondria, thus inducing cell death (9Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Nutt L.K. Chandra J. Pataer A. Fang B. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. O'Neil R.G. McConkey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20301-20308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and mice deficient in both Bax and Bad show a decrease in ER Ca2+ stores and a resistance to a wide range of apoptotic stimuli (11Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 related proteins possess conserved α-helices with sequence conservation clustered in Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains, which enable the different members of the family to form either homo- or heterodimers and to regulate each other (12Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, harbor at least three BH domains. Among the death promoters, some proteins (e.g. Bax, Bak) contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 and closely resemble Bcl-2. Others (e.g. Bid, Bad) possess only the BH3 domain. Most Bcl-2-related proteins also contain a C-terminal ∼20-residue hydrophobic domain that targets them to intracellular membranes. In the case of Bcl-2, this transmembrane domain functions as a signal anchor that targets and inserts the protein in a Ncyt-Cin orientation into the two main membrane locations for this protein: the mitochondrial outer membrane and the endoplasmic/nuclear envelope (13Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Bax, the transmembrane domain was reported to permit its translocation from the cytosol to mitochondrial membranes upon overexpression and/or induction of cell death (14Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent works have show that Bax is present also in the ER/microsome subcellular compartments (11Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 15Krajewski S. Blomqvist C. Franssila K. Krajewska M. Wasenius V.M. Niskanen E. Nordling S. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4471-4478PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bcl-2 and related proteins have structural similarities with pore-forming bacterial toxins and can create ion channels in artificial membranes (16Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 17Saito M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schlesinger P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In particular, the predicted fifth and sixth α-helices of Bcl-2 and Bax are hypothesized to directly participate in channel formation. These α-helices are positioned in the core of these proteins and are believed to be inserted into the lipid bilayer with the loop connecting α5 and α6 presumably protruding from the other side of the membrane (16Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of the α5-α6 regions from Bcl-2 abolishes its ability to form ion channels in synthetic membranes in vitro (3Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The structural basis for differences in the channels formed in vitro by Bcl-2 and Bax is unknown but could be due, at least in part, to differences between the polar residues of the α5-α6 regions (reviewed in Ref. 16Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this work, we have employed aequorin-based recombinant probes targeted to specific intracellular localizations and used two cellular models (stable inducible clones versus transient expression) to evaluate the effect of Bax overexpression on subcellular Ca2+ homeostasis. We then analyzed the role of the presumed channel-forming α5-α6 helices of Bcl-2 and Bax in Ca2+ mobilization by using two chimerical constructs in which the putative pore domains of the proteins were mutually swapped. Reagents—Ionomycin, histamine, ATP, digitonin, N-acetyl-d-sphin-gosine (C2-ceramide), Geneticin, hygromycin B, and doxycycline were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and coelenterazine was purchased from Molecular Probes. Generation of the Bax Tet-off Cell Line—Bax Tet-off cell lines were generated by co-transfecting pTRE-Bax with pTK-Hyg at a ratio of 20:1, using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, into a HeLa Tet-off cell line (HeLa cell line stably transfected with pTet-off regulatory vector with resistance to neomycin) (Clontech, Cambridge, UK). Transfected cells were selected for growth in the presence of 400 μg of hygromycin B and 400 μg of Geneticin/ml of culture medium. Single colonies of resistant cells were tested for doxycycline (Dox) withdrawal-dependent expression of Bax by Western blot. Cell Culture—HeLa cells and Bax stable clone were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Cellbio, Euroclone) in 75-cm2 Falcon flasks. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 90% relative humidity. The Bax stable clone was maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with hygromycin B and Geneticin in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline (added every 48 h). Constructs—For calcium analyses, we used aequorin probes targeted to the ER (erAEQ) or mitochondria (mtAEQ-wt and the low affinity probe mtAEQ-mut) or the cytosolic aequorin probe (cytAEQ) (18Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For subcellular structural analyses, we used a mitochondrially targeted GFP probe (mtGFP) (18Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The wild-type human Bcl-2 and Bax cDNAs and the chimeric Bcl-2/Bax(α5-α6) and Bax/Bcl-2(α5-α6) constructs are cloned in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (19Matsuyama S. Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30995-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pTRE-Bax construct was generated by subcloning human Bax cDNA into pTRE vector (doxycycline response plasmid) (Clontech) under the control of the tetracycline response element. Transient Transfection—Transient transfection was carried out using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. For aequorin measurements, the cells were seeded onto 13-mm coverslips and co-transfected with the mtGFP (control) or the expression plasmid of interest (Bcl-2, Bax, Bax/Bcl-2(α5-α6), or Bcl-2/Bax(α5-α6) and the various recombinant aequorin probes in a 3:1 ratio (3 μg versus 1 μg), thus favoring the expression of the protein of interest in the same subset of cells expressing recombinant aequorin. For mitochondrial morphological analyses and C2-ceramide experiments, co-transfection was performed on 24-mm glass coverslips with 2 μg of mitochondrial targeted GFP and 6 μg of each construct. Control cells were transfected with 8 μg of mtGFP only. For all experiments analyses were performed 24–36 h after transfection. Aequorin Measurements—For cytAEQ mtAEQmut and mtAEQwt, 24–36 h post-transfection the coverslips were incubated with 5 μm coelenterazine for 2 h in Krebs-Ringer modified buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 (KRB: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 37 °C). For reconstituting erAEQmut with high efficiency the luminal [Ca2+] of the ER was first reduced. This was done by incubating the cells for 1 h at 4 °C in KRB supplemented with 5 μm n-coelenterazine, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, and 600 μm EGTA. After this incubation, the cells were extensively washed with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mm EGTA before the luminescence measurement was initiated. All aequorin measurements were carried out in a purpose-built luminometer in KRB supplemented with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 100 μm EGTA. Agonists (ATP or histamine at 100 μm) were added to the same medium (see legends for Figs. 1 and 2). The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated into [Ca2+] values as described previously (18Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Characterization of the Bax-inducible stable clone.

After three washes with PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h. Immunostaining was performed with anti-Bax antibody (diluted 1:200 in 3% BSA) for 1 h. After three washes with PBS (5 min each), immunodetection was carried out using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:200 in 3% BSA). Microscopic Analyses—Mitochondrial morphological analyses were performed 36 h post-transfection. 24-mm coverslips containing the cells were placed in a thermostatted Leyden chamber (model TC-202A; Medical system Corp.) on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, SPA, Milano, Italy) equipped with epifluorescence and piezoelectric motorization of the objective (Physik Instrumente). Fluorescent images were captured by a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap, Roper Scientific, Inc.) and analyzed using Metamorph 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Z-series images were deconvolved using Exhaustive Photon Reassignment (EPR) software, a point spread function-based deconvolution algorithm developed by the University of Massachusetts Imaging Group (20Carrington W.A.

Apoptosis Analyses—Apoptosis was evaluated by counting apoptotic nuclei (fragmented nuclei) among GFP-positive cells using 7-amino actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) nuclear staining. At 36 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After two washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with Triton 0.2% in PBS for 10 min and washed again with PBS. Samples were then incubated with 7-amino actinomycin D at room temperature for 15 min. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from at least 400 GFP-positive cells in three or more independent experiments. For C2-ceramide treatment, cells transfected with mtGFP alone (control) or co-transfected with mtGFP and the plasmid of interest (see “Transient Transfection”) were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 10 μm C2-ceramide for 16 h. Cell viability was assessed by microscope count of living GFP-expressing cells. Data are expressed as the percentage of fluorescent cells in different microscope field. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. A p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. All data are reported as means ± S.E. Transient Overexpression of Bax in HeLa Cells Drastically Reduces Mitochondrial Ca2+ Responses but Leaves ER Ca2+ Levels Unaffected—The first task of this work was to evaluate the effect of Bax overexpression on subcellular Ca2+ homeostasis in transiently transfected HeLa cells, i.e. the same cell model in which the effect of Bcl-2 on Ca2+ signaling was detected and analyzed previously (4Pinton P. Ferrari D. Magalhaes P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We used targeted chimeras of the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin to monitor the dynamics of agonist-dependent [Ca2+] changes occurring in the cytoplasm and in organelles acting as the source (ER) or target (mitochondria) of Ca2+ signals. We investigated the response to ATP, which acts on Gq-coupled plasma membrane receptors and causes the production of IP3, thus releasing Ca2+ from the ER, followed by sustained influx from the extracellular medium through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. In these experiments, as shown in Fig. 1, HeLa cells were either co-transfected with Bax and the aequorin chimera of interest (traces labeled Bax) or transfected only with the aequorin probe (controls). Where indicated, the cells were challenged with ATP. The most striking result was the drastic reduction of the mitochondrial Ca2+ rise evoked by agonist stimulation in Bax overexpressing cells: peak value 59 ± 9 μm in Bax cells versus 86 ± 9 μm in control cells (n = 7, n = 11, respectively, p < 0.01 (Fig. 1B)), i.e. a 32% decrease in amplitude versus control cells. In contrast, a small (9%), albeit statistically significant reduction was detected in the cytosolic Ca2+ peak (peak value 2.1 ± 0.05 μm, n = 24 in Bax cells versus 2.3 ± 0.06 μm, n = 38 in control cells, p = 0.01 (Fig. 1A)). We then focused our attention on the ER store, given that mitochondria depend on ER Ca2+ release for the rapid accumulation of Ca2+ in the matrix during agonist stimulation (22Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In these experiments, in which the Bax cDNA was co-transfected with the erAEQmut aequorin probe, the ER Ca2+ store was first depleted of Ca2+ during the phase of aequorin reconstitution performed in Ca2+-free medium (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). When Ca2+ was added back into the KRB perfusion medium, [Ca2+]ER rose from <10 μm to a plateau value of ∼400 μm as reported previously (23Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no significant difference was observed between Bax-overexpressing and control cells (410 ± 10 μm, n = 20 and 399 ± 9 μm, n = 31; p > 0.1 (Fig. 1C)). These results showed that Bax per se reduces mitochondrial and, to a lesser extent, cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Our findings were surprising given that a reduction of ER Ca2+ levels and the ensuing reduction of cellular Ca2+ signals represent key findings in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. In agreement with this view (and in apparent contrast with our results), a reduction in ER Ca2+ levels and cellular Ca2+ signals was detected also in cells in which the Bax/Bak genes were ablated (11Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered the possibility that reduction of Ca2+ signals is not a direct primary effect of Bax but, rather, that after prolonged high-level expression of Bax, cells have significantly progressed into apoptosis and the down-regulation of Ca2+ signaling is part of the final stages of the apoptotic phenotype. In support of this possibility, we observed a high percentage of apoptotic cells in our experimental conditions, i.e. cells transiently expressing Bax under the control of a strong cytomegalovirus-derived promoter (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we observed that the reduction of mitochondrial agonist-evoked Ca2+ signals was proportional to Bax expression. Taking the [Ca2+]m rise of control cells as 100%, the agonist-evoked [Ca2+]m peak was reduced in Bax-transfected cells to 82 and 68% at 24 and 36 h post-transfection, respectively (Fig. 1E). In this context, to reveal the primary effect of Bax on Ca2+ signaling, we proceeded to the generation of a new experimental model in which Bax expression can be finely tuned and its early pro-apoptotic effects can thus be assessed. Characterization of the Inducible Bax Clone—We generated a cell clone expressing Bax in an inducible manner by stably transfecting a HeLa clonal cell line (HeLaTet-off) expressing the tetracycline regulatory element with an expression vector in which the Bax cDNA was placed downstream of a tetracycline-repressible promoter. Stable clones were generated by hygromycin selection and screened by Western blotting for conditioned Bax expression. One clone was selected for the following studies that shows a finely tunable up-regulation of Bax expression after induction by doxycycline withdrawal (up to a >2-fold increase after 48 h; see Fig. 2A). Bax induction did not alter the protein level of endogenous anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, and thus the rheostat of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins in these cells was modestly affected and depended mainly on the protein level of pro-apoptotic Bax (Fig. 2A). Immunostaining analyses revealed the enhancement of the Bax signal, as well as its re-localization to mitochondria upon doxycycline withdrawal (Fig. 2A). As a consequence of Bax expression, a modest enhancement of apoptotic cell death was detected 48 h after induction (10% in -Dox cells versus 2% in +Dox cells (Fig. 2B)), which correlated with a reduction of mitochondrial potential measured by tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester staining intensity (13% reduction in -Dox cells as compared with +Dox cells (Fig. 2C)). Bax Induction Is Associated with a Transient ER Ca2+ Overload and an Increase in Mitochondrial Ca2+ Signals—We then evaluated ER Ca2+ homeostasis in the inducible Bax clone. Twenty-four hours after induction of Bax expression, reconstitution of erAEQmut with coelenterazine was performed in Tet-off cells (as well as in cells maintained under tetracycline gene repression, i.e. the controls of this experiment). After transferring the cells to the luminometer chamber, perfusion was initiated with a KRB/EGTA buffer, which was then switched to KRB/Ca2+. In the latter condition, [Ca2+]ER gradually increased, reaching in ∼2 min a steady-state plateau value that was markedly different in Bax-induced and control cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, Bax induction was associated with an increase of steady-state [Ca2+]ER values (335 ± 13 μm, n = 17 in -Dox cells versus 255 ± 8 μm, n = 22 in +Dox cells, p ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3A). Kinetic analysis of IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the ER revealed a greater initial Ca2+ release upon histamine stimulation in Bax-induced cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the [Ca2+]ER increase upon Bax induction appeared to be transient; 48 h after the beginning of Bax induction, the [Ca2+]ER value became similar to control cells (240 ± 12 μm, n = 7 in -Dox cells) (Fig. 3C), thus mimicking the situation of the high-level transient expression of Bax (Fig. 1). We then investigated mitochondrial Ca2+ responses. In agreement with the ER data, a larger [Ca2+]m rise was observed in Bax-induced cells upon histamine stimulation (peak amplitude 4 ± 0.2 μm, n = 15 in -Dox cells versus 2.5 ± 0.15 μm, n = 15 in +Dox cells, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that, as suggested by experiments carried out in other cells models (the Bax/Bak knock-out lines) (11Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), Bax exerts an opposite effect to Bcl-2 on the state of filling of the ER Ca2+ store (increased in the former, reduced in the latter case). In turn, a greater filling of the ER store may allow mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and ensuing recruitment of these organelles into apoptotic responses, thus representing an important initiating step in the apoptotic process triggered by this protein. Establishment of the Role of the Putative Pore-forming Domain (α5-α6) in Ca2+ Mobilization by Bax and Bcl-2—An apparent explanation of our results is that the different effects of Bcl-2 and Bax on Ca2+ signaling of these proteins are due to differences in the putative pore-forming domain (α5-α6) present in both the pro- and anti-apoptotic family members. To investigate this issue, we used two mutant constructs in which the α5-α6 helices of Bcl-2 and Bax were mutually swapped (Fig. 4A) (19Matsuyama S. Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30995-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and performed a comparative analysis of subcellular [Ca2+] changes occurring in HeLa cells transiently co-transfected with the appropriate aequorin chimera and either Bcl-2/Bax(α5-α6), Bax/Bcl-2(α5-α6), wild-type Bcl-2, or wild-type Bax. Ca2+ measurements were performed 36 h after transfection, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 as the mean of the [Ca2+]ER steady-state levels (Fig. 4B) and of the agonist-evoked Ca2+ signals in the mitochondria (Fig. 4C) and cytosol (Fig. 4D) expressed as a percentage of those of control cells. These analyses revealed a similar reduction of [Ca2+]ER steady-state levels in Bcl-2/Bax(α5-α6)-transfected (73%) and Bcl-2-transfected cells (80%, Fig. 4B). In agreement with this result, in Bcl-2/Bax(α5-α6)- and Bcl-2-transfected cells a comparable reduction was observed in the amplitude of the agonist-dependent [Ca2+] rises of mitochondria (79 and 73% of controls for Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax (α5-α6), respectively (Fig. 4C)) and cytosol (85 and 91% of controls for Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax(α5-α6) (Fig. 4D)). Conversely, similarly to Bax, overexpression of the Bax/Bcl-2(α5-α6) chimera modestly perturbed ER Ca2+ homeostasis (Fig. 4B) and greatly reduced the agonist-evoked [Ca2+]m peak (68 and 54% of controls in Bax and Bax/Bcl-2(α5-α6) (Fig. 4C)). The agonist-dependent [Ca2+]c peak is also slightly diminished (90 and 83% of controls in Bax and Bax/Bcl-2(α5-α6) (Fig. 4D)). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the putative pore-forming domains of Bcl-2 and Bax are not the key determinants of the different effect of the two proteins on Ca2+ homeostasis, as the two chimeric proteins maintain the effect on Ca2+ signaling of the native polypeptide and do not acquire that of the introduced α5-α6 helices. Relationship between Ca2+ Dynamics and Apoptotic Regulation by Bcl-2 and Bax Proteins and the Bax/Bcl-2 Chimeras— We reported previously that Bcl-2 prevents mitochondrial damage caused by Ca2+ mobilizing apoptotic stimuli, such as ceramide, and protects cells from apoptosis (6Pinton P.

Whereas the subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase was shown to originate from the cooperation of a multicomponent complex, it is currently unknown whether in a cellular environment BACE is enzymatically active as a monomer or in concert with other proteins. Using blue native gel electrophoresis we found that endogenous and overexpressed BACE has a molecular mass of 140 kDa instead of the expected mass of 70 kDa under denaturing conditions. This suggests that under native conditions BACE exists as a homodimer. Homodimerization was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of full-length BACE carrying different epitope tags. In contrast, the soluble active BACE ectodomain was exclusively present as a monomer both under native and denaturing conditions. A domain analysis revealed that the BACE ectodomain dimerized as long as it was attached to the membrane, whereas the cytoplasmic domain and the transmembrane domain were dispensable for dimerization. By adding a KKXX-endoplasmic reticulum retention signal to BACE, we demonstrate that dimerization of BACE occurs already before full maturation and pro-peptide cleavage. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the purified native BACE dimer revealed a higher affinity and turnover rate in comparison to the monomeric soluble BACE. Dimerization of BACE might, thus, facilitate binding and cleavage of physiological substrates.

Moreover, the apparent absence of an overt phenotype of BACE-deficient mice qualifies this protease as an ideal drug target for the therapy of AD (32Vassar R. J. Mol.

The structure of the soluble BACE ectodomain was resolved in a complex with high affinity inhibitors showing a monomer with great similarity to the pepsin-like aspartic proteases (35Hong L.

However, because of the essential long term treatment of AD, BACE inhibitors have to be highly selective. This is complicated by the aforementioned structural similarities to other proteases as well as the extended substrate pocket (35Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C.

Whereas other aspartic proteases, like pepsin, renin, and cathepsin D exist as soluble monomers, cathepsin E is the only known aspartic protease that exists as a homodimer consisting of two fully catalytically active monomers (42Tsukuba T. Masayuki Y. Hori H. Azuma T. Yamamoto K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 362: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Dimerization of cathepsin E results in an increased pH and temperature stability, which is consistent with its biological function in endosomal vesicles (43Fowler S.D. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Tatnell P.J.

For membrane-bound BACE it remains unclear whether it is monomeric or associates with itself or heterologous proteins, as it was shown for the presenilins, the catalytically active component within the γ-secretase complex (3Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 46Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Moreover, a participation of native BACE in a larger complex could alter its enzymatic properties (39Marcinkeviciene J. Luo Y.

Because BACE is the rate-limiting enzyme of Aβ production (4Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J.

To clarify whether membrane-bound BACE functions in cooperation with itself or other proteins, we investigated BACE under native conditions. We demonstrate dimerization of native BACE and show that membrane attachment is a prerequisite for the dimerization of the catalytic ectodomain. A comparison of the kinetic parameters of purified dimeric to monomeric BACE reveals an increased affinity and a higher turnover rate of the dimer for a Swedish mutant APP-like substrate. Mouse Lines and Tissue Preparation—The construct used to generate the transgenic BACE overexpressing mouse line contains a human BACE cDNA insertion in the Thy-1 cassette at the XhoI site of the pTSCα plasmid (48Andra K.

Mice were sacrificed at an age of 3 months, and tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genotypes were evaluated by genomic PCR. All animal manipulations were performed in full accordance with current German laws. Cloning of BACE Expression Constructs—Full-length BACE (BACE-FL) was tagged at its C terminus with an Myc-His tag in pcDNA4/Zeo(+) vector (Invitrogen) or was fused to the hemagglutinin tag (HA) in the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(–) vector (Invitrogen) using the GC-Rich-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science). For the purification of soluble BACE a Myc-His tag was fused to the soluble ectodomain of BACE truncated at amino acid 454 and cloned into the pcDNA4Myc/His/A vector (9Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

In the BACE-polyalanine (BACE-pA) construct the wild-type transmembrane domain (amino acids 455–477) was replaced by a stretch of 23 alanines. To establish a GPI-linked BACE-NT (BACE-GPI) we fused the BACE-NT sequence to the GPI anchor of CD59 (amino acids ASLENGGTSLSEKTVLLLVTPFLAAAWSLHP). To retain BACE within the ER, we attached the KKXX (BACE-KKXX) recognition signal by replacement of the original C terminus SILLK with AKKAA (49Townsley F.M. Pelham H.R. Eur. J.

Cell Culture and Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The Swedish APP-expressing cell line was described elsewhere (50Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All stable transfections of HEK 293 cells were performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Cell lines expressing constructs with the pcDNA3/Zeo or the pcDNA4/Zeo vector were selected with 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromvyin (Invitrogen). H4 glioblastoma cells were used without transfection. Sample Preparation—For the membrane preparations, cells were grown to confluency and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The 1.000 × g cell-pellet was homogenized in hypotonic buffer (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture P-8340, Sigma) and frozen in liquid nitrogen for cell rupture by thawing. Protein fractionation was done at a concentration of 1% of each Lubrol WX and Brij35 (Pierce) by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and continued with the 5,000 × g supernatant (5% glycerol added) at 130,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (Optima™ Ultracentrifugation, Beckman) to remove non-membranous material. Membrane pellets were solubilized in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, protease Inhibitor mixture P-8340; Sigma) with 1% Triton X-100. Unsoluble material was removed by 130,000 × g ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. Native lysates containing all proteins of the secretory pathway and cytosolic components were obtained by solubilization of the 5000 × g supernatant with a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 and a clearing centrifugation at 130,000 × g in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, protease Inhibitor mixture P-8340, Sigma). Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography Purification of His-tagged Soluble and Membrane-bound BACE—For the purification of membrane-bound BACE-FL with an Myc-His tag, membrane preparations were used. To obtain soluble BACE for purification, HEK 293 cells expressing BACE-NT with a Myc-His tag were kept in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 24 h. Supernatants containing BACE-NT- or Triton X-100-extracted membrane preparations (see above) were purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography ΔKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) with a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) by a 10 mm imidazole washing step and a 10–500 mm imidazole gradient each in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1%Triton X-100. The eluted material was pooled and dialyzed against (phosphate-buffered saline), 0.1% Triton X-100 and concentrated by using a Vivaspin 6-ml concentrator with a molecular mass cut-off MWCO of 5000 Dalton (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). The purity of BACE was verified by Coomassie staining with Colloidal Blue-staining solution (Novex, San Diego, CA). For size determination in 8% SDS gels we used the Seeblue marker (Invitrogen). Blue Native PAGE (BN-PAGE)—Native 6–16% gradient gels were prepared according to the protocol of Schägger et al. (51Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the supplier's instructions. Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fractions, native lysates, or soluble BACE-NT were subjected to BN-PAGE essentially as described before (51Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Marker proteins used in BN-PAGE were bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) (Sigma). Antibodies for Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblotting—The polyclonal antibodies to BACE applied in standard immunoblotting procedures were an N-terminal antibody to amino acids 46–60 of BACE (EE-17, Sigma), a C-terminal antibody to amino acids 482–501 (LK-16, Sigma), and the BACE propeptide antibody GM190 to amino acids 22–45 (9Capell A.

For the immunoprecipitation studies of Myc-tagged proteins we used anti-Myc-agarose (Sigma) and anti-HA-agarose (Sigma) for HA-tagged proteins. The monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the Myc epitope was obtained from the hybridoma bank. For HA detection we used the anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ). Immunoprecipitation of BACE was performed from lysates in 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.4, 2% CHAPS (Merck), 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Agarose beads were washed with STEN (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and the bound protein was analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The neoepitope-specific antibody sw192 was used to specifically detect soluble Swedish βAPPs (53Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The monoclonal HSP70 antibody SPA-820 was purchased from Stressgen. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Promega) were used for ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was performed using standard protocols (9Capell A.

Alexa 555- or Alexa 586-labeled secondary antibodies were used (Molecular Probes). Fixed cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a 63×/1.25 objective and standard fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC fluorescence filter sets. Images were obtained with Metaview system software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Enzyme Assays—Purified BACE-FL and BACE-NT were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline 0.1% Triton X-100 and stored at –80 °C in aliquots. Protein concentrations were estimated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Active enzyme concentrations were obtained by active site titration using the statine-based inhibitor H-EVN-Statin-VAEF-NH2 and by fitting data from inhibition experiments approaching titration conditions to the general equation for tight binding inhibitors (54Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The kinetic measurements were performed in 100-μl reaction mixtures containing the substrate (Cy3-SEVNLDAEFK-(Cy5Q)-NH2 from Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration in the range of 1–27 μm in 50 mm acetate buffer with 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 4.5, at 26 °C. The inner filter effect was measured and found to be not significant up to a substrate concentration of 30 μm. Me2SO concentrations were adjusted in all assays and did not exceed 5%. Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme, and the increase in fluorescence at 590 nm (excitation at 530 nm) was measured in 96-well plates (Nunc) on a Fluoroskan Ascent FL Fluores"

We have investigated whether DAG and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have a role in the Rab- and SNARE-dependent homo-typic vacuole fusion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vacuole fusion was blocked when DAG was sequestered by a recombinant C1b domain. DAG underwent ATP-dependent turnover during vacuole fusion, but was replenished by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to DAG by PLC. The PLC inhibitors 3-nitrocoumarin and U73122 blocked vacuole fusion in vitro, whereas their inactive homologues did not. Plc1p is the only known PLC in yeast. Yeast cells lacking the PLC1 gene have many small vacuoles, indicating defects in protein trafficking to the vacuole or vacuole fusion, and purified Plc1p stimulates vacuole fusion. Docking-dependent Ca2+ efflux is absent in plc1Δ vacuoles and was restored only upon the addition of both Plc1p and the Vam7p SNARE. However, vacuoles purified from plc1Δ strains still retain PLC activity and significant 3-nitrocoumarin- and U73122-sensitive fusion, suggesting that there is another PLC in S. cerevisiae with an important role in vacuole fusion.

Regulated membrane fusion is essential for transport of proteins and lipids between subcellular compartments and for the maintenance of organelle identity in eukaryotic cells. Fusion events require proteins and lipids that are conserved from yeast to mammals. Among these are SNAREs 1The abbreviations used are: SNAREs, soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptors; α-SNAP, α-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment factor; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; rVam7p, recombinant Vam7p; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)); IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: SNAREs, soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptors; α-SNAP, α-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment factor; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; rVam7p, recombinant Vam7p; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)); IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. and Sec1/Munc18 family proteins, Sec18/N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and Sec17/α-SNAP, and the Ypt/Rab GTPases and their effector proteins. Lipids, including phosphoinositides and sterols, also play crucial roles. Yeast vacuoles are used to study membrane fusion mechanisms. The homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles, reconstituted in vitro, occurs in three stages: priming, docking, and bilayer fusion and contents mixing (1Wickner W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Mayer A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). During priming, Sec18p (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) disassembles cis-SNARE complexes containing the three Q-SNAREs (Vti1p, Vam7p, and Vam3p) and an R-SNARE (Nyv1p or Ykt6p). Priming releases Sec17p (α-SNAP) and a soluble SNARE, Vam7p, from vacuoles. The docking stage begins with tethering, which is regulated by the small Rab GTPase Ypt7p. Tethering is followed by the accumulation of fusion factors into a vacuole membrane microdomain termed the “vertex ring,” which surrounds the closely apposed membranes of the tethered vacuoles (3Wang L. Seeley E.S. Wickner W. Merz A.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The final step of docking is the formation of SNARE complexes in trans between apposed vacuoles. Docking requires the HOPS/VpsC complex, composed of the subunits Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, Vps33p, Vps39p, and Vps41p. HOPS fulfills several functions. It serves as a nucleotide exchange factor for Ypt7p (4Wurmser A.E. Sato T.K. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). HOPS also binds to Ypt7p-GTP and is thus a Ypt7p effector (5Seals D.F. Eitzen G. Margolis N. Wickner W.T. Price A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9402-9407Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The Vps33p subunit of HOPS is a Sec1/Munc18 family protein that allows HOPS to interact with the SNARE complexes. trans-SNARE interactions trigger a Ca2+ efflux from the vacuole lumen (6Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The late stages of fusion may require additional factors such as the V0 sector of the V-ATPase (7Bayer M.J. Reese C. Buhler S. Peters C. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Peters C. Bayer M.J. Buhler S. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Specific “regulatory lipids” are also essential for vacuole fusion. Ergosterol, a yeast sterol, is required for priming (13Kato M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At least two phosphoinositides are involved in vacuole docking. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) is recognized by the Phox homology domain of Vam7p to facilitate the rebinding of this SNARE to the vacuole (14Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 15Boeddinghaus C. Merz A.J. Laage R. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) regulates priming and docking (16Mayer A. Scheglmann D. Dove S. Glatz A. Wickner W. Haas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although its functions have been unknown. Theses lipids are required for the enrichment of fusion factors in the vertex ring during docking. 2R. A. Fratti, Y. Jun, A. J. Merz, N. Margolis, and W. Wickner, submitted for publication.2R. A. Fratti, Y. Jun, A. J. Merz, N. Margolis, and W. Wickner, submitted for publication. Enzymes that generate or modify these lipids are therefore likely to play essential roles in vacuole fusion. Cells deleted for any of the genes for ergosterol biosynthesis have fragmented vacuoles (13Kato M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which often indicate a fusion defect. Vacuoles are also fragmented in vps34Δ cells that lack phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity (17Seeley E.S. Kato M. Margolis N. Wickner W. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and vacuoles isolated from spheroplasts pretreated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin are incompetent for fusion in vitro (15Boeddinghaus C. Merz A.J. Laage R. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 participates in the formation of the vertex ring microdomain 2R. A. Fratti, Y. Jun, A. J. Merz, N. Margolis, and W. Wickner, submitted for publication. and may serve as a membrane anchor for fusion catalysts such as those that remodel actin (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) or as a biosynthetic precursor of other lipids that are needed for fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is synthesized in yeast through the sequential phosphorylation of PI by the PI 4-kinase Stt4p and the PI(4)P 5-kinase Mss4p (19Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15787-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3 by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). We refer here to all phospholipase C activities as PLC, whereas PLC1 encodes the only known yeast PLC. DAG is a hydrophobic lipid of intrinsic negative curvature that promotes the fusion of bilayer membranes (20Allan D. Thomas P. Michell R.H. Nature. 1978; 276: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies have shown that DAG promotes the fusion of synthetic vesicles by altering the physical properties of a membrane lipid bilayer, modifying its fluidity, or inducing lateral phase separations and transitions (21Goni F.M. Alonso A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 1-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). DAG may fulfill these roles in biological membrane fusion events as well. DAG has been implicated in several membrane trafficking events. It promotes Ca2+-induced fusion of chromaffin granules with other membranes (22Sanchez-Migallon M.P. Aranda F.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and facilitates exocytosis of amylase from parotid gland secretory granules (23Mizuno-Kamiya M. Inokuchi H. Kameyama Y. Yashiro K. Shin S.O. Fujita A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). DAG also has an essential role in protein transport from the yeast Golgi complex (24Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We now report that DAG and PLC, which hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2 to DAG, are required for vacuole fusion, suggesting that the requirement of PI(4,5)P2 for vacuole fusion may reflect an essential role of DAG. DAG is produced by PLC on yeast vacuoles and is consumed in an ATP-dependent manner. There is only one known PLC, encoded by PLC1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Payne W.E. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4351-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Yoko-o T. Matsui Y. Yagisawa H. Nojima H. Uno I. Toh-e A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking the PLC1 gene have a fragmented vacuole phenotype, which often indicates a vacuole fusion defect. However, vacuoles isolated from plc1Δ cells still retain PLC activity and exhibit reduced but meaningful fusion, indicating that there is an additional gene, structurally unrelated to PLC1, encoding PLC activity. These studies establish that DAG regulation through PLC is required for Rab- and SNARE-dependent biological membrane fusion.

The mutations were confirmed by creation of a new PvuII site (underlined) and by complete loss of PLC activity of the purified mutant protein. The wild-type PLC1 gene or the lipase-inactive mutant of the PLC1 gene was subcloned into the pRS316 vector (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Recombinant Pbi2p (IB2) was purified as described (40Slusarewicz P. Xu Z. Seefeld K. Haas A. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5582-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). His6-Plc1p was prepared as described (25Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) except that strain YJY11 was used and the overexpression of His6-Plc1p was induced with 2% galactose in yeast extract/peptone medium instead of synthetic dextrose medium lacking uracil. Vacuole Isolation and in Vitro Fusion Assay—For in vitro fusion, vacuoles were isolated from yeast strains BJ3505 and DKY6281 unless indicated otherwise (29Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Standard fusion reactions (30 μl) contained 3 μg of vacuoles lacking the protease Pep4p, 3 μg of vacuoles from cells without Pho8p, reaction buffer (125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 6.8), and 200 mm sorbitol), 1 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine kinase, 10 μm coenzyme A, and 4.5 μm recombinant Pbi2p (IB2) (29Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fusion assays were incubated for 90 min at 27 °C, and fusion was measured by assaying alkaline phosphatase (41Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PLC Assay and Thin Layer Chromatography—A simple PLC assay was developed utilizing a fluorescent PI(4,5)P2 substrate and TLC by modifying an assay for phosphoinositide phosphatase (42Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Di-C6-NBD-PI(4,5)P2 (0.3 μg; Echelon Research) was incubated with 50 nm purified His6-Plc1p or 3 μg of isolated vacuoles in PLC assay buffer (50 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 5 μm CaCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of acetone and then evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac evaporator set on low heat. The dried reaction products were resuspended in 10 μl of methanol/2-propanol/glacial acetic acid (5:5:2) and spotted onto a glass-backed TLC plate (K6 silica gel, 60 Å, 20 × 20 cm; Whatman). The TLC plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/acetone/glacial acetic acid/water (46:15:17:14:8) and air-dried. Fluorescent lipids were visualized using a Typhoon PhosphorImager 8600 (Amersham Biosciences). Calcium Efflux Assay—Ca2+ efflux assays were performed as described for fusion, but with 10 μg rather than 6 μg of vacuoles from BJ3505 or YJY1 (BJ3505 plc1Δ::URA3) in 30-μl reactions. Aequorin luminescence assays were performed as described previously (9Muller O. Bayer M.J. Peters C. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 43Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in 96-well low protein binding conical bottom plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) in a luminometer (Molecular Devices). IGOR Pro 4 (WaveMetrics) and JMP5 (SAS Institute) were used for data analysis. Calibration was done using buffered Ca2+-EGTA standard solutions (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as described previously (6Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DAG enhances the fusion of liposomes by changing their surface properties (21Goni F.M. Alonso A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 1-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting that DAG may also fulfill this function for biological membrane fusion. DAG becomes enriched in vertex rings during yeast vacuole fusion and regulates the vertex enrichment of other lipids and of proteins such as Ypt7p, SNAREs, and HOPS.2 We have tested the role of DAG in membrane fusion by examining the effect of DAG ligands and the need for DAG production from PI(4,5)P2. We first examined whether DAG is required for vacuole fusion, using an in vitro fusion assay and a specific DAG ligand, the C1b domain from mammalian protein kinase CβII (33Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We assayed the homotypic fusion of vacuoles by mixing vacuoles from two strains. One strain has the vacuolar luminal protease Pep4p, but is deleted for the gene encoding the Pho8p phosphatase. The other strain lacks the protease Pep4p and therefore accumulates catalytically inactive pro-Pho8p. During incubation with ATP, fusion allows the Pep4p protease to gain access to pro-Pho8p, converting it to the active form, which is assayed colorimetrically. The recombinant C1b domain inhibited the fusion reaction (Fig. 1), indicating that DAG is involved in vacuole fusion. PI(4,5)P2, which is hydrolyzed by PLC to DAG and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), is required for early stages of vacuole fusion (16Mayer A. Scheglmann D. Dove S. Glatz A. Wickner W. Haas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 may be needed as a substrate for PLC to produce DAG. To examine whether PLC activity is required for vacuole fusion, we have employed two specific PLC inhibitors, 3-nitrocoumarin and U73122. 3-Nitrocoumarin inhibits the PLC activity of Plc1p in vitro with a Ki of 57.6 μm (44Tisi R. Coccetti P. Banfi S. Martegani E. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2001; 19: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and also inhibits mammalian PLCγ (45Ward P.D. Klein R.R. Troutman M.D. Desai S. Thakker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35760-35765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Vacuole fusion was blocked by 3-nitrocoumarin at a comparable concentration (Ki < 40 μm), whereas its inactive analogue 7-hydroxy-3-nitrocoumarin had little effect on vacuole fusion (Fig. 2A). Although not previously tested on yeast PLC, U73122 has been used as an inhibitor for mammalian PLCs (46Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar) and plant PLCs (47Staxen I.I. Pical C. Montgomery L.T. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. McAinsh M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). U73122 prevented vacuole fusion with a Ki of 40 μm, whereas its structural analogue U73343 did not inhibit (Fig. 2B). U73122 also inhibited the activity of purified His6-Plc1p (Fig. 2C) and the PLC activity that is present on isolated yeast vacuoles (see Fig. 8E below).Fig. 8Plc1p is not essential for in vitro vacuole fusion. A, plc1Δ vacuoles fuse in vitro. Fusion reactions were performed with PLC1 vacuoles (black bars) isolated from strains BJ3505 and BY4742 pho8Δ::neo or with plc1Δ vacuoles (gray bars) isolated from strains YJY1 and YJY2. Reactions were incubated on ice (bars 1 and 2) or at 27°C(bars 3 and 4) for 90 min in the presence of 0.35 μm His6-Plc1p (bars 5 and 6) or 2.7 μm rVam7p (bars 7 and 8). U, units. B, immunoblot analysis of vacuoles isolated from BJ3505 or YJY1 (BJ3505 plc1Δ::URA3). C, excess rVam7p partially bypasses the DAG requirement for vacuole fusion. Fusion reactions were incubated at 27 °C in the presence (bars 1–6) or absence (bars 7–12) of 30 μm C1b domain. After 30 min, rVam7p was added at the indicated concentrations. Reactions were incubated at 27 °C for an additional 70 min before assaying for alkalinephosphatase. D, characterization of plc1Δ vacuole fusion. Reactions were performed with PLC1 vacuoles (black bars) or with plc1Δ vacuoles (gray bars) as described for A in the presence of the indicated concentrations of U73122, 0.15 μm affinity-purified anti-Sec17p antibody, 0.14 μm affinity-purified anti-Sec18p antibody, or 0.15 μm affinity-purified anti-Vam7p antibody. E, plc1Δ vacuoles retain detectable PLC activity. PLC1 vacuoles (3 μg; lanes 3–6) or plc1Δ vacuoles (lanes 7–10) were incubated with 0.4 μg of NBD-PI(4,5)P2 in 30 μl under PLC assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Incubations were performed on ice (lanes 3 and 7) or at 30 °C for 30 min either alone (lanes 4 and 8) or in the presence of 80 μm U73122 (lanes 5 and 9) or 250 μm 3-nitrocoumarin (3NC; lanes 6 and 10). A portion (3 μl) of each reaction was spotted on a TLC plate and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As controls, NBD-PI(4,5)P2 and Plc1p-treated NBD-PI(4,5)P2 were also analyzed (lanes 1 and 2, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We developed an assay of vacuole surface DAG to determine whether it is dynamically altered during in vitro fusion reactions. C1b labeled with the Alexa 488 fluorophore was incubated with vacuoles, and the vacuole-bound Alexa 488-labeled C1b was assayed by sedimenting the organelle. During a standard fusion reaction, there was an ATP-dependent loss of vacuole surface DAG (Fig. 3A, circles, +ATP; and squares, –ATP). A greater loss of vacuole surface DAG was seen in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U73122 (Fig. 3B, bar 3 versus bar 2), suggesting that the DAG pool was being replenished by the action of one or more PLCs. This is supported by the finding that the addition of purified His6-Plc1p increased the level of accessible DAG (Fig. 3B, bars 4 and 5). DAG is thus synthesized by PLC on isolated vacuoles and undergoes further ATP-dependent modification or internalization. Vacuole fusion occurs in three stages. Priming, initiated by ATP-dependent Sec18p action, is a prerequisite for docking and fusion (48Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To determine the stage at which PLC functions during vacuole fusion and whether PLC function is also regulated by the priming factor Sec18p, the reaction was arrested by blocking priming using either anti-Sec18p (Fig. 4A) or anti-Sec17p (Fig. 4B) antibody. Although anti-Sec18p antibody blocked the reaction (Fig. 4A, bar 3), fusion could be restored after a 30-min incubation by the addition of excess Sec18p (bar 10) as reported (49Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Without anti-Sec18p antibody, substantial docking and even fusion occurred during a 30-min incubation (bar 16), but the presence of anti-Sec18p antibody prevented priming, and thereby docking and fusion, during this period (bar 9). Therefore, upon reversal of an anti-Sec18p antibody block with Sec18p, fusion reactions were still fully sensitive to docking inhibitors such as anti-Ypt7p (bar 11), anti-Vam3p (bar 12), or anti-Vps33p (bar 13) antibody. However, fusion reactions had acquired substantial resistance to 3-nitrocoumarin or U73122 during a 30-min incubation with anti-Sec18p antibody (bars 14 and 15), showing that PLC function is not regulated by Sec18p action. To further determine when PLC functions during vacuole fusion, we exploited the recent observation that rVam7p can bypass the requirement for Sec17/18p-mediated priming (6Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 50Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fusion reactions were arrested by anti-Sec17p antibody (Fig. 4B, bar 4) and at least partially restored after a 30-min incubation by the addition of rVam7p (bar 9). This fusion reaction was largely resistant to U73122 (bar 11), although it was fully sensitive to anti-Vam3p antibody, a docking inhibitor (bar 10), or to the C1b domain (bar 12), suggesting that PLC function is largely completed before rVam7p-driven docking, but that DAG, a product of PLC function, is still needed during or after docking. These experiments show that the production of DAG by PLC is an early event that is not regulated by Sec18p and that DAG generated at earl"

The analysis of the TG2 primary sequence showed the presence of an eight amino acid domain, sharing 70% identity with the Bcl-2 family BH3 domain. Cell-permeable peptides, mimicking the domain sequence, were able to induce Bax conformational change and translocation to mitochondria, mitochondrial depolarization, release of cytochrome c, and cell death. Moreover, we found that the TG2-BH3 peptides as well as TG2 itself were able to interact with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, but not with anti-apoptotic members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Mutants in the TG2-BH3 domain failed to sensitize cells toward apoptosis. In TG2-overexpressing cells about half of the protein is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane where, upon cell death induction, it cross-links many protein substrates including Bax.

EC 2.3.2.13) is a multifunctional enzyme belonging to the transglutaminase family (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). Its primary enzymatic activity resides in a Ca2+-dependent reaction in which γ-carboxyamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues serve as acyl donors and primary amino groups of several compounds function as acceptor substrates (2Fesus L. Piacentini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This reaction results in the post-translational modification of proteins by establishing ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine and N,N-bis(γ-glutamyl)polyamine isodipeptide linkages (3Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Covalent TG2-dependent cross-linking leads to the polymerization of substrate proteins that can be dismantled only by the proteolytic degradation of the protein chains (4Fesus L. Thomazy V. Autuori F. Ceru M.P. Tarcsa E. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). While Ca2+ is a positive regulator of TG2 enzymatic activity, GTP is a negative one. It has been demonstrated that high intracellular GTP concentrations shift the enzyme activity from cross-linking to G-protein. At physiological intracellular GTP concentration, TG2 might act as the Gαh subunit of the GTP-binding protein (Gh) and form a ternary complex in association with the 50-kDa β subunit (Gβh) and the α1-adrenergic receptor (5Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, the TG2/Gαh proves to be a multifunctional protein, which by binding GTP in a GαhGTP complex, can modulate receptor-stimulated phospholipase-C (PLC) activation. The binding of GTP to TG2/Gαh prevents the activation of the pro-apoptotic cross-linking activity (6Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M.

It has been proposed that the fine modulation of TG2 enzymatic activity exerted by GTP, Ca2+, and nitric oxide allows cells to survive in the presence of high TG2 protein levels (10Bernassola F. Rossi A. Melino G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies suggest that TG2 in its G protein configuration could lead to prevention of cell death (11Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition to these two main enzymatic activities, it has been proposed very recently that TG2 might also function as a protein-disulfide isomerase (14Hasegawa G. Suwa M. Ichikawa Y. Ohtsuka T. Kumagai S. Kikuchi M. Sato Y. Saito Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and as a kinase (15Mishra S. Murphy L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23863-23868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), depending on its subcellular localization. Under physiological conditions, TG2 is a ubiquitous enzyme, although high expression levels could be detected only in particular cell subsets (e.g. endothelial, mesangial, and smooth muscle cells). However, during both physiological (i.e. mammary gland regression, interdigital web shaping) and pathological (i.e. HIV infection, hepatitis) onset of apoptosis, a large increase in the enzyme synthesis and cross-linking activity could be observed (16Amendola A. Gougeon M.L. Poccia F. Bondurand A. Fesus L. Piacentini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11057-11062Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Szegezdi E. Szondy Z. Nagy L. Nemes Z.

Piacentini M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: S79-S80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, the drop of intracellular GTP concentration and the increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels are responsible for the activation of TG2 cross-linking activity, which results in the assembly of highly cross-linked intracellular protein polymers (4Fesus L. Thomazy V. Autuori F. Ceru M.P. Tarcsa E. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This detergent-insoluble protein scaffold contributes to the stabilization of dying cells, before their clearance by phagocytosis. In addition to this “late” contribution to the apoptotic process, TG2 might act also as an upstream regulator of the mitochondrial pathway. In a previous report (19Piacentini M. Farrace M.G. Piredda L. Matarrese P. Ciccosanti F. Falasca L. Rodolfo C. Giammarioli A.M. Verderio E. Griffin M. Malorni W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we showed that overexpression of TG2 in neural cells results in a 4-5-fold more rapid accomplishment of the death program, as compared with their parental counter-part that expresses low levels of TG2. We observed that mitochondria of TG2-overexpressing cells were greatly modified with respect to both their ultrastructure and physiology. Mitochondria appeared often clustered in discrete cytoplasmic regions, with few cristae and extremely electron-dense matrix. These ultrastructural modifications are coupled with a constitutive hyperpolarization of the organelles, a decrease of intracellular GSH level and an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The TG2-dependent hyperpolarization of mitochondria preceded and was separated from the PTP opening and the release of cytochrome c, which took place only upon induction of apoptosis. Prompted by these results, we investigated whether TG2 interaction/modification of proteins known to influence mitochondrial physiology and/or to control the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway might play a role in the observed commitment to death. To address these questions, we investigated the effect exerted by TG2 accumulation in mitochondria, focusing our attention to the possible interaction of TG2 with Bcl-2 family members. The choice of this class of protein was basically because of their well defined role in the regulation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (20Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 21Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). It has been widely accepted that the pro-apoptotic factors Bax and Bak are important regulators of the mitochondrial permeability transition and that other Bcl-2 family members could modulate their action. In particular, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are able to inhibit Bax/Bak mitochondrial action, while the proapoptotic BH3-only subfamily are activators of Bax and Bak, also at the mitochondrial level (22Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 23Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate for the first time that TG2 possesses a well defined and functional BH3 domain. Through this domain the enzyme might behave as a BH3-only protein, able to interact, even in the absence of any apoptotic stimuli, with pro-apoptotic members Bax and Bak, but not with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Upon cell death induction, the interaction with Bax increased, and many mitochondrial proteins were post-translationally modified by TG2. It is worth noting that Bax acts as one of the major mitochondrial substrates, and its modification led to the formation of large molecular weight polymers. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human SK-n-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells and stably transfected TG2 derivatives (TGA) were grown as described (24Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6584-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For all experiments, cells were seeded in tissue culture flasks, multiwell plates, and chamber slides (NUNC), and allowed to attach overnight before treatment. The seeding density varied according to the type of experiment. Expression vectors for TG2 wild type (TG2-wt), deleted of the BH3 domain (TG2-ΔBH3), with cysteine 277 mutated to serine and with leucine 204 mutated to aspartic acid (TG2-LE), were generated by PCR and cloning in the pcDNA4/HisMax vector (Invitrogen). Deletion of the TG2-BH3 domain was accomplished by substitution of the nucleotides corresponding to the amino acids 204LKNAGRDCS212 with an EcoRI site via PCR. Mutations of the leucine 204 (CTG-GAG) and cysteine 277 (TGC-AGC) were also accomplished by PCR, with primers containing the mutations. Transient transfections of SK-n-BE(2) cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cytofluorimetric analysis of cell death induction by staurosporine (1 μm) was conducted 48 h after transfection. Synthetic Peptides and Cell Treatment—Peptides bearing the BH3 sequence of interest fused to antennapedia (ANT) sequence, as to allow cell entry, were designed as follows: ANT: NH2-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-COOH; ANT-BH3 TG2: NH2-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKDVNPKFLKNAGRDCSR-COOH; ANT-BH3 Bax: NH2-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKKKLSECLKRIGDELDS-COOH; ANT-BH3 TG2 L-E; NH2-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKDVNPKFEKNAGRDCSR-COOH. All peptides were synthesized, with or without biotin at the N terminus, by Sigma-Genosys, purified by HPLC and controlled by mass spectroscopy. Upon arrival peptides were dissolved in Me2SO at 50 or 100 mm and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. SK-n-BE(2) cells were treated with 50 μm ANT-BH3 peptides for 30 min in culture medium without FCS, then supplemented with FCS, and incubation was continued for the indicated time period. Induction of Apoptosis by ANT-BH3 Peptides and Cell Viability Assessment—For cell viability assessment (CellTiter Proliferation Assay, Promega) 1-2 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 0.2 ml of complete culture medium in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 24 h, cells were washed with culture medium without FCS and treated with peptides (50 μm). At the indicated time, measurement of cell viability was determined following the manufacturer's protocol. For apoptosis evaluation and measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and after 24 h treated as above. Quantitative flow cytometry evaluation of apoptosis was performed by double staining, using the FITC-conjugated annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (Eppendorf) and evaluation of DNA fragmentation in ethanol-fixed cells using PI (Sigma). For cell death inhibition, cells were treated 15 min with 1 mm cyclosporin A (CsA, Sigma) before adding BH3 peptides. Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Living Cells— Analysis of MMP in control and peptide-treated cells was conducted with the JC-1 probe. Briefly, cells were stained with 10 μm JC-1 (Molecular Probes) as previously described (25Cossarizza A. Cooper E.L. Quaglino D. Salvioli S. Kalachnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Tetramethylrhodamine ester (1 μm, TMRM, Molecular Probes) was also used to confirm the data obtained using JC-1. Analysis of Cytochrome c Release in Living Cells and on Isolated Mitochondria—For cytochrome c release assays, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and after 24 h were treated with 50 μm BH3 peptides as described above. At the indicated times, cells were harvested by trypsin treatment and collected by centrifugation. After washing three times in PBS, cells were suspended in 250 μl of Hypotonic Buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer with B-type pestle as previously reported (26Zamzami N. Maisse C. Metivier D. Kroemer G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 147-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, after addition of an equal volume of Mitochondria Buffer (400 mm sucrose, 10 mm TES, 400 μm EGTA, pH 7.2), centrifuged twice for 10 min at 900 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and further centrifuged for 15 min at 17,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was considered to be the mitochondria, and the supernatant was the cytosol. Release of cytochrome c was assessed by Western blot with monoclonal anti-cyt c antibody (65981A, BD PharMingen). Anti-COX subunit IV antibody (20E8-C12, Molecular Probes) was used as a control of mitochondrial isolation. For peptide treatments, mitochondria were isolated with a further 10 min centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C of the 900 × g supernatant, obtained as above. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in swelling buffer (SB: 0.1 m sucrose, 0.5 m sodium succinate, 50 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 1 m H3P04, 0.5 m MOPS, 2 mm rotenone), kept on ice, and used within 2 h from the preparation. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were treated with 10 and 50 μm of different BH3 peptides in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml cyclosporin a for 20 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Proteins contained in the supernatants were then concentrated in 90% acetone (4 °C, 18 h; centrifugation at 17,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the precipitate was subjected to Western blot with anti-cytochrome c antibody. Swelling Experiments—For swelling experiments mitochondria, isolated as described above, were suspended in 1.5 ml of SB (0.5 mg protein/ml). As a general rule, 4 min after starting to record, the reagents to be tested were added. Total recording time was 20 min. As a positive control we used 300 μm CaCl2, which opens the protein transition pore causing high amplitude swelling, accompanied by a decrease of ΔΨ and an increase of outer membrane permeability. CsA (5 μg/ml) added before Ca2+ prevented ΔΨ loss. ΔΨ measurement was performed by cytofluorimetric analysis of TMRM (1 μm; Molecular Probes) incorporation. Low levels of TMRM incorporation (revealed by a decrease of red fluorescence) indicated a low ΔΨ. We tested the effect produced by different peptides (e.g. TG2-BH3, BAX-BH3, and TG2-BH3 L-E) on the ΔΨ either in the presence or absence of CsA. All samples were analyzed with a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 488 argon laser. To exclude debris, samples were gated based on light scattering properties in the side scattering (SSC) and forward scattering (FSC) modes. The red fluorescence emission of untreated mitochondria was considered as basal emission and recorded for 4 min; after this time reagents to be tested were added, and the effect was monitored for the following 16 min. Dot plots of red fluorescence emission as a function of the time, obtained in each condition, were statistically analyzed using CellQuest software to determine the percentage of mitochondria with depolarized membrane. Cyt c presence in the supernatants of swelling reactions, performed in the absence of TMRM, was assessed with a commercial ELISA kit (R&D System). The cyt c release was quantified and expressed as pg/ml in all tested samples, including the positive control. Co-precipitation between BH3 Domain Peptides and Bax—Mitochondria (0.5 mg) isolated from SK-n-BE(2) cells were treated with 5 and 10 μm biotinylated BH3 domain peptides for 20 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate the supernatant. Pellets were lysed with CHAPS-IP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 150 mm KCl, 1% CHAPS) for 30 min on ice and, after addition of 50 μl of prewashed streptavidin paramagnetic particles (MagneSphere, Promega), incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. The beads were recovered and washed six times. Proteins attached to the beads were solubilized in sample buffer and after separation on 4-12% Nu-PAGE (Invitrogen) subjected to Western blot with anti-Bax antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For whole cell co-precipitation, cells were treated with 50 μm biotinylated peptides and, after lysis in CHAPS-IP buffer, peptides and interacting proteins were isolated as described above. Identification of Bax as a TG2 Protein Substrate—TG2-overexpressing cells (TGA) were grown in the presence of 5 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (EZ-link, Pierce) and treated for 2 h with 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 100 μm z-VAD (Promega). Cells were harvested and lysed in CHAPS-IP buffer, and biotinylated TG2 substrates were separated on 4-12% Nu-PAGE (Invitrogen). After transfer to nitrocellulose, TG2 substrates were revealed with streptavidin-horseradish-conjugated peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, 1:3000). Mitochondria from the same cells were isolated and, after lysis in CHAPS-IP buffer, biotinylated TG2 protein substrates were purified by streptavidin paramagnetic particles (MagneSphere, Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Purified proteins were separated on 4-12% Nu-PAGE gels and revealed by Western blot with anti-Bax N-20 antibody. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitation experiments TG2-overexpressing cells (TGA), seeded in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks, were treated with 1 μm staurosporine for 2 h, harvested with trypsin, and washed twice in PBS. Whole cell extracts were obtained by lysis with CHAPS-IP buffer for 30 min on ice and clearing at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. For each reaction 500 μg of total protein were prein-cubated with 50 μl of prewashed Dynabeads-protein G (Dynal) for 1 h at 4 °C, with gentle shacking. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 5 μg of anti-TG2 (CUB 7402, NeoMarkers), or anti-Bax (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology and 6A7, BD PharMingen) or anti-Bak (G-23, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, and 50 μl of prewashed Dynabeads-protein G. After 4 h or overnight incubation, beads were recovered and washed six times with CHAPS-IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detached from beads by boiling in sample buffer and separated on 4-12% Nu-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were incubated with anti-TG2 (0.2 μg/ml), anti-Bax (N-20, 0.2 μg/ml; 6A7, 1 μg/ml), and anti-Bak (0.2 μg/ml) antibodies for 1 h and then appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 h. The signals were detected with Supersignal (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence experiments SK-n-BE(2) and TGA cells were seeded in 4-well chamber slides and treated or not with ANT-BH3 peptides, as described above. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed on paraformaldehyde (4% w/v) and picric acid (0.19% v/v) for 20 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. After permeabilization with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature and blocking in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% FCS, primary antibody was added, and incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. For indirect immunofluorescence anti-Bax (N-20, 2 μg/ml; 6A7, 1 μg/ml) and anti-Hsp60 (SPA-806, 1 μg/ml, StressGen) antibodies were used. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used as suggested by the manufacturer. Direct labeling of anti-TG2 and anti-Bax (2D2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies with Alexa Fluor was performed with Zenon Mouse IgG Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 6 μg of each monoclonal antibody were labeled with 30 μl of Zenon Mouse IgG labeling reagent for 5 min at room temperature, and then the reaction was blocked by addition of 30 μl of Zenon blocking reagent and further incubation for 5 min. The formed complex was added to permeabilized fixed cells, and incubation was carried out for 1 h in the dark. After washing three times with PBS, cells were subjected to a second fixation for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and nuclei counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). The dried slides were mounted with Prolong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes) and examined with a Nikon Eclipse TE200 epifluorescence microscope equipped with Coolsnap CCD camera. Images were assembled with Adobe Photoshop. TG2 Has a Functional BH3 Domain—TG2 protein selectively accumulates to high levels in cells undergoing cell death by apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro (27Piacentini M. Fesus L. Farrace M.G. Ghibelli L. Piredda L. Melino G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar, 28Piacentini M. Melino G. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 385: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with this, we previously showed that TG2-overexpressing cells (TGA) were primed toward apoptosis, and their mitochondria were greatly modified both at the ultrastructural and functional levels (19Piacentini M. Farrace M.G. Piredda L. Matarrese P. Ciccosanti F. Falasca L. Rodolfo C. Giammarioli A.M. Verderio E. Griffin M. Malorni W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the basis of this evidence, we decided to further investigate the role exerted by TG2 at the mitochondrial level. We first analyzed the primary structure of TG2, in search of sequences that might be involved in its subcellular localization or responsible for specific protein-protein interactions. This analysis led us to the identification of an eight amino acid region (amino acids 204-212 in the enzyme's catalytic core) that shares more than 70% identity with the Bcl-2 BH3 domain (Fig. 1A). This sequence showed the presence of the highly conserved leucine, at position 204, and only two different amino acids out of eight. At first glance, the substitution of the aspartic acid 209, which is highly conserved in all other proteins of the Bcl-2 family, with arginine might be considered as relevant, given the opposite charge of the two amino acids. On the other hand, it might not be as drastic with respect to steric hindrance and folding properties. The other substitution, phenylalanine 211 with cysteine, occurs in an amino acid that seems not to be relevant for the domain-mediated interaction, at least as described for the other Bcl-2 family members (29Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, by comparing the surrounding sequence to the 12 amino acid BH3 consensus found on Prosite (ca.expasy.org/prosite/), we found only one other difference consisting of a shift of the first amino acid of the domain. Computer-assisted analysis of the published crystal structure of TG2 (8Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) revealed that the identified TG2 domain is structured into two α-helices, the conformation expected for the BH3 domain of Bcl-2 family proteins (30Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and exposed to the interaction with solvent (represented in red in Fig. 1B). Analyses carried out to identify other putative BH domains in TG2 primary sequence do not lead to the identification of regions showing relevant homology to them. In order to assess the relevancy and functionality of this identified domain, we generated two different TG2 mutants in which the BH3 domain had been either deleted (TG2 ΔBH3) or the leucine 204 mutated to glutamic acid (TG2 L-E), because this amino acid has been described to be critical for the homo-/heterodimerization of Bax (29Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutated TG2s were expressed in SK-n-BE(2), by transient transfection, and sensitization to cell death induction was addressed. When we treated transfected cells with 1 μm staurosporine we observed that, as expected, expression of wild-type TG2 sensitized cells toward death. On the other hand, when the two mutants were expressed, this sensitization to death completely disappeared (Fig. 1C). We also observed that, as described (13Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TG2 bearing a mutation in the cysteine of the active site (C277S) was unable to sensitize cells toward cell death (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the identified domain is a functional one and that TG2 sensitization to death relies on this BH3 domain, which proves to be necessary but not sufficient for priming cells toward apoptosis. In fact, the C277S mutant that retains the BH3 domain but lacks the transamidating activity indicates the TG2 enzymatic activity as necessary for the sensitization to death. Effect of TG2-BH3 Peptide in Vivo—To further assess whether the identified domain behaves as previously characterized BH3 domains, we decided to use synthetic peptides bearing the domain sequence fused to the C terminus of the antennapedia sequence (ANT-BH3 peptides), as described by others (31Vieira H.L. Boya P. Cohen I. El Hamel C. Haouzi D. Druillenec S. Belzacq A.S. Brenner C. Roques B. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1963-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Schol"
https://openalex.org/W2069208899,"Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is an important membrane polyglycerolphospholipid required for the activity of a variety of enzymes and is a precursor for synthesis of cardiolipin and bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate. PG is subjected to remodeling subsequent to its <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis to incorporate appropriate acyl content for its biological functions and to prevent the harmful effect of lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) accumulation. The enzymes involved in the remodeling process have not yet been identified. We report here the identification and characterization of a human gene encoding an acyl-CoA: lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase (LPGAT1). Expression of the LPGAT1 cDNA in Sf9 insect and COS-7 cells led to a significant increase in LPG acyltransferase activity. In contrast, no significant acyltransferase activities were detected against glycerol 3-phosphate or a variety of lysophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylinositol, and lysophosphatidylserine. The recombinant human LPGAT1 enzyme recognized various acyl-CoAs and LPGs as substrates but demonstrated clear preference to long chain saturated fatty acyl-CoAs and oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors, which is consistent with the lipid composition of endogenous PGs identified from different tissues. Kinetic analyses of LPGAT1 expressed in COS-7 cells showed that oleoyl-LPG was preferred over palmitoyl-LPG as an acyl receptor, whereas oleoyl-CoA was preferred over lauroyl-CoA as an acyl donor. Consistent with its proposed microsomal origin, LPGAT1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum by subcellular fractionation and immunohistochemical analyses. Northern blot analysis indicated that the human LPGAT1 was widely distributed, suggesting a dynamic functional role of the enzyme in different tissues."

Nectins first form cell-cell contact and then recruit cadherins to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites to form adherens junctions cooperatively with cadherins. In addition, the trans-interactions of nectins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, which enhances the formation of adherens junctions by forming filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively. The trans-interactions of nectins first recruit and activate c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. c-Src then phosphorylates and activates FRG, a Cdc42-GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42. The activation of both c-Src and Cdc42 by FRG is necessary for the activation of Rac, but the Rac-GEF responsible for this activation of Rac remains unknown. We showed here that the nectin-induced activation of Rac was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Vav2, a Rac-GEF. Nectins recruited and tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2 through c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites, whereas Cdc42 was not necessary for the nectin-induced recruitment of Vav2 or the nectin-induced, c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2. Cdc42 activated through c-Src then enhanced the GEF activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2 on Rac1. These results indicate that Vav2 is a GEF responsible for the nectin-induced, c-Src-, and Cdc42-mediated activation of Rac.

At AJs in epithelial cells, E-cadherin functions as a major cell-cell adhesion molecule (for reviews, see Refs. 2Gumbiner B.M.

E-cadherin is a member of the cadherin superfamily consisting of over 80 members, each of which is expressed in a wide variety of cells not only in epithelial cells but also in non-epithelial cells (for reviews, see Refs. 11Takeichi M.

E-cadherin first forms homo-cis-dimers and then homo-trans-dimers (trans-interactions) through the extracellular region in a Ca2+-dependent manner, inducing cell-cell adhesion (9Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through α- and β-catenins, which strengthens its cell-cell adhesion activity (5Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 7Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 8Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar and 15Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nectins comprise a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. Each member first forms homo-cis-dimers and then homo- or hetero-trans-dimers (trans-interactions) through the extracellular region in a Ca2+-independent manner, causing cell-cell contact. The cytoplasmic region is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectin- and F-actin-binding protein. Nectins are involved in the formation of AJs cooperatively with E-cadherin in epithelial cells; the trans-interactions of nectins first form cell-cell contact and then recruit E-cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites, inducing the formation of AJs. In addition, nectins play a role in the formation of AJs in fibroblasts, synapses in neurons, contacts between commissural axons and floor plate cells in developing mice, and spermatid-Sertoli cell junctions in the testis cooperatively with, or independently of, cadherins (14Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the formation of AJs is enhanced through the Cdc42- and Rac-mediated formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (16Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J.

The Cdc42-formed filopodia increase the cell-cell contact sites, whereas the Rac-formed lamellipodia efficiently zip the cell-cell contact between filopodia, acting like a “zipper,” eventually enhancing the formation of AJs.

The trans-interactions of nectins first recruit and activate c-Src. c-Src then tyrosine-phosphorylates FRG, a specific GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42, and induces the activation of Rap1 small G protein through C3G, a Rap-GEF, at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites (28Fukuhara T.

Activated Rap1 then enhances the GEF activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG on Cdc42. The activation of both c-Src and Cdc42 is necessary for the activation of Rac, but the Rac-GEF responsible for this activation of Rac remains unknown. Many GEFs for Rac, including Vav, Tiam, GRNP, Abr, BCR, PIX, P-REX1, Asef, and Trio, have been identified (for a review, see Ref. 29Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Among them, the Vav family members, consisting of three members, Vav1, -2, and -3, are strictly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation on their GEF activity (30Teramoto H. Salem P. Robbins K.C.

In addition, it has recently been reported that Vav2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells transfected with activated c-Src and induces the activation of Rac1 and the formation of lamellipodia (32Servitja J.M.

Therefore, we have examined here whether Vav2 is involved in the nectin-induced, c-Src-, and Cdc42-mediated activation of Rac. Expression Plasmids—The full-length mouse Vav2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. X. R. Bustelo (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). A Vav2 mutant changing Leu212 to Gln was used as a dominant negative mutant of Vav2 (Vav2-DN), and an N-terminal region (amino acids: 1–183)-truncated mutant of Vav2 was used as a constitutively active mutant of Vav2 (Vav2-CA) as described (34Kodama A. Matozaki T. Fukuhara A. Kikyo M. Ichihashi M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2565-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for Myc-tagged and FLAG-tagged wild-type Vav2 (pCIneo-Myc-Vav2 and pEF-BOS-FLAG-Vav2) were constructed by inserting a full-length of Vav2 cDNA into pCIneo-Myc and pEF-BOS-FLAG, respectively. An expression vector for Myc-tagged Vav2-CA (pCIneo-Myc-Vav2-CA) was constructed by inserting amino acids 184–868 of Vav2 cDNA into pCIneo-Myc. An expression vector for Myc-tagged Vav2-DN (pCIneo-Myc-Vav2-DN) was point-mutated at Leu212 to Gln by site-directed mutagenesis of pCIneo-Myc-Vav2 as described (35Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H.

The full-length human Tiam1 cDNA was kindly supplied by Dr. A. M. Crompton (Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, CA).

NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, consisting of the NWASP-Cdc42 and Rac-interacting binding (CRIB) domain and the C-terminal polybasic sequence of amino acids (CAAX; C is Cys, A is aliphatic, and X is a variety of amino acids), is preferentially targeted to the plasma membrane and inhibits the Cdc42 activity by specifically binding to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 (20Fukuhara A.

Expression vectors for GFP-V12Cdc42 (pEGFP-V12Cdc42) and GFP-V12Rac1 (pEGFP-V12Rac1) were kindly supplied from Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). V12Cdc42 and V12Rac1 are constitutively active mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1, respectively, changing Gly12 to Val. An expression vector for FLAG-V12Cdc42 (pEF-BOS-FLAG-V12Cdc42) was constructed by inserting V12Cdc42 cDNA into pEF-BOS-FLAG. An expression vector for wild-type c-Src (pUSE-Src) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. All the constructs used here were confirmed by sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein. Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Mouse fibroblast L cells and MDCK cells were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) and Dr. W. Birchmeier (Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany), respectively. L cells and MDCK cells stably expressing nectin-1α (nectin-1-L cells and nectin-1-MDCK cells, respectively) were prepared as described (37Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K.

These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells with a confocal imaging system (Radian 2100, Bio-Rad Laboratories) were performed as described (37Takahashi K. Nakanishi H.

Briefly, nectin-1-L cells were seeded on each well of a 24-well plate and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 12 h. Latex-sulfate microbeads coated with the extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the Fc portion of IgG (Nef-3) or concanavalin A (ConA) as a control were added to each well. After a 60-min incubation, the cells were fixed and immunostained. Assays for the Immunoprecipitation and the Vav2 GEF Activity—The immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described (28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, nectin-1-L cells (1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected in the combination with 6 μg of pEF-BOS-FLAG-Vav2, pcDNA-c-Src, pEGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, pEGFP-V12Cdc42, and pEGFP. After an 8-h culture, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h. The medium was then replaced by 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing clustered Nef-3 or IgG with or without 20 μm PP2 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), an inhibitor for Src family kinases, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. The cells were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, lysed in 0.5 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm (p-amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate/sodium, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cell extract (750 μg of protein) was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, incubated with 5 μl of the anti-FLAG mAb at 4 °C for 1 h, and further incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After the incubation, the beads were washed with Buffer A. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The GEF activity was assayed as described (39Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16626-16634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rac1 (10 pmol) was assayed by measuring the radioactivity of [35S]GTPγS bound to Rac1 after incubation for indicated periods of time in the presence of each immunoprecipitant from the cells treated with clustered Nef-3 or IgG for 30 min. Inhibition of the Nectin-induced Formation of Lamellipodia by a Dominant Negative Mutant of Vav2—Nectins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac, which then form filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, in L fibroblasts (21Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By using nectin-1-L cells and Nef-3, we first examined whether Vav2 is involved in the nectin-induced formation of lamellipodia. When nectin-1-L cells were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips, both filopodia and lamellipodia were formed as described (21Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). However, lamellipodia were hardly formed in nectin-1-L cells overexpressing Myc-Vav2-DN. The formation of filopodia was also reduced by Myc-Vav2-DN, although the effect of Myc-Vav2-DN on the formation of filopodia was less than that on the formation of lamellipodia. This result is different from our previous observation on the effect of a dominant negative mutant of Rac, which inhibits the Nef-3-induced formation of lamellipodia but not that of filopodia (21Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The exact reason for this difference is not known, but Myc-Vav2-DN may interfere with FRG and thereby inhibit the FRG-induced activation of Cdc42. Moreover, when the cells were cultured on the IgG-coated coverslips, the formation of lamellipodia in nectin-1-L cells overexpressing Myc-Vav2-DN appeared to be further inhibited than that in nectin-1-L cells overexpressing an empty vector. Although the exact reason for this further inhibition of the formation of lamellipodia by Myc-Vav2-DN remains unclear, Vav2 may play a role other than a Rac-GEF. The Nef-3-induced formation of filopodia or lamellipodia was not inhibited by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Tiam1, another Rac-GEF, in nectin-1-L cells, suggesting that Vav2 functions as a specific Rac-GEF in the nectin-induced formation of lamellipodia, although the involvement of another Rac-GEF(s) could not be excluded. When the similar experiments were performed with nectin-1-MDCK cells, the essentially same results were obtained (data not shown). These results, together with the earlier observation that the Nef-3-induced formation of lamellipodia is mediated by Rac (21Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicate that Vav2 is necessary for the nectin-induced activation of Rac in nectin-1-L and nectin-1-MDCK cells. If Vav2 functions upstream of Rac, overexpression of V12Rac1, a constitutively active mutant of Rac1, in nectin-1-L cells would suppress the inhibitory effect of Vav2-DN. Consistently, overexpression of GFP-V12Rac1 restored the formation of lamellipodia, but not filopodia, in nectin-1-L cells expressing Myc-Vav2-DN when the cells were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips (Fig. 1B). Essentially the same results were obtained for nectin-1-MDCK cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that Vav2 functions upstream of Rac in the nectin-induced formation of lamellipodia in nectin-1-L cells and nectin-1-MDCK cells. Recruitment of Vav2 to the Contact Sites between the Nef-3-coated Beads and Nectin-1-L Cells—We have previously shown that c-Src and FRG are recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites (28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We next examined whether Vav2 is recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. Nectin-1-L cells transiently expressing FLAG-Vav2 were incubated with the Nef-3-coated beads. The ConA-coated beads were used as a control. The immunofluorescence signals for nectin-1 and FLAG-Vav2 were concentrated at the contact sites between the Nef-3-coated beads and the nectin-1-L cells expressing FLAG-Vav2 but not between the ConA-coated beads and the nectin-1-L cells expressing FLAG-Vav2 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when nectin-1-L cells expressing Myc-Tiam1 were incubated with the Nef-3- or ConA-coated beads, the signal for Myc-Tiam1 was not concentrated at either of the bead-cell contact sites (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that Vav2 is likely to be specifically recruited by nectins to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. Involvement of c-Src in the Nectin-induced, Vav2-mediated Formation of Lamellipodia and the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Vav2—We have previously shown that Src family kinases (SFKs) are necessary for the nectin-induced activation of Rac (28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that Vav2 functions downstream of SFKs. The nectin-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia was inhibited in nectin-1-L cells in the presence of PP2, an inhibitor of SFKs, but not in the presence of PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2 (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effects of PP2 were suppressed in nectin-1-L cells expressing Myc-Vav2-CA regarding the formation of lamellipodia. It may be noted that filopodia were not formed in nectin-1-L cells expressing Myc-Vav2-CA in the presence of PP2. This may be due to the fact that the inhibition by PP2 of the c-Src-induced, FRG-mediated activation of Cdc42 was not rescued by Vav2-CA. These results suggest that Vav2 functions downstream of SFKs and induces the activation of Rac, but not Cdc42, in nectin-1-L cells. Although Vav2-CA significantly restored the formation of lamellipodia in the presence of PP2, there was a slight difference from the control on the extent of the formation of lamellipodia and the cell morphology. When nectin-1-L cells overexpressing both Vav2-CA and V12Cdc42 were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips in the presence of PP2, lamellipodia as well as filopodia were formed to similar extents to the control levels, and the cell morphology of these cells was also similar to that of the control cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of Cdc42, which is induced by the trans-interactions of nectins through FRG, a Cdc42-GEF, might be additionally necessary to induce the maximal activation of Vav2 on Rac. We then examined whether Vav2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src. Nectin-1-L cells transiently overexpressing FLAG-tagged Vav2 and c-Src were incubated with Nef-3 clustered with an anti-human Fc pAb and subjected to the immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-FLAG mAb. IgG clustered with an anti-human Fc pAb was used as a control. Vav2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by clustered Nef-3, whereas it was not tyrosine-phosphorylated by clustered IgG (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 induced by clustered Nef-3 was inhibited by PP2. These results indicate that nectins induce the c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 in nectin-1-L cells. No Requirement of Cdc42 for the Nectin-induced Recruitment of Vav2—We have previously shown that Rap1 is necessary for the Nef-3-induced activation of tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG but not necessary for the Nef-3-induced recruitment of FRG or the Nef-3-induced, c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FRG (28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 53Fukuyama T.

We next examined whether Cdc42 is necessary for the Nef-3-induced recruitment of Vav2 and the c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2. When nectin-1-L cells expressing Vav2 were incubated with the Nef-3-coated beads or the ConA-coated beads, the immunofluorescence signals for nectin-1 and Vav2 were observed at the contact sites between the Nef-3-coated beads and nectin-1-L cells but not between the ConA-coated beads and nectin-1-L cells (Fig. 4A). The localization of nectin-1 and Vav2 was not affected by GFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, a specific inhibitor of activated Cdc42 (40Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). In Fig. 4A, when GFP-CAAX as a control for GFP-NWASP-CAAX was co-expressed with Vav2, we observed that the recruitment of GFP-CAAX to the Nef-3-coated beads was similar to that to the ConA-coated beads, suggesting that the recruitment of GFP-CAAX to the bead-cell contact sites might not be dependent on the trans-interactions of nectins. Nectin-1-L cells transiently overexpressing FLAG-tagged Vav2 and c-Src were incubated with Nef-3 clustered with an anti-human Fc pAb and subjected to the immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-FLAG mAb. Vav2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by Nef-3 clustered with an anti-human Fc pAb, but this tyrosine phosphorylation was not inhibited by GFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Cdc42 is not necessary for the Nef-3-induced recruitment of Vav2 or the Nef-3-induced, c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2. c-Src- and Cdc42-mediated Activation of Vav2—In the final set of experiments, we examined in a cell-free assay system whether Nef-3 enhanced the GEF activity of Vav2 on Rac. The GEF activity on Rac of FLAG-Vav2 immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG mAb from the Nef-3-treated nectin-1-L cells was more active than that from the IgG-treated cells, indicating that Nef-3 induces the activation of Vav2 (Fig. 5). This Nef-3-induced activation of Vav2 was inhibited by PP2 and GFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX (20Fukuhara A. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51885-51893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition of the GEF activity of Vav2 in the presence of PP2 was not restored by V12Cdc42, a constitutively active form of Cdc42. Taken together, these results indicate that the activation of only Cdc42 is insufficient and that both the activation of Cdc42 and the nectin-induced, c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 are necessary for the activation of Vav2. We have previously shown that the trans-interactions of nectins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac (21Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

We have then studied how they induce the activation of these small G proteins and have found that the trans-interactions of nectins first recruit and activate c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites (28Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activated c-Src then tyrosine-phosphorylates FRG, a Cdc42-GEF, and activates C3G, a Rap1-GEF, through Crk, an adaptor of c-Src, at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. Rap1 then enhances the GEF activity on Cdc42 of tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG (53Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. J Biol. Chem. 2004; (10.1074/jbc.M411099200)Google Scholar). At that time, we have found that the activation of both c-Src and Cdc42 is necessary for the activation of Rac, but it remained unknown which Rac-GEF is responsible for this activation of Rac. We have clarified in this study that at least Vav2 is a GEF responsible for this activation of Rac; Vav2 is recruited, tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src, and activated at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. The c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 alone is insufficient for the activation of Vav2, and the activation of Cdc42 is additionally necessary for it, consistent with the earlier observations (28Fukuhara T.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It may be noted that Cdc42 is not necessary for the nectin-induced recruitment of Vav2 to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites or the nectin-induced, c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2. The Vav gene was originally isolated as an oncogene (42Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In mammals, Vav1 expression is highly restricted in hematopoietic cells, whereas Vav2 and Vav3 are ubiquitously expressed (for reviews, see Refs. 43Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar and 44Hornstein I. Alcover A. Katzav S. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All Vav proteins share several characteristic structural domains; they have a calponin homology domain, an acidic-rich domain, a Dbl homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, an Src homology 2 domain, and two Src homology 3 domains from the N terminus to the C terminus in this order. Overexpression of wild-type or N-terminal truncated Vav proteins induce cellular transformation, which is generally related to tumor metastasis (45Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar, 46Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). There are several reports showing that Vav2 activates RhoA and Cdc42 as well as Rac1 (33Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 47Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the extent of the activation of each small G protein is dependent on the in vitro and in vivo experiments or cell lines used. In our assay system, Vav2 specifically induces the activation of Rac. The structural analysis of Vav proteins has revealed that at the resting state, the GEF activity of Vav is inhibited by its N-terminal arm, which occludes the Dbl homology domain essential for interacting with small G proteins and changing from the GDP form to the GTP form of these proteins (49Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). When the tyrosine residue, Tyr174, in the N-terminal arm of Vav is phosphorylated by activated c-Src, the N-terminal arm is released from the Dbl homology domain, resulting in the exposure of the site with GEF activity and the activation of Rac. Thus, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 is required for its activation. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 alone is not sufficient at least for the nectin-induced activation of Rac, and activated Cdc42 is additionally required. It remains unknown how Cdc42 activates tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2. In this study, when we used the N-terminal truncated form of Vav2 (amino acids: 184–868) as Vav2-CA (34Kodama A. Matozaki T. Fukuhara A. Kikyo M. Ichihashi M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2565-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which lacks the N-terminal inhibitory domain and constitutively activates Rac, the restoration by Vav2-CA of the formation of lamellipodia in the presence of PP2 was almost complete, but there is a slight difference from the control. Nectin-1-L cells overexpressing both Vav2-CA and V12Cdc42 formed lamellipodia as well as filopodia to similar extents to the control levels. This raises the possibility that the activation of Cdc42 through c-Src is additionally necessary to induce the maximal activation of Vav2 on Rac. The present results are consistent with the recent report that Vav2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells transfected with activated c-Src and induces the activation of Rac1 and the formation of lamellipodia (32Servitja J.M. Marinissen M.J. Sodhi A. Bustelo X.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34339-34346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, there is a recent report that the cell spreading is actually observed in T cells expressing GEF activity-impaired Vav1 (50del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Hu J. Kiosses W.B. Altman A. Villalba M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reason why these discrepancies exist remains unknown, but it may be due to the difference of cell types or the difference of the function between Vav1 and Vav2. Moreover, platelets from Vav1-/- or Vav1-/-/Vav2-/- mice do not show any inhibitory effects on cell spreading when platelets are plated on the fibrinogen-coated coverslips (51Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Vav1-/-/Vav2-/- mice, Vav3 may compensate for the lack of Vav1 and Vav2 on the integrin-induced cell spreading. A further investigation using all Vav proteins-null (Vav1/2/3 knock-out) mice, which have been recently generated, could contribute to resolving this issue (52Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Taken together, we propose here a current model for the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac in Fig. 6. Nectins first recruit and activate c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. c-Src then recruits and tyrosine-phosphorylates FRG there, whereas c-Src induces the activation of Rap1 through the Crk-C3G complex at the same sites. Rap1 then induces the activation of tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG, eventually inducing the activation of Cdc42. Cdc42 then induces the formation of filopodia through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which enhances the formation of AJs (16Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 127-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, c-Src recruits and tyrosine-phosphorylates Vav2. Cdc42 activates tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2, eventually inducing the activation of Rac. Rac then induces the formation of lamellipodia, which also enhances the formation of AJs (19Ehrlich J.S.

The repair system employs processing enzymes to restore the stalled fork. In Archaea Hef is a well conserved protein that specifically cleaves nicked, flapped, and fork-structured DNAs. This enzyme contains two distinct domains that are similar to the DEAH helicase family and XPF nuclease superfamily proteins. Analyses of truncated mutant proteins consisting of each domain revealed that the C-terminal nuclease domain independently recognized and incised fork-structured DNA. The N-terminal helicase domain also specifically unwound fork-structured DNA and Holliday junction DNA in the presence of ATP. Moreover, the endonuclease activity of the whole Hef protein was clearly stimulated by ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the N-terminal domain. These enzymatic properties suggest that Hef efficiently resolves stalled replication forks by two steps, which are branch point transfer to the 5′-end of the nascent lagging strand by the N-terminal helicase followed by template strand incision for leading strand synthesis by the C-terminal endonuclease.

It is essential for living organisms to replicate and transfer the genetic information in the genome precisely from parents to offspring. Interference with accurate DNA replication by a variety of intrinsic causes and extrinsic agents leads to serious diseases, including cancer. To maintain the accuracy of DNA replication, several repair systems developed in living organisms during evolution. The proofreading activity of DNA polymerases directly works for accurate DNA strand synthesis (for review, see Ref. 1Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). In addition, several repair systems operate at the damaged points and are controlled by the cell cycle checkpoint system (for review, see Refs. 2Carr A.M. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and 3Sancar A Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaccmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). The well known repair systems, such as nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair, and end joining are conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes (3Sancar A Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaccmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). In the cells the DNA replication fork often stops at nucleotide lesions, backbone gaps, regions with secondary DNA structures, protein-bound regions, and other anomalous regions during DNA replication (for review, see Ref. 4Bierne H. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol.

To overcome the obstruction of the fork progression, cells utilize replication-coupled repair systems. Multiple pathways have beenproposedfortherepairofreplicationforks.DNApolymerase-dependent translesion synthesis and bypass or collapse/restart of the stalled fork are two major pathways (for review, see Refs. 4Bierne H.

In the latter case a Holliday junction (HJ) 1The abbreviations used are: HJ, Holliday junction; DTT, dithiothreitol; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). intermediate is produced by regression of the fork and annealing of the two nascent strands, and this intermediate is resolved by reprogression after bypass synthesis at the lesion site or by cleavage at the junction point with HJ resolvases. HJ structures formed from stalled replication forks in the cells have been observed by electron microscopy (14Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 15Sogo J.M. Lopez M. Foiani M. Science. 2000; 297: 599-602Crossref Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the stalled fork can be directly cleaved by a structure-specific endonuclease. When the DNA strands of the HJ or fork structure are cleaved by these endonucleases, the fork can be reconstructed by homologous recombination starting from the free DNA ends. The relationships between replication and recombination have mostly been analyzed in Escherichia coli (16Briggs G.S. Mahdi A.A. Weller G.R. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

The Mus81 protein, which is conserved in all eukaryotic organisms and shares sequence similarity with the XPF (mammals) and Rad1 (yeast) endonucleases, is a structure-specific endonuclease that works as a heterodimer with Eme1 (human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) or Mms4 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (18Boddy M.N.

This protein complex has recently been in the spotlight in the research field of DNA repair and recombination, and there has been much debate about its in vivo function (26Haber J.E. Heyer W.D.

Recent reports on the substrate specificity of the purified Mus81 complex suggested that this endonuclease directly cleaves stalled replication forks near the junction point to facilitate the resumption of the fork progression after recombinational repair (21Doe C.L.

Yeast mus81 mutants are sensitive to agents such as methylmethane sulfonate and camptothecin, which can stall replication forks, but not to ionizing radiation and bleomycin, which introduce DNA double strand breaks (21Doe C.L.

On the other hand, the human and yeast Mus81·Eme1 complexes also cleave HJs in vitro, and the yeast protein has substrate preference for a nicked HJ (32Gaillard P.H. Noguchi E. Shanahan P. Russell P.

Cell. 2003; 12: 761-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). From these observations, one of the proposed functions of Mus81 has been to resolve the intermediate in meiotic recombination to generate crossovers (for review, see Ref. 34Hollingsworth N.M. Brill S.J. Gene Dev. 2004; 18: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Archaea, the third domain of life (35Woese C.R. Fox G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5088-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar), is distinct from both Bacteria and Eukaryotes. Whereas Archaea belong to the prokaryotes in terms of cellular ultrastructure, they share many similarities with eukaryotes in the information processing pathways, including DNA replication, transcription, and translation (36Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the archaeal processes provide a useful model system to understand the more complex mechanisms of their eukaryote equivalents. Several proteins involved in homologous recombination are also conserved between eukaryotes and Archaea. For example, RadA and RadB, which play a central role in the initiation steps of homologous recombination (37Hayashi I. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J.

Kato I. Ishino Y. Genes Cells. 1995; 2: 499-512Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 41DiRuggiero J. Robb F. Le Gal Y. Halvorson H. New Developments in Marine Bio/Technology. Plenum Press, New York1998: 193-196Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Pyrococcus furiosus RPA, which is composed of three subunits like the eukaryotic RPA but differs from the bacterial single-stranded DNA binding protein, clearly stimulated a RadA-mediated strand exchange reaction (42Komori K. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25654-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). With regard to the HJ processing, we identified an archaeal HJ resolvase and named it Hjc (43Komori K Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hjc is an Archaea-specific protein, which lacks sequence and three-dimensional structural similarity to any other known HJ resolvase (44Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40385-40391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of the HJ processing in Archaea, we searched for proteins related to Hjc and found a novel endonuclease activity in P. furiosus. Identification of the gene corresponding to this activity revealed that the encoded protein consists of two distinct domains that are similar to the DEAH helicase family and the XPF nuclease superfamily. Biochemical characterization of each purified domain showed that these proteins have a specific affinity for branched DNA structures, including the replication fork. Actually, the N-terminal domain possesses an ATPase activity that was dramatically stimulated by fork-structured DNAs. The C-terminal domain has an endonuclease activity that specifically cleaved nicked, flapped, and fork-structured DNAs. Therefore, we designated this protein as Hef (helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA) (46Komori K. Fujikane R. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 2002; 77: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Nishino T. Komori K. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2003; 11: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hef is well conserved in Archaea and may be a prototypical enzyme for the eukaryotic XPF/Rad1/Mus81 nuclease family, working in important repair processes. To understand the function of Hef in more detail, we purified the full-length Hef protein to homogeneity and characterized its helicase and nuclease activities in this study. These two activities seem to work together for very efficient fork processing. Synthetic DNA Substrates—The duplex (D), nicked (N), 3′-flap (3F), 5′-flap (5F), and pseudo-X (PX)-structured DNAs and the Holliday junction DNA (HSL) were prepared by annealing of the synthetic oligonucleotides as described earlier (48Komori K.

The various fork-structured DNAs without a mobile region (FI), with a single-stranded region on the nascent strand of lagging synthesis (FG, FG4) or leading synthesis (FGE), containing a mobile region (FM) and containing a homologous region to facilitate the formation of a Holliday junction (FH) were also prepared by annealing the oligonucleotides. The nucleotide sequences and the combination of the synthetic oligonucleotide DNAs for the various substrate structures are shown in Table I.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used to make synthetic substrates Open table in a new tab Construction of Expression Vectors for the hef Gene—The hef gene was amplified by PCR directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA using the primers, 5′-GCACTACCATGGTATTAAGGAGAGACTTAA-3′ and 5′-GTGCGTCGACCTACTCCTCATCCTCTATAT-3′. PyroBEST DNA polymerase (TakaRa) was used to maintain the accuracy of amplification. To place the translational initiation codon ATG at the NcoI site for the expression vector of pTV118 (Takara), the recognition sequences were included in the forward primer. In the reverse primer the SalI site was placed just after the termination codon. The PCR products were digested with NcoI-SalI, and the proper fragment was inserted into the corresponding sites of pTV118. The resultant plasmid was designated as pTVHef, and its nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The full-length Hef protein can be produced without any tag by pTVHef. Purification of the Recombinant Hef Protein—E. coli JM109 carrying pTVHef was grown on LB agar medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 1 day. The cells (11 g) were harvested from the agar plates, suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 m NaCl, proteinase inhibitor (Complete™, Roche Applied Science)), and disrupted by a French press. The supernatant was treated at 80 °C for 20 min, and the heat-resistant fraction was obtained by centrifugation. The heat-resistant fraction was fractionated on a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2 m NaCl. The Hef protein was eluted at 0.5–0.6 m NaCl. The fraction was diluted with two volumes of buffer B and loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions that eluted at 0.36–0.44 m NaCl were pooled and fractionated on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.3 m NaCl. The fractions that eluted at about 1.2 ml of retention volume were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and were stored at –140 °C. The concentration of purified Hef protein was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The theoretical molar absorption coefficient of the molecule was calculated based on its tryptophan and tyrosine content, as described previously (49Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient of Hef is 50,920 m–1cm–1. Two truncated proteins, N546 (1–546) and C547′ (547–763), were prepared as described previously (46Komori K. Fujikane R. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 2002; 77: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Endonuclease Assays—The purified full-length Hef and C547′ proteins were incubated with 10 nm concentrations of the various substrate structures labeled with 32P at the 5′-or3′-end in cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl) at 60 °C for 30 min. The products were mixed with the same volume of loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol) and analyzed by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris-buffered EDTA followed by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—P. furiosus cells (1 g) were disrupted by sonication in 15 ml of buffer B containing proteinase inhibitor (Complete™), and the extract was obtained by centrifugation. The P. furiosus cell extract (800 ng) and the purified Hef proteins (1 ng) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and reacted with anti-N546 or anti-C547′ antiserum. The bands were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's recommendations. Gel-retardation Assay—Purified N546 protein was incubated with 2 nm 5′-32P-labeled duplex (D) or fork (FI) in binding buffer (20 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATPγS) at 37 °C for 20 min. Then glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the reactions were incubated for further 5 min at room temperature for fixation of the DNA-protein complexes. The products were separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1×TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and were visualized by autoradiography. ATPase Assay—Purified N546 or Hef protein (each at 50 nm) was incubated with 1 mm ATP and [α-32P]ATP (25 pCi/μl) in cleavage buffer in the presence or absence of DNA with various structures (800 nm) at 60 °C for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 60 min. Aliquots of reactions were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The amounts of ATP and ADP were quantified from the autoradiograms using a laser-excited image analyzer (BAS5000, Fujifilm). Helicase Assay—Purified N546 protein was incubated with 5′-32P-labeled FG4 or HSL (each at 2 nm) in helicase buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C or 55 °C. After phenol extraction the products were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer followed by autoradiography. Effect of C547′ on the Arrested Replication Forks in E. coli—To produce the C547′ and C547′ mutant (C547′m) proteins in E. coli, the genes encoding C547′ and C547′m were each inserted into the pBAD24 vector under the control of the araC promoter. As for C547′m, a mutant with no endonuclease activity due to one amino acid substitution, D583A, at the catalytic center (47Nishino T. Komori K. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2003; 11: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was used. The fork-blocked strains (50Horiuchi T. Fujimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring pBAD24-C547′, pBAD24-C547′m, or the pBAD24 vector alone were grown logarithmically in LB medium containing 1% glucose and were collected at the indicated time points after the induction of C547′ or C547′m production by changing the medium to LB plus 0.2% arabinose. The collected cells were embedded into agarose plugs and lysed in basically the same way as described previously (51Michel B. Ehrlich S.D. Uzest M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and then subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose gel following PvuII restriction enzyme digestion. Southern hybridization analysis was performed as described previously (52Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 382-389Google Scholar). Production and Purification of the Hef Protein—The full-length hef gene was directly amplified from P. furious genomic DNA and cloned into the pTV118 expression vector. The resultant plasmid, pTVHef, was introduced into E. coli JM109, and the hef gene was expressed in the cells. However, the transformants grew slowly in the liquid medium, and the production level of Hef protein was very low. Furthermore, the protein rapidly degraded in the cells, although various cultivation conditions were tested. When E. coli carrying pTVHef was grown on LB-agar plates and the cells were directly collected from the plates, the yield and the stability of Hef protein in E. coli were substantially improved. The recombinant Hef protein was stable against heat treatment at 80 °C for 20 min. After sequential column chromatography, including gel-filtration for the removal of the degraded products, the Hef protein was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses using domain-specific anti-N546 and anti-C547′ antisera showed that the molecular weight of the recombinant Hef protein was consistent with that of the protein produced in P. furiosus cells (Fig. 1B). The slight difference of the band mobility between recombinant Hef and native Hef in Fig. 1B is probably due to the difference of salt concentration in the sample solutions. The Hef Protein Forms a Homodimer at the C-terminal Domain—The XPF nuclease family members are known to form and act as heterodimers (27Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Solinger J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 548-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Hef forms a dimer, gel-filtration analyses were carried out for the full-length and truncated mutant Hef proteins. The full-length Hef protein was eluted at a position corresponding to about 170 kDa, clearly showing the formation of a homodimer (Fig. 2A). Then the region responsible for the dimer formation was analyzed by using two mutant proteins. The two truncated proteins, N546 (1–546) and C547′ (547–763), were subjected to the same column chromatography under the same conditions. The elution peaks of N546 and C547′ corresponded to 62 and 41 kDa, respectively, indicating that the N546 and C547′ proteins exist as a monomer and a dimer, respectively (Fig. 2B). These results show that Hef forms a stable dimer and the dimer interface region exists in the C-terminal endonuclease domain, as revealed by our crystallographic analysis (47Nishino T. Komori K. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2003; 11: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but not in the N-terminal helicase domain. When the mixture of the N546 and C547′ proteins was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography, these proteins eluted individually (Fig. 2B). The elution profiles of the N546 were slightly different between the mixture with C547′ and N546 alone (lower and upper panels, respectively in Fig. 2B). This difference probably depends on the different amounts of N546, which were loaded onto the gel-filtration column. To adjust the molecular ratio of N546 and C547′ to 1:1 in the mixture, 1.4 μg of N546 was mixed with 5 μg of C547′. On the other hand, 11 μg of protein was applied to the column to analyze the N546 by itself. These results indicate that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions exist as distinct domains and do not associate with each other in the Hef protein. Substrate Specificity of the Hef Endonuclease Activity—To investigate the substrate specificity of the Hef endonuclease activity, DNAs with various structures were labeled with 32P and were reacted with the Hef or C547′ protein. The Hef protein specifically cleaved nicked (N), flapped (5F, 3F, and PX), and fork-structured (FI) DNAs at the 5′ side of the nicked position (Fig. 3). Hef and C547′ could not cleave pseudo-Y structured DNA (PY, a fork-like structure with only the template DNA strands), in contrast to the XPF/ERCC1 endonuclease, which specifically cleaved this structure. Hef and C547′ recognized and cleaved the same DNA structures, suggesting that the substrate specificity for the cleavage ability of the Hef protein is contained in the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, the major bands produced by Hef and C547′ were detected with a one- or two-nucleotide difference in the denaturing gel electrophoresis (discussed below). Effects of Various Fork-structured DNAs on the Hef ATPase Activity—Previously, we reported that the N-terminal domain of Hef, N546, has ATPase activity, which is drastically enhanced by fork-structured DNAs (46Komori K. Fujikane R. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 2002; 77: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This result supports the idea that Hef works at a stalled replication fork. In this study, we further characterized the helicase-like domain of Hef. As shown in Fig. 4A, N546 specifically bound to fork-structured DNA. The ATPase activity of N546 was enhanced in the presence of fork-structured DNAs about 4–12 times more than in the reaction with normal duplex DNA. Among the fork-structured DNAs used in this study, a fork with an immobile branch point in which a single-stranded region is fixed in the template for lagging strand synthesis (FG) enhanced the ATPase activity of N546 about 2-fold higher than that by fork DNAs without a single-stranded region (FI) or with a single-stranded region on the nascent leading strand (FGE) DNA. When fork-structured DNAs containing a homologous region, by which the branch point can migrate (FM and FH), were added to the reaction, the most prominent enhancement of the ATPase activity was observed with the N546 protein. The DNA structure dependence of the ATPase derived from the full-length Hef protein was somewhat similar to that of the N546 protein (Fig. 4B). The N-terminal Domain of Hef Has a DNA Structure-specific Helicase—The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain of Hef is similar to those of the DEAH helicase family members and has an ATPase activity that is drastically stimulated by fork-structured DNAs, as described above. These observations suggested that the N-terminal domain of Hef may unwind and migrate the branch point of the stalled replication fork to a suitable position for incision by the C-terminal nuclease. To investigate whether the N-terminal domain of Hef has a DNA structure-specific helicase"

We constructed C. albicans strains expressing one, two, or three copies of the TRK1 gene in order to investigate possible roles of Trk1p (the organism's principal K+ transporter) in the actions of Hst 5. All measured parameters (Hst 5 killing, Hst 5-stimulated ATP efflux, normal Trk1p-mediated K+ (86Rb+) influx, and Trk1p-mediated chloride conductance) were similarly reduced (5–7-fold) by removal of a single copy of the TRK1 gene from this diploid organism and were fully restored by complementation of the missing allele. A TRK1 overexpression strain of C. albicans, constructed by integrating an additional TRK1 gene into wild-type cells, demonstrated cytoplasmic sequestration of Trk1 protein, along with somewhat diminished toxicity of Hst 5. These results could be produced either by depletion of intracellular free Hst 5 due to sequestered binding, or to cooperativity in Hst 5-protein interactions at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, Trk1p-mediated chloride conductance was blocked by 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid in all of the tested strains, strongly suggesting that the TRK1 protein provides the essential pathway for ATP loss and is the critical effector for Hst 5 toxicity in C. albicans.

Hst 5 is also effective against azole- or amphotericin-resistant strains of these fungi (7Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is of considerable practical importance and is of basic significance as well, suggesting a fundamental difference in their mechanisms of action. Hst 5 has been shown not to act like conventional poreforming cationic peptides (8Koshlukova S.E. Lloyd T.L. Araujo M.W.B. Edgerton M. J. Biol.

Instead, it acts via a multistep process that includes initial binding of extracellular Hst 5 to a Candida surface protein Ssa1/2p (10Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), followed by subsequent entry of Hst 5 into the cytoplasm (11Xu Y. Ambukar I. Yamagishi H. Swaim W.

That the primary target for Hst 5 is indeed intracellular has been verified by the observation that expression of a chromosomally encoded human-salivary histatin 5 gene, under the control of a regulated promoter, yields all of the customary toxic effects (13Baev D. Li X. Edgerton M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whatever the primary target for Hst 5, its actions quickly become apparent at the plasma membrane and include noncytolytic efflux of cellular ATP and of potassium and magnesium ions (8Koshlukova S.E.

These obvious membrane effects are accompanied by a rapid and irreversible loss of cell volume and ultimately by cell cycle arrest (16Baev D. Li X. Dong J. Keng P. Edgerton M. Infect.

Li X. Dong J. Keng P. Edgerton M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4777-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Potassium ions appear to be especially important in these protective phenomena. In addition to their biochemical role as enzyme cofactors (especially in protein synthesis; see Ref. 21Lubin M. The Cellular Functions of Membrane Transport. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1964: 193-211Google Scholar), they have several major physiological functions. Under normal circumstances, K+ accounts for ∼40% of the cytosolic osmoticum and therefore establishes background conditions against which control of cell turgor must operate. Also, as the major cytoplasmic cation, K+ controls the ionic strength of cytoplasm, a property closely related to its function as a catalytic cofactor. Cytoplasmic K+ can also buffer the electric potential difference across the plasma membrane (Vm, membrane voltage), which in turn supplies energy for the majority of “active” transport processes in fungal membranes. This role normally becomes important only when the membrane itself or its primary voltage generator, the H+-ATPase (22Slayman C.L. Long W.S. Lu C. Y.-H. J. Membr. Biol. 1973; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Slayman C.L. Kaminski P. Stetson D. Biochemistry of Cell Walls and Membranes of Fungi. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 295-312Google Scholar), is damaged or down-regulated. Tok1p, a cloned potassium channel which is the only certified K+ channel in Candida plasma membranes, may be the principal diffusion pathway for voltage stabilization (24Bertl A. Slayman C.L.

Acta. 2002; 1558: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another protein involved in these potassium-related phenomena is the major K+ uptake system in Candida, Trk1p. This transporter, initially cloned in Saccharomyces by Gaber et al. (29Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 8: 2848-2859Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar), is believed to operate as a proton-coupled system, having similar properties to the high affinity K+ uptake system in Neurospora (30Rodriguez-Navarro A.

Biol. 1987; 98: 169-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and has also been reckoned as a voltage regulator on the basis of dye distribution measurements (32Madrid R. Gomez J.J. Ramos J.

Finally, it has recently been shown to mediate chloride currents through Saccharomyces plasma membrane, which are made easily visible by raising intracellular Cl– above ∼10 mm (33Kuroda T. Bihler H.

The possible involvement of Tok1p in histatin toxicity was investigated by creating TOK1-disrupted mutants of C. albicans (34Baev D. Rivetta A. Li X.S. Vylkova S. Bashi E. Slayman C.L. Edgerton M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3251-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Knockout of TOK1 (tok1Δ/tok1Δ) completely abolished the characteristic currents of Tok1p and also reduced (but did not abolish) Hst 5-induced efflux of ATP. However, these cells had only slightly increased residual viability after Hst 5 treatment. The fact that standard Hst 5 treatment still produced very substantial killing and ATP efflux, after knockout of both wild-type TOK1 alleles, clearly demonstrated that Tok1p channels could not be the primary site of Hst 5 action, although they do play a modulating role. NSC1, the putative nonselective cation channel that is responsible for very low affinity K+ uptake in Saccharomyces (28Bihler H. Slayman C.L. Bertl A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1558: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Roberts S.K. Fischer M. Dixon G.K. Sanders D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 291-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is not yet accessible to mutational analysis. We therefore turned to the “Reactive” K+ transporter, Trk1p, for further examination of potassium involvement in Hst 5-mediated effects on Candida. The initial experimental objective was the same as that used with Tok1p (34Baev D. Rivetta A. Li X.S. Vylkova S. Bashi E. Slayman C.L. Edgerton M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3251-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which was to assess the effects of Hst 5 on killing and ATP loss in Candida strains deleted of one and deleted of both TRK1 alleles. However, it proved impossible to delete both TRK1 alleles, and all such attempts resulted in retention of a wild-type allele, a phenomenon associated with essential candidal genes. We therefore decided to overexpress TRK protein by introducing an additional TRK1 gene, into the RP10 locus of wild-type (CaTK2(wt)) cells, for comparison of TRK1p-mediated Hst 5 effects. TRK1 transcription, assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, approximated a multiplicative dependence on the number of genes present, but functional assays (conventional transport and electrophysiological measurements) implied a saturable step in translation and/or protein function. The most important findings, however, were that (a) TRK1 is required for Hst 5-toxicity, which marks Trk1p as the principal effector for Hst 5 action in Candida, and (b) the well known anion channel inhibitor DIDS blocks native chloride conductance in Candida Trk1p, which suggests that Trk1p in fact provides the anion pathway for Hst 5-induced ATP loss. Strains and Media—Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was used as host for plasmids and was grown in LB medium (Difco). Ampicillin was added at a final concentration of 100 μgml–1. Strain CAI4 of C. albicans (36Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for transformation, and strain SC5314 (37Gillum A.M. Tsay E.Y.H. Kirsch D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 198: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) provided genomic DNA for the CaURA3 locus amplification. Cells for transformation (CAI4) were grown on a rich medium (YPD; Difco) but were transferred to a minimal medium (YNB; Qbiogene) plus 2% glucose and lacking uridine for selection of the URA+ transformants. Solid media were made with 1.5% Bacto agar (Difco). To select ura– auxotrophs from the transformants, cells were plated on solid YNB containing 50 μg/ml uridine (200 μm) and 1 mg/ml FOA (Sigma). The FOA-resistant colonies were picked after 3 days of incubation at room temperature. In order to simplify referencing of experimental results to the underlying TRK1 gene configuration, we have adopted a transparent nomenclature for our principal isogenic C. albicans strains as follows. CaTK2(wt) is wild-type strain CAI4, possessing two chromosomal alleles of TRK1; CaTK1 is the single-allele deletion strain derived from CaTK2(wt) that carries only one allele of TRK1; CaTK2 is a complemented strain constructed from CaTK1, in which one copy of TRK1 has been placed at the RP10 locus; and CaTK3, constructed from CaTK2(wt), has a third copy of TRK1, also inserted at the RP10 locus. DNA Manipulations—All synthetic oligonucleotides used in strain constructions are listed in Table I and were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Molecular cloning, DNA hybridizations, and electrophoresis were carried out as previously described (13Baev D. Li X. Edgerton M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CAI4 cells were transformed with linearized DNA using the LiAc procedure as we have previously described (13Baev D. Li X. Edgerton M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli by the alkaline lysis method, employing the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Purification of restriction digest mixes and PCR mixes and isolation of DNA fragments from agarose gels were done with QIAquick PCR purification and QIAquick gel extraction kits, respectively (both from Qiagen) using the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Fermentas, and the Fast-Link DNA ligation kit came from Epicenter Technologies. C. albicans genomic DNA was isolated as previously described (13Baev D.

Open table in a new tab Amplification of the Candida URA3 Locus—The CaURA3 gene to be used as a selectable marker was first isolated by complementation of ura3 mutants in S. cerevisiae and of pyrF mutants in E. coli (37Gillum A.M. Tsay E.Y.H. Kirsch D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 198: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 38Losberger C. Ernst J.F. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but our experience using the 1.37-kb DNA fragment yielded very low rates of transformation in C. albicans, irrespective of the targeted locus. It seemed likely that the low transformation frequencies might result from too short flanking untranslated regions in the commonly used transforming fragment (424 bp upstream, 129 bp downstream), so we tested transformation with a much longer fragment, 2.37 kb, in which the URA3 gene is flanked by 1.04 kb upstream and 0.52 kb downstream. This length was selected to assure inclusion of the complete URA3 promoter, along with additional potential regulatory sequences. Experiments quickly found transformation frequencies with this larger fragment to range from 30- to 600-fold higher than with the standard 1.37-kb fragment 3D. Baev, unpublished data.; therefore, we have used this long fragment of CaURA3 DNA for plasmid constructs in the CaTRK1 disruption cassette. Design of the TRK1 Disruption Cassette—The design principle for the CaTRK1 disruption cassette is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A depicts the TRK1 locus, including the ORF (shaded bar, arrowhead), three target regions (5′TR, 3′TR, and 3′R-2), of which the two 3′ regions are within the ORF; and two short flanking sequences (• and ▪) are used for control PCR. Fig. 1B depicts the plasmid bearing the disruption cassette (pDBT1U3), which consists, in order, of 5′-TR from the TRK1 locus, cloned as a SalI-BamHI fragment; 3′R-2, cloned as a BamHI-KpnI fragment; the wild-type URA3 gene; and 3′TR, cloned as a SacI-ApaI fragment. Since 3′R-2 naturally occupies a region downstream of 3′TR in the TRK1 locus (these fragments are described below), integration of the disruption cassette into the genome via homologous recombination (Fig. 1C) results in a pair of directed repeats, upstream and downstream of the selectable marker. This construct affords a simple way, via intrachromosomal recombination and upon FOA screening (39Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Gen. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 40Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), to delete the URA3 gene and 3′TR (Fig. 1D), leaving only the remnants 5′TR, 3′R-2, plus (in this case) 221 terminal bp of the TRK1 ORF. The principal advantages of this design are (a) that the resulting disrupted allele is no longer a target for the same disruption cassette, leaving only the surviving intact allele as target; (b) that no foreign sequences are left in the recipient locus or genome; and (c) that the selectable marker cannot be recycled if, by chance, the cassette integrates ectopically. Construction of the CaTRK1 Disruption Cassette—The three gene-specific fragments 5′TR, 3′TR, and 3′R-2 of the CaTRK1 disruption cassette were amplified by PCR using as a template genomic DNA from strain CAI4 and the (S)TRK5′-f/(B)TRK5′-r, (Sc2)1TRK3′-f/(A2)1TRK3′-r, and (B2)2TRK3′-f/(K2)2TRK3′-r primer pairs, respectively (see Table I). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 three-step cycles consisting of 15-s denaturation at 94 °C, 15-s annealing at 55 °C, and 30-s elongation at 72 °C. This was followed by a 1-min final elongation at 72 °C. The 5′TR is the 247-bp fragment spanning positions –287 to –41 upstream of the translational start codon of the CaTRK1; 3′TR is the 297-bp fragment spanning positions 2291–2587 within the CaTRK1 ORF; and 3′R-2 is the 304-bp fragment spanning positions 2659–2962 of the ORF and ending 218 bp above the stop codon. Thus, the deleted region is delimited between the 3′-end of 5′TR and the 5′-end 3′R-2 so that 221 bp of the ORF, plus the 3′-untranslated region remain. This region was retained, because sequence analysis in the Candida genome data base (available on the World Wide Web at www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida/) identified a potential IMP4 gene close to the 3′-region of the TRK1 locus, with the 3′-untranslated regions overlapping between the two genes. In S. cerevisiae, IMP4 is an essential gene, since Imp4p is a part of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein that is required for pre-18 S rRNA processing (41Lee S.J. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5441-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The putative C. albicans Imp4 protein shows 66% identity with the corresponding S. cerevisiae Imp4p, so it very likely is essential in C. albicans as well. Construction of Plasmids pUC18A and pDBU3—Because it was not usable for our purposes, the EcoRI site present at the 3′ end of the MCS in pUC18 was replaced by a unique ApaI site, and the plasmid was renamed pUC18A. For this exchange, pUC18 was linearized by EcoRI digestion and used as template for divergent PCR, via primers (A)PUC-f/(A)PUC-r, which carried the ApaI recognition sequence at their 5′-ends (Table I). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 three-step cycles consisting of 15-s denaturation at 94 °C, 15-s annealing at 55 °C, and 3-min elongation at 72 °C. This was followed by a 5-min final elongation at 72 °C. After purification, the resulting PCR fragment was ApaI-digested and self-ligated to yield pUC18A. The 2.37-kb DNA fragment bearing the CaURA3 gene was amplified from Candida genomic DNA (strain SC5314), via the primer pair (K)URA3-f/(Sc)URA3-r (Table I). Sequences for these primers were derived from the sequence of the URA3 locus in the C. albicans database (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 three-step cycles consisting of 15-s denaturation at 94 °C, 15-s annealing at 55 °C, and 2-min elongation at 72 °C. This was followed by a 5-min final elongation at 72 °C. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. After purification and digestion with KpnI/SacI, this fragment was ligated to KpnI/SacI-digested pUC18A, generating pDBU3, the basic vector for construction of C. albicans gene-disruption cassettes. As a part of the pUC18A sequence, two convenient restriction sites, Eco31I and Eam1105I, are available for linearizing constructs containing the C. albicans gene-disruption cassettes. Construction of pMP2-U3 and pMP2–5′trk1-U3—The rationale for construction of pMP2-U3 was to generate a vector specifically designed for displacement of the promoter of a second gene copy under study. We have used this strategy to inactivate a second allele that could not be deleted with the disruption cassette used for the first allele (34Baev D. Rivetta A. Li X.S. Vylkova S. Bashi E. Slayman C.L. Edgerton M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3251-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A KpnI-SacI URA3 fragment was cloned via KpnI- and SacI-digested pMalPr (13Baev D. Li X. Edgerton M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to yield pMP2-U3. Then the fragment bearing the first 1120 bp of TRK1, including the putative translational start codon, was PCR-amplified using primers (H)TRK1-f/(B)TRK1-r (Table I). After digestion with HindIII-BamHI, this fragment was ligated into HindIII/BamHI-digested pMP2-U3 to generate pMP2–5′trk1-U3. Construction of C. albicans Strain CaTK1—Strain CaTK2(wt) was first transformed with Eco31I-linearized pDBT1U3 in order to inactivate the first TRK1 allele (Fig. 1C). Transformation frequency was in the range of 30–50 URA3+ colonies/μg of transforming DNA. Correct allelic replacement was confirmed by PCR of four randomly selected URA+ transformants using the primer pairs TRK1ctrl-f/(Sc)URA3-r and (K)URA3-f/2TRK1ctrl-r and by Southern analysis (data not shown). One of them was grown overnight (∼14 h) in 5 ml of liquid YPD medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine. Then serial dilutions were made, and the suspensions were plated on YNB containing 50 μg/ml uridine and 1 mg/ml FOA. Four FOA-resistant colonies were picked and PCR-analyzed for loss of the marker and the major portion of the first TRK1 allele (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, the trk1/TRK1 heterozygous strain CaTK1 was obtained. Attempts to Delete the Second TRK1 Allele—The CaTK1 trk1/TRK1 strain was subjected to a second round of transformation with the TRK1 disruption cassette. Transformation frequency in this second round was lower compared with the first allele integration events and was in the range of 5–10 URA3+ colonies/μg of transforming DNA. Twenty-four URA+ transformants from three independent experiments were analyzed by PCR and by Southern analysis, and all displayed the transforming cassette in the remaining allele but also retained a wild type third allele (data not shown), a phenomenon previously observed by us and other laboratories (e.g. see Refs. 34Baev D.

Yeast. 2002; 19: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this third allele maintenance is currently unknown. Therefore, a second strategy was attempted, by means of a conditional mutation of the second allele via a regulatable pro"

In this study, we originally identified authentic TKs and their receptor from a protochordate, Ciona intestinalis. The Ciona TK (Ci-TK) precursor, like mammalian γ-preprotachykinin A (γ-PPTA), encodes two TKs, Ci-TK-I and -II, including the -FXGLM-NH2 vertebrate TK consensus. Mass spectrometry of the neural extract revealed the production of both Ci-TKs. Ci-TK-I contains several Substance P (SP)-typical amino acids, whereas a Thr is exceptionally located at position 4 from the C terminus of Ci-TK-II. The Ci-TK gene encodes both Ci-TKs in the same exon, indicating no alternative generation of Ci-TKs, unlike the PPTA gene. These results suggested that the alternative splicing of the PPTA gene was established during evolution of vertebrates. The only Ci-TK receptor, Ci-TK-R, was equivalently activated by Ci-TK-I, SP, and neurokinin A at physiological concentrations, whereas Ci-TK-II showed 100-fold less potent activity, indicating that the ligand selectivity of Ci-TK-R is distinct from those of vertebrate TK receptors. Ci-TK-I, like SP, also elicited the typical contraction on the guinea pig ileum. The Ci-TK gene was expressed in neurons of the brain ganglion, small cells in the intestine, and the zone 7 in the endostyle, which corresponds to the vertebrate thyroid gland. Furthermore, the Ci-TK-R mRNA was distributed in these three tissues plus the gonad. These results showed that Ci-TKs play major roles in sexual behavior and feeding in protochordates as brain/gut peptides and endocrine/paracrine molecules.

Peptides of the former group, containing the identical C-terminal TK consensus motif, are expressed exclusively in the salivary gland and are devoid of any activity on the cognate tissues, indicating that the TK-like peptides are not functional counterparts of vertebrate TKs (9Kurtz M.M Wang R.

TKRPs exert a TK-like contractile activity, and the expression of the TKRP gene is observed in the central nervous system (20Satake H. Kawada T. Minakata H. Nomoto K. Zool. Sci. 2003; 20: 533-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, they contain the analogous -FX1(G/A)X2R-NH2 consensus, and TKRP precursors encode multiple TKRP sequences (20Satake H.

In earlier studies, SP- and/or NKA-like immunoreactivities were detected in the central nervous system and several peripheral tissues of ascidians by immunohistochemical analyses and radioimmunoassays (24Burighel P.

However, neither molecular nor functional characteristics of authentic ascidian TKs and their receptor have ever been elucidated, and no reproducible findings have been provided by previous immunohistochemical studies (24Burighel P.

Since investigation of TKs or TKRPs in protochordates is expected to provide crucial findings concerning not only the biological roles of TKs or TKRPs in protochordates but also the evolutionary origins of the structures and functions of the TK family, we explored TK peptides and its receptor in an ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, which belongs to protochordates as a basal chordate, namely an emerging deuterostome model animal (29Moss C. Beesley P.W. Thorndyke M.C. Bollner T. Tissue Cell. 1998; 30: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Corbo J.C. Di Gregorio A. Levine M.

Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 376-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this work, we present the structure, localization, and reactivity of Ciona TK, Ci-TK, and its receptor, Ci-TK-R, suggesting biological roles of the TK family in protochordates and the features of Ci-TK and Ci-TK-R as prototypes of vertebrate TK peptides and receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Adults of C. intestinalis were cultivated and collected at the Maizuru Fisheries Research Station of Kyoto University, and maintained in sea water at 18 °C.PCR Primers—All sequences of PCR primers are summarized in Supplemental Table I.Identification of the Ci-TK and Ci-TK-R cDNAs—Total RNA (0.5 μg) from the neural complex was reverse-transcribed to the template cDNA at 55 °C for 60 min using the oligo(dT) anchor primer and the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase supplied in the 5′/3′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Roche Applied Science). The partial Ci-TK cDNA was obtained by PCR using the primers identical to nucleotides (nt) 46–66 and complementary to nt 499–518. RACE was performed using the gene-specific primers complementary to nt 268–288 (for 5′-RACE) and nucleotides identical with nt 268–288 (for 3′-RACE), respectively. Similarly, the Ci-TK-R cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using the primers identical to nt 20–40 and complementary to nt 1464–1485 followed by nested PCR with primers identical to nt 45–68 and complementary to nt 1391–1410. 5′-RACE with primers complementary to 350–371 and 379–398, and 3′-RACE with primers identical to nt 1261–1280 and nt 1310–1329 were subsequently performed. Subcloned inserts were sequenced on an ABI PRISM™ 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using a Big-Dye sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and universal primers (SP6 and T7 primers).Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Ten Ciona neural complexes were pulverized by grinding under liquid nitrogen and extracted in 20 ml of boiled water. The resultant extract was eluted using a Sep-pak plus C-18 cartridge (Waters; Tokyo, Japan), and the eluate was evaporated and lyophilized. To acquire MS/MS spectra of Ci-TKs, the crude peptide was dissolved in 50% (v/v) methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, followed by observation of the spectra for Ci-TK-I and -II with a Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray nanoelectrospray interface (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The needle voltage was optimized at 1000 V; the cone voltage was set at 50 V. Argon was used as the collision gas, and the collision gas energy was set at 28 V.Functional Analysis of Ci-TK-R Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—The open reading frame region of Ci-TK-R cDNA was amplified and inserted into the Xenopus expression vector pSPUTK (Stratagene). The cRNA was prepared from the plasmid linearized with HpaI using SP6 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX). 50 nl of the cRNA solution (0.05 μg/μl) were injected into oocytes. The oocytes were incubated for 2–4 days at 17 °C and transferred to ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6)). The oocytes were voltage-clamped at -80 mV. The dose-response data and the EC50 values of the experiment were analyzed using Origin 6.1 software (Microcal Software, Tokyo). For the bioassay, the guinea pig ileum was a gift from Dr. Toshiaki Fujii. The contractile effects of Ci-TKs and other TKs were observed as described previously (19Kanda A. Iwakoshi-Ukena E. Takuwa-Kuroda K. Minakata H. Peptides. 2003; 24: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Southern Hybridization of RT-PCR Products—The primer sets used for Ci-TK cDNA were identical with nt 20–40 in the Ci-TK cDNA and complementary to nt 582–602; the primer sets used for Ci-TK-R cDNA were identical with nt 45–68 in the Ci-TK-R cDNA and complementary to nt 752–773, and the primer sets used for Ciona β-actin cDNA were identical with nt 254–274 in the Ciona β-actin cDNA and complementary to nt 845–864. PCR was performed for 25 cycles for amplification of the Ci-TK cDNA and for 35 cycles for the Ci-TK-R cDNA consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel followed by transfer to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cDNA probes, hybridization, and detection were performed in accordance with the DIG system protocol (Roche Applied Science).In Situ Hybridization—The Ci-TK cDNA fragment (nt 47–558) was inserted into the PST 18 vector (Roche Applied Science), and the linearized plasmid was supplied to the synthesis of DIG-labeled Ci-TK RNA probe using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) Whole-mount in situ hybridization of the juvenile and adult neural complex and endostyle were performed as previously described (32Ogasawara M. Satoh N. Biol. Bull. 1998; 195: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Ogasawara M. Sasaki A. Metoki H. Shin-i T. Kohara Y. Satoh N. Satou Y. Dev. Genes. Evol. 2002; 212: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Ciona digestive tracts were dissected and fixed in Bouin's fluid at 4 °C overnight. Preparation of 5-μm serial sections, hybridization, washing, and detection were carried out as previously reported (34Satake H. Takuwa K. Minakata H. Matsushima O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5605-5611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No positive signals were observed when sense probes were used, confirming the specificity of hybridization.RESULTSIdentification of the Ci-TK Peptides, cDNA, and Genomic Structure—In an attempt to detect a Ciona TK cDNA, we performed BLAST searches on the draft genome data base of C. intestinalis (available on the World Wide Web at ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/indexr1.html) (35Dehal P.

Science. 2002; 298: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Application of only γ-PPTA to the data base searches resulted in the detection of several EST clones (Cluster ID CLSTR36631 on the Ciona genome data base). These clones were found to encode an identical open reading frame including two putative TK sequences with the FXGLM vertebrate TK consensus motif. This was reminiscent of the structural organization of γ-PPTA (7Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 12Nawa H. Hirose T. Takashima H. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1983; 312: 32-36Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 13Nawa H. Kotani H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1984; 312: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA was cloned from the neural complex by RT-PCR followed by 5′- and 3′-RACE. As shown in Fig. 1A, the deduced amino acid sequence encoded two putative TK sequences flanked by a Gly C-terminal amidation signal at their C termini and typical endoproteolytic sites at both termini, suggesting that two TK peptides, HVRHFYGLM-NH2 and ASFTGLM-NH2, are produced from the precursor. Thus, we designated these two peptides as Ci-TK-I and Ci-TK-II, respectively. The in silico analyses of the Ci-TK genomic structure using the JGI Ciona genome project data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.jgi.doe.gov/programs/ciona.html) verified that the Ci-TK gene consists of six exons. Notably, both Ci-TK-I and -II sequences were encoded in the third exon (Fig. 1B), contrary to SP and NKA, which are encoded in the fifth and seventh exon of the vertebrate PPTA gene, respectively (7Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 12Nawa H. Hirose T. Takashima H. Inayama S. Nakanishi S.

Nature. 1984; 312: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).To investigate the presence of Ci-TK peptides as mature forms, we performed Q-TOF MS/MS analysis of the peptide fraction of the ascidian neural complex. Fig. 2 demonstrates the fragmentation patterns, each of which was compatible with HVRHFYGLM-NH2 and ASFTGLM-NH2, respectively. In addition, no mass values for putative N-terminally extended forms of Ci-TK-I or II were observed. In combination, these data confirmed that both Ci-TK-I and II are yielded from the precursor. Consequently, we concluded that TKs are conserved in protochordates as well as vertebrates.Fig. 2Q-TOF MS/MS spectra of Ci-TK-I (upper panel) and Ci-TK-II (lower panel). b-type ions and several characteristic fragment ions are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence Comparison of Ci-TKs with Other TKs—Ci-TK-I was found to possess a Tyr and an Arg at positions 4 and 7 from the C terminus, respectively (Table I), which is in good agreement with the fact that TKs with an aromatic amino acid and a neutral or basic amino acid at each of these positions show the binding selectivity to NK1, the SP-selective TK receptor (1Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 7Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ci-TK-I lacks Pro, which is seen at position 8 and/or 10 from the C terminus of SP and several submammalian SP-like TKs (1Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 7Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal region of Ci-TK-I (HVRH) displayed no significant similarity to any other TKs. Ci-TK-II shared a Ser with NKA and several amphibian and fish TKs (36Kozawa H. Hino J. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Wang Y. Badgery-Parker T. Lovas S. Chartrel N. Vaudry H. Burcher E. Conlon J.M. Biochem.

Peter R.E. Peptides. 1997; 18: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) at position 6 from the C terminus as shown in Table I. However, the most outstanding feature of Ci-TK-II is that this ascidian TK is composed of only 7 amino acids, whereas other known TKs include 9–11 amino acids (1Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 7Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Thr at position 4 from the C terminus of Ci-TK-II is regarded as a unique amino acid residue, given that SP and its related TKs contain an aromatic amino acid, whereas an aliphatic amino acid is located at this position in NKA, NKB, and their counterparts (1Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 7Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol.

The full-length sequence of the Ciona putative GPCR was determined by combination of RT-PCR, 3′-RACE, and 5′-RACE. The deduced amino acid sequence was shown to harbor the seven hydrophobic transmembrane regions and several sites that are conserved in TK receptors (Fig. 3). A sequence comparison verified that the transmembrane domain of the putative Ciona GPCR displayed high amino acid sequence similarity (30–43%) to those of mammalian TK receptors and protostome TKRP receptors (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results allowed us to presume that the putative Ciona GPCR is a candidate for a Ci-TK receptor, Ci-TK-R.Fig. 3Alignment of the amino acid sequences of TK receptors and TKRP receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1988651446,"The Gi-linked adenosine A1 receptor has been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory actions, possibly via modulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NFκB). Here we demonstrate that an adenosine A1 agonist, N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), activated IKKα/β phosphorylation through PTX-insensitive G proteins in human lymphoblastoma Reh cells. To delineate the mechanism of action, different PTX-insensitive G proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Only Gα16 supported the CHA-induced IKK phosphorylation and NFκB-driven luciferase activity in time-dependent, dose-dependent, and PTX-insensitive manners. Gβγ subunits also modulated IKK/NFκB, as indicated by the stimulatory actions of Gβ1γ2 and the abrogation of CHA-induced response by transducin. The participation of phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II in CHA-induced IKK/NFκB activation were demonstrated by employing specific inhibitors and dominant-negative mutants. Inhibition of c-Src and numerous intermediates along the extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase cascade including Ras, Raf-1 kinase, and MEK1/2 abolished the CHA-induced IKK/NFκB activation. Although c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK were also activated by CHA, they were not required for the IKK/NFκB regulation. Similar results were obtained using Reh cells. These data suggest that the G16-mediated activation of IKK/NFκB by CHA required a complex signaling network composed of multiple intermediates.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 6: 225-260Crossref Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the NFκB heterodimer is anchored and retained in the cytosol by inhibitor-κBα (IκBα). The NFκB transcription factor can be stimulated by various environmental factors including ultraviolet rays, as well as cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α. These extracellular signals activate a key regulatory step in the pathway, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, comprising the catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a linker subunit (IKKγ/NEMO). This kinase complex, in turn, phosphorylates IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 and signals for its ubiquitin-related degradation (2Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The released NFκB is then translocated into the nucleus and promotes NFκB-dependent transcription (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar).As one of the largest superfamilies of cell surface detectors, the heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to regulate numerous cellular processes, ranging from photon detection to cell differentiation. The GPCRs transduce signals through the coupling of one or more heterotrimeric G proteins to generate diverse cellular responses. Increasing evidence indicates that GPCRs can actively control gene transcription and expression in different cell types (4Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Practically all GPCRs are capable of activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (5Crespo P. Gutkind J.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar), thereby regulating numerous cellular responses including apoptosis (6Berestetskaya Y.V. Faure M.P. Ichijo H.

A variety of GPCRs have now been shown to regulate inflammation and cell survival processes by controlling the activation of NFκB. They include receptors for bradykinin (8Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N.

This list of NFκB-regulating GPCRs is far from complete and is rapidly expanding.The nucleoside adenosine controls a variety of physiological responses and the adenosine receptors can be considered as novel therapeutic targets of various diseases (14Fredholm B.B. Drug News Perspect. 2003; 16: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In particular, the Gi-linked adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) has been shown to play critical roles in regulating apoptotic and inflammatory activities. The apoptotic effects induced by ethanol (15Liu J. Tian Z. Gao B. Kunos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20927-20933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and hydrogen peroxide (16Lee H.T. Emala C.W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F844-F852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are attenuated by the activation of A1R, and the severity of multiple sclerosis is reduced by the administration of A1R-specific agonist in female 129/Sv mice (17Tsutsui S. Schnermann J. Noorbakhsh F. Henry S. Yong V.W. Winston B.W. Warren K. Power C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Immune responses, for instance the adherence of neutrophil to endothelium (18Cronstein B.N. Levin R.I. Philips M. Hirschhorn R. Abramson S.B. Weissmann G. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2201-2206PubMed Google Scholar) and chemotaxis in human dendritic cells (19Schnurr M. Toy T. Shin A. Hartmann G. Rothenfusser S. Soellner J. Davis I.D. Cebon J. Maraskovsky E. Blood. 2004; 103: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), are also regulated by A1R. However, the precise mechanisms by which A1R modulates these cellular events remain elusive. Given the central role of NFκB in mediating inflammatory and immune responses, it is reasonable to predict that A1R can regulate the activity of NFκB. Signals arising from A1R can be channeled via PTX-sensitive Gi (20Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and PTX-insensitive G16 (21Lee J.W. Joshi S. Chan J.S. Wong Y.H. J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar) proteins, and both pathways can potentially lead to the activation of NFκB. The fMLP receptor can employ both Gi-(23Pan Z.K. Chen L.Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and G16-dependent (24Yang M. Sang H. Rahman A. Wu D. Malik A.B. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) mechanisms to activate NFκB, but the ability of A1R to activate NFκB has not been reported. In view of the hematopoietic-specific expression of Gα16 (25Amatruda 3rd, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it will be particularly interesting to determine its ability to link A1R activation to changes in NFκB activity. In the present study, we examined the ability of A1R to stimulate the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and the up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter in human lymphoblastoma Reh cells that endogenously express Gα16 (26Mapara M.Y. Bommert K. Bargou R.C. Leng C. Beck C. Ludwig W.D. Gierschik P. Dorken B. Blood. 1995; 85: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transiently expressing Gα16. The possible involvement of various signaling intermediates including PKC, c-Src, and MAPKs was also determined.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals except for PTX were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or CalBiochem (San Diego, CA). PTX was from List Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Cell culture reagents, including Lipofectamine Plus and Lipofectamine 2000, were from Invitrogen. The origin of cDNAs for receptors and G proteins were as described previously (22Mody S.M. Ho M.K. Joshi S.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar, 27Liu A.M. Ho M.K.

The cDNAs of wild-type IκBα and doubly mutated IκBα-AA were gifts from Dr. Alain Israel (Institut Pasteur, France) whereas Akt and its dominant-negative mutant cDNAs were obtained from Dr. Zhenguo Wu (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong). The cDNAs for wild type and dominant-negative mutants of IKKα and IKKβ were from Dr. Richard D. Ye (University of Illinois). The luciferase reporter gene was obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA), and the luciferin substrate kit was a product of Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Various antisera were products of Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Specific anti-Gα antibodies were purchased from CalBiochem (San Diego, CA), PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells (CRL-1573, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To establish stably transfected HEK 293 cells carrying pNFκB-luc, HEK 293 cells were grown to ∼40% confluence in a 100-mm dish. Cells were washed with fresh MEM medium 3 h before transfection, and 9 μg of pNFκB-luc luciferase reporter gene (Clontech) and 1 μg of pcDNA3 (as a selection marker) were introduced using the calcium phosphate method. One day after transfection, cells were subjected to selection with 500 μg/ml G418. HEK 293 cells stably expressing NFκB luciferase reporter gene (HEK 293-NFκB) were maintained in growth medium containing 250 μg/ml G418. For luciferase assay, 1 day prior to transfection, HEK 293-NFκB cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/well into white 96-well microplates designed for luminescent work (Nunc). Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding various receptors (12.5 ng) and G proteins (37.5 ng) using 0.2 μl of PLUS and Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of Opti-MEM per well. In the case where other signaling molecules were investigated, 10 ng of receptor, 30 ng of G protein, and 10 ng of the signaling molecule cDNAs were transfected per well instead. After 3 h, 25 μl of Opti-MEM containing 30% fetal bovine serum were added to the well. For immunoblotting analysis, HEK 293 cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well into 6-well microplates 1 day prior to transfection, and the cells were transfected with 200 ng of receptor and 400 ng of G protein cDNAs per well using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). To investigate other signaling molecules, an extra 200 ng of cDNA encoding the gene of interest was also transfected.Human lymphoblastoma cell line Reh (CRL-8286, American Type Culture Collection) was cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For immunoblotting analysis, Reh cells, serum-starved overnight, were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for drug treatment.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Transfectants were grown in culture medium for 30 h and then maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 10 μmN6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) for 16 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml, 4 h) and/or various kinase inhibitors (30 min) before the CHA challenge. Subsequently, the growth medium was removed and replaced by 25 μl of lysis buffer provided in the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Roche Applied Science). The 96-well microplate was shaken on ice for 30 min. Luciferase activity was determined using a microplate luminometer LB96V (EG&G Berthold, Germany). Injector M connected to lysis buffer and injector P connected to the luciferin substrate were set to inject 25 μl of each component into each well. A 1.6-s delay time followed by a 2-s measuring time period was assigned to injector M whereas injector P was measured for 10 s after the luciferin was introduced into the well. Results were collected by WinGlow version 1.24 and expressed as relative luminescent units. Statistical calculation was performed using KyPlot version 2.0.Immunoblotting Analysis—30 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were serum-starved overnight in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml PTX. The cells were then challenged by 10 μm CHA for 10 min followed by cell lysis in 150 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm NaP2O7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. When kinase inhibitors were examined, the transfectants were pretreated with different kinase inhibitors for 30 min in serum-free medium. The cell lysates were shaken for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min. Clarified lysates (40 μg) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). For Reh cells, treated cells were harvested by centrifugation for 2 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was removed and replaced with 150 μl of lysis buffer. Phospho-IKKα(Ser180)/IKKβ(Ser181), IKKα, phospho-ERK(Thr202/Tyr204), ERK, phospho-JNK(Thr183/Tyr185), JNK, phospho-p38 MAPK(Thr180/Tyr182), p38 MAPK, phospho-c-Src(Tyr416), and c-Src were detected by specific primary antisera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Images detected on x-ray films were quantified by densitometric scanning using ImageJ software.Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent sets of experiments. The probability of the observed difference being a coincidence was evaluated by analysis of variance and paired Student's t test using KyPlot software. Differences at values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSActivation of A1R Induces IKKα/β Phosphorylation in Human Lymphoblastic Reh Cell through PTX-insensitive G Proteins—A1R has been shown to induce adherence in neutrophils (18Cronstein B.N. Levin R.I. Philips M. Hirschhorn R. Abramson S.B. Weissmann G. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2201-2206PubMed Google Scholar) and chemotaxis (19Schnurr M. Toy T. Shin A. Hartmann G. Rothenfusser S. Soellner J. Davis I.D. Cebon J. Maraskovsky E. Blood. 2004; 103: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. These inflammatory events are likely to be NFκB-dependent. However, no report has yet documented the functionality of A1R in regulating NFκB activity. We began our study by examining the ability of A1R to activate the NFκB signaling pathway in a human lymphoblastic leukemic Reh cell line. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β was determined using a phospho-IKKα/β-specific antiserum. As shown in Fig. 1A, the A1R-specific agonist CHA significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of IKKα/β in a time-dependent manner in Reh cells. Maximum stimulation was observed with a 15-min CHA treatment, and the response was sustained up to 60 min. The levels of IKKα/β phosphorylation increased with increasing concentrations of CHA (Fig. 1B, solid squares). Phosphorylation of IKKα/β in Reh cells became detectable at 100 nm CHA and reached a maximum of over 3-fold at 10 μm with an EC50 of ∼100 nm.A1R has previously been demonstrated to interact with both Gαi (20Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and Gα16 (21Lee J.W. Joshi S. Chan J.S. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Mody S.M. Ho M.K. Joshi S.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar). Having a hematopoietic lineage, the Reh cells are known to express Gα16 (26Mapara M.Y. Bommert K. Bargou R.C. Leng C. Beck C. Ludwig W.D. Gierschik P. Dorken B. Blood. 1995; 85: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the CHA-induced IKKα/β stimulation was Gi-dependent, Reh cells were pretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml, 16 h) to ADP-ribosylate the Gi proteins. The CHA-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β in Reh cells was resistant to PTX treatment (Fig. 1B, open squares), indicating the lack of involvement of PTX-sensitive G proteins in this pathway. Collectively, these data suggested that activation of IKKα/β by A1R occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner but did not require PTX-sensitive G proteins.Activation of IKK/NFκB by A1R Is Mediated via PTX-insensitive G16—To identify the specific PTX-insensitive G proteins that were responsible for the A1R-mediated IKKα/β phosphorylation, we employed an HEK 293-NFκB cell stably expressing the NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter gene for heterologous expression of A1R and Gα subunits. As a well established recombinant system, HEK 293 cells are known to express a number of PTX-insensitive G proteins including Gαs, Gα12/13 and Gαq/11. If any of these endogenous G proteins are capable of interacting with A1R, expression of A1R alone in HEK 293-NFκB cells will be sufficient to support CHA-induced luciferase activity. In contrast to the Reh cells, CHA was unable to induce IKKα/β phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, Ctrl) or NFκB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B, Ctrl) in HEK 293-NFκB cells expressing the A1R; CHA was, however, fully capable of inhibiting adenylyl cyclase in the transfectants (data not shown). These data implied that PTX-insensitive G proteins, which are absent in HEK 293 cells might be responsible for the CHA effects observed in Reh cells. Indeed, three such PTX-insensitive G proteins (Gαz, Gα14, and Gα16) have previously been shown to functionally interact with A1R upon co-expression with the receptor (20Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Lee J.W. Joshi S. Chan J.S. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28Ho M.K. New D.C. Wong Y.H. NeuroSignals. 2002; 11: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hence, Gαz, Gα14, and Gα16 were transiently co-expressed with A1R in HEK 293-NFκB cells. Co-expression of Gα14 or Gαz with A1R did not support CHA-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) or NFκB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). The total expression of IKKα/β was unaffected by the co-expression of Gα subunits or by the application of CHA (Fig. 2A). The ineffectiveness of Gα14 and Gαz in supporting CHA-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation and NFκB activation was not because of the lack of expression of these Gα subunits (Fig. 2C). In contrast, 10 μm CHA stimulated IKKα/β phosphorylation by up to 2-fold in HEK 293 cells co-expressing A1R with Gα16 (Fig. 2A). The CHA-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in NFκB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B) in these transfectants. Indeed, a previous study has demonstrated that the constitutively active Gα16 mutant (Gα16QL) can activate NFκB in HeLa cells (24Yang M. Sang H. Rahman A. Wu D. Malik A.B. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gα16QL was co-expressed with A1R to confirm the ability of Gα16 to regulate NFκB in HEK 293 cells. The constitutive activity of Gα16QL resulted in agonist-independent stimulation of IKKα/β phosphorylation (Fig. 2D) and NFκB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). The magnitudes of the Gα16QL-induced responses were similar to those obtained with CHA in Gα16-expressing cells (compare Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2CHA induces NFκB activation through Gα16 in a dose- and PTX-insensitive manner in HEK 293 cells. A, HEK 293 cells were transfected with A1R (200 ng) and pcDNA1 vector control (Ctrl) or Gα subunits (400 ng) including Gαz, Gα14, and the Gα16. Cells were serum-starved overnight in presence of PTX (100 ng/ml) and then incubated in the absence or presence of CHA (10 μm) for 10 min. Relative intensities of CHA-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation are expressed as fold-stimulation of the basal level (set as 1). B, for luciferase assays, HEK 293-NFκB cells were transfected with A1R (12.5 ng/well) and different G proteins (37.5 ng/well) using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent for 30 h. Transfectants were treated with PTX for 4 h and stimulated by 10 μm CHA for 16 h. Luciferase activities were analyzed and expressed as a percentage of the corresponding basal NFκB activities. In the case of Gα16QL, serum-free medium was used instead of CHA treatment for 16 h; % stimulation was in reference to the basal NFκB activity of Gα16-transfectants. *, significantly higher than the control; paired Student's t test, p < 0.05. §, significantly higher than the Gα16 basal control; paired Student's t test, p < 0.05. C, expression of different exogenous Gα subunits was detected using specific anti-Gα antibodies. Cell lysates from parental (C) and transfected (T; as in A) HEK 293 cells were immunoblotted. D, HEK 293 cells were transfected as described in A. Transfectants were serum-starved, lysed, and assayed for basal IKKα/β activity without CHA treatment. E and F, HEK 293-NFκB cells were transfected with Gα16 and A1R. Where indicated, transfectants were treated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 4 h prior to the CHA treatment. Different concentrations of CHA were used to stimulate the NFκB-dependent luciferase expression for 16 h in E and IKK phosphorylation for 10 min in F. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunodetection as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Data shown are the mean ± S.E. from three individual experiments. Representative results from at least three sets of experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of Gα16 to link A1R activation to the IKK/NFκB pathway is in good agreement with the results obtained with Reh cells (Fig. 1). Since Gα16 appeared to mediate the CHA-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation and NFκB-dependent luciferase expression, we went on to characterize this pathway in detail. Transfectants co-expressing A1R and Gα16 were serum-starved in the absence or presence of PTX prior to stimulation with increasing concentrations of CHA. The NFκB-driven luciferase activity was dose-dependently stimulated by CHA with an EC50 of around 100 nm (Fig. 2E), similar to that obtained with Reh cells. The CHA-induced response was essentially unaffected by PTX throughout the agonist dose range tested. In the absence of Gα16, CHA was completely unable to stimulate the NFκB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2E, pcDNA1), confirming that endogenous G proteins could not support A1R-mediated activation of NFκB even at an agonist concentration of 100 μm. The Gα16 dependence and PTX insensitivity of the CHA-induced NFκB activation were further confirmed by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2F). The phosphorylation level of IKKα/β increased with increasing concentrations of CHA, reaching a peak at around 10 μm. The CHA-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β was also unaffected by PTX (Fig. 2F).CHA-induced NFκB Activation Is Inhibited by DPCPX and Mediated through IKK and IκBα—To determine the specificity of the CHA-induced response, PTX-treated HEK 293-NFκB cells co-expressing A1R and Gα16 were incubated with 100 nm NFκB activation inhibitor (APQ; 6-amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenylethylamino)quinazoline) for 30 min before the CHA challenge (Fig. 3A). APQ significantly attenuated the CHA-induced NFκB-dependent luciferase activity as compared with the vehicle control. Furthermore, blockade by a selective A1R antagonist DPCPX (1 mm) confirmed the specific involvement of A1R in mediating the IKKα/β phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) and NFκB activation (Fig. 3A). Next, we asked if dominant negative mutants of IKKα and IKKβ can attenuate the CHA-induced activation of NFκB. Introduction of IKKα, IKKβ, or both into HEK 293-NFκB cells did not affect the agonist-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the dominant negative mutants of IKKα and IKKβ partially attenuated the CHA-mediated luciferase transcription by ∼25 and 45%, respectively. When both dominant negative mutants were co-expressed in the cells, the CHA-induced NFκB activation was suppressed by 70% (Fig. 3C). Similarly, overexpression of the NFκB inhibitor protein, IκBα, significantly reduced the CHA-induced NFκB-dependent luciferase activity by ∼30% as compared with the vector control (Fig. 3D). A doubly mutated IκBα protein (IκBαAA) in which the phosphorylation sites have been removed was then employed. IκBαAA is resistant to the induction of degradation by IKKα/β and thus can inhibit NFκB activation. By introducing IκBαAA into HEK 293-NFκB cells in conjunction with A1R and Gα16, CHA treatment was indeed significantly suppressed as compared with the vector control (Fig. 3D). The suppressive effect of this non-degradable IκBαAA protein was slightly but significantly stronger than the wild-type degradable IκBα protein.Fig. 3Characterization of CHA-induced NFκB activation.

https://openalex.org/W2045787241,"CD98hc (SLC3A2) constitutively and specifically associates with β1 integrins and is highly expressed on the surface of human tumor cells irrespective of the tissue of origin. We have found here that expression of CD98hc promotes both anchorage- and serum-independent growth. This oncogenic activity is dependent on β1 integrin-mediated phosphoinositol 3-hydroxykinase stimulation and the level of surface expression of CD98hc. Using chimeras of CD98hc and the type II membrane protein CD69, we show that the transmembrane domain of CD98hc is necessary and sufficient for integrin association in cells. Furthermore, CD98hc/β1 integrin association is required for focal adhesion kinase-dependent phosphoinositol 3-hydroxykinase activation and cellular transformation. Amino acids 82–87 in the putative cytoplasmic/transmembrane region appear to be critical for the oncogenic potential of CD98hc and provide a novel mechanism for tumor promotion by integrins. These results explain how high expression of CD98hc in human cancers contributes to transformation; furthermore, the transmembrane association of CD98hc and β1 integrins may provide a new target for cancer therapy.

The CD98 family is composed of widely expressed cell-surface disulfide-linked 125-kDa heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins containing a common glycosylated 80-kDa heavy chain (CD98hc, 4F2hc, SLC3A2) and a group of ∼45-kDa light chains. Early studies of peripheral blood T lymphocytes implicated CD98hc in the regulation of cellular activation (1Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D. Eisenbarth G. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Although expressed at low levels on the surface of quiescent cells, CD98hc is rapidly up-regulated early in transition from G0 to G1 phase following cellular activation and remains at elevated levels until the cell cycle is complete (2Azzarone B.

CD98hc is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells, irrespective of the tissue of origin (5Bellone G. Alloatti G. Levi R. Geuna M. Tetta C. Peruzzi L. Letarte M. Malavasi F. Eur. J.

Deletion of CD98hc in embryonic stem cells blocks their ability to form teratomas in mice, 1C. Feral and M. H.

Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, increased CD98hc expression correlates with the development, progression, and metastatic potential of tumors (8Esteban F. Ruiz-Cabello F. Concha A. Perez Ayala M. Delgado M. Garrido F. Cancer. 1990; 66: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Garber M.E. Troyanskaya O.G. Schluens K. Petersen S. Thaesler Z. Pacyna-Gengelbach M. van de Rijn M. Rosen G.D. Perou C.M.

Thus, CD98hc plays an important role in tumorigenesis; however, its mechanism of action has not been determined. The integrin family of cell-surface heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of α and β subunits function primarily as receptors for extracellular matrix ligands, which regulate many aspects of cell physiology, including morphology, adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (11Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Many cancers show abnormalities of integrin function as a result of transformation by oncogenes (12Zou J.X. Liu Y. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1824-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More importantly, the growth of several tumors depends on β1 integrin function (13Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Wang F. Larabell C.A. Briand P. Damsky C. amd Bissell M.J. J.

Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Hemler M.E. BMC Biochem. 2001; 2: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CD98hc associates with and regulates integrin function and what role this plays in transformation are unclear. The extracellular domain of CD98hc combines with at least six different light chains to form a series of disulfide-bonded heterodimers that are involved in l-amino acid transport. The role of the light chain in CD98hc interaction with or regulation of function of β1 integrins is controversial. Mutations of cysteine residues in CD98hc that disrupt covalent association with the light chain and that reduce amino acid transport also eliminate the transforming activity of CD98hc in BALB/3T3 cells (22Shishido T. Uno S. Kamohara M. Tsuneoka-Suzuki T. Hashimoto Y. Enomoto T. Masuko T. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cause loss of β1 integrin association in low density light chain membrane fractions (21Kolesnikova T.V. Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Hemler M.E. BMC Biochem. 2001; 2: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, these mutants still bind to free β1A cytoplasmic tails (Tac-β1) in vitro and reverse Tac-β1-induced dominant integrin suppression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (15Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, titration of CD98hc by β1 tails is not the mechanism of Tac-β1 dominant suppression (15Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, other evidence suggests that the cytoplasmic/transmembrane domain of CD98hc is the critical region mediating CD98hc alteration of β1 integrin surface distribution and cytoskeletal architecture in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and reversal of Tac-β1 dominant suppression in CHO cells (15Zent R.

We have shown previously that cross-linking CD98hc stimulates PI3K activity in a β1 integrin-dependent manner (18Rintoul R.C. Buttery R.C. Mackinnon A.C. Wong W.S. Mosher D. Haslett C. Sethi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2841-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which overexpression of CD98hc leads to cellular transformation, in particular assessing the relationship between transformation, PI3K activation, and β1 integrins. We found that cellular transformation by overexpression of CD98hc depends on activation of PI3K mediated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This PI3K activation depends on the interaction of β1 integrins with CD98hc and is associated with redistribution of the integrins. Finally, we found that the CD98hc transmembrane domain is necessary and sufficient for integrin association and PI3K activation and transformation by CD98hc. This protein plays an important role in the formation of certain tumors; this study defines the CD98hc interactions and resulting signaling events that lead to transformation. DNA Constructs—Human full-length CD69 was kindly provided by Dr. F Sanchez-Madrid (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain). The CD98hc chimeras were made by overlap PCR or restriction digestion and religation. C98T69E98 contains amino acids 1–81 of CD98hc (Swiss-Prot accession number P08195), amino acids 121–183 of CD69 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q07108), and amino acids 105–529 of CD98hc. C69T98E98 contains amino acids 1–40 of CD69 and amino acids 82–529 of CD98hc. C98T98E69 contains amino acids 1–104 of CD98hc and amino acids 62–199 of CD69. C98T69E69 contains amino acids 1–81 of CD98hc and amino acids 41–199 of CD69. C69T98E69 contains amino acids 1–40 of CD69, amino acids 1–40 82–104 of CD98hc, and amino acids 1–40 62–199 of CD69. C69T69E98 contains amino acids 1–61 of CD69 and amino acids 105–529 of CD98hc. CD98hc(Δ2–77) has a deletion of amino acids 2–77, which removes the entire cytoplasmic domain of CD98hc, maintaining the initiator methionine as well as the presumptive stop transfer sequence Val-Arg-Thr-Arg. CD98hc(Δ1–86) (also previously termed D5; kindly provided by Drs. D. Merlin and J. L. Madara) (16Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T. Lewis B. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39282-39289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has a deletion of amino acids 1–86, which removes the entire cytoplasmic domain and the five proximal amino acids of the predicted transmembrane domain. The above cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which confers neomycin resistance. The subcloned plasmids were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were purified using the QIAGEN maxi plasmid kit. cDNA encoding human LAT1, a CD98 light chain, was a kind gift from Dr. F. Verrey (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland). Antibodies—For Western blotting, the following antibodies were used: anti-protein kinase B and anti-phospho-Ser473 protein kinase B antibodies (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-FAK and anti-phospho-Tyr397 FAK antibodies (BIOSOURCE), anti-CD98 antibody (sc-7095, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (141720, Transduction Laboratories). For flow cytometry, protein A-purified 4F2 was used for identification of CD98hc and CD98hc chimeras containing the extracellular domain of CD98hc. Anti-human CD69 antibody (clone FN50, Dako Corp.) was used for identification of CD69 and chimeras containing the extracellular domain of CD69. For β1 integrin, rat clone 9EG7 was used (Pharmingen). For immunoprecipitation, anti-human β1 integrin antibody K20 (Dako Corp.) was used. Species-specific horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG (Dako Corp.) was used for Western blotting, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Dako Corp.) for flow cytometry, and Alexa Fluor 568 and Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for confocal microscopy. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% nonessential amino acids, 5 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cell lines GD25β1 null, GD25β1A, and GD25β1A(Y783F/Y795F) have been described previously (23Fassler R. Pfaff M. Murphy J. Noegel A.A. Johansson S. Timpl R. Albrecht R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 24Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fassler R. Mosher D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GD25β1 null cells are fibroblasts derived from β1 null embryonic stem cells. The GD25β1A and GD25β1A(Y783F/Y795F) mutant cell lines were derived from GD25 cells upon stable transfection with cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutant murine β1A integrin subunits, respectively (25Wennerberg K. Armulik A. Sakai T. Karlsson M. Fassler R. Schaefer E.M. Mosher D.F. Johansson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). GD25β1 null cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 5 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; GD25β1A and GD25β1A(Y783F/Y795F) cells were grown in the same medium containing 10 μg/ml puromycin for selection. Transient transfection of cell lines with chimeric constructs was undertaken using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Under optimal conditions, a transfection efficiency of at least 60% was achieved in each cell line. Control cells were transfected with control vector pcDNA 3.1. The hybridoma cell line 4F2 (C13) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM containing 15% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and OPI media supplement (Sigma). Secreted antibody was purified by protein G affinity chromatography. Construction of Stable Cell Lines—Subconfluent CHO-K1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine following the manufacturer's instructions in serum-free medium for 5 h. Serum was added for the subsequent 48 h, and transfectants were selected in medium with 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Clones selected from each construct were maintained in 0.8 mg/ml G418 and expanded. Clones showing equivalent wild-type, chimeric, or truncated human CD98hc expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis were selected for this study. Flow Cytometry—Aliquots of 5 × 105 cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 μg of 4F2 (for CD98hc and chimeras containing the extracellular portion of CD98hc) or 1 μg of anti-CD69 antibody (for CD69 and chimeras containing the extracellular portion of CD69). Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS. Samples were then incubated with species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:50) for 30 min at 4 °C and again washed twice with PBS. Samples were finally resuspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur™ (BD Biosciences). Control IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies for 4F2 and CD69, respectively, were also used. Clonogenic Assay—Cells (2 × 104/ml) were suspended in 0.3% (w/v) agarose in DMEM containing 1% FCS unless indicated otherwise. The cells were layered over a solid base of 0.5% (w/v) agarose in DMEM in 6-well culture dishes. Cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After 6 days, colonies greater than four cells were counted under a light microscope. Cloning efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the initial number of seeded cells that formed colonies. PI3K Activity Assay—PI3K activity was measured as described previously (26Moore S.M. Rintoul R.C. Walker T.R. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Sethi T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5239-5247PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). PI3K was immunoprecipitated from protein-equilibrated cell lysates using anti-PI3K p85α mAb (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and assayed for activity using [γ-32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine as substrate. 3-Phosphorylated lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography, identified by autoradiography, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Radioligand Displacement Assay for Mass Measurement of Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Trisphosphate (PIP3)—PIP3 levels were measured as described previously (27Van der Kaay J. Cullen P.J. Downes C.P. Bird I.M. Phospholipid Signaling Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 109-125Google Scholar). In brief, CHO-K1 cells (5 × 106) were subjected to a standard Folch extraction, and lipid extracts containing PIP3 were then subjected to alkaline hydrolysis, resulting in the release of the polar head group inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). The mass of IP4 was measured by [3H]IP4 (Amersham Biosciences) displacement from a recombinant IP4-glutathione S-transferase-binding protein using a calibration curve obtained with unlabeled IP4 standards. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Confluent cultures from 100-mm plates were quiesced overnight in 0.1% FCS and washed with PBS. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples (20 μg of protein) were retained and solubilized in NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) for analysis of whole cell lysate by Western blotting. The remaining lysate was incubated overnight with 2 μg of immunoprecipitating antibody at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured using 15 μl of protein G-agarose and washed three times with lysis buffer. Following elution with NuPAGE buffer, associated proteins were resolved on 4–12% gradient gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; blocked using 3% (w/v) albumin in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature; and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used for secondary labeling. Immunoreactive bands were identified by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amino Acid Transport Assay—Cells (5 × 106) were washed twice and resuspended in amino acid-free and Na+-free uptake solution containing 100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). After equilibration at 37 °C for 30 min, 2 μCi of l-[4,5-3H]leucine (82 Ci/mmol) containing 2 mm unlabeled l-leucine was added to each tube, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then placed on ice; pelleted; and washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer containing 80 μm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The washed cells were then digested with 200 μl of 0.2% SDS in 0.2 m NaOH for 1 h. Protein-equilibrated aliquots of 100 μl were added to scintillation fluid containing 100 μl of 0.2 m HCl, and activity was counted in a scintillation counter. Confocal Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated onto glass coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked using 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS. Cells were then incubated sequentially with (i) 4F2 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated FN50, 9EG7, anti-phospho-FAK antibody, or IgG1 and IgG2A negative control antibodies and (ii) secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies. To assess the co-localization of CD98hc and β1 integrin, incubation with 9EG7 was carried out overnight at 4 °C prior to fixation. In these experiments, incubation with 4F2 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated FN50 was performed last of all, after secondary labeling of the β1 integrin. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope system, and image analysis was performed using Leica TCS NT software. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.E. Significance of the differences between means was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-tailed Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Unless stated otherwise, studies were performed on three to six independent occasions. CD98hc-induced Anchorage- and Serum-independent Growth Is Dependent on the Level of CD98hc Expression and PI3K Activation—To investigate the role that CD98hc plays in cancer, we examined the effect of overexpressing human CD98hc in CHO cells on anchorage-independent growth in soft agarose, a cardinal feature of malignant transformation that closely correlates with xenograft growth in nude mice, human tumor invasiveness, and clinical aggressiveness (28Bouck N. Di Mayorca G. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 1820-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Two clones stably expressing different cell-surface levels of CD98hc were selected. CHO cells stably expressing CD69 were used as controls. Like CD98hc, CD69 is a member of the type II transmembrane protein family. To exclude the possibility of clonal variation, three different stable clones were selected, and similar results were obtained. In addition, comparable results were obtained using a transient transfection system with transfection efficiencies >60%. Furthermore, chimeric expression did not affect β1 integrin expression as judged by flow cytometry (data not shown). The colony-forming efficiency of CHO cells stably expressing CD98hc was significantly higher than that of vector- or CD69-transfected cells. In addition, the efficiency of colony formation was greatest in the clone with the highest level of CD98hc cell-surface expression (CD98hc+) (Fig. 1A). Another feature of the transformed phenotype is the ability of cells to grow under serum-free conditions. Fig. 1B shows that overexpressing CD98hc supported anchorage-independent growth even under serum-free conditions. High saturation density is also regarded as an indicator of malignant transformation. In cell culture, the CD98hc clone exhibited higher saturation density compared with CD69-transfected cells after 10 days in culture, whereas the rate of growth was unaffected (Fig. 1C). PI3K plays a key role in integrin activation and cellular activation and transformation (30Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of overexpressing CD98hc on PI3K activity in CHO cells. Expression of CD98hc significantly increased PI3K activity compared with expression of CD69 by 2–2.5-fold and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Fig. 2A). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (31Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) caused a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of the colony-forming ability of CHO cells stably overexpressing CD98hc (IC50 = 2.1 μm) (Fig. 2B). Thus, increased expression of wild-type CD98hc acts like an oncogene, stimulating serum- and anchorage-independent clonal growth. These effects are dependent on the level of CD98hc cell-surface expression and are blocked by inhibiting PI3K activation. The Transmembrane Domain (Amino Acids 82–104) of CD98hc Is Necessary and Sufficient for PI3K Activation, Elevation of Intracellular PIP3, and Colony Formation—CD98hc/CD69 chimeras (in which the extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of CD98hc were exchanged with those of the type II membrane protein CD69 as shown in Fig. 3) were transfected into CHO cells to investigate the structure/function relationship of CD98hc to PI3K activation and transformation. Stable CHO cell lines were generated expressing each chimera at comparable levels as judged by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). The membrane topography of CD98hc and each of the chimeras has been established previously (32Fenczik C.A. Zent R. Dellos M. Calderwood D.A. Satriano J. Kelly C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8746-8752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); the C terminus is extracellular, and the N terminus is cytoplasmic. Chimeric expression did not affect β1 integrin expression as judged by flow cytometry (data not shown).Fig. 4Expression of CD98hc/CD69 chimeras in CHO-K1 cells. CD98hc/CD69 chimeras were stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells. The results from FACS analysis of expression in the stable clones using either anti-CD98 antibody 4F2 or anti-CD69 antibody are shown (A). The results from Western blot analysis of expression of CD98hc/CD69 chimeras in stable clones are also shown (B). Cell lysates were probed with anti-CD98 antibody 4F2 or anti-CD69 antibody as indicated. Analysis of expression of chimeras containing the CD69 extracellular domain was performed under nonreducing conditions, as the anti-CD69 antibody recognizes only native antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of expressing CD98hc/CD69 chimeras on PI3K activity in CHO cells was examined both by in vitro kinase assay and by generation of the product PIP3 using a radioisotope dilution assay (27Van der Kaay J. Cullen P.J. Downes C.P. Bird I.M. Phospholipid Signaling Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 109-125Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain of CD98hc was necessary and sufficient to activate PI3K and to elevate intracellular PIP3 levels (Fig. 3, A and B). In particular, the C69T98E69 chimera (extracellular and intracellular CD69 and transmembrane CD98hc) and the truncation mutant CD98hc(Δ2–77) (in which the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 2–77) is deleted) were both able to stimulate PI3K activation and elevation of intracellular PIP3 levels. In contrast, the chimera C98T69E98 (in which the transmembrane domain of CD98hc is substituted with the transmembrane domain of CD69) did not stimulate PI3K activity or elevate PIP3 levels. The effect of stable chimeric expression on colony formation in semisolid agarose and 1% FCS is shown in Fig. 3C. All CHO cells stably expressing the transmembrane domain of CD98hc showed cloning efficiencies comparable with to those of CHO cells overexpressing wild-type CD98hc. In contrast, chimeras containing the transmembrane domain of CD69 had cloning efficiencies"

We and others have previously reported that Akt is phosphorylated in response to FcγR clustering. However, the functional consequence of Akt activation by FcγR is not known. Using Raw 264.7 macrophage cells transfected to overexpress either constitutively active myristoylated (Myr)-Akt or a dominant-negative CAAX-Akt and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from wild-type and transgenic mice expressing macrophage-specific Myr-Akt, we analyzed the function of Akt in phagocytosis. We report that overexpression of Myr-Akt resulted in significant increase in phagocytic efficiency, whereas CAAX-Akt down-regulated phagocytosis in Raw 264.7 cells. Likewise BMMs expressing Myr-Akt displayed enhanced phagocytic ability. Analyzing the downstream effectors of Akt, we demonstrate that p70S6 kinase is constitutively phosphorylated in Myr-Akt-expressing BMMs. p70S6 kinase is reported to influence actin cytoskeleton and cell migration, suggesting that Akt may influence phagocytosis through the activation of p70S6 kinase. Consistent with this, overexpression of either wild-type or constitutively active but not a kinase-inactive p70S6 kinase in Raw 264.7 cells significantly enhanced phagocytosis. Likewise suppression of p70S6 kinase with rapamycin down-regulated phagocytic efficiency conferred by the expression of constitutively active Akt. These findings demonstrate a novel role for Akt in phagocytosis through the activation of p70S6 kinase.

Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17 (593–623): 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Murine macrophages express two classes of activating FcγRs, FcγRI and FcγRIIIa, which are associated with the low molecular weight γ-subunit bearing a tyrosine-based activation motif (2Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Upon encountering an immune complex FcγRs on macrophages are clustered and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) are phosphorylated by the membrane-associated Src kinases (3Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Strzelecka-Kiliszek A. Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6787-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated ITAMs recruit several signaling enzymes and adapter-enzyme complexes, activating a cascade of signaling events that culminates in phagocytosis and generation of inflammatory mediators. In addition these macrophages also express the inhibitory FcγRII(b) that contains a tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (IT1M), which when phosphorylated recruits inositol phosphatases to down-regulate the phagocytic response (5Nakamura K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24513-24520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The generation of PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate is necessary for the recruitment and activation of pleckstrin homology domain-containing enzymes such as Vav, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac that promotes cytoskeletal changes necessary for phagocytosis. Inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase function, either directly or by blocking upstream molecules such as Gab2 that is necessary for membrane recruitment of PtdIns 3-kinase (13Gu H. Botelho R.J. Yu M. Grinstein S. Neel B.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), has been shown to abrogate phagocytosis.Protein kinase B/Akt is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing, serine/threonine kinase that is also activated by PtdIns 3-kinase products and is often used as an indicator of PtdIns 3-kinase activation. Kinase activity of Akt is turned on following membrane translocation of Akt, mediated by the binding of its pleckstrin homology domain with PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphorylation of Akt on threonine and serine residues. It is generally accepted that threonine phosphorylation of Akt is the function of PDK-1 (14Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which serine 473 of Akt is phosphorylated is somewhat controversial. Thus, some studies suggest that Akt undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser-473, while others suggest a distinct kinase(s) (PDK-2) (16Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Nevertheless forced expression of Akt using membrane-targeting signals results in constitutive activation of Akt. Two such membrane-targeted Akt constructs have been reported: one a viral gag fusion designated gag-protein kinase B and another containing the Src myristoylation signal designated myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt) (21Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 22Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Both these membrane-targeted versions display ligand-independent serine and threonine phosphorylation and enzyme activity. It is thought that the upstream kinases that are required for phosphorylation and activation of Akt may have some basal activity that is sufficient to activate the membrane-targeted forms of Akt (14Alessi D.R.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Activated Akt has been shown to influence a variety of cellular functions including cell survival, cell cycle regulation, NFκB-dependent gene transcription, and actin remodeling and cell migration through the activation of ribosomal p70S6 kinase (24Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 25Brazil D.P. Park J.

Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar).We and others have previously demonstrated that Akt is phosphorylated in response to FcγR clustering in myeloid cells (7Tridandapani S.

Grinstein S. Neel B.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether there is a functional consequence to Akt activation by FcγR clustering. In this study we have examined the details of Akt activation during IC-mediated activation of macrophages including the kinetics of Akt activation and the functional relevance of this activation. We report that serine and threonine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of Akt are induced after FcγRs are clustered either by heat-aggregated IgG or by IgG-coated SRBCs. Using transiently transfected Raw 264.7 cells and transgenic Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) expressing Myr-Akt we report that the presence of constitutively active Akt promoted FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. In contrast, expression of a dominant-negative construct (CAAX-Akt) down-regulated phagocytosis. Furthermore Myr-Akt-expressing BMMs had constitutively elevated phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase suggesting that p70S6 kinase may be the downstream target of Akt in enhancing phagocytosis. Consistent with this, overexpression of active p70S6 kinase, but not a kinase-inactive p70S6 kinase, in Raw 264.7 cells led to significantly enhanced phagocytosis. Furthermore inhibition of p70S6 kinase activation by rapamycin down-regulated phagocytosis even in the presence of constitutively active Akt, indicating that p70S6 kinase is downstream of Akt. These findings are the first to demonstrate a role for Akt and p70S6 kinase in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, Antibodies, and ReagentsRaw 264.7 murine macrophage cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 3.5% fetal bovine serum. Actin and Akt antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All phosphospecific antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-mouse CD16/32 (FcγRIII/II) was purchased from BD Pharmingen. p70S6 kinase plasmids were a generous gift from Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Plasmids encoding Myr-Akt and CAAX-Akt were kindly provided by Dr. D. Stokoe (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Dr. Burgering (Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for murine FcγRII were kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Cambier (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO).Generation of Myr-Akt Transgenic MiceTransgenic mice with macrophage-specific expression were generated by methods described previously (27Sasmono R.T. Oceandy D. Pollard J.W. Tong W. Pavli P. Wainwright B.J. Ostrowski M.C. Himes S.R. Hume D.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The Myr-Akt-HA plasmid used for this purpose was a kind gift from Dr. P. Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The fms-Myr-Akt plasmid was constructed such that the GFP cassette between ApaI and NotI site of Δ6.7fmsGFP plasmid described previously (24Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar) was replaced by Myr-Akt-HA. The fms-Myr-Akt was linearized with SalI and PvuI, and transgenic mice were generated in the transgenic facility in Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blots with Akt1 cDNA as a probe, and Western blots were probed with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody. Subsequent transgenic offspring were identified by PCR with three primers (forward primer for the transgene Myr-Akt, CCAAAGCATGGTCCCAGTGTTGGG; common reverse primer, GAAGTAGCGTGGCCGCCAGG; and forward primer for endogenous Akt, AGCGGTGGCACCTCCTGGG).Culture of Murine Bone Marrow MacrophagesBMMs were derived as described previously (28Ptak W. Paliwal V. Bryniarski K. Ptak M. Askenase P.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 47: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly bone marrow cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 20 ng/ml colony-stimulating factor-1 for 7 days. BMMs were activated by clustering FcγRs with heat-aggregated IgG for varying time points.Preparation of Heat-aggregated IgGHeat aggregated IgG was prepared according to methods described previously (28Ptak W. Paliwal V. Bryniarski K. Ptak M. Askenase P.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 47: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief Chromopure mouse IgG at a concentration of 750 μg/ml was heated at 62 °C for 30 min and then cooled on ice immediately and used directly to stimulate the cells.Cell Stimulation, Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western BlottingRaw 264.7 cells and BMMs were activated by clustering FcγRs with heat-aggregated IgG. Resting and activated cells were lysed in TN1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), and postnuclear lysates were incubated overnight with the antibody of interest and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). Immune complexes bound to beads were washed in TN1 buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8. 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with the antibody of interest, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence.In other experiments Raw 264.7 cells were stimulated with IgG-coated SRBCs. Here the cells were mixed with IgG-coated SRBCs, centrifuged briefly to increase contact between the Raw 264.7 cells and the SRBCs, and placed at 37 °C. Stimulation was terminated at varying time points by lysing in TN1 buffer. Cell lysates were then either subjected to immunoprecipitation with Akt antibodies for Akt kinase assays as described below or boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.Western Blot Data QuantitationThe enhanced chemiluminescence signal was quantitated using a scanner and a densitometry program (Scion Image). To quantitate the phosphospecific signal in the activated samples, we first subtracted background, normalized the signal to the amount of actin or total target protein in the lysate, and plotted the values as -fold increase over unstimulated samples as described previously (28Ptak W. Paliwal V. Bryniarski K. Ptak M. Askenase P.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 47: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Akt in Vitro Kinase AssayCells were incubated for 10 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). By centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min the lysates were cleared of nuclei. The amount of protein in the lysates was estimated. Equal amounts of the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with Akt antibody. Immunoprecipitations with control antibodies were also done. The immune complexes bound to beads were washed two times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2) and subsequently incubated with 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein as a substrate. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with phospho-GSK-3 antibody, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence.TransfectionTo study the influence of Akt and p70S6 kinase on phagocytosis, Raw 264.7 cells were transfected using the Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief 3 × 106 cells in 100 μl of Solution V (“Kit V,” Amaxa Biosystems) at room temperature were mixed with 5 μg of the Akt constructs or the p70S6 kinase constructs along with 1 μg of EGFP-encoding plasmids. The cells were transfected using the program U-14. After transfection the samples were transferred to 12-well plates containing prewarmed medium. Transfectants were cultured for 24 h and then used in phagocytosis assays.Flow Cytometry Analysis of FcγR ExpressionAnalysis of FcγRII/III Expression—BMMs were tested for expression of FcγR by incubating with anti-murine FcγRII/III monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mouse F(ab′)2 anti-rat Ig secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C.Analysis of FcγRI Expression—BMMs were incubated with 100 μg/ml pooled human IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was washed off. Cells were incubated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-human IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. All cells were subsequently washed, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry on an Elite EPICS fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Data from 10,000 cells/condition were recorded to yield the percentage of cells expressing receptors.Preparation of IgG-coated Sheep RBCsSheep RBCs (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and labeled with PKH26 Red. Labeled cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a subagglutinating dose of rabbit anti-sheep RBC IgG (Diamedix, Miami, FL) at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound IgG was removed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline.Phagocytosis AssaysThe IgG-coated SRBCs described above were added to BMMs or transfected Raw 264.7 cells. The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation to increase contact between SRBCs and phagocytes. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to study phagocytosis. Cells were then subjected to brief hypotonic lysis with water to get rid of externally bound RBCs prior to fixation in paraformaldehyde to be viewed under a fluorescence microscope. That the phagocytosis was via Fc receptors was confirmed by the lack of ingested particles observed in samples incubated with fluoresceinated RBCs that were not opsonized with IgG. Phagocytosis was measured by counting the total number of RBCs ingested by 100 transfectants (GFP-positive) or BMMs. In all experiments, the percentage of cells actually phagocytosing was between 35 and 45%.All experiments were repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test, setting a p value of ≥0.05 as significant.RESULTSFcγR Clustering Induces Akt Activation in Murine Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—We have previously reported that FcγRIIa clustering in human monocytic cells and FcγRIII/II clustering in murine macrophages induces serine phosphorylation of Akt (7Tridandapani S.

To test whether clustering of FcγR by ICs would likewise induce serine phosphorylation of Akt as well as to determine whether Akt kinase activity is induced, murine BMMs were stimulated for varying time points with heat-aggregated IgG, and the following analyses were performed. First serine phosphorylation of Akt was assessed by Western blotting protein-matched whole cell lysates (WCLs), from resting and activated BMMs, with phospho-Ser Akt antibody (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Results indicated that serine phosphorylation of Akt occurs maximally at 5 min post-IC stimulation and subsides by 30 min. The same membrane was reprobed with Akt antibody to ensure equal loading in all lanes (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Phosphorylation levels were quantitated as described in under “Materials and Methods.” The graph represents the mean and S.D. of values obtained from three independent experiments (Fig. 1A, lower panel). In parallel experiments, threonine phosphorylation of Akt was assessed using phospho-Thr-Akt antibody (Fig. 1B). Finally, to examine whether Akt enzyme activity is turned on by IC stimulation, Akt immunoprecipitates were tested for their ability to phosphorylate GSK-3 in an in vitro kinase assay. The results shown in Fig. 1C demonstrate that kinase activity of Akt is induced in cells stimulated with ICs but not in unstimulated cells (lane marked R). These data demonstrate that FcγR clustering in murine BMMs results in serine/threonine phosphorylation and induction of Akt kinase activity.Transient Transfection of Raw 264.7 Murine Macrophage Cells Using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector—Our findings that Akt is activated during FcγR clustering suggest that Akt may play a functional role in immune complex-induced activation of macrophages. To test the functional consequence of Akt activation on FcγR-mediated phagocytosis a novel transfection method was standardized to achieve efficient transfection in Raw 264.7 cells. Here Raw 264.7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of a plasmid encoding EGFP in Solution V using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector program U-14. Transfectants were harvested 24 h later and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results indicated that 63% of the cells were GFP-positive. Shown in Fig. 2A is a fluorescence image of the transfected cells. This strategy represents an important breakthrough in our capacity to introduce plasmid DNA into myeloid cell lines.Fig. 2Akt promotes FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. A, Raw 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmid encoding EGFP. Transfectants were analyzed for the expression of EGFP by fluorescence microscopy. B, Raw 264.7 cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure (1 μg of EGFP along with 5 μg of either vector alone, Myr-Akt, or CAAX-Akt). The transfectants were analyzed for their ability to phagocytose IgG-coated SRBCs by counting the total number of SRBCs ingested by 100 GFP-positive cells. Values obtained from three independent experiments are presented as mean and S.D. C, protein-matched WCLs from the transfectants were analyzed by Western blotting with phosphothreonine Akt antibody (upper panel) and with phosphoserine Akt antibody (second panel). Akt immunoprecipitates were assessed for their ability to phosphorylate GSK-3 in an in vitro kinase assay (third panel), and expression of total Akt was assessed by Western blotting with Akt antibody (lower panel). These results are representative of three independent experiments.

Recent studies have indicated that Akt promotes cytoskeletal changes and cell migration through the activation of p70S6K (30Qian Y. Corum L. Meng Q. Blenis J. Zheng J.Z. Shi X. Flynn D.C. Jiang B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C153-C163Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Since actin cytoskeletal changes are critical for phagocytosis, we asked whether Akt likewise influenced FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. In these experiments Raw 264.7 cells were transiently co-transfected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding Myr-Akt, CAAX-Akt, or vector alone along with 1 μg of a plasmid encoding EGFP. Myr-Akt is constitutively anchored in the plasma membrane and is active, whereas CAAX-Akt, which is also anchored in the membrane due to the membrane-targeting signal of Ki-Ras, the CAAX motif, functions as a dominant-negative (31van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). GFP-positive cells were assessed for their ability to phagocytose IgG-coated, PKH26 Red-labeled SRBCs. A total of 100 GFP-positive cells were analyzed in each experiment. Results from three independent experiments indicated that overexpression of Myr-Akt significantly enhanced phagocytic efficiency, while the overexpression of CAAX-Akt dampened the same (Fig. 2B).The above transfectants were also tested in each experiment for the expression of the Akt constructs used. Western blotting of protein-matched WCLs from the transfectants indicated that indeed Myr-Akt was constitutively phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues and was kinase-active, whereas CAAX-Akt was not (Fig. 2C). Western blotting with total Akt antibody indicated that both Myr-Akt and CAAX-Akt were expressed at equivalent levels. Taken together these data suggest that Akt is an upstream regulator of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. To examine whether the increase in FcγR function in Myr-Akt-expressing Raw 264.7 cells could be due to a change in FcγR expression flow cytometry and Western blot analyses were performed. Results indicated that overexpression of either Myr-Akt or CAAX-Akt had no influence on the expression levels of FcγR (data not shown).Transgenic BMMs Expressing Constitutively Active Akt Display Enhanced FcγR-mediated Phagocytosis—The above experiments were performed in a transiently transfected macrophage cell line. Thus, to examine the effects of Akt more thoroughly in primary cells, we next used BMMs isolated from wild-type and transgenic mice with macrophage-specific expression of Myr-Akt. The expression of the Myr-Akt transgene was confirmed by Western blotting cell lysates with Ser(P) Akt antibody. The results shown in Fig. 3A demonstrate that IC stimulation of BMMs results in serine phosphorylation of endogenous Akt in both wild-type and Myr-Akt-expressing BMMs. In contrast, Myr-Akt was constitutively serine phosphorylated in the transgenic BMMs. These BMMs were then used in phagocytosis assays as described above. The results shown in Fig. 3B indicate that Myr-Akt-expressing BMMs display significantly enhanced phagocytic ability. Notably only 35–45% of the cells were ingesting the SRBCs in both wild-type and Myr-Akt-expressing BMMs. These results indicate that macrophages e"

To analyze the biological function of chondroitin, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of human ChSy (sqv-5) was recently cloned, and the expression of its product was depleted by RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) and deletion mutagenesis. Blocking of chondroitin synthesis resulted in defects of cytokinesis in early embryogenesis, and eventually, cell division stopped. Here, we cloned the ortholog of human ChPF in C. elegans, PAR2.4. Despite little glycosyltransferase activity of the gene product, chondroitin polymerization was demonstrated as in the case of mammals when PAR2.4 was coexpressed with cChSy in vitro. The worm phenotypes including the reversion of cytokinesis, observed after the depletion of PAR2.4 by RNAi, were very similar to the cChSy (sqv-5)-RNAi phenotypes. Thus, PAR2.4 in addition to cChSy is indispensable for the biosynthesis of chondroitin in C. elegans, and the two cooperate to synthesize chondroitin in vivo. The expression of the PAR2.4 protein was observed in seam cells, which can act as neural stem cells in early embryonic lineages. The expression was also detected in vulva and distal tip cells of the growing gonad arms from L3 through to the young adult stage. These findings are consistent with the notion that chondroitin is involved in the organogenesis of the vulva and maturation of the gonad and also indicative of an involvement in distal tip cell migration and neural development.

Some CS-PGs modulate cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and morphogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Schwartz N.B. Domowicz M.

We have revealed that chondroitin is required for normal cell division and cytokinesis at an early developmental stage in Caenorhabditis elegans (3Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H.

In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that CS chains are major inhibitory molecules affecting axon growth after spinal cord injury in the central nervous system of adult mammals (4Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D.F. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B.

Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Thus, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanism of the biosynthesis of chondroitin and CS for a better understanding of various developmental processes in lower organisms through mammals. The biosynthesis of CS is initiated by the addition of Xyl to specific serine residues in the core protein followed by the sequential addition of two Gal residues and a GlcUA residue, forming the tetrasaccharide linkage structure GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser. Then, chondroitin polymerization with alternating GalNAc and GlcUA takes place by the action of a complex consisting of chondroitin synthase (ChSy) (5Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF), a unique protein factor required for the polymerization (6Kitagawa H.

Also, the functionally redundant, multiple glycosyltransferases involved in chondroitin biosynthesis have been cloned (7Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

This redundancy makes it difficult to investigate the mechanism of chondroitin biosynthesis by gene knockout or characterization of individual glycosyltransferases. To clarify the mechanism of chondroitin biosynthesis in vivo, we have been using lower organisms such as C. elegans because they are predicted to have few glycosyltransferases and a simple mechanism for production of the chondroitin chain. C. elegans is one of the most tractable model animals because all genomic DNA sequences and all cell lineages are known. In addition, it is easy to knock down specific genes using the reverse genetic method, RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) (12Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C. elegans produces a large amount of non-sulfated chondroitin but not CS (13Yamada S. Van Die I.

Recently, we cloned a ChSy ortholog (cChSy or sqv-5) in C. elegans and depleted expression of its product using RNAi methods (3Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. Nomura K. Nature. 2003; 423: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). cChSy-RNAi-treated worms showed defects of cytokinesis in early embryogenesis, and cell division eventually stopped as a result of depletion of chondroitin (3Mizuguchi S.

Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Speculating that the fundamental mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of chondroitin in C. elegans might be similar to that in humans, we hypothesized that an ortholog of ChPF might exist in C. elegans. Screening of a data base using the amino acid sequence of human ChPF identified a candidate protein, PAR2.4. In addition, it was predicted that only two genes, cChSy and PAR2.4, are critically involved in chondroitin biosynthesis in C. elegans since PAR2.4- and cChSy (sqv-5)-RNAi-treated worms showed extremely similar phenotypes (3Mizuguchi S.

To the stirred solution of the residue in a mixture of 10.5 ml of MeOH and 3.5 ml of H2O was added 2.5 ml of 0.107 m sodium methoxide dropwise at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 50% AcOH after 17 h, and the volatiles were removed under diminished pressure.

A polymerization reaction using 100 nmol of GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz as an acceptor was conducted in incubation mixtures containing the following in a total volume of 20 μl, i.e. 0.25 mm UDP-GalNAc, 0.25 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (1.35 × 106 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μlof suspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 26 °C overnight, and the 14C-labeled products were separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide column equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions (0.4 ml each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the measurement of radioactivity was carried out by liquid scintillation counting. Characterization of the Reaction Products—Products of polymerization reactions on GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. The radioactive peak containing the co-transfection reaction product was pooled and evaporated to dryness.

The collected C. elegans pellet (50 mg) was sonicated and immediately heated at 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate proteases, and then the supernatant fluid was subjected by chondroitinase ABC digestion, and the digests were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated for 3 h with an anti-ΔDi-0S antibody (1-B-5; Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The anti-chondroitin antibody was diluted 1:5,000 with 25 mm Tris-buffered saline. The bound antibody was detected with F(ab′)2 against mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (EY Laboratories) as described (3Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K.

Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans—Glycosaminoglycans were prepared from 24 mg of dried homogenates of RNAi-treated nematodes. The unsaturated disaccharides were produced by enzymatic digestion with chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of heparitinases I and II, and then the digests were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (3Mizuguchi S.

It should be noted that the amount of heparan sulfate (HS) in C. elegans was so small (13Yamada S. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Yokota A. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that 100 μg of shark cartilage chondroitin 6-O-sulfate (Seikagaku Corp.), which contained a negligible proportion of non-sulfated disaccharides, was added as a carrier after the borohydride treatment but before the purification steps. Transgenic Constructs—The expression vector pFX_DsRedXT or pFX_ EGFPT is composed of Bluescript (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA) with an additional multiple cloning site followed by DsRed or enhanced GFP (EGFP) cDNA (Clontech) and about 1 kb of 3′-untranslated region from the unc-86 gene for poly(A) signal. 2K. Gengyo-Ando and S. Mitani, unpublished results. Each component was introduced into Bluescript by the serial addition of DNA fragments with restriction sites as follows. The multiple cloning site from pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) was added between the KpnI and NotI sites and further modified by inserting an oligonucleotide sequence 5′-CCATATGTTAACTGGGGAGTCGACGCCCCAGCTGACTAGTGG-3′ between the BamHI site and the NotI site to make two XcmI sites. The DsRed and EGFP cDNAs were amplified by PCR using pDsRed-Express-1 and pEGFP-N1 cDNAs as templates, respectively, and subcloned into the NotI and BglII sites. The 3′-untranslated region from unc-86 was prepared by digestion of the C. elegans unc-86 genomic DNA subcloned into Bluescript with BglII and SacI sites and was added between the BglII and SacI sites. The vector containing two XcmI sites in the multiple cloning site was digested with XcmI to make a thymidine overhang in 3′-terminus at both ends for the TA cloning strategy (24Borovkov A.Y. Rivikin M.I. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 812-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), as described below. The PAR 2.4 reporter gene plasmid was constructed using the vector pFX_DsRedXT. The translational fusion construct contained a 4.4-kb genomic fragment including the 1.0-kb potential promoter region. The fragment was amplified with C. elegans genomic DNA as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-ATTTTGGTTTATCGATTGAGCA-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-TTTTTCGTGGAATAACAATTTTG-3′) located just before the stop codon. PCR was carried out with Platinum TaqDNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) for 28 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 300 s followed by adenine addition with Taq polymerase at 72 °C for 15 min. The PCR fragment was inserted into pFX_ DsRedXT using the TA cloning strategy to fuse the coding sequence region of DsRed. The sqv-5 (cChSy) reporter gene plasmid was constructed using the vector pFX_EGFPT as above. The translational fusion construct contained a 6.0-kb genomic fragment including the 5.0-kb potential promoter region. The fragment was amplified with C. elegans genomic DNA as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-GCGTAGTCAATCGGCGTCTCAC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-TCGTCGTCTGCTCGCAAGAACC-3′) located in exon 3. PCR was carried out with Platinum TaqDNA polymerase High Fidelity for 28 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 420 s followed by adenine addition with Taq polymerase at 72 °C for 15 min. The PCR fragment was inserted into the pFX_EGFPT vector using the TA cloning strategy to fuse the coding sequence region of EGFP. Expression of PAR2.4::DsRed and cChSy::GFP in the Nematode C. elegans—Germ-line transformation was done as described by Mello et al. (25Mello C.C. Karmer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). The PAR 2.4::DsRed construct was microinjected into the distal gonad of an adult hermaphrodite of Caenorhabditis Genetic Center strain JR667, which expresses GFP in seam cells. The PAR2.4::DsRed and cChSy::EGFP constructs were co-injected into the distal gonad of a wild type N2 strain. Transgenic lines containing reporter constructs were isolated. Live transgenic worms were paralyzed with a 50 mm sodium azide solution and placed on an 8-well printed microscope slide glass (Matsunami Glass) and examined by four-dimensional microscopy (a DMRXA full automatic microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent optics, Leica) as described (3Mizuguchi S.

The images were processed using MetaMorph software (version 4.6, Universal Imaging). Molecular Cloning of PAR2.4—Screening of the non-redundant data base at the NCBI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD), using the deduced amino acid sequence of human ChSy, identified a few homologs in C. elegans. One of them, designated PAR2.4 (WormBase accession PAR2.4), contained a 5′-untranslated region of 133 bp, a single open reading frame of 2,412 bp coding for a protein of 804 amino acids with three potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1), and a 3′-untranslated region of 308 bp. The predicted translation initiation site conformed to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (26Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment of 16 amino acid residues in the NH2-terminal region, predicting that the protein has a type II transmembrane topology (Fig. 1). Notably, the identified protein did not have the conserved DXD motif found in most glycosyltransferases (28Wiggins S. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Data base searches suggested that the amino acid sequence displayed 28, 27, and 16% identity to human chondroitin GlcAT (8Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y-D. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, the features of the identified protein sequence suggest that the gene product is involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin in C. elegans but would not possess glycosyltransferase activity. Coexpression and Characterization of PAR 2.4—To facilitate the functional analysis of PAR2.4, a soluble form of the protein was generated by replacing the first 52 amino acids with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG-binding domain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then, the soluble protein was expressed in COS-1 cells at 30 °C as a recombinant protein fused with the protein A IgG-binding domain. The fusion protein secreted in the medium was adsorbed onto IgG-Sepharose beads for purification to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and then the protein-bound beads were used as an enzyme source. Although the bound fusion protein was assayed for glycosyltransferase activity at 26 °C using chondro-hexasaccharide (GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc)3 or chondro-heptasaccharide GalNAcβ1-4(GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc)3 as a sugar accepter and either UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcUA as a sugar donor substrate, neither GalNAcT-II nor GlcAT-II activity was detected (Table I). However, coexpression of the soluble PAR2.4 with the soluble cChSy augmented the GalNAcT-II activity of cChSy over 20-fold and clearly showed GlcAT-II activity, which had not been detected when only cChSy was expressed. Notably, these effects of coexpression were not due to differences in the expression levels of these proteins, as assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). These results are analogous to the findings recently made for human ChPF and ChSy. Thus, we asked whether the coexpression of PAR2.4 and cChSy could result in the expression of polymerization activity.

The Hairy-related transcription factor (HRT) family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins is composed of transcriptional repressors highly expressed in the cardiovascular system. However, it has remained unclear whether HRT proteins modulate gene expression driven by cardiac transcriptional activators. Here, we have shown that HRT proteins inhibit cardiac gene transcription by interfering with GATA transcription factors that are implicated in cardiac development and hypertrophy. HRT proteins inhibited GATA-dependent transcriptional activation of cardiac gene promoters such as the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter. Adenovirus-mediated expression of Hrt2 suppressed mRNA expression of ANF and other cardiac-specific genes in cultured cardiomyocytes. Among various signaling molecules implicated in cardiomyocyte growth, constitutively active Akt1/protein kinase Bα relieved Hrt2-mediated inhibition of GATA-dependent transcription. HRT proteins physically interacted with GATA proteins, and the basic domain of HRT was critical for physical association as well as transcriptional inhibition. These results suggest that HRT proteins may regulate specific sets of cardiac genes by modulating the function of GATA proteins and other cardiac transcriptional activators in a signal-dependent manner.

Transcription factors form multiprotein complexes, and combinatorial actions of transcription factors in such complexes dictate the specificity of downstream gene expression.

The recombinant adenovirus encoding Myc-Hrt2 or its viral packaging control was prepared by Cre/loxP-mediated recombination of a sub360 adenoviral cosmid in 911 cells as described previously (35Aoki K. Barker C. Danthinne X. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 224-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—In 6-well plates, HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 300 ng of plasmid for luciferase reporters, Myc- or FLAG-Gata4 plasmid, and Myc- or FLAG-Hrt2 plasmid. Luciferase activity was measured 40 h after transient transfection. All experiments were accompanied by Western blot analysis to verify relevant protein expression. Plasmids encoding Hrt2 mutations were titrated (600–1200 ng) such that protein expression of the mutations was comparable with protein levels of wild type Hrt2. 100 ng of plasmids encoding various enzymes was used for the initial screen, and subsequent titration revealed that 5 ng of myr-Akt plasmid was sufficient for the maximal effect. Cardiomyocyte Preparation and Adenoviral Infection—Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured as described previously (36Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 37Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Itoh H. Suga S. Komatsu Y. Kishimoto I. Nishino K. Yoshimasa T. Nakao K. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Eighteen hours after plating, cells were infected with adenovirus for Myc-Hrt2 and its control at a multiplicity of infection of 30/cell for 2 h and cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 36 h. Total RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and dot blot analysis was performed as described previously (38Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Expression of Myc-Hrt2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Expression of α-tubulin was used as a loading control. Co-immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Binding Assays—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs for Myc- and FLAG-tagged proteins using FuGENE 6. Whole cell lysate was incubated with polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitates were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or by staining with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For in vitro binding assays of Hrt2 deletion mutations, 35S-labeled Hrt2 fragments were synthesized using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), incubated with the lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with Myc-Gata4 plasmid, immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Myc antibody, and visualized by autoradiography. The largest 35S-labeled fragments corresponded to the predicted sizes of wild type Hrt2 and its mutants, and they were used for the quantification of the phosphorimage using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Values of output bands were divided by those of the corresponding input bands and were presented as arbitrary binding capacity units for Gata4. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using oligonucleotides representing a GATA-binding element (underlined) (5′-TCGAGGTAATTAACTGATAATGGTGC-3′) as described previously (39McFadden D.G. Charite J. Richardson J.A. Srivastava D. Firulli A.B. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 5331-5341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hrt2 Inhibits Gata4-dependent ANF Gene Expression—To test whether HRT proteins modulate cardiac gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors, we examined the effects of Hrt2 on the transcriptional activity of a series of cardiac transcriptional activators. As depicted in Fig. 1A, Hrt2 significantly repressed Gata4-mediated transactivation of the ANF promoter, which contains two essential GATA binding sites (26Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcriptional activity of various luciferase reporters controlled by MEF2C, NFAT3, or Hand2 was not significantly inhibited by co-expression of Hrt2 (data not shown). GATA proteins are known to regulate the expression of various cardiac genes in normal and hypertrophic myocytes (7Garg V. Kathiriya I.S. Barnes R. Schluterman M.K. King I.N. Butler C.A. Rothrock C.R.

Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the effects of Hrt2 expression upon endogenous cardiac gene expression. Adenovirus-mediated Hrt2 expression markedly decreased ANF mRNA expression in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1B). The relative ANF mRNA levels with control and Hrt2 adenovirus infection were 105 ± 11% and 26.5 ± 5.2% (mean ± S.D.), respectively, compared with the levels without adenovirus infection. Hrt2 also down-regulated other cardiac hypertrophy markers, βMyHC and α-skeletal actin. The βMyHC promoter contains a GATA binding site that is essential for its transcriptional activation in cardiac hypertrophy (40Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that HRT proteins may generally suppress the GATA-dependent cardiac gene program by interfering with GATA proteins. HRT1, -2, and -3 Specifically Suppress Transcription Driven by GATA Proteins—To further investigate the generality of the repressive effects of HRT on GATA proteins, we examined its effects on the transcription of other GATA-dependent cardiac regulatory elements. As shown in Fig. 2A, a similar pattern of Hrt2-mediated repression of Gata4-dependent transcription was observed for αMyHC- and Nkx2.5-luciferase reporters, both of which contain essential GATA sites (27Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lien C.L. Wu C. Mercer B. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 75-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hrt2 also displayed repressive activity against transcription driven by other cardiac-enriched GATA proteins, Gata5 and Gata6 (Fig. 2B). In addition, all of the human HRT proteins, HRT1, -2, and -3, were able to repress Gata4-dependent transactivation (Fig. 2C). Because Gata4 cooperates with SRF to activate ANF transcription (41Belaguli N.S. Sepulveda J.L. Nigam V. Charron F. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7550-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Moore M.L. Wang G.L. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1026-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we asked whether Hrt2 could repress transactivation induced by co-expression of Gata4 and SRF. Hrt2 attenuated Gata4-SRF transactivation to levels similar to the contribution by SRF alone, whereas Hrt2 did not repress SRF-dependent transcription in the absence of Gata4 (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that HRT family proteins specifically inhibit GATA-dependent gene transcription. Akt1 Relieves HRT-mediated Repression of GATA-dependent Transcription—Because GATA and HRT proteins are co-expressed both in the embryonic and adult heart, we hypothesized that functional interactions between these proteins could be modulated by developmental and disease signals. To begin to search for such regulatory pathways, we examined whether any protein kinases or phosphatases implicated in cardiac growth and hypertrophy could affect Hrt2-mediated repression of Gata4-dependent transcription. Of the various proteins tested, only a constitutively active form of Akt1/protein kinase Bα, myr-Akt (32Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), significantly relieved Hrt2-mediated repression of Gata4-dependent transactivation (Fig. 3A). Calcineurin A, ribosomal S6 kinase 2, and protein kinase A have been implicated in cardiac growth (43Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 44Aramburu J. Rao A. Klee C.B. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although they appeared to slightly increase GATA transcriptional activity, they did not relieve Hrt2-mediated repression (data not shown). As we showed previously (14Nakagawa O. McFadden D.G. Nakagawa M. Yanagisawa H. Hu T. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13655-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), Hrt2 can also attenuate transactivation of its own promoter driven by the Notch/RBP-Jκ complex. However, myr-Akt did not antagonize Hrt2 repression in this system (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the effect of Akt1 is specific to Hrt2-mediated Gata4 inhibition. Various effects of Akt1 are mediated by the inhibition of GSK3β, a downstream protein kinase (45Morisco C. Seta K. Hardt S.E. Lee Y. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28586-28597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, because dominant-negative GSK3β (33He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) did not mimic the action of Akt1 (Fig. 3C), Akt1 appeared to act independent of the GSK3β pathway, either by directly phosphorylating Hrt2 and/or Gata4 or via intermediate molecules upstream of HRT- and GATA-mediated transcriptional regulation. HRT Physically Associates with GATA and Inhibits Transcription through a GATA-binding DNA Element—To clarify the mechanism underlying the repression of GATA by Hrt2, we tested whether Hrt2 could form a protein complex with GATA proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A, Hrt2 showed physical interaction with Gata4 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Association of human HRT1 and HRT3 with Gata4 was also detected (data not shown). Furthermore, Hrt2 significantly suppressed Gata4-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter with a single GATA-binding element, (GATA)-MIS-luciferase (34Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22128-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). However, Hrt2 did not inhibit the binding of Gata4 to the GATA-binding element in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that direct interaction between HRT and GATA proteins on a GATA-binding DNA element is important for this repression. The Basic Domain of Hrt2 Is Essential for Transcriptional Repression—To determine the Hrt2 domains that are necessary for repression of GATA-dependent transcription, we tested the effects of various Hrt2 mutations (Fig. 5A) on Gata4-dependent transactivation of the ANF promoter. In contrast to most mutations, a deletion of the basic domain, Hrt2Δ(33–37), failed to repress GATA-mediated transcription (Fig. 5B). Lack of transcriptional repression by Hrt2Δ(33–37) was also observed using the reporter with a GATA-binding element (Fig. 5C). Because the basic domain of Hrt2 can also act as a nuclear localization signal, mislocalization of Hrt2Δ(33–37) to the cytoplasm might contribute to the loss of repressive activity. However, Hrt2Δ(33–37) was observed in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm in HeLa cells, and increasing amounts of Hrt2Δ(33–37) did not result in any repressive activity (data not shown). The Basic Domain of Hrt2 Is Necessary for Physical Interaction with Gata4 —We next tested the effects of Hrt2 mutations on Hrt2-Gata4 association. Because the expression levels of these Hrt2 mutations were variable in COS-1 cells, we synthesized 35S-labeled Hrt2 proteins using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and performed in vitro association assays with Gata4 expressed in COS-1 cells. Hrt2 fragments containing the bHLH and orange domains were sufficient for the interaction with Gata4 in vitro (data not shown). Although a deletion of the loop segment in the HLH domain (Hrt2Δ(47–52)) did not affect the association significantly, Hrt2Δ(33–37) showed a marked decrease in binding capacity for Gata4 (Fig. 5D). This result is consistent with the results of the luciferase assays and suggests that Hrt2 associates with Gata4 mainly through its basic domain to inhibit Gata4-dependent transcription. In this study, we demonstrated that the HRT family of bHLH transcriptional repressors forms a protein complex with the GATA family of transcriptional activators and inhibits cardiac gene transcription. HRT was identified as a novel subfamily of bHLH repressors similar to Drosophila Hairy, Enhancer of split, and mammalian HES (8Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev.

Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), no target genes of HRT proteins have been identified to be regulated via direct DNA binding. HRT can repress Notch-dependent transactivation by a mechanism independent of its binding to DNA (14Nakagawa O. McFadden D.G. Nakagawa M. Yanagisawa H. Hu T. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13655-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and HRT/CHF proteins also repress transcription by associating with transcriptional activator complexes such as HIF1/ARNT and MyoD/E12 (11Chin M.T.

We found that HRT proteins physically associate with GATA proteins and inhibit GATA-dependent transcription and that the basic domain of Hrt2 is important for both transcriptional repression and physical association. A single GATA-binding site is sufficient for HRT-mediated GATA inhibition, suggesting that HRT proteins might associate with GATA proteins on GATA-binding DNA elements. However, Hrt2 does not appear to alter GATA DNA-binding affinity, at least in electrophoretic mobility shift assays in vitro. One mechanism for HRT-mediated repression may be via recruitment of its co-repressors, including class 1 and class 3 histone deacetylases (15Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S. Wu H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 46Takata T. Ishikawa F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), to the GATA complex. The bHLH domain of HRT family proteins is important for association with these co-factors (15Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S. Wu H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 46Takata T. Ishikawa F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The deletion of the basic domain may result in inefficient association with GATA proteins as well as impairment of co-repressor recruitment. Alternatively, the interaction with HRT proteins might interfere with the association of GATA with its co-activators. Transcriptional activity of GATA is modulated via interactions with various co-factors such as histone acetyltransferase p300 and DNA-binding transcriptional activators SRF, Nkx2.5, Tbx5, MEF2C, Hand2 and NFAT3 (7Garg V.

In addition, expression of Gata4 or Gata6 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo (54Liang Q. De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol.

Hrt2 can suppress cardiac gene expression in cardiomyocytes, but it remains to be determined whether the effects of Hrt2 on endogenous gene expression occur via repression of GATA-mediated transcription. It will be intriguing to examine whether HRT proteins also modulate GATA-dependent cardiac gene expression during the course of cardiac development and hypertrophy. The present study implicates Akt1 as a potential regulator of HRT-mediated repression of GATA-dependent transactivation. Akt1 is a critical regulator of cell growth and survival in many tissues including the heart (55Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S.

The attenuation of HRT-mediated repression of GATA-dependent gene expression might serve as an additional mechanism by which Akt1-mediated signaling provokes cardiac growth and hypertrophy. Akt1 did not have strong effects on the transactivation by Gata4 in luciferase assays, and Akt1 did not influence the repressive activity of Hrt2 in a Notch-related system, suggesting that the effects of Akt1 may be specific to HRT-GATA functional interaction. Akt1 is known to regulate the sublocalization and/or transcriptional activity of various transcription factors either by direct phosphorylation or via intermediate signaling molecules (59Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 60Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y. Altomonte J. Dong H.

N. Olson, unpublished observation. it is still unknown whether Akt1 influences Hrt2-mediated Gata4 inhibition by phosphorylation of Hrt2 and/or Gata4. We await further studies to elucidate how Akt1 modulates functional interactions between HRT and GATA. In summary, we have demonstrated that HRT proteins physically associate with GATA proteins and inhibit GATA-dependent cardiac gene expression in an Akt1-sensitive manner. An understanding of such functional interactions among cardiac transcription factors and their responsiveness to cellular signals should provide further insight into the mechanisms of cardiac development and disease.

https://openalex.org/W2141934750,"Syntrophins are scaffold proteins of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), which target ion channels, receptors, and signaling proteins to specialized subcellular domains. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library with the PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of γ1-syntrophin yielded overlapping clones encoding the C terminus of TAPP1, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing adapter protein that interacts specifically with phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). In biochemical assays, the C terminus of TAPP1 bound specifically to the PDZ domains of γ1-, α1-, and β2-syntrophin and was required for syntrophin binding and for the correct subcellular localization of TAPP1. TAPP1 is recruited to the plasma membrane of cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a motogen that produces PI(3,4)P2. Cell migration in response to PDGF stimulation is characterized by a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which gives rise to plasma membrane specializations including peripheral and dorsal circular ruffles. Both TAPP1 and syntrophins were localized to PDGF-induced circular membrane ruffles in NIH-3T3 cells. Ectopic expression of TAPP1 potently blocked PDGF-induced formation of dorsal circular ruffles, but did not affect peripheral ruffling. Interestingly, coexpression of α1- or γ1-syntrophin with TAPP1 prevented the blockade of circular ruffling. In addition to syntrophins, several other proteins of the DGC were enriched in circular ruffles. Collectively, our results suggest syntrophins regulate the localization of TAPP1, which may be important for remodeling the actin cytoskeleton in response to growth factor stimulation. Syntrophins are scaffold proteins of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), which target ion channels, receptors, and signaling proteins to specialized subcellular domains. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library with the PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of γ1-syntrophin yielded overlapping clones encoding the C terminus of TAPP1, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing adapter protein that interacts specifically with phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). In biochemical assays, the C terminus of TAPP1 bound specifically to the PDZ domains of γ1-, α1-, and β2-syntrophin and was required for syntrophin binding and for the correct subcellular localization of TAPP1. TAPP1 is recruited to the plasma membrane of cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a motogen that produces PI(3,4)P2. Cell migration in response to PDGF stimulation is characterized by a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which gives rise to plasma membrane specializations including peripheral and dorsal circular ruffles. Both TAPP1 and syntrophins were localized to PDGF-induced circular membrane ruffles in NIH-3T3 cells. Ectopic expression of TAPP1 potently blocked PDGF-induced formation of dorsal circular ruffles, but did not affect peripheral ruffling. Interestingly, coexpression of α1- or γ1-syntrophin with TAPP1 prevented the blockade of circular ruffling. In addition to syntrophins, several other proteins of the DGC were enriched in circular ruffles. Collectively, our results suggest syntrophins regulate the localization of TAPP1, which may be important for remodeling the actin cytoskeleton in response to growth factor stimulation. Many cellular signaling pathways involve dynamic changes in lipid composition at discrete sites in the plasma membrane (1Janmey P.A. Lindberg U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These changes are thought to create lipid microdomains that provide a platform for the formation of signaling complexes. Scaffold proteins, which are characterized by multiple protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction domains, form multiprotein complexes that direct signaling components to specialized membrane domains. In addition to facilitating the proper intracellular localization of their partner proteins, scaffold proteins also provide spatial and temporal regulation of signaling events (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The syntrophin family of scaffold proteins consists of five isoforms (α1, β1, β2, γ1, and γ2) with the same modular domain organization. Each has two tandem pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; BAS-GRIP, PTP-BAS GLGF-repeat interaction protein; DG, dystroglycan; DGC, dystrophin glycoprotein complex; DGK-ζ, diacylglycerol kinase-ζ; Db, dystrobrevin; Dys, dystrophin; ECM, extracellular matrix; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDZ, postsynaptic density protein-95/discs-large/zona occludens-1; SU, syntrophin unique; TAPP1, tandem PH domain-containing protein 1; Utr, Utrophin; PI, phosphoinositol; SH, Src homology domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PI3K, PI 3-kinase. domains, an intervening PSD-95, discs-large, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, and a C-terminal syntrophin-unique region (SU) (3Adams M.E.

The PDZ domain of syntrophins serves as an adaptor for recruiting membrane channels, receptors, kinases, and other signaling proteins (6Albrecht D.E. Froehner S.C. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The latter half of syntrophin, which includes the PH2 and SU domains, mediates the interaction with members of the dystrophin family of cytoskeletal proteins, including dystrophin, utrophin, and dystrobrevin (6Albrecht D.E. Froehner S.C. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Dystrophin associates with a multimeric transmembrane complex (the dystrophin glycoprotein complex or DGC) that serves as a link between extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin, and cortical actin (7Montanaro F. Carbonetto S. Neuron. 2003; 37: 193-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, syntrophins provide a link between signaling proteins and the actin cytoskeleton via dystrophin. The exact function of the DGC has not been precisely determined, but it is thought to provide structural stability to the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells during cycles of contraction and relaxation (8Petrof B.J. Shrager J.B. Stedman H.H. Kelly A.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In accordance with this idea, mutations in genes encoding proteins of the DGC are the cause of various muscular dystrophies (9Durbeej M. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The DGC may have additional roles, including modulating the actin cytoskeleton through its ability to recruit signaling proteins that regulate actin cytoskeletal organization (10Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this report, we identified an interaction between syntrophins and “tandem PH domain-containing protein 1” (TAPP1). TAPP1, TAPP2, and Bam32/DAPP1 are a closely related group of PH domain-containing adapter proteins that are recruited to the plasma membrane of cells in response to phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (11Dowler S. Currie R.A. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5479-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PI3K is a key component of multiple signaling pathways, including those that regulate cell survival, growth, and motility (16Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). PI3K catalyzes the transient production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), which triggers the activation of downstream signaling pathways by recruiting PH domain-containing signaling proteins to the plasma membrane. At the membrane, these signaling proteins are activated and initiate various local responses including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. One potential fate of PI(3,4,5)P3 is dephosphorylation at the 5 position of the inositol ring by Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing phosphatases (SHIP1 and SHIP2), which produces PI(3,4)P2 (17Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests PI(3,4)P2 functions as a signaling lipid. First, it is present at low levels in unstimulated cells, and its cellular concentration markedly increases following growth factor stimulation (18Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Second, agents such as hydrogen peroxide and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that produce PI(3,4)P2 induce the rapid translocation of TAPP1, TAPP2, and Bam32/DAPP1 to the plasma membrane of stimulated cells (13Kimber W.A. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Cheung P.C. Deak M. Marsden L.J. Kieloch A. Watt S. Javier R.T. Gray A. Downes C.P. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

J. 2004; 377: 653-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, several proteins possess PH domains with dual specificity for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 and the C-terminal PH domain of TAPP1 is highly selective for PI(3,4)P2 and not PI(3,4,5)P3. These findings also suggest TAPP1 participates in PI(3,4)P2-mediated signaling in response to growth factor stimulation and PI3K activation. PI3K-driven signaling pathways downstream of PDGF stimulation induce a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which manifests as plasma membrane specializations including lamellipodia, filopodia, and membrane ruffles (21Buccione R. Orth J.D. McNiven M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In serum-starved fibroblasts, PDGF induces at least two types of membrane ruffles that can occur independently of each other and that can be distinguished on the basis of their morphology and their longevity: 1) peripheral (edge) ruffles are persistent components of an extending lamellipodium and 2) dorsal circular ruffles, which appear within minutes after stimulation, then constrict and disappear, lasting only 5–20 min. Here, we investigated the role of syntrophins and TAPP1 in the formation of dorsal circular ruffles. We show that expression of TAPP1 blocks circular ruffle formation induced by PDGF stimulation, but does not affect PDGF-induced peripheral ruffling. This effect was not evident when TAPP1 was coexpressed with syntrophins. We show that endogenous TAPP1, syntrophins and proteins of the DGC are prominent components of dorsal circular ruffles. Our results suggest syntrophins and TAPP1 regulate actin-mediated membrane ruffling downstream of growth factor activation. Materials—FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc. All other cell culture reagents were from Sigma. PDGF-bb was obtained from Sigma and was dissolved in 0.004 m HCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Aliquots were stored at -20 °C. Aliquots were thawed and diluted to 500 ng/ml in the same buffer. This 100× stock solution was stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. A polyclonal antibody to BAS-GRIP (also known as TAPP1; see below) was made by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein corresponding to the C-terminal 115 amino acids. Antibodies directed against the GST portion were removed by absorbing the antisera against GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A polyclonal antibody against TAPP1 was a gift from Dario Alessi and has been described previously (13Kimber W.A. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Cheung P.C. Deak M. Marsden L.J. Kieloch A. Watt S. Javier R.T. Gray A. Downes C.P. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against syntrophins and monoclonal antibody 13H1 against dystrobrevin have been characterized previously (22Peters M.F. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). AlexaFluor 488- and 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA was from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of human TAPP1 (DDASLPVSDV) and human DGK-ι (IGHEDLETAV) were synthesized by the University of Waterloo Peptide Synthesis Facility (Waterloo, ON). All peptides contained an additional 4 amino acid linker (SGSG) at the N terminus and an N-terminal biotin. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using the EGY48 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes β-galactosidase (β-gal) on the plasmid EGY48 and Leu2 on the plasmid pSH18-34. These reporter genes are under the control of 6 and 8, respectively, upstream LexA operators (Invitrogen). The PDZ domain bait consisted of amino acids 51–149 of human γ1-syntrophin fused in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain in vector pHybLex/Zeo (Invitrogen). A human brain cDNA library constructed in the activation domain vector pB42AD (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with the PDZ domain bait. Several small scale yeast transformations were performed, where 2.5 × 108 cells containing the bait plasmid were transferred to 50 ml of YPD media and subsequently incubated until the density reached 2 × 10 7 cells/ml, after which the liquid yeast culture was transformed with 5 μg of cDNA library and 0.5 mg of salmon sperm carrier DNA using the lithium acetate method with 50% polyethylene glycol (w/v). After transformation, the yeast were grown 1–2 h in selective ura- trp- medium to allow expression of the Leu2 reporter gene, before adding Zeocin (Invitrogen) at 200 μg/ml. Cultures were grown overnight then plated on ura- trp- leu- plates containing 25 μg/ml Zeocin, 2% galactose, and 1% raffinose. DNA was isolated from positive yeast colonies and transformed into the KC8 bacterial strain by electroporation. Positives were isolated from the bacteria and retransformed into yeast with either the bait or a negative control (pHybLex/Zeo + Lamin) and plated on selective 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates. Positive clones were sequenced at the University of Ottawa Biotechnology Research Institute. Cloning—Clone 4 (encoding amino acids 348–404 of TAPP1) was excised from pB42AD with EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 cut with the same enzymes. A construct encoding amino acids 348–399 of TAPP1 (ΔC-term) was made by amplifying clone 4 with the primer ATATCTCGAGCTAAAGGCTCGCATCGTCCAAG and a sense primer from pB42AD. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then ligated into pGEX-4T-1 cut with the same enzymes. Myc-tagged α1-syntrophin has been described previously (10Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To create a Myc-tagged γ1-syntrophin, α1-syntrophin was excised from a modified pQBI25-fC1 (Quantum Biotechnologies Inc.) containing two N-terminal Myc epitope tags (in place of sequences encoding green fluorescent protein) by digesting with ApaI and HindIII restriction enzymes. A full-length T7-tagged γ1-syntrophin construct described previously (24Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was digested with the same enzymes and ligated with the cut vector fragment. In separate studies, a cDNA clone was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human kidney library with the second PDZ domain of PTP-BAS (amino acids 1206–1496) as bait (25Maekawa K. Imagawa N. Nagamatsu M. Harada S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Of the 1 × 107 clones screened, 4 positives were isolated. Sequencing of the inserts revealed they were identical and encoded 34 amino acids fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain. One of the clones (G2Y13) was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to probe a human kidney library in λgt10. The hybridization was carried out at 60 °C in a solution composed of 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed at 50 °C in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The resultant positive clones were sequenced using a T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and 5′-labeled fluorescent primers. One of the clones, s4–1, had a 1.9 kb insert with an open reading frame, which encoded a novel protein (at the time of submission) of 404 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number E16311). The protein was named PTP-BAS GLGF repeat-interacting protein (BAS-GRIP). This sequence is the same as subsequent data base entries for human TAPP1. Hereafter, we refer to BAS-GRIP as TAPP1. An N-terminal HA epitope tag was cloned in-frame with the N terminus of TAPP1 in pGEM-1. The insert was excised with EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (-) that had been cut with EcoRI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. TAPP1ΔCT, a full-length construct encoding a C-terminally truncated TAPP1 (missing the last 5 amino acids) was amplified from the full-length template in pcDNA3.1(-) using the T7 promoter primer and 5′-ATATGAATTCCTAAAGGCTCGCATCGTCCAAG-3′. The 1.3-kb product was digested with EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3.1(-) as described above. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Preparation and Purification of Bacterial Fusion Proteins—Fusion proteins were purified as described previously (26Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: BL21(λDE3)pLysS cells were transformed and grown in 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol (LB-Amp-Chlor) overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh LB-Amp-Chlor. This was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB-Amp-Chlor, which was grown until the optical density at 600 nm reached between 0.6 and 1.0. Protein expression was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (BioShop, Canada, Inc., Burlington, ON), and the culture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 28 °C. All subsequent steps were as described. Overlay Assays—Overlay assays were carried out as described previously (26Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gee S.H. Sekely S.A. Lombardo C. Kurakin A. Froehner S.C. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21980-21987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: signals generated by enhanced chemiluminescence were captured with a Digital Image Station (Kodak). The amount of fusion protein loaded in each lane was compared by digitally capturing an image of the Ponceau S stained blot prior to blocking. Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and were cultured on 10-cm diameter plastic dishes at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For immunolocalization experiments, cells were seeded onto 18-mm diameter glass coverslips that had been coated sequentially with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine and 10 μg/ml fibronectin in 24-well plates. When the cells were 80% confluent, they were transfected 6 h using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum) overnight, treated for 5 min with 5 ng/ml PDGF or carrier alone, then fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Immunolabeling—Coverslips were removed from the 24-well plates and transferred to a covered dish lined with Parafilm “M” laboratory film. Cells were permeabilized for 5–10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a filtered solution of 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were for 1 h each in the same solution. Incubations were followed by 3 × 5 min washes with the same solution. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA) then sealed with nail polish. The immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 MOT equipped with an Axiocam digital camera and Zeiss Axiovision 3.0 software. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Quantification of Membrane Ruffling—Transfected NIH-3T3 cells were labeled as described above, counted, and scored separately for the presence of peripheral and dorsal circular ruffles. A minimum of 100 cells was counted for each condition, and three independent experiments were quantified. Untransfected cells were double stained with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated phalloidin and DAPI. At least 10 random fields were photographed with a 40× objective and both fluorophores captured and saved in a multichannel image using Zeiss AxioVision 3.0 software. The number of cells in each field was determined by counting DAPI-stained nuclei. The number of cells with peripheral or dorsal circular ruffles was determined and expressed as the percentage of cells with ruffles. Identification of TAPP1 as a γ1-Syntrophin-interacting Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin as bait yielded 2 independent overlapping cDNA clones encoding TAPP1. The structure of TAPP1 is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Controls for the specificity of the yeast two-hybrid interaction included retesting positive clones by back-transformation into yeast and lack of interaction with a nuclear lamin prey. In addition, γ1-syntrophin PDZ did not self-activate when transformed into yeast with an empty prey vector. The cDNAs isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen overlapped in the C-terminal region of TAPP1, suggesting this region mediates the binding to the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence (-PVSDV) at the C terminus of TAPP1, which is conserved in human and mouse TAPP1, is consistent with the class I PDZ domain ligand consensus ((S/T)XV) (28Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) but differs from the consensus sequence identified for strong binding to α- and β-syntrophin PDZ domains ((Q/R/K)E(S/T)X(V/L/I)) (26Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14638-14646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Direct Interaction between Syntrophin PDZ Domains and the C Terminus of TAPP1—To show direct biochemical association between the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin and the C terminus of TAPP1, overlay filter binding assays were performed. A soluble GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of TAPP1 (clone 4) bound strongly to a hexahistidine (H6)-fusion protein of the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin and somewhat less strongly to the PDZ domains of α1- and β2-syntrophin (Fig. 2A). Longer exposures revealed weak binding to the PDZ domain of β1-syntrophin (not shown) but not to any of the other PDZ domains tested including PDZ-1, -2, and -3 of PSD-95 and PDZ-3 of Chapsyn-110 (Fig. 2A). Thus, these in vitro binding data indicate that TAPP1 interacts preferentially with the PDZ domain of syntrophins. In previous studies, we demonstrated that synthetic peptides corresponding to C-terminal PDZ binding motifs of various proteins are sufficient for strong binding to recombinant PDZ domains subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (24Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Gee S.H. Madhavan R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14638-14646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine if the C terminus of TAPP1 is sufficient for interaction with the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin, a biotinylated synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of TAPP1 was assayed for binding to various recombinant PDZ domains in overlay assays. Surprisingly, no binding was observed to any of the PDZ domains tested. In parallel blots, the C-terminal 10 amino acids of diacylglycerol kinase-ι (IGHEDLETAV)) bound to syntrophin PDZ domains and to PDZ-3 of PSD-95 and Chapsyn-110, ruling out the possibility that the recombinant proteins had lost their ability to bind PDZ ligands. Thus, these results demonstrate that the C-terminal 10 amino acids of TAPP1 are not sufficient for binding to syntrophin PDZ domains. Most known PDZ domain interactions occur by the recognition of short C-terminal peptide motifs and require that the peptide ligands have a free carboxylate group (28Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C.

Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), but in some cases internal peptide motifs that are well removed from the C terminus can mediate interactions with PDZ domains (27Gee S.H.

To further investigate the function of the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of TAPP1, we constructed a GST fusion protein mutant in which the C-terminal 5 amino acids of TAPP1 were deleted (ΔC-term). As shown in Fig. 2D, removal of these residues completely abrogated binding to the γ1-syntrophin PDZ domain in overlay assays. Thus, our results demonstrate that the extreme C terminus of TAPP1 is necessary, but not sufficient, for binding to the syntrophin PDZ domains and suggest additional residues upstream are important for mediating strong binding or for maintaining the proper conformation of the C terminus. PDZ Interactions Regulate the Subcellular Localization of TAPP1—PDZ-containing adapter proteins act as scaffolds for the assembly of protein complexes at the plasma membrane (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that γ1-syntrophin might recruit TAPP1 to the plasma membrane of cells. We first tested whether the PDZ interaction occurs within the context of the full-length γ1-syntrophin protein expressed in mammalian cells. A GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of TAPP1 efficiently “pulled down” T7-tagged full-length γ1-syntrophin from lysates of transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2C), whereas GST alone did not. Thus, the PDZ interactio"
https://openalex.org/W1981380308,"The structural organization and topology of the Lcb1p subunit of yeast and mammalian serine palmitoyltransferases (SPT) were investigated. In the yeast protein, three membrane-spanning domains were identified by insertion of glycosylation and factor Xa cleavage sites at various positions. The first domain of the yeast protein, located between residues 50 and 84, was not required for the stability, membrane association, interaction with Lcb2p, or enzymatic activity. Deletion of the comparable domain of the mammalian protein SPTLC1 also had little effect on its function, demonstrating that this region is not required for membrane localization or heterodimerization with SPTLC2. The second and third membrane-spanning domains of yeast Lcb1p, located between residues 342 and 371 and residues 425 and 457, respectively, create a luminal loop of ∼60 residues. In contrast to the first membrane-spanning domain, the second and third membrane-spanning domains were both required for Lcb1p stability. In addition, mutations in the luminal loop destabilized the SPT heterodimer indicating that this region of the protein is important for SPT structure and function. Mutations in the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of Lcb1p also disrupted heterodimer formation. Taken together, these data suggest that in contrast to other members of the α-oxoamine synthases that are soluble homodimers, the Lcb1p and Lcb2p subunits of the SPT heterodimer may interact in the cytosol, as well as within the membrane and/or the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The sphingolipids are essential components of all eukaryotic cells. They confer important structural properties to membranes and partition into microdomains that are believed to organize proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways (1Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In addition, sphingolipid metabolites are regulatory molecules for a variety of cellular processes (2El Bawd S.U.J. Rode P. Skulk Z.M. Bylaws A. Hansin Y.A. J.

Signal. 2000; 12: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that the sphingolipids are crucial for the function of eukaryotic cells, very little is known about the regulation of their synthesis. The committed step of sphingolipid synthesis, the condensation of palmitoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and l-serine to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). 1The abbreviations used are: SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; POAS, PLP-dependent α-oxoamine synthases; AONS, 8-amino-7-oxopelargonic acid synthase; HSN, hereditary sensory neuropathy; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PHS, phytosphingosine; GC, glycosylation cassette, residues 80–133 of invertase (Suc2p); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; fXa, factor Xa; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; HA, hemagglutination. This enzyme belongs to a subfamily of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes known as the α-oxoamine synthases (POASs) that catalyze the decarboxylative condensation between the α-carbon of an amino acid and an acyl-CoA (8Hanada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of one member of this family, 8-amino-7-oxopelargonic acid synthase (AONS), has been solved and its detailed mechanism determined (9Alexeev D. Alexeeva M. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. Webster S.P. Sawyer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 401-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These studies showed that AONS is a head-to-tail homodimer with two symmetrical active sites. However, although other members of the POAS family, including AONS, are soluble homodimers, SPT is a membrane-associated heterodimer composed of two subunits, which in yeast are named Lcb1p and Lcb2p and in mammalian cells are named SPTLC1 and SPTLC2. The Lcb1p and Lcb2p subunits (as well as the mammalian subunits) share a considerable degree of sequence homology but are no more closely related to one another than they are to AONS. Although there is no structural information for Lcb1p or Lcb2p, sequence alignments comparing them with each other and with AONS indicate that some of the catalytic residues of AONS, including the lysine that forms a Schiff's base with PLP, are present in Lcb2p but not in Lcb1p, whereas other catalytic residues are present in Lcb1p but not in Lcb2p. Modeling studies based on the structure of AONS suggest that SPT is likely to have a single active site that lies at the Lcb1p/Lcb2p interface with some catalytic residues contributed by Lcb1p and others by Lcb2p. In support of this model is the observation that amino acid substitutions in Lcb1p analogous to the SPTLC1 mutations that causes hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSN1) alter a cysteine residue (Cys-180) predicted to lie across the heterodimeric interface from the PLP-binding lysine in Lcb2p (10Bejaoui K.

Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the yeast Lcb1p protein that correspond to the HSN1 mutations abolish catalytic activity, but do prevent heterodimerization, and are dominant negative (13Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10194-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, mutations in the PLP-binding lysine residue (Lys-366) of Lcb2p also dominantly inactivate SPT in a manner similar to the HSN1-like mutations in Lcb1p (13Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10194-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SPT is associated with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (14Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protease accessibility studies indicated that the active site is cytoplasmic (15Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with the cytoplasmic localization of its substrates, serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Based on the homology of SPT with AONS, the central regions of the Lcb1p and Lcb2p protein were predicted to associate to form a cytoplasmically oriented active site at the heterodimer interface whereas the amino and/or carboxyl-terminal extensions of Lcb1p and Lcb2p that are missing in the soluble α-oxoamine synthases were considered likely to mediate membrane association. Recently, Yasuda et al. (16Yasuda S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4176-4183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that the amino terminus of mammalian (CHO) SPTLC1 is located in the lumen of the ER, whereas the carboxyl terminus is cytoplasmic, demonstrating that the protein has an odd number of membrane-spanning segments. Based on hydropathy analyses and consideration of the likely location of the active site, they proposed that SPTLC1 has a single amino-terminally located membrane-spanning domain. Yeast Lcb1p protein also has a very hydrophobic amino terminus. However, mutations that replaced hydrophobic residues with charged residues or complete deletion of the putative amino-terminal membrane-spanning domain did not eliminate SPT activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal domain may not be the only region of the protein that determines membrane localization and topology. In the present study, we provide evidence that in addition to an amino-terminal membrane-spanning domain, yeast Lcb1p protein has two additional membrane-spanning domains located in the region of the protein homologous to the PLP-binding domain of AONS. Because this region was previously predicted to participate in the formation of the heterodimeric interface with Lcb2p, these results, in combination with the finding that the carboxyl-terminal extension of Lcb1p is critical for interaction with Lcb2p, suggest that the structure of the SPT heterodimer may be more dissimilar from that of the homodimeric POAS family members than previously thought. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strains used in this study are as follows: TDY2037, Matα ura3-52 trp1 leu2 lys2; TDY2507, Matα lcb1Δ::TRP ura3-52 trp1 leu2 lys2; TDY 2505, Matα lcb1Δ::TRP lcb2Δ::TRP ura3-52 trp1 leu2 lys2; and TDY2509, Mata lcb1Δ::TRP tsc3-2 ura3-52 trp1 leu2 lys2. Standard yeast media were prepared, and yeast was cultured according to established procedures (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The lcb1Δ and lcb1Δlcb2Δ mutants were cultured in medium containing 15 μm phytosphingosine (PHS) and 0.1% tergitol. Plasmids carrying various mutant and tagged alleles of LCB1 were tested for their ability to complement the lcb1Δ null mutant by streaking onto YPD medium with and without PHS. LCB1-SUC2 Glycosylation Cassette Topology Reporter Plasmids— LCB1 gene fusion alleles with the invertase glycosylation cassette (GC) inserted were constructed in two steps. In the first step, NheI restriction sites were created at 17 positions along the LCB1 gene by converting the two codons between which the cassette was to be inserted into GCTAGC by using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For this mutagenesis, a pRS315-based plasmid containing a BamHI to KpnI fragment that extended from 250 bp upstream of the start codon to 135 bp downstream of the stop codon of LCB1 was used as template (13Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10194-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The codons in the LCB1 gene that were changed to GCTAGC were 4/5, 50/51, 84/85, 120/121, 142/143, 239/240, 279/280, 342/343, 371/372, 386/387, 407/408, 416/417, 425/426, 457/458, 484/485, 549/550, and 556/557 (Fig. 1). For each mutagenesis reaction, a pair of mutagenic primers containing the NheI site (GCTAGC) flanked by 15 nucleotides of homology to LCB1 was used. Following mutagenesis and transformation into Escherichia coli, plasmids were isolated and screened for the presence of the NheI site. In the second step, an SpeI-ended PCR fragment encoding the 53-amino acid domain of invertase (Suc2p), extending from codon 80 to 133 and containing three potential glycosylation sites located at residues 99, 114, and 120 (18Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was inserted into the NheI sites created in step 1. To generate the SpeI-ended GC, the PCR primers SUC2F, 5′-GCATATGCACTAGT GAATTCACTAATTGGGAAGATCAA, and SUC2R, 5′-GCATATGCACTAGTATAAGTCCAAATCGCAACGCA, were used in a PCR amplification reaction with yeast genomic DNA as template. The SpeI sites on the ends of the primers are boldface and underlined. The SUC2F PCR primer was designed to place an EcoRI site (italicized) on the 5′-end of the GC by introducing two conservative nucleotide changes in codons 80 and 81 of the Suc2p coding sequence. The PCR fragment was band-isolated and digested with SpeI prior to ligation into the NheI sites of the plasmids created in step 1. Plasmids containing the GC cassette inserted in the correct orientation were identified by loss of the NheI site and digestion with EcoRI. Candidate plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The lcb1 mutant alleles with charged residues substituted for hydrophobic residues in the potential aminoterminal membrane-spanning domains (Table I) were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis.

To create the YGI (66–68) DVK substitution, the primer 5′-AGATAGGGCTTATTTTAGACGTCAAAATCTATTACTTGTCCAAGCCA and its complement were used. The lcb1 mutants with the Ile/Leu residues at 549/550 changed to Ala/Ser (IL → AS) or Pro/Arg (IL → PR), and the insertion mutants, IL → IASL or IL → IPRL, were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis. For the IL → AS substitution mutant, an NheI site (underlined and in boldface) was created that encodes the AS substitution using the primer 5′-AGTGTCAAGCAGTCCGCTAGCGCCTGTTGCCAAGAA and its complement. For the IL → PR substitution mutant, an AvrII site (underlined and in boldface) was created that encodes the PR substitution using the primer 5′-AGTGTCAAGCAGTCCCCTAGGGCCTGTTGCCAAGAA and its complement. For the IL → IASL insertion mutant, an NheI site (underlined and in boldface) was inserted between codon 549 and 550 using the primer 5′-GTCAAGCAGTCCATCGCTAGCCTTGCCTGTTGCCAA and its complement. For the IL → IPRL insertion mutant, an AvrII site (underlined and in boldface) was inserted between codon 549 and 550 using the primer 5′-GTCAAGCAGTCCATCCCTAGGCTTGCCTGTTGCCAA and its complement.Table IMutations in Yeast Lcb1pLCB1 alleleComplements lcb1ΔLcb1p stabilityStabilizes Lcb2pWild typeYesStableYesYLW (24,25,26) DRSYesStableYesYGI (66,67,68) DVKYesStableYesΔ4–50 (N-terminal ER domain)YesStableYesΔ50–85 (TMD 1)YesStableYesΔ9–85YesStableYesΔ342–371 (TMD 2)NoUnstableNoΔ371–386 (ER luminal loop)NoStableNoΔ386–416 (ER luminal loop)NoUnstableNoΔ416–425(ER luminal loop)NoStableNoΔ433–458 (TMD 3)NoUnstableNoIL (549,550) IASLaThese mutated Lcb1ps have two residues inserted between 549 and 550YesStableYesIL (549,550) ASYesStablePartiallyIL (549,550) IPRLaThese mutated Lcb1ps have two residues inserted between 549 and 550NoStableNoIL (549,550) PRNoStablePartiallya These mutated Lcb1ps have two residues inserted between 549 and 550 Open table in a new tab LCB1 Deletion Mutant Alleles—Several plasmids with NheI sites in the LCB1 gene were used as templates for QuikChange mutagenesis to introduce AvrII sites using the same strategy described above for inserting the NheI sites. The resulting plasmids thus had NheI and AvrII sites flanking the domain to be deleted (Table I). In some cases, a second NheI site was introduced rather than an AvrII site. The doubly mutated plasmids were digested with NheI and AvrII (or NheI alone) and religated to generate the lcb1Δ deletion mutant alleles, Δ4–50, Δ50–85, and Δ9–85, which were verified by DNA sequencing. Carboxyl Terminally Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged lcb1 Alleles—A fragment flanked by XbaI sites and containing the GFP gene was generated by PCR using the primers GFPF, 5′-TCGTCTAGAGCAAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC, and GFPR, 5′-TCGTCTAGAGCATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC, with the pQBI63 plasmid (Quantum Biotechnologies Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) as template. The fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated into an AvrII site created at codons 556 and 557 by QuikChange mutagenesis as described above. To construct the GFP-tagged lcb1 deletion mutants, an SnaBI/XbaI restriction fragment (extending from codon 433 to 470 bp downstream of the stop codon) from the GFP-tagged LCB1 plasmid was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the plasmids with the deletion mutant lcb1 (Δ4–50, Δ50–85, Δ9–85) alleles. The GFP-tagged deletion mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Western Blotting—Prior to electrophoresis, proteins were heated at 70 °C for 10 min in NuPAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved using a 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gel system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Lcb1p, 1:2500; anti-Lcb2p, 1:2000) as described previously (19Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad). The blot was developed using chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL-Plus Western blotting detection systems, Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the Glycosylation Status of the Lcb1p-Suc2p Topology Reporter Fusion Proteins—For analysis of the glycosylation status of the GC-tagged Lcb1p proteins, microsomes were prepared as described previously (19Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The strains transformed with the GC topology reporter plasmids were grown in minimal medium (minus leucine) to maintain selection for the plasmid. The cells were lysed by bead beating in buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm leupeptin. For endoglycosidase H (EndoH) treatment, 100 μg of microsomal protein was suspended in 54 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm Na2EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl). Six μl of 10× denaturing buffer (5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the samples were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. Ten μl of 10× G5 buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5) were added to the boiled samples to bring the volume to 70 μl, and the samples were split into two aliquots. One aliquot was treated with 5000 units of EndoH (New England Biolabs), and the other aliquot was incubated with buffer. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and proteins were resolved by NuPAGE gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen) and visualized by immunoblotting as described above. Construction of LCB1-fXa Fusion Alleles—The LCB1 alleles containing factor Xa (fXa) cleavage sites were constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis. Pairs of mutagenic primers were designed to insert the sequence encoding a repeat of the fXa protease recognition site, IEGRIEGR, after codons 4, 50, 279, 407, 416, 425, or 556 of the LCB1 gene. Each primer pair contained the sequence, GATATCGAAGGTCGAATTGAGGGACGG, flanked on either side by 18 nucleotides of homology to the LCB1 site into which the fXa cleavage site was to be inserted. An extra GAT codon on the 5′-end of the sequence encoding the fXa cleavage site was added to generate an EcoRV site that could be used to identify candidate mutants. LCB1-fXa fusion alleles were verified by DNA sequencing. Cleavage with Factor Xa Protease—Preparation of microsomes for analyzing the fusion proteins containing the fXa cleavage site was performed essentially as described by Gilstring and Ljungdahl (18Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cells were resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm sodium azide) at an A600 of 20. Spheroplasts were generated by treatment of the cells with 1.0 mg/ml zymolyase-100T (Seikagaku Corp., East Falmouth, MA) at 30 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, spheroplasts were resuspended at an A600 of 20 in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm each of the protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Spheroplasts were lysed with 20 strokes of a Teflon pestle in a 5-ml tissue grinder followed by removal of unbroken cells by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Microsomal membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed once with storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), resuspended in storage buffer at 4 mg/ml protein, and stored at -80 °C. For assay of cleavage by fXa protease, 20 μg of microsomal protein was diluted with 20 μl of fXa buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sorbitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Samples were mock-digested or digested with 1.1 μg of factor Xa protease (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence or absence of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 3 h. Construction of Amino-terminal Domain lcb1 Deletion Mutants with the GC at Codons 4, 416, or 425—To construct the lcb1Δ50–85 with the GC at codon 4, the SmaI fragment (extending from codon 36–221 bp downstream of the stop codon of LCB1) was isolated from the lcb1Δ50–85 plasmid and was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the plasmid in which the GC had been inserted after codon 4. To construct lcb1Δ50–85 with the GC at codon 416 or at 425, a BstZ171/XbaI restriction fragment that extended from codon 144–470 bp downstream of the stop codon was generated from the plasmid with the GC at either 416 or at 425 and was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the plasmid with the lcb1Δ50–85 deletion mutant allele. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The CHO-SPTLC1 Deletion Mutant Alleles—The CHO-SPTLC1 gene was PCR-amplified by using pSV-cLCB1 (20Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (generous gift of Dr. Hanada) as template. The PCR primers, CHO1-UP, 5′-TTCCGCGGGAATTCGTCGACGCCATGGCGATGGCGGCGGAGCAG, and CHO1-DOWN, 5′-TTCCGAATTCGTCGACTCTAGACTACAGCAGCACAGCCTGGGC, were designed to generate a PCR fragment with multiple restriction sites on the ends. The coding sequence of CHO-SPTLC1 from the start codon through codon 7 is underlined in CHO1-UP, and the coding sequence for the last seven codons of CHO-SPTLC1 is underlined in CHO1-DOWN. Following restriction with EcoRI (site shown in boldface in CHO1-UP) and with XbaI (site shown in boldface in CHO1-down), the PCR fragment was ligated between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). For deletion of codons 3–45, primer D3F, 5′-GACGCCATGTCTAGAATGGCGGATATCTTGCAAGAGCGTTCTGATCTT and its complement, primer D3R, were used for QuikChange mutagenesis. The primer pair was designed to place an EcoRV site (underlined) at the deletion junction. The correct plasmid was identified by restriction mapping and confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO Cell Culture and Transfection—The Chinese hamster ovary cell lines CHO-K1 and CHO-LY-B (RIKEN Bioresource Center, Japan) deficient in SPTLC1 expression (21Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A.

The cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and transfected at 60–80% confluency. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the recommendations of the manufacturer and optimized for our conditions. A total of 20 μg of the pcDNA3.1(+)-based plasmids carrying the CHO-SPTLC2, CHO-SPTLC1, or the CHO-SPTLC1Δ3–45 genes and 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were added to 4 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitogen) for each transfection. Five hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Microsome Preparation and Immunoblotting of CHO SPTLC1 and CHO SPTLC2—Cells were harvested and microsomes were prepared 48 h after transfection. The cells were washed with PBSE (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA) and harvested by scraping into 4 ml of PBSE buffer. The cells were transferred into 15-ml conical tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in MEM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm pepstatin A). Following cell lysis by sonication (three 6-s pulses at a setting of 5), the lysate was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min. Microsomes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the microsomal pellet was washed and resuspended in 100 μl MEM buffer containing 15% glycerol. For detection of CHO SPTLC1, 2 μg of microsomal protein were resolved on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. A monoclonal anti-CHO SPTLC1 antibody (BD Biosciences) was used at a dilution of 1/12,000. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody, and detection was with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of CHO SPTLC2, 5 μg of microsomal protein were resolved by NuPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized using rabbit anti-CHO SPTLC2 anti-peptide antibodies raised against two combined peptides, CGKYSRHRLVPLLDRPF (residues 538–552) and CGDRPFDETTYEETED (residues 549–561) of SPTLC2; these peptides had been used previously for generating anti-SPTLC2 antibodies by Uhlinger et al. (22Uhlinger D.J. Carton J.M. Argentieri D.C. Damiano B.P. Dandrea M.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1320-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Antisera were prepared by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX), and specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using peptides coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 6MB (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Lcb2p antibodies were used at a dilution of 1/5000, and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody. Detection was as for CHO-SPTLC1. SPT Assays—Microsomal protein was purified as above. SPT was assayed as described previously (19Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol.

Background incorporation of l-[G-3H]serine was measured without the addition of palmitoyl-CoA and subtracted. Each assay was conducted in triplicate, and the average SPT activity was reported. Hydropathic Profile Analysis Is Not Informative for Predicting the Topology of Lcb1p—The Lcb1p subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is a 558-amino acid protein. Although Lcb1p has biochemical properties consistent with it being an integral membrane protein, various algorithms for predicting membrane-spanning segments suggest vastly different topologies for the yeast Lcb1p protein; hydropathic profile analyses predict anywhere from 0 to 5 potential membrane-spanning domains in the protein (Table II). The inability of these analyses to predict a single model for the topology of mammalian SPTLC1 was noted previously and motivated a study of the topology of the mammalian protein by Hanada and co-workers (16Y"

Recently, a separate class of soluble guanylyl cyclases has been identified that are only slightly activated by or are insensitive to nitric oxide. These atypical guanylyl cyclases include the vertebrate β2 subunit and examples from the invertebrates Manduca sexta, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. A member of this family, GCY-35 in C. elegans, was recently shown to be required for a behavioral response to low oxygen levels and may be directly regulated by oxygen (Gray, J. M., Karow, D.

Drosophila contains three genes that code for atypical soluble guanylyl cyclases: Gyc-88E, Gyc-89Da, and Gyc-89Db. COS-7 cells co-transfected with Gyc-88E and Gyc-89Da or Gyc-89Db accumulate low levels of cGMP under normal atmospheric oxygen concentrations and are potently activated under anoxic conditions. The increase in activity is graded over oxygen concentrations of 0–21%, can be detected within 1 min of exposure to anoxic conditions and is blocked by the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ).

This is the first demonstration of a soluble guanylyl cyclase that is activated in response to changing oxygen concentrations. The intracellular messenger, cGMP, is synthesized by guanylyl cyclases (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol.

There are two families of guanylyl cyclase, integral membrane proteins known as receptor guanylyl cyclases and the cytoplasmic soluble guanylyl cyclases (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S.

Another class of soluble guanylyl cyclase has been identified that have a similar structure but are only slightly activated by or are insensitive to NO (2Koglin M. Vehse K. Budaeus L. Scholz H.

Examples of these atypical guanylyl cyclases include the β2 subunit in mammals and MsGC-β3 from the insect Manduca sexta (3Morton D.B. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 97-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also predicted that all the soluble guanylyl cyclases in Caenorhabditis elegans, and three of the soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits in Drosophila are part of this subfamily (3Morton D.B. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 97-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome contains five genes that code for soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits, named according to their chromosomal locations; Gycα-99B, Gycβ-100B, Gyc-88E, Gyc-89Da, and Gyc-89Db (3Morton D.B. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 97-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gycα-99B and Gycβ-100B form a conventional, heterodimeric enzyme that is potently activated by NO (6Shah S. Hyde D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15368-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, Gyc-88E is active in the absence of additional subunits whereas Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db are only active when co-expressed with Gyc-88E and all three combinations are slightly activated by some, but not all, NO donors (5Langlais K.K. Stewart J.A. Morton D.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 2D. B. Morton and K. K. Langlais, unpublished data.2D. B. Morton and K. K. Langlais, unpublished data. This biochemical data in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Gyc-88E, Gyc-89Da, and Gyc-89Db suggested that they are also members of a family of atypical guanylyl cyclases (3Morton D.B. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 97-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the members of this family in C. elegans, GCY-35, has recently been demonstrated to be required for oxygen sensation (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). When placed in an oxygen gradient, C. elegans preferentially congregates at 5–12% oxygen whereas individuals that have a deletion in gcy-35 distribute themselves evenly across the gradient (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This behavior appears to require cGMP production and unlike any other guanylyl cyclase, the heme-binding domain of GCY-35 binds oxygen (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This suggested that the activity of GCY-35 is regulated by oxygen concentration, although it was not possible to directly demonstrate this as recombinant GCY-35 showed no enzyme activity (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the Drosophila atypical soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits are activated in the absence of oxygen and hence could act as oxygen sensors, alerting the animals to hypoxic environments. Plasmids containing the open reading frames of the Drosophila soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells in 12-well tissue culture plates as described previously (5Langlais K.K. Stewart J.A. Morton D.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 72 h after transfection, the culture medium was removed from the cells and replaced with physiological saline (composition in mm: NaCl, 120; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 2; Tris, 25; glucose, 15; pH 7.4) that had been saturated with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The culture plate was then placed in a plexiglass chamber with the same oxygen/nitrogen mixture flowing through it at ∼10 cubic feet/h. The composition of the gas mixture was varied according to the experiment and continuously monitored with an oxygen monitor (model 5120, Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland). The cells were rapidly lysed after a 60-min incubation period by replacing the saline with acidified ethanol (100:1, ethanol:1 m HCl). The lysed cells were centrifuged to remove cell debris and the supernatant dried under vacuum. The residue was assayed for cGMP content by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (7Kingan T.G. Gray W. Žitňan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the Drosophila soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits were regulated by oxygen, different combinations of subunits were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and the cGMP content of the cells determined after exposure to a variety of conditions. The three atypical guanylyl cyclase subunit combinations that exhibit guanylyl cyclase activity, Gyc-88E, Gyc-88E + Gyc-89Da, and Gyc-88E + Gyc-89Db, all showed higher accumulation of cGMP in the presence of 100% nitrogen compared with 21% oxygen/79% nitrogen (Fig. 1). By contrast, the conventional soluble guanylyl cyclase, Gycα-99B/β-100B, showed no such change. To confirm that the conventional soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits were capable of being activated under these conditions, a NO donor was added directly to the medium while the cells were exposed to 21% oxygen. In this case the cells showed the expected robust increase in cGMP levels (Fig. 1). It was interesting to note that the cGMP levels that accumulated when cells transfected with Gyc-88E/89Db were exposed to anoxic conditions were comparable (30–40 pmol of cGMP) to the levels accumulated by cells transfected with conventional guanylyl cyclase subunits that were exposed to an NO donor. To determine the concentration range of oxygen that affected the activity of Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db, cells that were transfected with these combinations of subunits were exposed to varying oxygen concentrations for 60 min and their cGMP accumulation measured (Fig. 2). These data showed that both subunit combinations exhibited a graded increase in activity from 21 to 0% oxygen. A small difference was seen between the two subunit combinations; there was no difference in the cGMP accumulation in cells transfected with Gyc-88E/89Db between 0 and 2% oxygen, whereas cells transfected with Gyc-88E/89Da showed significantly less cGMP accumulation. The graded effect from 0–21% oxygen is consistent with the model in C. elegans that these atypical guanylyl cyclases act as oxygen sensors (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). One of the requirements for a molecular oxygen sensor that can signal hypoxic conditions is that it binds oxygen with low affinity (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Phys. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). If Gyc-88E/89Da or Gyc-88E/89Db was inhibited by oxygen and bound oxygen with a high affinity, it would be expected that only a low concentration of oxygen would be sufficient to fully inhibit cGMP accumulation. As there was a graded decrease in cGMP accumulation over the concentration range of 0–21%, the data suggest that both Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db bind oxygen with a relatively low affinity. The time course of cGMP accumulation in response to anoxia was also determined. Cells transfected with either Gyc-88E/89Da or Gyc-88E/89Db were switched from 21% oxygen/79% nitrogen to 100% nitrogen at different times within the 60-min exposure period and then assayed for cGMP content (Fig. 3). This experiment showed that within 1 min of exposure to an anoxic environment there was a significant accumulation of cGMP in cells expressing Gyc-88E/89Db, which continued to accumulate throughout the 60-min exposure time. Cells that expressed Gyc-88E/89Da took longer to show a significant increase in cGMP levels (30 min compared with 1 min), but this could have been due to the lower level of activity of this subunit combination.Fig. 3Time course of activation of Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db in response to anoxic conditions. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the subunits shown and exposed to 21% oxygen/79% nitrogen and then switched at different times to 100% nitrogen. The total incubation time was 60 min in each case.

Schelvis J.P.M. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4502-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The heme-binding domain of the C. elegans GCY-35 was the first guanylyl cyclase demonstrated to be able to bind oxygen (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To determine whether the heme group of Gyc-88E/89Db was likely to mediate the anoxia activation, the cells were incubated in ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one), a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor that acts by oxidizing the iron in the heme group (10Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. DiValentin M. Schelvis J.P.M. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10848-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Exposure of COS-7 cells transiently expressing Gyc-88E/89Db to 100 μm ODQ completely abolished the anoxia activation (Fig. 4), suggesting that the heme group is necessary for activation. These data suggest that Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db can act as oxygen sensors in Drosophila. If these enzymes exhibit the same properties in vivo as they do in COS-7 cells, when the cells are exposed to reduced oxygen concentrations, there will be an increase in the levels of cGMP. The co-localization of these subunits in putative chemosensory neurons supports this notion (5Langlais K.K. Stewart J.A. Morton D.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sensory neurons that express both Gyc-88E and Gyc-89Db and send projections to the surface of Drosophila embryos are found in the head, terminal segments, and lateral margins (5Langlais K.K. Stewart J.A. Morton D.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). They are in an ideal position to rapidly signal to the CNS when the animal encounters reduced oxygen concentrations to respond in a behaviorally appropriate manner. Drosophila larvae will respond rapidly to reduced oxygen concentrations by withdrawing from their food and initiating a search-like behavior, which appears to be regulated by a cGMP-dependent pathway (11Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The biochemical data presented in the present study suggest that under normal oxygen concentrations, oxygen binds to the heme group and results in low levels of guanylyl cyclase activity. When the enzyme is exposed to reduced oxygen concentrations, the oxygen dissociates from the heme group resulting in activation of the enzyme. The increased activity seen when the atypical guanylyl cyclases are exposed to NO donors could be due to the displacement of oxygen by NO (5Langlais K.K. Stewart J.A. Morton D.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to conventional guanylyl cyclases that do not bind oxygen and are directly activated by the binding of NO (13Lawson D.M. Stevenson C.E.M. Andrew C.R. George S.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 553-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this model proves to be correct, it will be a novel mechanism for the activation of a soluble guanylyl cyclase. These data might also shed new light on the molecular basis of oxygen sensors in other species. In addition to long term (hours to days) adaptive changes to hypoxia (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Phys. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), all animals respond quickly (seconds to minutes) to reduced oxygen concentrations (12Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14Peers C. Kemp P.J. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The recent report on the role of GCY-35 in the behavioral response of C. elegans to hypoxia supports the model of atypical guanylyl cyclases as molecular oxygen sensors (4Gray J.M. Karow D.S. Lu H. Chang A.J. Chang J.S. Ellis R.E. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the glomus cells of the carotid body detect short-term changes in oxygen concentration leading to a variety of physiological changes (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Phys. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of the oxygen sensor in these cells is unclear, although it is thought to be either a heme protein or a potassium channel that direct binds oxygen (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Phys. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 15Prabhakar N.R. Overholt J.L. Respir. Physiol. 2000; 122: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There are several candidate heme proteins, including NADPH oxidase, NO synthase, and a low affinity mitochondrial cytochrome (15Prabhakar N.R. Overholt J.L. Respir. Physiol. 2000; 122: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The atypical guanylyl cyclase, Gyc-88E/89Db, in the peripheral nervous system of Drosophila may prove to be a valuable model system to study this critical biological pathway.

Despite their longstanding clinical use and physiological importance, a better understanding of the mechanism by which glucocorticoids induce apoptosis is necessary to enhance the efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy. Unlike many death-promoting stimuli, glucocorticoids induce an active program of cellular suicide that requires transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of either transcription or translation blocks glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of thymocytes, indicating that de novo RNA and protein synthesis are required (9McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 10Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The presence of a functional glucocorticoid receptor is also required. It was first observed that lymphocyte sensitivity to glucocorticoids was directly related to the ability of cells to selectively bind cortisol (11Sibley C.H. Tomkins G.M. Cell. 1974; 2: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 12Baxter J.D. Harrison D.J. Tomkins G.M. Cohen G.M.

Furthermore, glucocorticoid-resistant strains of childhood T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia often result from diminished abundance, alternative splicing, or truncation of the glucocorticoid receptor (14Hillmann A.G. Ramdas J. Multanen K. Norman M.R. Harmon J.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2056-2062PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hala M. Hartmann B.L. Bock G. Geley S. Kofler R. Int. J.

Several transcriptionally regulated signaling pathways appear to be important in the initiation of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 17Distelhorst C.W.

Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). How these pathways signal the commitment of the lymphocyte to apoptosis is unclear. It is known that Bax and Bak, pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulatory proteins, are critical for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, because thymocytes from mice lacking bax and bak are resistant to glucocorticoids (26Rathmell J.C. Lindsten T. Zong W.X. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Once activated, Bax and Bak release cytochrome c from mitochondria, resulting in caspase activation and the subsequent degradation of cellular protein and chromatin (27Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 28Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Although glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis requires transcriptional regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor and activation of Bax, the molecular events connecting these processes remain elusive. It is becoming increasingly clear that BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family play a critical role in activating Bax and Bak and often act as cellular sensors whose induction or activation are very early events in the execution phase of apoptosis (29Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The BH3-only protein that is of particular interest in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is Bim. Bim is induced by glucocorticoids (30Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), is capable of activating Bax directly (29Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whereas glucocorticoids are capable of inducing an intrinsic form of apoptosis that does not require extracellular pro-apoptotic signals (such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor-α), environmental cues can influence the apoptotic response. Many cytokines, including interleukins 2 and 4 (33Migliorati G. Nicoletti I. Pagliacci M.C. D'Adamio L. Riccardi C. Blood. 1993; 81: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Migliorati G. Nicoletti I. Pagliacci M.C. Riccardi C. Pharmacol. Res. 1992; 25: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), interleukin 7 (35Amos C.L. Woetmann A. Nielsen M. Geisler C. Odum N. Brown B.L. Dobson P.R. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), interferon-α (36Panayiotidis P. Ganeshaguru K. Jabbar S.A. Hoffbrand A.V. Br J. Haematol. 1994; 86: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and activation of the T-cell receptor inhibit glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in multiple model systems (37Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although inhibition of these signaling pathways may help overcome glucocorticoid resistance, identification of the receptors whose activation enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis will open new opportunities for the enhancement of glucocorticoid therapy. In an attempt to identify glucocorticoid-regulated genes that promote apoptosis, we have performed microarray expression analysis on three models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (30Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have found that tdag8 (T-cell death-associated gene 8), a G protein-coupled receptor selectively expressed in lymphoid tissues (primarily thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood monocytes), is rapidly and markedly induced by glucocorticoids in all three model systems. Activation of TDAG8 with the glycosphingolipid agonist psychosine markedly enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and the induction of Bim. This enhancement is only mediated by agonists of TDAG8 and is suppressed by a partial reduction of TDAG8 expression by RNA interference. Furthermore, expression of a TDAG8-GFP fusion protein is sufficient to induce apoptosis, and repression of endogenous TDAG8 partially protects against glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. These studies define a role for TDAG8 as a regulator of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and suggest that agonists of TDAG8 may be promising adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Reagents—Unless otherwise noted, all of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All of the sphingolipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), with the exception of N-acetylpsychosine, which was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Lyophilized sphingolipids were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 10 mm. Working solutions of sphingolipids were prepared immediately before use by diluting 10 mm stock solutions into a 10-fold excess solution of 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Lymphoma Cell Culture—WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 murine T-cell lymphoma lines were gifts of Diane Dowd (Case Western Reserve University) and Roger Miesfeld (University of Arizona), respectively. WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (HyClone), 12.5 units/ml penicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 cultures were seeded at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/ml and grown in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The CEM-C7–14 human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line was a gift of E. Brad Thompson (University of Texas Medical Branch). CEM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (USB Corp.), 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). CEM cultures were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/ml and grown in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Expression Analysis—Gene expression analysis using Affymetrix MG-U74A(v2) GeneChips was performed as previously described, with the following modifications (30Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Metrics files were filtered to include only those genes whose expression were considered by the Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 statistical algorithm to be “changed” in at least one time point in each of the three model systems (WEHI7.2, S49.A2, and thymus) analyzed. The resulting 207 genes were ranked by the significance analysis of microarrays algorithm using a two-class unpaired data model with a 10 nearest neighbors imputer (39Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9643) Google Scholar). To assign a measure of significance to glucocorticoid-regulated genes, significance analysis of microarrays compares the change in gene expression observed for a gene between the treatment and control populations to the distribution of expression values for that gene across measurements from the same group (either treatment or control populations). Observed changes in gene expression that are greater than those observed across measurements from the same group are considered significant, and the magnitude of the difference between expected and observed changes provides an index of significance (39Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9643) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from WHEI7.2 cells by lysing cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and then purifying the aqueous phase with an RNeasy mini-column (Qiagen). Ten micrograms of total RNA were separated on a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10× SSC by downward capillary transfer. The RNA was fixed to the membrane by cross-linking with ultraviolet light (245 nm, 30 s, 1200 μJ) using a Stratalinker UV oven (Stratagene). A full-length cDNA probe for TDAG8 was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from WEHI7.2 cells, and labeled with [32P]dCTP using random priming oligonucleotides. Hybridization of the probe occurred at 68 °C for 16 h in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene). The membranes were subsequently washed at 68 °C twice for 15 min in 2× SSC, once for 30 min in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS, and once for 10 min in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS. Hybridized probes were then detected by autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—The cell cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) to which complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) were added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentration in cell lysates was quantified by the Bradford method. Sample volume and protein concentration in each of the samples were normalized by the addition of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer prior to loading. The lysates were mixed with equal volumes of 2× sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and then boiled for 10 min. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through 12.5% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE gels with a 5% stacking gel and then immobilized by electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk prior to incubation with primary antibodies. The anti-Bim polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) were used for antibody detection. Quantitative Apoptosis Assay: Cellular DNA Content—Culture samples containing 1.5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, then suspended in 500 μl ice-cold methanol, and incubated for a minimum of 5 min at –20 °C. Methanol-fixed samples were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 2 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in propidium iodide staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline. Propidium iodide fluorescence was measured using a FACScan XL flow cytometer (Coulter). Nonaggregated whole cells having a DNA content less than that of the G1 population were scored as apoptotic. Data analysis was performed using WinList 3D version 5.0 (Verity Software House). TDAG8-GFP Expression—The phTDAG8-GFP expression vector, containing enhanced GFP fused to the carboxyl terminus of human TDAG8 was a generous gift of Kevin Lynch (University of Virginia). The construction and initial characterization of this vector has previously been described (40Im D.S. Heise C.E. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. Lynch K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The control plasmid, pEmdGFP-cb5, encodes an emerald GFP that localizes to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and remains within the cell following methanol fixation (41Wang N.S. Unkila M.T. Reineks E.Z. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44117-44128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). WEHI7.2 cells were transfected with either phTDAG8-GFP or pEmdGFP-cb5 by electroporation. Ten million viable cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min and then suspended in ice-cold intracellular buffer modified from van den Hoff et al., containing 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glutathione (42van den Hoff M.J.B. Christoffels V.M. Labruyere W.T. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-DNA suspensions were mixed with 60 μg of either phT-DAG8-GFP or pEmdGFP-cb5 and transferred to a 0.4-cm gap GenePulser cuvette (Bio-Rad). The cells were electroporated with a Bio-Rad GenePulser Xcell using a 225 V exponential pulse with a capacitance of 1,175 microfarad, then transferred immediately to 30 ml of warm growth medium, and allowed to recover for 8 h. Transfected cells were then dispensed into 6-well plates and treated with 1 μm dexamethasone or ethanol control for 24 h. GFP expression and apoptosis was measured on a FACScan XL flow cytometer (Coulter). Data analysis was performed using WinList 3D version 5.0 (Verity Software House). Epifluorescence Microscopy—Expression and proper localization of TDAG8-GFP was confirmed using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence of TDAG8-GFP in WEHI7.2 cells was visualized using a Zeiss Plan-APOCHROMAT 63X/1.4 NA oil objective. The images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA C4742-95 cooled CCD camera using SimplePCI image acquisition software, version 5.1 (Compix, Inc.). RNA Interference—Hairpin oligonucleotides containing the target sequence (5′-AGATGCTGTAGAATTAGATTC-3′), homologous to the murine TDAG8 mRNA, flanked by HindIII- and BamHI-compatible overhangs were synthesized by Qiagen. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and then ligated for 16 h at 14 °C into HindIII- and BamHI-digested pSilencer2.1-U6 hygro using 400 units of T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). Ligase reaction products were cloned into chemically competent DH5α (Invitrogen). Proper insertion of the TDAG8 RNAi hairpin oligonucleotides into the pSilencer vector was confirmed by sequencing (Cleveland Genomics). A pSilencer-GFP plasmid containing the RNAi hairpin oligonucleotide homologous to 21 bp of the coding region of enhanced GFP was used as a negative control. The pSilencer-TDAG8 or pSilencer-GFP plasmids were transfected into WEHI7.2 cells by electroporation, as described under “TDAG8-GFP Expression.” Electroporated cells were seeded into a T-175 flask containing 70 ml of fresh growth medium. Two hours following electroporation, hygromycin (Invitrogen) was added to the medium to make a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Approximately 1 week later, dead cells were removed from the culture using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences). The remaining live cells were then counted, seeded at a density of 1.5–2.0 × 105 cells/ml and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium containing 1 mg/ml hygromycin. The ability of pSilencer-TDAG8 to repress TDAG8 message was confirmed by Northern blotting of stable clones treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 16 h. Glucocorticoids Induce tdag8 in Multiple Models of Glucocorticoid-mediated Apoptosis—Alteration of gene expression is a requisite step in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. To identify genes potentially involved in the apoptotic response to glucocorticoids, we employed microarray expression analysis to identify glucocorticoid regulated genes in three models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Transcript abundance for over 10,000 genes and expressed sequence tags was measured in the WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 murine lymphoma cell lines as well as in primary murine thymocytes treated with 1 μm dexamethasone over a range of treatment times between 6 and 24 h. From over 10,000 genes represented on the array, 207 genes, deemed significantly changed by the Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite v5.0 statistical algorithm, were similarly regulated by dexamethasone treatment in all three model systems (Fig. 1A). Because small changes in the abundance of apoptosis regulatory proteins can have profound influences on cell fate, these 207 gene changes were not filtered by an arbitrary fold change parameter. Instead, the significance analysis of microarrays algorithm was used to assign a measure of significance to these 207 genes (39Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9643) Google Scholar). The five most significant gene inductions resulting from this analysis are listed in Table I. Among these genes are known regulators of apoptosis and nuclear receptor function. Interestingly, several of these genes appear to mediate glucocorticoid resistance. These include the stress response gene dig2, whose expression protects against glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (38Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); FKBP51, a known glucocorticoid-regulated component of the glucocorticoid receptor chaperone complex that can mediate glucocorticoid resistance by inhibiting cortisol binding (43Davies T.H.

Also included in this list is bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 family that acts at the mitochondria to activate Bax and release cytochrome c, promoting critical and irreversible steps in the execution phase of the apoptotic process (48Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 49O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The earliest and most pronounced of gene changes within this group of five was the induction of tdag8, a G protein-coupled receptor predominantly expressed within the immune system. Dexamethasone induced tdag8 in both cell lines and primary thymocytes at every time point analyzed (Fig. 1, B–D). Its expression was increased after as little as 2 h in thymocytes and was increased up to 11-fold by 24 h in WEHI7.2 cells. The induction of tdag8 was confirmed by Northern blotting. In the S49.A2 cell line, tdag8 was induced by 3 h and progressively accumulated throughout the 36-h time course (Fig. 1E).Table IFive most significant gene inductionsFold changeGene inducedAccession numberWEHI7.2S49.A2Thymus6h12h18h24h6h12h18h24h2h12hTDAG8U398275.36.18.611.33.53.24.04.05.72.8DIG2/RTP801AI8499393.75.72.33.04.63.23.25.75.74.6ABC transporter 2 (ATP-binding cassette)U600913.02.62.32.51.72.62.82.81.60.7FK506-binding protein 5 (51 kDa)U169592.32.62.32.61.31.31.31.05.73.5Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim)AA7966901.41.92.12.12.31.72.12.32.61.4 Open table in a new tab To test the involvement of the glucocorticoid receptor in TDAG8 induction, WEHI7.2 cells were cultured for 16 h in the presence of 1 μm dexamethasone, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing a 10-fold excess of the glucocorticoid-antagonist RU-486. The abundance of TDAG8 mRNA was determined by Northern blots of total RNA samples harvested at varying times following the removal of dexamethasone and the addition of RU-486. Within 2 h of incubation with RU-486, tdag8 message abundance was reduced to basal levels, suggesting that glucocorticoid receptor activation is required for the induction of tdag8 and that in the absence of dexamethasone, the elevated tdag8 message is rapidly degraded (Fig. 1F). The TDAG8 Agonist Psychosine Markedly Enhances Glucocorticoid-induced Apoptosis—The work of Im et al. (40Im D.S. Heise C.E. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. Lynch K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the glycosphingolipid psychosine is a nonselective agonist of TDAG8. The induction of TDAG8 in multiple models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and the ability of TDAG8 to induce apoptosis suggested that agonists of TDAG8 ought to induce apoptosis in glucocorticoid-treated cells. To investigate this hypothesis, WEHI7.2 cells were treated with dexamethasone for 16 h to elevate TDAG8 expression. Psychosine was then added to these cultures and incubated for an additional eight hours, after which the cells were harvested to measure apoptosis. At doses consistent with the EC50 value for TDAG8 activation (40Im D.S. Heise C.E. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. Lynch K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), psychosine markedly enhanced dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, as determined by DNA fragmentation and caspase activation (Fig. 2, A and B).

However, its exact function in this process remains largely unknown. Here, we report a detailed biochemical/biophysical characterization of His-tagged MoFe proteins purified from A. vinelandii nifZ and nifZ/nifB deletion strains DJ1182 and YM6A (ΔnifZ and ΔnifZΔnifB MoFe proteins, respectively). Our data from EPR, metal, activity, and stability analyses indicate that one αβ subunit pair of the ΔnifZ MoFe protein contains a P cluster ([8Fe-7S]) and an iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) ([Mo-7Fe-9S-X-homocitrate]), whereas the other contains a presumed P cluster precursor, possibly comprising a pair of [4Fe-4S]-like clusters, and a vacant FeMoco site. Likewise, the ΔnifZΔnifB MoFe protein has the same composition as the ΔnifZ MoFe protein except for the absence of FeMoco, an effect caused by the deletion of the nifB gene. These results suggest that the MoFe protein is likely assembled stepwise, i.e. one αβ subunit pair of the tetrameric MoFe protein is assembled prior to the other, and that NifZ might act as a chaperone in the assembly of the second αβ subunit pair by facilitating a conformational rearrangement that is required for the formation of the P cluster through the condensation of two [4Fe-4S]-like clusters. The possibility of NifZ exercising its effect through the Fe protein was ruled out because the Fe proteins from nifZ and nifZ/nifB deletion strains are not defective in their normal functions. However, the detailed mechanism of how NifZ carries out its exact function in MoFe protein maturation awaits further investigation.

The biochemical machinery for the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia is provided by the metalloenzyme nitrogenase. This enzyme comprises two separately purifiable proteins, the MoFe (molybdenum-iron) protein and the Fe (iron) protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem.

They are the molybdenum nitrogenase, the vanadium nitrogenase, the iron-only nitrogenase, and the nitrogenase from Streptomyces thermoautotrophicus. The major distinctive feature of the first three classes of nitrogenases, which are otherwise very similar, is the heterometal atom in the active site of the metal cluster (molybdenum, vanadium, or iron, respectively). The fourth nitrogenase is superoxide-dependent and apparently different from the other nitrogenase classes (8Ribbe M. Gadkari D. Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26627-26633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The molybdenum nitrogenase discussed herein is considered to be the “conventional” nitrogenase. The biosynthesis of the component proteins of molybdenum nitrogenase and their containing metalloclusters is controlled by the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes (reviewed in Refs. 9Dean D.R. Jacobson M.R. Stacey G. Burris R.H. Evan H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 763-834Google Scholar–13Dos Santos P.C. Dean D.R. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The Fe protein is a 60-kDa dimer of two identical subunits encoded by the nifH gene. Each subunit of the Fe protein contains a binding site for MgATP, and the two subunits are bridged by a single [4Fe-4S] cluster. The more complicated MoFe protein is an α2β2 tetramer of ∼230 kDa, and its α and β subunits are encoded by the nifD and nifK genes, respectively. The MoFe protein contains two different types of unique metal clusters, i.e. the P cluster ([8Fe-7S]), which is bridged between each αβ subunit pair, and the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) 2The abbreviations used are: FeMoco, iron-molybdenum cofactor; Av, A. vinelandii; IDS, indigo disulfonate.

Science. 2002; 297: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). which is located within each α subunit. The substrate reduction activity of nitrogenase requires the participation of both component proteins, with the Fe protein serving as an obligate electron donor to the MoFe protein, which in turn provides the site of substrate reduction. The reduced Fe protein first binds two molecules of MgATP and undergoes a conformational change before forming a complex with the MoFe protein. Then, coupled with the hydrolysis of MgATP, electrons are transferred from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein to the P cluster of the MoFe protein within the complex. This process is followed by complex dissociation, re-reduction of the oxidized Fe protein, and dissociation of MgADP, allowing the enzyme complex to start the next cycle of electron transfer. Finally, electrons are believed to be transferred from the P cluster to FeMoco, where substrate binding and reduction take place. The assembly of nitrogenase and, in particular, the MoFe protein and its two unique metalloclusters is arguably one of the most complicated processes in the field of bioinorganic chemistry (reviewed in Refs. 9Dean D.R.

It has been proposed that FeMoco biosynthesis starts with the mobilization of iron and sulfur and the assembly of Fe-S fragments that are subsequently transferred to NifB (nifB gene product), where the Fe-S core of FeMoco (designated NifB-co) is formed. NifB-co is then transferred to NifEN (nifE and nifN gene products), where it rearranges in a reaction that probably requires the Fe protein (nifH gene product). Molybdenum and homocitrate may or may not be inserted at this point, but they are attached prior to the insertion of FeMoco into a P cluster-containing but FeMoco-deficient form of the MoFe protein during the final maturation of the holo-MoFe protein. Such a form of MoFe protein was isolated from a nifB deletion strain of Azotobacter vinelandii (designated the ΔnifB MoFe protein). It can be directly activated by isolated FeMoco, indicating that the FeMoco-binding site in the ΔnifB MoFe protein is readily accessible for FeMoco insertion (22Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J.

This is consistent with the crystal structure of the ΔnifB MoFe protein, which is essentially unchanged from that of the wild-type protein except for the rearrangement of a domain presumed to facilitate the insertion of FeMoco into the accessible FeMoco-binding site in the MoFe protein (27Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Contrary to the progress that has been made regarding the biosynthesis and insertion of FeMoco, the assembly of the P cluster remains largely unknown. Recently, we were able to show that a MoFe protein isolated from a nifH deletion strain of A. vinelandii (designated the ΔnifH MoFe protein) does not contain a fully assembled P cluster; rather, it has a P cluster precursor that is composed of two [4Fe-4S]-like clusters (28Campbell M.

This is consistent with our earlier biochemical and spectroscopic studies indicating the presence of an “unusual” P cluster in this ΔnifH MoFe protein (29Ribbe M.W. Hu Y. Guo M. Schmid B. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23469-23476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies provide the first insights into the process of P cluster formation, which occurs likely by the condensation of two [4Fe-4S]-like fragments, possibly concomitant with Fe protein (nifH gene product)-induced conformational change (28Campbell M. Hu Y. Naderi F. Ribbe M.W. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28276-28282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although a number of components have been implicated in the complex assembly process of the MoFe protein and its clusters, more players are yet to be identified before a more accurate model of nitrogenase assembly can be established. It has been demonstrated that NifZ (nifZ gene product) is required for the expression of a fully functional MoFe protein in A. vinelandii (30Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Some earlier studies suggest that NifZ has some function related to formation of FeMoco or insertion of FeMoco into the immature MoFe protein (30Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), whereas more recent reports indicate that it might be involved in P cluster synthesis (31Wang D.Y. Wang Y.P. Huang J.F. Wang Z.P. Zhong Z.P. Li J.-G. Acta Bot. Sin. 1999; 41: 71-74Google Scholar, 32Huang J.F. Wang D.Y. Dong Z.G. Wang Z.P. Li J.-G. Wang Y.P. Acta Bot.

Here, we report a detailed biochemical/biophysical characterization of MoFe proteins expressed by the nifZ and nifZ/nifB deletion strains of A. vinelandii and the implication of these studies for the function of NifZ and the assembly mechanism of the MoFe protein.

Wild-type and variant strains of A. vinelandii were grown in 180-liter batches in a 200-liter New Brunswick fermentor in Burke's minimal medium supplemented with 2 mm ammonium acetate. The growth rate was measured by cell density at 436 nm using a Spectronic 20 Genesys (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, New York). After the consumption of the ammonia, the cells were de-repressed for 3 h, followed by harvesting using a flow-through centrifugal harvester (Cepa). The cell paste was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Published methods were followed for the purification of all Fe proteins (35Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

All EPR samples were prepared in a Vacuum Atmospheres dry box with an oxygen level of <4 ppm. Unless noted otherwise, all samples were in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm Na2S2O4. MoFe protein samples were oxidized by incubation with excess indigo disulfonate (IDS) for 30 min. Subsequently, IDS was removed by a single pass over an anion exchange column as described (37Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

Samples were either used as they were or concentrated in a Centricon-30 (Amicon, Inc.) in anaerobic centrifuge tubes outside of the dry box. All perpendicular and parallel mode EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300 Ez spectrophotometer interfaced with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. All spectra were recorded at 10 K using a microwave power of 50 milliwatts, a gain of 5 × 104, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 5 G. Microwave frequencies of 9.62 and 9.39 GHz were used for the perpendicular (10 scans) and parallel (20 scans) mode EPR spectra, respectively.

Rev. 1990; 90: 1377-1406Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 44Morningstar J.E. Hales B.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6854-6855Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The wild-type MoFe protein used in this study contains a complete cluster content based on metal analysis and activity measurements and can therefore be used as an internal standard for spin quantitation. This method has been used in earlier MoFe protein-related studies involving catalytic and structural investigations (36Ribbe M.W. Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

Quantitation numbers in this study represent the average of three independently purified protein batches and show an uncertainty of 2.9%. Spin quantitation of the g = 11.8 parallel mode EPR signal was performed using the wild-type MoFe protein as an internal standard. The wild-type MoFe protein has been successfully applied to earlier studies as a standard (22Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R.

It should be noted that the results of the spin quantitation of the MoFe protein variants (S = 3/2 perpendicular mode EPR signal and g = 11.8 parallel mode EPR signal) are also consistent with their specific activities determined elsewhere in this study. All nitrogenase activity assays (8.7-ml vials) were carried out as described previously (33Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys.

Two approaches were used to determine the stability of the purified MoFe proteins: gel filtration and heat treatment. For gel filtration, a total amount of 100 mg of purified MoFe protein (in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, and 2 mm Na2S2O4) was loaded onto an AcA34 gel filtration column (2.5 × 130 cm, 600-ml bed volume; ICF, Cedex, France) and chromatographed as described (29Ribbe M.W. Hu Y. Guo M. Schmid B. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23469-23476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For heat treatment, a total amount of 50 mg of purified MoFe protein (in the same buffer described above) was incubated in a crimped anaerobic vial (8.7-ml volume; 100% argon gas atmosphere) at 56 °C for 30 s. Precipitated protein was subsequently removed in both cases by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a Biofuge fresco (Heraeus) in a Vacuum Atmospheres dry box. The enzymatic activity of the MoFe protein after gel filtration and heat treatment was determined as described previously (33Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys.

The binding of the abundant extracellular matrix ligand fibronectin to integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 is known to depend upon the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif on the tenth fibronectin FIII domain. The adjacent ninth FIII domain provides a synergistic effect on RGD-mediated integrin α5β1 binding and downstream function. The precise molecular basis of this synergy remains elusive. Here we have dissected further the function of FIII9 in integrin binding by analyzing the biological activity of the FIII9-10 interdomain interface variants and by determining their structural and dynamic properties in solution. We demonstrate that the contribution of FIII9 to both α5β1 and αvβ3 binding and downstream function critically depends upon the interdomain tilt between the FIII9 and FIII10 domains. Our data suggest that modulation of integrin binding by FIII9 may arise in part from its steric properties that determine accessibility of the RGD motif. These findings have wider implications for mechanisms of integrin-ligand binding in the physiological context.

These findings have wider implications for mechanisms of integrin-ligand binding in the physiological context. The interaction of the abundant extracellular matrix molecule fibronectin with the integrin family of cell surface receptors mediates wide-ranging biological processes, including cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Integrin-fibronectin interactions thus have a fundamental role in tissue development and homeostasis, and integrin receptor agonism and antagonism are implicated in the etiology of a number of diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. However, the precise molecular bases of integrin-fibronectin interactions required for downstream biological function are not understood. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors comprising one α and one β subunit. So far, 18 α and 8 β subunits have been identified, but the potential to form functional dimers is restricted. Some integrin subunits, notably αv and β1, are more promiscuous than others, such as α5, in the selection of subunits with which they can dimerize. Similarly, some integrins, such as αvβ3, can bind to more than a dozen different ligands including fibronectin, whereas the ligand repertoire of others, such as α5β1, is much more limited. Fibronectin is a large dimeric glycoprotein (∼220 kDa) and is almost exclusively composed of repeating units falling into three structurally distinct categories, named type I (FI), type II (FII), and type III (FIII) domains. The central portion of the molecule contains a pair of FIII domains, designated FIII9 and FIII10, which constitute the best studied and most versatile integrin-binding region. The tripeptide adhesion motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) resides on a surface loop in FIII10 and is the essential recognition site for at least 11 integrins. The adjacent FIII9 domain provides synergistic enhancement of binding to and signaling through several RGD-dependent integrins, including α5β1 (1Obara M. Yoshizato K. Exp.

Numerous studies of the interactions of the FIII9-10 pair with integrins have demonstrated the functional importance of specific synergistic residues or sequences, notably the PHSRN motif, within FIII9 (2Altroff H.

The most obvious is a direct contribution from FIII9 to integrin binding (8Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Solution x-ray scattering and mutagenesis studies performed recently suggest the existence of direct interactions between FIII9 and the integrin α5 subunit (10Mould A.P. Symonds E.J. Buckley P.A. Grossmann J.G. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Bella J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39993-39999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, in a second study, electron micrographs did not reveal significant FIII9-integrin contact (11Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recent data from this laboratory suggest that the FIII9 domain can modulate binding via less specific, conformational effects affecting global domain stability (2Altroff H. Choulier L. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, partial structural uncoupling of FIII9 and FIII10 by the extension of the linker at the FIII9-10 interface leads to loss of synergistic function (12Grant R.P. Spitzfaden C. Altroff H. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6159-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating a requirement for adequate interdomain contact for receptor binding. Although flexibility of the FIII9-10 linkage has been implicated in large scale conformational changes in native fibronectin (13Johnson K.J. Sage H. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15473-15479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence to support this, and the potential biological consequences of such structural changes are not known. Here we explore the possibility that modulation of the interdomain tilt between FIII9 and FIII10 may affect the domain pair's integrin binding and downstream biological activity. Our aim is to gain further structural insight into the mechanism of integrin recognition by fibronectin. Construction and Expression of FIII Variants—Wild-type FIII9-10 and FIII10 clones were obtained by inserting the respective DNA fragments, amplified from the pGEX2T-FIII9-10 construct (14Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and digested with NheI/HindIII, into the corresponding sites in the pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen). Creation of the FIII9-10 construct incorporating a Leu1408 to Pro mutation (designated here as FIII9′10) has been described previously (15van der Walle C.F. Altroff H. Mardon H.J. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further amino acid substitutions, Ala1340/Val1442 to Cys/Cys, were introduced into the latter construct according to the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene), resulting in mutant FIII9′10-CC. All FIII variants were expressed as His tag proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega) and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen). Isotopically labeled proteins were produced using modified M9 medium containing 5 g/liter 15NH4Cl and/or 2 g/liter uniformly labeled [13C]glucose (CK Gas Products). Purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The single disulfide bond present in the oxidized form of mutant FIII9′10-CC was reduced either by adding dithiothreitol at 100-400 times molar excess (for NMR and equilibrium unfolding experiments) or by alkylation with iodoacetamide (for cell adhesion and solid-phase assays). The oxidation state of mutant FIII9′10-CC was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Integrin α5β1 used in solid-phase binding assays was purified from human placenta as specified elsewhere (3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R.

Purification of αvβ3 was performed in a similar manner using antibody clone HB11029 raised against the αvβ3 heterodimer. Binding of soluble FIII constructs to immobilized integrin was performed in the presence of divalent cations Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ as described earlier (3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J.

Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression as described (3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol.

(dose-response graphs) or the means + CI95% (bar graphs) of at least two independent determinations. Cell Adhesion Assays—Cell attachment and spreading assays with plate-bound recombinant proteins were performed using baby hamster kidney (BHK) 1The abbreviations used are: BHK, baby hamster kidney; GdnHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. fibroblasts as detailed elsewhere (14Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The data presented are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent duplicate or triplicate determinations. Equilibrium Unfolding Studies—Equilibrium chemical denaturation assays were carried out on FIII proteins incubated in the presence of 0 to ∼8 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, as described earlier (3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F.

The data obtained were fitted for a two-state unfolding mechanism (16Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1997: 299-321Google Scholar). The error bars represent CI95%. NMR Sample Preparation—All NMR samples were prepared from freeze-dried 15N-labeled protein in a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer in 95/5% H2O/D2O. The pH was adjusted to 4.8 by the addition of HCl. 4% polyacrylamide gels with 3% cross-linking were prepared (17Sass H.J. Musco G. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 18Ishii Y. Markus M.A. Tycko R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and radially compressed by an axial ratio of 1.45 using a custom-made device (19Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NMR Experiments—All NMR experiments were performed at 25, 30, or 35 °C on spectrometers operating at 1H frequencies of 600 and 750 MHz with triple-resonance triaxial gradient probes. Experiments used gradient-enhanced coherence selection (20Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) and water flip-back (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) wherever possible. For backbone assignment of FIII9′10, three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (22Kay L.E. Marion D. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 72-84Google Scholar) and TOCSY-HSQC (23Driscoll P.C. Clore G.M. Marion D. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3542-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) spectra with mixing times of 125 and 29.0 ms, respectively, and a TOCSY field strength of 11,900 Hz were recorded on a 1 mm sample at 600 MHz, as well as the three-dimensional triple-resonance experiments HNCA (24Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 496-514Google Scholar), HNCOCA (25Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar), and CBCACONH (26Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar) at 750 MHz. Hα, Hβ, and NH resonances were assigned using a combination of cross-peaks in the three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY and NOESY-HSQC spectra between Hα,Hβ to NH, and NH to NH resonances as well as through bond correlations between the Cα(i - 1) and Cα(i) observed in the HNCA and HNCACO. Characteristic Cα/Cβ shifts in the CBCACONH aided the identification of amino acids (27Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Initial assignments of NH and 15N resonances of the FIII9′10-CC mutant were derived from FIII9′10, and these were confirmed through Hα,Hβ to NH, and NH to NH cross-peaks in the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC. Heteronuclear [1H]15N NOE spectra were acquired on 1 mm samples at 30 °C and 600 MHz with acquisition times of 40.4 ms for 15N and 82 ms for 1H. 1H saturation in the NOE experiment was effected by means of a train of 225° flip-angle pulses at 10-ms intervals for 4.5 s. 15N-T1 and T2 relaxation time constants of 0.25 mm uniformly 15N-labeled samples were measured at 25 °C as described (28Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). For each sample a series of eight 1H-15N autocorrelation spectra with acquisition times of 91.1 ms for 15N and 82 ms for 1H was recorded. Transverse relaxation was measured using a spin-echo sequence with a CPMG delay of 285 μs. Relaxation delays varied between 40 ms and 1.2 s and between 4.5 and 136 ms for the T1 and T2 series, respectively. 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of 0.35 mm15N-labeled samples in stretched polyacrylamide gels (19Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were measured at 35 °C using the in-phase, anti-phase scheme (29Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) with acquisition times of 50.7 ms (15N) and 51 ms (1H). The reference 1H-15N scalar couplings in isotropic solution were recorded at 35 °C. The 1H-15N RDCs were obtained from the difference of the chemical shift of 15N resonances in the aligned and isotropic state. Errors were estimated to be 1.0 Hz for each of four measurements, resulting in a combined error of 2.0 Hz. NMR Data Analysis—All NMR data were processed with Felix 2.3 (Biosym Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) and analyzed with NMR-view5 (30Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Alignment tensors of the individual domains FIII9 and FIII10 for each of the three variants were obtained from the 1H-15N RDC data from residues with a [1H]15N NOE > 0.65 using the program MODULE (31Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and known x-ray coordinates (32Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Monte Carlo simulations were used for error estimation. MODULE was also used to perform rigid body reorientations of the domains around residue Ser1317 in the interdomain linker to obtain a best fit with the RDC data. Subsequently, the interdomain tilt and twist angles were calculated with mod22 (33Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the conserved Trp1347 and Trp1437 as a reference. Relaxation analysis and derivation of diffusion tensors was performed according to standard techniques (34Werner J.M. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 173: 285-300Google Scholar) using software written in house or the program TENSOR (35Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Experimental Strategy—In order to probe the role of interdomain orientation and flexibility in fibronectin function, we changed native domain-domain coupling by modifying the interface between FIII9 and FIII10, creating an extra interdomain covalent bond to restrict domain-domain mobility. The double cysteine mutant FIII9′10-CC harbors altered residues that are positioned on loops extending into the interdomain space from either side (Fig. 1). The mutant was engineered on a previously described modified FIII9-10 construct designated FIII9′10, which incorporates a Leu1408 → Pro substitution in FIII9 (Fig. 1) that confers better conformational stability and functional activity (15van der Walle C.F. Altroff H. Mardon H.J. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The variant proteins were assessed for stability, analyzed by NMR, and tested in functional assays of integrin binding and biological activity. Introduction of an Interdomain Disulfide Bridge in FIII9-10 Increases FIII9 Stability—Wild type and mutant FIII9-10 proteins were first assessed for their global thermodynamic stability by performing chemical equilibrium unfolding experiments with GdnHCl as a denaturant (Fig. 2). FIII9′10-CC was tested both in its oxidized, disulfide-linked form (FIII9′10-CCox) and in the reduced form (FIII9′10-CCred). All tested proteins, except for FIII9′10-CCox, follow a two-state unfolding mechanism characteristic of native FIII9-10 (3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D.

Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and have very similar unfolding parameters for the FIII10 domain, whose conformational stability is known to be largely independent of the presence of FIII9 (3Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a, inset, and Table I). Analysis of the effect of the interface mutations on the unfolding of FIII9, however, reveals that mutant FIII9′10-CC shows an increased stability both in its reduced and oxidized forms (Fig. 2). We note that the moderate stability increase seen with FIII9′10-CCred may partly arise from an incomplete reduction of the interdomain disulfide bridge by dithiothreitol. The observed stability-promoting effect is, however, greatly enhanced in FIII9′10-CCox, such that unfolding of FIII9 can no longer be separated from that of FIII10, and the two domains follow a single transition curve (Fig. 2a, inset). The values for FIII9 stability in the variants, expressed as the GdnHCl concentration leading to 50% domain unfolding ([GdnHCl]), are 2.33, 3.12, and 4.43 m for FIII9′10, FIII9′10-CCred, and FIII9′10-CCox, respectively (Fig. 2b and Table I). These findings indicate that the unfolding process is sensitive to amino acid changes in the interface region between FIII9 and FIII10 and provide further support to the notion that the interdomain contact surface within FIII9-10 is an important determinant of the thermodynamic properties of FIII9 (36Spitzfaden C.

Open table in a new tab Interdomain Disulfide Linkage Abolishes the Synergistic Cell Adhesion Activity of FIII9-10 and Reduces Its Affinity for Integrins α5β1 and αvβ3—The interface variants were next subjected to assays designed to quantify the impact of interdomain perturbations on function. Cell adhesion assays were performed with immobilized FIII9-10 proteins and BHK fibroblasts, which recognize fibronectin mainly via integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 (12Grant R.P. Spitzfaden C. Altroff H. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6159-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Integrin α5β1 accounts for most of the adhesion potential of BHK cells and is a major synergy-dependent receptor for fibronectin, whereas αvβ3 has been shown to bind the single FIII10 domain with high affinity and does not require FIII9 for full activity (5Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional activity of mutant FIII9′10-CCox was drastically reduced compared with FIII9′10 and was similar to that achieved with the single FIII10 domain (Fig. 3, a and b). This was the case both for cell attachment (Fig. 3a), a primary event of establishing integrin-dependent contact with the ligand, and the ensuing cell spreading (Fig. 3b), driven by extensive signaling and reorganization of the cytoskeletal architecture. In contrast, the adhesion-promoting ability of FIII9′10-CCred was indistinguishable from that of native FIII9-10 or FIII9′10 (Fig. 3, a and b). We further sought to complement our cell-based studies with solid-phase receptor binding assays. Dose-response data from experiments on the FIII9′10-CC interface mutant and purified integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 (Fig. 3, c-f) show that the disulfide-linked FIII9′10-CCox loses the synergistic activity of its parent protein FIII9′10 for binding to α5β1. It exhibits effectively the same receptor affinity as the isolated FIII10 domain and has an apparent Kd value ∼15-fold higher than that of FIII9′10 (Fig. 3, c and d). In contrast, FIII9′10-CCred has a substantially higher affinity for α5β1, although it does not reach the level of binding achieved by FIII9′10 (Fig. 3, c and d). The FIII9′10-CCox variant also exhibits a markedly reduced affinity for integrin αvβ3, as compared with FIII9′10 (the apparent Kd is ∼5-fold higher), whereas both FIII9′10-CCred and the single FIII10 domain bind αvβ3 with an affinity similar to that of FIII9′10 (Fig. 3, e and f). These solid-phase observations are thus in general agreement with the cell adhesion data. Our findings show that improved conformational stability of FIII9, as seen with mutant FIII9′10-CC, does not necessarily correlate with its synergistic biological activity. This prompted us to perform a detailed analysis of the structural basis of the loss of function of the disulfide-linked FIII9′10-CCox. The Interdomain Disulfide Bridge Reduces the Average Tilt Angle between FIII9 and FIII10—The structural integrity of FIII9′10 and FIII9′10-CC was confirmed by solution state NMR. The 1H-15N backbone resonances of the FIII9′10-CC mutant were characteristic of folded molecules and showed only small chemical shift changes with respect to the FIII9′10 variant (data not shown). Local and global changes in structure and dynamics were further determined using chemical shift perturbation, RDCs, and heteronuclear relaxation measurements. The chemical shift differences between FIII9′10 and FIII9′10-CC in the oxidized and reduced state are shown in Fig. 4. The only significant perturbations in both FIII9′10-CCox and FIII9′10-CCred with respect to FIII9′10 are restricted to the vicinity of the mutated residues (Fig. 4). This indicates that neither the introduction of this disulfide bond nor its reduction cause a significant structural change in the backbone structure of individual domains. This was expected because the disulfide bridge was designed to satisfy the distance and conformational constraints on the basis of crystal structure coordinates (32Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Changes in the orientations of the NH bond vectors of FIII9′10 and the FIII9′10-CC variants were determined from the measurements of RDCs of NH bond vectors in two different alignment media. The results for the polyacrylamide medium are shown in Table II and illustrated in Fig. 5. The bicelle medium yields similar data (not shown). RDCs are very sensitive to angular reorientations of a particular bond or molecular fragment with respect to the molecular frame and are therefore well suited to investigate domain-domain orientations in solution. The RDCs of each domain in each variant were used to determine the alignment tensor of each domain individually. Subsequently, the domains of each construct were reoriented with respect to each other such that the individual alignment tensors coincided. There is good agreement between the RDC data and the values calculated from the x-ray structure (32Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), as shown by the quality factors, Q, in Table II, for the individual domains in all three FIII9-10 proteins. These values are typical for protein structures with a resolution of about 2 Å (37Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar).

This enzyme catalyzes ATP-dependent ligation of l-glutamate and l-cysteine to form γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine, which undergoes another ATP-dependent ligation with glycine catalyzed by glutathione synthetase to form the final GSH product (1Griffith O.W.

GCL is a heterodimer, composed of a light regulatory subunit as well as a heavy catalytic subunit. Although both are required for optimal enzyme activity, overexpression of the catalytic subunit GCLC alone is sufficient to increase enzyme activity significantly over control levels (1Griffith O.W.

The regulation of GCL expression and activity has been studied in many other cell types, including mesangial and endothelial cells, but not the pancreatic islet. Long term exposure to high glucose levels decreases GCL expression in mesangial, retinal Muller, and endothelial cells, which results in a decrease in GSH levels (3Urata Y. Yamamoto H. Goto S.

That the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus involves interactions with IL-1β and oxidative stress secondary to chronic hyperglycemia (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have reported that prolonged hyperglycemia or shorter exposure to ribose, a stronger reducing sugar, stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pancreatic islets (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and causes beta cell dysfunction. These excessive increases in intraislet ROS levels cause decreases in insulin mRNA levels, insulin content, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. GSH plays a central role in the endogenous cellular response against oxidative stress by acting directly as an antioxidant to reduce reactive oxygen species and as a substrate for the antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (1Griffith O.W.

We have reported that the adverse effects of excessive intraislet ROS can be prevented by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and by overexpression of glutathione peroxidase (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).

These observations are clinically relevant because decreases in GSH levels or the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) measured in the red blood cells of type 2 diabetic patients correlate with worsening of the diabetic state (11Murakami K.

The studies described here were designed to establish whether GCLC is normally expressed in the islet and to determine whether adenoviral overexpression of GCLC in pancreatic islets prevents beta cell dysfunction caused by oxidative stress. Using interleukin-1β as an inducer of oxidative stress, we examined 1) the level of GCLC expression in control islets and islets exposed to IL-1β, as well as the consequences of IL-1β-dependent changes in GCLC on ROS production, intraislet GSH levels, and insulin secretion; 2) whether IL-1β effects on GCLC gene expression depend on p38 MAPK and NFκB activation; and 3) whether adenoviral overexpression of GCLC increases intraislet levels of GSH and mitigates the adverse effects of IL-1β-induced oxidative stress on glucose-induced insulin secretion. Materials—Adenovirus and antibodies for GCLC were obtained from the Department of Pathology and the NIEHS (National Institutes of Health) Center of Ecogenetics and Environmental Health, Department of Environmental Health at the University of Washington, Seattle. RT-PCR probes, primers, and reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Isolation and Culture of Wistar Rat Islets—Islets from the pancreata of male Wistar rats were isolated and cultured as described previously (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Tran P.O. T Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol.

Measurements of Intracellular ROS Levels—Intracellular levels of ROS were detected by flow cytometric analysis using a fluoresceinlabeled dye, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously by our laboratory (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The acetoxymethyl ester derivative readily permeates cell membranes and is trapped within the cell upon cleavage by esterases. Oxidation by reactive oxygen species converts the dye from its nonfluorescent to its fluorescent form. Briefly, islets were cultured with 4 μm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation with the dye, cells and islets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to prevent measurement of any extracellular reaction between the dye and H2O2 released by the cells into the medium. Islets were then dispersed using trypsin, and intracellular peroxide levels were measured with the EPICS® XL-MCL flow cytometer controlled by the System II software (Beckman-Coulter). Results were calculated as -fold difference from control untreated islets. GCLC Adenovirus Infection—Adenovirus encoding human GCLC was obtained from the Department of Pathology at the University of Washington. Propagation of the adenovirus was performed as described by Franklin et al. (15Franklin C.C. Krejsa C.M. Pierce R.H. White C.C. Fausto N. Kavanagh T.J. Am. J.

Isolated rat islets were cultured in the presence of adenovirus (at a final concentration of 107 plaque-forming units/islet) in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h at 37 °C. Ascertainment of adenoviral penetration into beta cells within the core of the islet was performed by infection with virus encoding green fluorescent protein, insulin immunostaining, and detection via confocal microscopy (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Beta cell toxicity of the adenovirus encoding GCLC was assessed by determining glucose-induced insulin secretion after infection with various concentrations of virus. Real Time Fluorescence-based RT-PCR Analysis of GCLC Expression Levels—Total RNA was extracted from rat islets, and one-step RT-PCR was carried out using the Gold RT-PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence detector equipped with a thermocycler (Taqman™ technology) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera to detect fluorescence emission over a range of wavelengths (500–650 nm) as described previously by our laboratory (14Tran P.O.

Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Western Analysis of GCLC Protein Levels—Total protein was collected from islets following incubation under different experimental conditions using cell lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol along with protease inhibitors. A total of 30 μg of protein was run on SDSPAGE, and immunoblotting was performed according to the standard protocol. In addition to measuring the protein levels of GCLC, Western analysis was also performed to detect the protein levels of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3 kinase or α-tubulin to correct for protein loading. Protein levels were analyzed using the Optiquant analysis program (Packard Instrument Co.). GSH/GSSG Measurements in Rat Islets—The levels of GSH and GSSG were measured in isolated rat islets using the GSH/GSSG 412 kit (Oxis Research, Portland, OR). After incubation under experimental conditions, islets were collected and washed once with potassium phosphate buffer. Islets were divided equally into samples for GSH and GSSG measurements in an assay kit buffer and analyzed per the manufacturer's instructions. Insulin Secretion Studies—Following incubation under experimental conditions, islets were placed into static incubation wells containing Krebs-Ringer buffer with either 2.8 mm glucose or 16.7 mm glucose. Insulin levels in the Krebs-Ringer buffer samples collected from the 1-h static incubations were measured by using a sensitive rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO). Expression of Data and Statistics—Data are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post-hoc test when appropriate with p < 0.05 considered as significant. GCLC Expression Level and IL-β Regulation of GCLC Expression, GSH/GSSG Ratios, and Intraislet ROS Levels—The expression level of GCLC mRNA in pancreatic islets was less than that found in kidney and liver, and greater than that observed in lung, subcutaneous fat, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). Western analysis for GCLC protein was generally in agreement except that lung content was greater than islet content (Fig. 1B). Effect of IL-1β on GCLC Gene Expression and Its Dependence on p38 MAPK and NFκB Interaction—IL-1β (10 ng/ml) increased GCLC expression (Fig. 2A) as well as GSH levels (Table I) and ROS levels (Fig. 3). Co-incubation with 1 μm SB203580, which prevents activation of the p38 form of MAPK, inhibited IL-1β-induced increases in GCLC expression (Fig. 2A). IL-1β (10 ng/ml) decreased cytosolic levels of the p50 form of NFκB, indicating dissociation of the NFκB·IκB complex and translocation of active NFκB into the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Cytosolic levels of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3 kinase used as a control did not change significantly from control following treatment with IL-1β. Western analysis for GCLC protein/α-tubulin in three experiments revealed the following levels: control, 0.79 ± 0.11; IL-1β, 0.87 ± 0.04; SB203580, 1.29 ± 0.01; and IL-1β + SB203580, 0.95 ± 0.16; mean ± S.E., density light units.

Islets were infected overnight with adenovirus at various concentrations to determine the optimal viral concentration to use. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was used to evaluate potential toxicity of the infection. Infection with adenovirus up to a concentration of 107 plaque-forming units/islet did not adversely affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 4) or the morphology of the islet as determined by light microscopy. Protein expression levels of GCLC by Western blot analysis were significantly increased in islets infected with the adenovirus encoding for GCLC (Fig. 4). Overexpression of GCLC increased overall activity of GCLC as evidenced by an increase in the ratio of GSH/GSSG (Table II). Infection with the control adenovirus encoding the luciferase gene did not affect basal levels of GSH/GSSG nor did it affect IL-1β up-regulation of GSH (Table II). In these experiments, no differences were observed when comparing ROS levels in islets incubated or not incubated with adenovirus (control = 1.53 ± 0.46; AdV-luciferase = 1.53 ± 0.44; AdV-GCLC = 1.85 ± 0.54. However, incubation with IL-1β increased ROS levels over control (1.53 ± 0.44 versus 3.08 ± 0.36, n = 5, p < 0.02), and infection with AdV-GCLC partially prevented this response to IL-1β (3.08 ± 0.51 versus 2.62 ± 0.25, n = 6, p < 0.001). Similarly, incubation with AdV-luciferase did not affect the inhibitory action of IL-1β on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas AdV-GCLC partially prevented the IL-1β-dependent decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 5).Table IIEffect of GCLC overexpression on GSH/GSSG levelsConditionControlLucLuc + ILGCLCGSH13.46 ± 2.013.75 ± 2.716.53 ± 3.1ap < 0.05 compared with control.

These studies provide the first identification and semi-quantitative measurement of GCLC mRNA in the pancreatic islet. GCLC expression is intermediate in magnitude compared with other metabolic tissues, such as kidney and liver, a finding that contrasts to the small or nonexistent levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, hydrogen peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase found in the islet (1Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative expression levels of GCLC in liver, muscle, kidney, lung, and fat in our study compare favorably with those reported previously for these tissues analyzed by Northern blot analysis (18Gipp J.J. Bailey H.H. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We observed that IL-1β up-regulated GCLC expression via the p38 form of MAPK and NFκB activation. At the same time IL-1β increased intraislet ROS levels as well as GSH content in islets, thereby exerting both a positive and a negative effect on beta cell function. Adenoviral overexpression of GCLC substantially but not completely prevented the IL-1β-induced increase in ROS and the negative effects of IL-1β on glucose-induced insulin secretion. Regulation of GCLC expression and activity has been studied in other cell types including mesangial and endothelial cells. Exposure of endothelial cells to high glucose conditions decreases GCL activity significantly from that found in cells cultured under low glucose conditions (3Urata Y. Yamamoto H. Goto S. Tsushima H. Akazawa S. Yamashita S. Nagataki S. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15146-15152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cytokines increase GCLC expression and activity in endothelial cells, and this response is inhibited by prior long term exposure to high glucose conditions (3Urata Y. Yamamoto H. Goto S. Tsushima H. Akazawa S. Yamashita S. Nagataki S. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15146-15152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The latter finding is similar to the effect of IL-1β up-regulation of GCLC expression that we observed. Long term exposure to high glucose conditions decreases GCLC expression in mesangial as well as retinal Muller cells resulting in a decrease in GSH levels (4Lu S.C. Bao Y. Huang Z.Z. Sarthy V.P. Kannan R. Investig. Ophthamol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1776-1782PubMed Google Scholar, 5Catherwood M.A. Powell L.A. Anderson P. McMaster D. Sharpe P.C. Trimble E.R. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 599-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Decreased GSH levels in erythrocytes from hyperglycemic type 2 diabetics are also accompanied by a decrease in GCLC activity (13Yoshida K. Hirokawa J. Tagami S. Kawakami Y. Urata Y. Kondo T. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). IL-1β has a well established role as an inducer of chronic inflammation. Increases in islet IL-1β during the development of diabetes in an animal model have been reported (7, Maedler, K., Sergeev, P., Ris, F., Oberholzer J., Joller-Jemelka, H. I., Spinas, G. A., Kaiser, N., Halban, P. A., and Donath, M.Y. J. Clin. Investig. 110, 851–860H. I.Google Scholar). We reported that specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE2 production prevent IL-1β from inhibiting glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated islets (14Tran P.O. T Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the effect of IL-1β that inhibits insulin secretion via ROS formation we identified in the current study appears to be independent from PGE2 production because PGE2 did not increase ROS levels. The effect of IL-1β that is mediated by PGE2 to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion may be more potent than the corresponding ROS-mediated effect of IL-1β because GCLC overexpression only partially prevented the IL-1β inhibitory effect on insulin secretion, whereas treatment with specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors completely prevented IL-1β-induced inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion (14Tran P.O. T Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that ROS production caused by exposing islets to IL-1β modulates glucose-induced insulin secretion downward and that the level of endogenous GCLC serves to act as a brake on this modulation by virtue of its ability to increase GSH and decrease intraislet ROS levels (Fig. 6). The clinical implications of our findings relate to the potential participation of oxidants in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. In type 1 diabetes IL-1β is generally regarded as playing an important role in beta cell destruction. In type 2 diabetes chronic exposure to high glucose levels is accompanied by oxidative stress and appears to contribute to the ongoing decline in beta cell function (21Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42351-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). That high glucose levels favor production of IL-1β within pancreatic islets (7, Maedler, K., Sergeev, P., Ris, F., Oberholzer J., Joller-Jemelka, H. I., Spinas, G. A., Kaiser, N., Halban, P. A., and Donath, M.Y. J. Clin. Investig. 110, 851–860H. I.Google Scholar) suggests the hypothesis that the cumulative effects of chronic hyperglycemia and local cytokine production may contribute to ongoing destruction of beta cells in both forms of diabetes. Our previous report of the protective effects of glutathione peroxidase overexpression (6Tanaka Y. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and the beneficial effects of GCLC overexpression that we now report suggest that enhancing endogenous islet antioxidant enzyme activity may offer a therapeutic strategy for protection against ongoing beta cell damage secondary to oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus.

The strongest Nurr1 inducers were activators of cAMP-protein kinase A-coupled signaling, followed by protein kinase C- and calcium-coupled signaling activators. Receptor tyrosine kinase activators had minimal effect, whereas serine/threonine kinase activators had no effect on basal Nurr1 mRNA levels.

In addition to osteoblasts, the precursor cell gives rise to chondroblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, and marrow stromal cells. Differentiation along any of these lineages is determined by expression of cell type- and stage-specific markers.

As a monomer, Nurr1 binds to an extended hormone response element (5′-AAAGGTCA-3′) referred to as an NGFI-B response element (NBRE) (23Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J.

Interestingly, the downstream NBRE-like site maps entirely within the previously identified cAMP-responsive region (26Towler D. Rodan G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to hypothesize that Nurr1 regulates Ocn gene expression in osteoblasts through direct binding and transactivation as a monomer. Here we demonstrate that multiple signaling activators important in osteoblast differentiation and function induced Nurr1 expression. Using chimeric and endogenous sequences, we show that monomeric Nurr1 bound to and transactivated NBRE-containing promoters. Importantly, Nurr1 induced Ocn mRNA levels in osteoblasts via direct binding to and transactivation of the NBRE-like site in the proximal promoter. Taken together with previous data, we conclude that Ocn is a Nurr1 target gene in osteoblasts.

Fluprostenol was purchased from Caymen Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Cell Culture—Primary mouse osteoblasts (MOBs) were collected from 6- to 8-day-old CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and were maintained as previously described (13Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Primary rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) were isolated from E18–E19 Sprague-Dawley fetuses (Charles River Laboratories). Briefly, calvariae were minced, digested five times in collagenase/trypsin-EDTA solution (100 mg of collagenase in 50 ml of 0.125% trypsin-EDTA) for 20 min (min) on a rocker platform at 37 °C/5% CO2. Digest 1 was discarded, and digests 2–5 were pooled for use in experiments. Culture conditions for each experiment are described below. Animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Office for Protection of Research Subjects at UCLA. Reporter and Expression Constructs—Synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) for the consensus WT3×NBRE (5′-CGCGGATCCAAAAGGTCACGGGATCTCGAAAAGGTCACGGGATCTCGAAAAGGTCAGGATCCGCG-3′) were cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pTATA-LUC vector (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Rat Ocn promoter-luciferase (luc) constructs were the kind gift of Dr. Jane Lian (University of Massachusetts). Nurr1 expression constructs were the kind gift of Dr. Astar Winoto (University of California at Berkeley). Transient Transfections—MOBs were plated at 100,000 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) and were transfected when 80–90% confluent using LipofectAMINE and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). For each reaction, a total of 0.36 μg of DNA (promoter-luc reporter with or without Nurr1 expression with or without empty pcDNA3.1(–) vectors) was transfected per well according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was assayed after 24–48 h using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI), normalized, and reported as percent control. Each experiment was repeated 5–18 times. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Recombinant proteins and nuclear extracts from MOBs were as previously described (27Ozkurt I.C. Tetradis S. J. Biol.

The rOCN(–120/–103) probe sequence was 5′-GGGTTTGACCTATTGCG-3′. The mutated rOCN(–120/–103) probe sequence was 5′-GGGTTTaACCcATTGCG-3′. Supershifts were performed using Nurr1 (sc-990x), RXRα (sc-553x), RXRβ (sc-831x), and E4bp4 (sc-9549x) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). E4bp4 antibody was used as a nonspecific antibody, and it failed to supershift protein complexes. Nurr1 and LacZ Adenoviruses—The AdEasy™ Adenoviral Vector System (Invitrogen) was used to construct adenoviruses expressing Nurr1 or LacZ proteins according to the manufacturer's protocol. ROBs were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The following day, the cells were transduced with 100 Nurr1-expressing virions/cell in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Experiments utilizing LacZ adenovirus and the same protocol demonstrated more than 90% transduction of the cells (data not shown). Two days after transduction, total RNA and nuclear extracts were collected for use for real-time PCR and EMSAs. Real-time PCR—One microliter (1.5 ng) of reverse transcribed product was amplified with iQ SYBR Green master mix (Bio-Rad) and gene-specific primers using the iCycler System and iCycler iQ Optical System software (Bio-Rad). The primers used were: mouse Nurr1 (accession number U86783) forward primer 5′-GATGAGTGGAGATGATACCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAGGTCAGCAAACGGAGGGA-3′; mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (accession number NM008084) forward primer 5′-ATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTGTCAGCAATGCATCCTG-3′; rat Ocn (accession number M23627) forward primer 5′-GCACCACCGTTTAGGGCAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGAGAGGGAACAGGGAG-3′; rat β actin (accession number NM 031144) forward primer 5′-TGGTGGGTATGGGTCAGAAGGA-3′and reverse primer 5′-TGGGTCATCTTTTCACGGTTGG-3′. The amplification program was set for 1 cycle of 95 °C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 20 s; and 72 °C, 30 s. Nurr1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were amplified simultaneously from samples and standards. Likewise, Ocn and β-actin were simultaneously amplified from standards and samples. Relative Nurr1 and Ocn induction was determined by the 2–ΔΔCt method using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin, respectively, for normalization (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated three times. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were plated on culture slides (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) at 5 × 104 cells/chamber in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Two days later cells were transduced with Nurr1-expressing adenovirus. Two days after transduction, medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were fixed in cold 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed in PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with Nurr1 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-990x) diluted 1:200 in 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-2004) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed with PBS and developed using 0.005% 3′3-diaminobenzidine/0.021% H2O2 solution in PBS, pH 7.4. Cells were washed in PBS, rinsed through an increasing ethanol gradient, and immersed in xylene for 1 min. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Confluent ROB cells were transduced with adenoviruses as described above. Two days post-transduction, cells were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays utilizing the ChIP assay kit (Upstate) and the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link histones, were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and then were sonicated to shear DNA. DNA was recovered, and histone-DNA cross-links were reversed in an aliquot, which subsequently was used in PCR reactions to evaluate the amount of DNA present in various groups. The remaining DNA-histone complexes were used in immunoprecipitation reactions utilizing Nurr1 or E4bp4 primary antibodies (Santa Cruz) or a no primary antibody control and a Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate). Histone-DNA cross-links were reversed, and DNA was recovered and used in PCR reactions utilizing primers that bracket the proximal NBRE-like site in the osteocalcin promoter. The sequences of the primers that encompass the proximal NBRE-like element were –137/–120 5′-CCAACCACAGCATCCTTT-3′ and –2/–19 5′-GGACTTGTCTGTTCTGCA-3′ in the proximal rat Ocn promoter. Multiple Osteoblastic Regulators Induce Nurr1 Gene Expression—We have previously shown that PTH induces Nurr1 mRNA and protein expression in MOBs (13Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate whether other regulators of osteoblastic function control Nurr1 gene expression, MOBs were treated for 1 h with agonists that activate cAMP-PKA signaling (Fig. 1A), PKC and/or calcium signaling (Fig. 1B), ligands of tyrosine kinase surface receptors (Fig. 1C), or members of the TGFβ-BMP family (Fig. 1D). cAMP-PKA pathway agonists (10 μm forskolin (FSK), 10 nm PTH, 10 nm PTHrP, 1 μm PGE2) caused the strongest Nurr1 gene expression followed by PKC and/or calcium signaling activators (1 μm PMA, 1 μm ionomycin, 1 μm PGF2α, 1 μm fluprostenol) and receptor tyrosine kinase activators (10 ng/ml FGF, 1 ng/ml PDGF, 1 ng/ml TGFα, 10 ng/ml EGF). Serine/threonine agonists (10 ng/ml TGFβ, 100 ng/ml BMP-2, 100 ng/ml BMP-7) and the receptor tyrosine kinase activators IGF-I (10 nm) and insulin (1 μm, data not shown) did not affect Nurr1 gene expression. To further characterize Nurr1 induction in osteoblasts, we generated dose-response curves for the strongest agonists. Maximum Nurr1 mRNA levels were induced in MOBs following a 1-h treatment with 10 nm PTHrP (34.6-fold induction), 10 μm FSK (31.2-fold induction), 100 μm PGE2 (15.3-fold induction), 10 μm PMA (8.71-fold induction), 10 μm PGF2α (5.1-fold induction), and 1 μm fluprostenol (2.75-fold induction). The EC50 for Nurr1 induction by these agonists was 0.109 nm PTHrP (Fig. 2A), 116 nm FSK (Fig. 2B), 115 nm PGE2 (Fig. 2C), 7 nm PMA (Fig. 2D), and 11.9 nm fluprostenol (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, Nurr1 induction by PGF2α never reached a plateau but continued to increase at higher doses (Fig. 2E). PGF2α at high doses can cross-react and bind EP receptors to activate the cAMP-PKA pathway (29Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Bayne M.A. Metters K.M. Slipetz D.M. Grygorczyk R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3881-3886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the PGF2α induction of Nurr1 mRNA levels is probably not mediated through FP receptor but rather through EP receptor signaling. PTH-induced Nurr1 Protein Binds to and Transactivates a Consensus NBRE—After demonstrating the induction of Nurr1 gene expression through multiple signaling pathways in osteoblasts, we tested potential function of Nurr1 protein. Because cAMP-PKA agonists yielded the strongest Nurr1 expression and PTH is an endogenous hormone, we utilized PTH to induce endogenous Nurr1 protein synthesis in subsequent studies. We have previously shown that 10 nm PTH causes maximum induction of Nurr1 gene expression (13Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine if PTH-induced Nurr1 protein translocates to the nucleus and binds DNA target sequences, nuclear proteins from MOBs treated with 10 nm PTH for 0–6 h were utilized in EMSAs. PTH-inducible binding to a consensus WT NBRE probe peaked between 2 and 4 h (Fig. 3A). No binding to a mutated NBRE was detected. This binding was competed by a 50× WT unlabeled competitor. To determine if Nurr1 is part of this PTH-induced protein complex, supershift assay was performed on the same proteins. Nurr1-specific antibody supershifted the majority of the PTH-induced complex (Fig. 3B), whereas nonspecific antibody had no effect (data not shown). Having determined that Nurr1 is part of the PTH-inducible complex that binds to the WT NBRE, we next investigated if Nurr1 protein induces NBRE-containing promoters. MOBs were co-transfected with an empty vector or the Nurr1 expression vector and a chimeric WT 3×NBRE-luc construct. Nurr1 overexpression induced luciferase activity through the chimeric promoter (Fig. 3C). Nurr1-transactivated Rat Ocn Promoter Activity Requires the Proximal 199 bp—Having determined that PTH-induced Nurr1 protein bound to and transactivated an NBRE-containing promoter, we used computer analysis to identify osteoblastic genes with NBRE-containing promoters. The –1050 bp rat Ocn promoter has two sites with close homology (7/8 bp) to the consensus NBRE at nt –934/–927 and nt –115/–108. To determine whether Ocn is a potential Nurr1 target gene, we transiently co-transfected MOBs with the Nurr1 expression vector and luc-reporter constructs driven by 5′ serial deletions of the rat (–1050) Ocn promoter. Nurr1 overexpression maximally induced Ocn promoter activity in constructs containing nt –1050/–199 (Fig. 4). However, deletion to nt –138 attenuated, whereas further deletion to nt –83 abolished, Nurr1-induced Ocn promoter activity. Nurr1 Is Part of a PTH-induced Nuclear Protein Complex That Binds the Rat Ocn Proximal NBRE—Our transfection data suggested that both nt –199/–138 and nt –138/–83 are important for Nurr1-mediated Ocn promoter induction (Fig. 4). Interestingly, computer analysis revealed an NBRE-like sequence within nt –138/–83 (–115/–108, ATAGGTCA in the antisense strand) but not within nt –199/–138. To determine potential direct Nurr1-DNA interaction accounting for the reduced Nurr1-mediated transcription seen in the (–199)Ocn-luc and (–138)Ocn-luc constructs, we performed EMSAs utilizing recombinant Nurr1 or luc proteins and nt –199/–138 or nt –142/–83 as probes. Nurr1 protein strongly bound to the nt –142/–83 probe but did not bind to the nt –199/–138 probe (Fig. 5A). Recombinant luc protein was used as control. Because computer analysis revealed an NBRE-like sequence in the distal Ocn promoter at nt –934/–927, we performed EMSAs utilizing recombinant Nurr1 or PTH nuclear extracts and a probe corresponding to nt –942/–920 of the Ocn promoter. Neither recombinant Nurr1 nor PTH treated extracts bound to that site (data not shown). Because the nt –142/–83 probe contains the putative NBRE at nt –115/–108, we tested the ability of endogenous Nurr1 protein to bind to this site. Nuclear proteins from MOBs treated with 10 nm PTH for 0–6 h showed peak binding to the nt –120/–103 probe at 2 h. Furthermore, a 2-nt mutation in the –120/–103 probe eliminated PTH-induced Nurr1 protein binding (Fig. 5B). The PTH-induced binding completely supershifted with Nurr1 antibody, whereas a nonspecific antibody had no effect (Fig. 5C). To determine if Nurr1 binds to the NBRE-like sequence alone (17Sacchetti P. Dwornik H. Formstecher P. Rachez C. Lefebvre P. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1546-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we performed supershift experiments on nuclear proteins from MOBs treated with 10 nm PTH for 0–6 h utilizing the nt –130/–103 probe and Nurr1, RXRα or RXRβ antibodies. Similar to Fig. 3B, Nurr1 antibody completely supershifted PTH-induced binding. No supershift was seen when the RXR antibodies were used (Fig. 5D). The Proximal NBRE Is Critical for Nurr1- and PTH-induced Ocn Promoter Activity—To evaluate the importance of the proximal NBRE-like element in Nurr1-mediated Ocn promoter activity, we introduced the same 2-nt mutation that abolished endogenous Nurr1 protein binding to the (–1050)Ocn promoter-luc construct. MOBs transiently co-transfected with an empty or Nurr1-expressing vector and the WT or mut (–1050)Ocn-luc construct showed that Nurr1 transactivated the WT, but not the mut (–1050)Ocn-luc construct (Fig. 6). Adenovirally Expressed Nurr1 Protein Translocates to the Nucleus in Primary Osteoblasts and Recognizes a Consensus NBRE—To investigate the effect of Nurr1 in endogenous Ocn gene expression, we generated Nurr1-expressing adenovirus constructs. These viruses at an multiplicity of infection of 100:1 transduced Nurr1 expression in the nucleus of more than 90% of osteoblasts, detected by immunocytochemistry utilizing a Nurr1 antibody (Fig. 7A). Similar treatment of ROBs with a LacZ-expressing adenovirus yielded no change in immunocytochemistry staining compared with control (data not shown). Our data that recombinant and endogenous Nurr1 protein bound to and transactivated the rat Ocn promoter suggest that Ocn is a potential Nurr1 target gene in osteoblasts. To test this, we transduced ROBs with Nurr1- or LacZ-expressing adenovirus for 2 days. Non-transduced cells were also used as controls. EMSA demonstrates that nuclear proteins from Nurr1-transduced ROBs bound to a consensus NBRE (Fig. 7B). Nurr1 Protein Binds to the Endogenous Ocn Promoter in Vivo—Our transient transfection and EMSA studies above indicate that Nurr1 protein recognized the proximal NBRE-like element in the rat Ocn promoter. To examine whether Nurr1 protein can recognize the endogenous Ocn promoter, we transduced ROB cells with Nurr1-expressing adenovirus and performed ChIP assays. Adenovirally expressed Nurr1 protein bound to an area of the Ocn promoter that encompasses the proximal NBRE-like site in primary ROB cells (Fig. 7C). LacZ control protein did not recognize this site. Nurr1-expressing Adenovirus Induces Ocn mRNA Levels in Primary Fetal Rat Osteoblasts—To investigate whether Nurr1 binding to the endogenous Ocn promoter results in activation of Ocn gene expression, ROB cells were transduced with Nurr1 or LacZ adenoviruses. Non-transduced cells were also used as controls. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to real-time PCR. Nurr1 significantly induced mRNA levels compared with control. LacZ had no effect on Ocn mRNA expression compared with control. β-Actin expression was used to normalize the data (Fig. 7D). We have previously reported the PTH-induced expression of the nuclear orphan receptor Nurr1 in osteoblasts (13Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A.

However, the structural determinants of the RANK that mediate osteoclast formation and function have not been definitively identified. To address this issue, we developed a chimeric receptor approach that permits a structure/function study of the RANK cytoplasmic domain in osteoclasts. Using this approach, we examined the role of six RANK putative tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-binding motifs (PTM) (PTM1, ILLMT-REE286-293; PTM2, PSQPS349-353; PTM3, PFQEP369-373; PTM4, VYVSQTSQE537-545; PTM5, PVQEET559-564; and PTM6, PVQEQG604-609) in osteoclast formation and function. Our data revealed that the RANK cytoplasmic domain possesses three functional motifs (PFQEP369-373, PVQEET559-564, and PVQEQG604-609) capable of mediating osteoclast formation and function. Moreover, we demonstrated that these motifs play distinct roles in activating intracellular signaling. PFQEP369-373 initiates NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 signaling pathways and PVQEET559-564 activates NF-κB and p38 pathways in osteoclasts, whereas PVQEQG604-609 is only capable of activating NF-κB pathway.

In the present study, we characterized the RANK-initiated signaling in osteoclast differentiation and function in physiological cellular background by identifying the specific RANK motifs regulating osteoclast formation and function. To this end, we developed a chimeric receptor approach that allows us to carry out a detailed structure/function study of RANK cytoplasmic domain in osteoclast differentiation and function. Using this approach, we have identified three functional motifs that regulate osteoclast differentiation and function. In addition, we show that these domains mediate osteoclast differentiation and function by initiating the distinct signaling pathways. Our present work has established a direct functional link between specific RANK cytoplasmic motifs and a physiological process: osteoclast formation and function. Moreover, the identification of these functional RANK motifs has laid foundations for further delineating the downstream signaling pathways implicated in osteoclast formation and function. Chemicals and Reagents—The chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Blasticidin was from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Antibody against the external domain of mouse TNFR1 (for flow cytometry) (TNF-R1, sc-12746PE) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant mouse TNFα (410-TRNC-050) was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA): antibodies against IκBα (antibody 9242), phospho-IκBα (antibody 9241), p44/42ERK (antibody 9102), phospho-p44/42ERK (antibody 9101), JNK (antibody 9252), phospho-JNK (antibody 9251), p38 (antibody 9212), and phospho-p38 (antibody 9211). Construction of TNFR1/RANK Chimeric cDNA—Using the standard molecular cloning techniques, we engineered a chimeric cDNA comprising the mouse TNFR1 external domain (amino acids 1-210) linked in-frame to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse RANK (amino acids 210-625). cDNA fragment encoding the mouse TNFR1 external domain was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA isolated from mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and a pair of primers containing XbaI sites. The TNFR1 cDNA fragment was then subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the XbaI site, resulting in a plasmid named SK-TNFR1. cDNA encoding the RANK transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was also amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA from mouse BMMs with a forward primer containing the SpeI site and a reverse primer containing the BamHI site. The RANK cDNA fragment was then subcloned into SK-TNFR1 between SpeI and BamHI, giving rise to a plasmid named SK-TNFR1-RANK. The orientation and sequence of the chimeric cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. Preparation of Retrovirus Encoding the Chimeric Receptors—The retrovirus vector pMX-puro (21Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and the Plat-E packaging cells (22Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) were used. The chimeric cDNA (TNFR1-RANK) from SK-TNFR1-RANK was subcloned into pMX-puro to generate plasmid construct named pMX-puro-TNFR1-RANK. Plat-E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum as described in (22Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). pMX-puro-TNFR1-RANK was transiently transfected into Plat-E cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Virus supernatant was collected at 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection. Culturing and Infection of BMMs—Bone marrow cells were isolated from long bones of 4-8-week-old TNFR1-/-R2-/- double knockout mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) or wild-type mice (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN) as described (23Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K. Boyer M.I. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BMMs were prepared by culturing isolated bone marrow cells in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells for 2 days as previously described (24Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The cells were then infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells and 8 μg/ml polybrene. The cells were further cultured in the presence of M-CSF and 2 μg/ml puromycin for selection and expansion of transduced cells. The selected cells were subsequently used for various studies. In Vitro Osteoclastogenesis Assays and Bone Resorption Assay— Retrovirally infected BMMs were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (1×105 cells/well) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.01 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells (final M-CSF concentration is 22 ng/ml) and 100 ng of GST-RANKL (25Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). In osteoclastogenesis assays involving the use of the chimeric receptor, TNFα was added at the concentrations indicated in individual assays. Osteoclasts began to form on day 3, and cultures were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity on day 5 using a commercial kit (387-A; Sigma). To perform bone resorption assays, osteoclasts were generated on whale dentin slices from infected or uninfected BMMs as described above. Dentin slices were harvested at day 9. The cells were removed from the dentin slices with 0.25 m ammonium hydroxide and mechanical agitation. The dentin slices were then subjected to scanning electron microscopy as described in Ref. 26Greenfield E.M. Alvarez J.I. McLaurine E.A. Oursler M.J. Blair H.C. Osdoby P. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Infected BMMs (up to 1×106 cells) were suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/azide. The cells were then blocked with 1 μg of 2.4G2 antibody (27Unkeless J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar) for 30 min on ice. Under dim light, 20 μl of TNFR1 antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin (Santa Cruz; sc-12746PE) or control IgG was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline/azide and resuspended in 300 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline/azide. 200 μl of cold 0.5% paraformaldehyde solution was added to fix the cells. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a Becton-Dickinson FACSan (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA). Mutagenesis—Mutations were generated in SK-TNFR1-RANK using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To mutate the six putative TRAF-binding motifs (PTM), the following oligonucleotides were used: for PTM 1, 5-GTGTGTGAAGGTgTCgTAgTAtTGtCTCtGGAcGAcAAGATGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAACCATCTTGTCgTCCaGAGaCaATAcGAcACCTTCACACAC-3; for PTM2, 5′-GAGTACACGGACCGGCtCaCGaAGCtTaCGACTGGTTCACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTGAACCAGTCGtAaGGTtCGtGaGCCGGTCCGTGTACTC-3′; for PTM3, 5′-GCAAATCTATACCCCcATggaAcGAcCtCCTGGAAGTGGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCCACTTCCAGGaGgTCgTtccATaGGGGTATAGATTTGC-3′; for PTM4, GACATCATCGTGgTGTtTcTCAcCaActCCaCGaAcGAcGGCCCGGGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGAACCCGGGCCgTCgTtCGtGGagTtGgTGAgAaACAGcACGATGATGTC-3′; for PTM5, 5′-CCCGTGGGCCGCCtTcTGaAcGAcGActCGCTGGCACAC-3′ and 5′-GTGTGCCAGCGagTCgTCgTtCAgAaGGCGGCCCACGGG-3′; and for PTM6, 5′-GGGACATCGCGGCtGcTGaAcGAcaAcGcTGGGGCGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCGCCCCAgTtgTCgTtCAgCaGCCGCGATGTCCC-3′. The intended mutations are indicated by lowercase letters in these oligonucleotides. The mutated sites were confirmed by sequencing, and other regions in the chimeric cDNA were sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced by PCR amplification during the mutagenesis. The mutant chimeric cDNAs were then subcloned into pMX-puro plasmids as described above for virus preparation. Western Analysis—BMMs infected with retrovirus or control BMMs (uninfected) were cultured in serum-free α-minimal essential medium in the absence of M-CSF for 16 h before treatment with RANKL or TNFα for various times as indicated in individual experiments. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 1 (P-2850; Sigma) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 2 (P-5726; Sigma). 40 μg of cell lysates were boiled in the presence of SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) for 5 min and loaded for electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (catalog number 162-0147) from Bio-Rad using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T)) for1hto prevent nonspecific binding and then washed three times with TBS-T. The membranes were incubated primary antibodies in TBS-T containing 5% bovine albumin (Sigma catalog number A-7030) overnight at 4°C. Next day, the membranes were then washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. The membranes were washed extensively and ECL detection assay was performed using a SuperSignal West Dura kit from Pierce. Sequence Analysis—Sequence analysis was performed using the Genetic Computer Group (Madison, WI) sequence analysis software. Construction of a Chimeric Receptor Capable of Mediating Osteoclast Formation and Function—To delineate functional motifs in the RANK cytoplasmic domain mediating osteoclast differentiation and function, we developed a chimeric receptor consisting of mouse TNFR1 external domain (amino acids 1-210) linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse RANK (amino acids 210-625) (Fig. 1). Given that both TNFR1 and RANK belong to the same family of the cytokines and that they are both activated by trimerization (Fig. 1), we predicted that the TNFα-induced trimerization of the chimeric receptor would be sufficient to activate RANK intracellular signaling pathways required for the osteoclast formation and/or function (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the chimeric receptor is capable of mediating osteoclast formation and function, we expressed the chimeric receptor in primary BMMs using a retroviral system (23Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K. Boyer M.I. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Feng X. Takeshita S. Namba N. Wei S. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinol. 2002; 143: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Given that TNFα is also implicated in osteoclast formation and function, we used BMMs from TNFR1 and R2 double knockout mice (TNFR1-/-R2-/-) to eliminate any possibility of signaling through TNF receptors (29Peschon J.J. Torrance D.S. Stocking K.L. Glaccum M.B. Otten C. Willis C.R. Charrier K. Morrissey P.J. Ware C.B. Mohler K.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). BMMs derived from TNFR1-/-R2-/- mice were infected with the retrovirus encoding the chimeric receptor and the cells expressing the chimera were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 2 or 4 days. Flow cytometric analysis with antibody against the external domain of TNFR1 demonstrated not only that the chimera was expressed on the cell surface but also that the surface expression levels of the chimera were increased with the selection time (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the chimeric receptor is capable of mediating osteoclast differentiation, infected BMMs expressing the chimera were treated with M-CSF (22 ng/ml), M-CSF (22 ng/ml) plus RANKL (100 ng/ml), or M-CSF (22 ng/ml) plus TNFα (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 2B). Whereas infected BMMs treated with M-CSF alone remained in macrophage lineage, those treated with M-CSF and RANKL formed osteoclasts, indicating that the endogenous RANK in the infected cells is functional (Fig. 2B). Most importantly, when infected BMMs were treated with M-CSF and TNFα, they also formed osteoclasts, confirming that the chimeric receptor is working (Fig. 2B). As a negative control, uninfected BMMs failed to form osteoclasts in response to M-CSF and TNFα treatment (Fig. 2B). Notably, the infected cell culture treated with M-CSF alone also contained few TRAP-positive cells (Fig. 2B). This likely resulted from overexpression of the chimera in a few BMMs, because overexpression of TNFR family members can lead to the self-activation of their signaling pathways (30Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Functionally, these TRAP-positive cells may not be regarded as osteoclasts because the high power view of the culture indicates that they were still mononuclear. More importantly, as shown below in Fig. 2C, these TRAP-positive mononuclear cells failed to form any pits in the resorption assays. Thus, the formation of few TRAP-positive mononuclear cells in this culture will not undermine the potential of the chimera as a great tool to study RANK signaling. In Fig. 2B, we used TNFα at the concentration of 10 ng/ml. Our subsequent studies showed that lower TNFα concentrations (as low as 1 ng/ml) were still able to mediate osteoclast formation (data not shown). To examine whether osteoclasts generated using the chimera strategy are capable of resorbing bone, we performed bone resorption assays (Fig. 2C). Osteoclasts generated using the chimera approach resorbed bone as efficiently as those formed using the endogenous RANK (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data indicate that a chimera comprising TNFR1 external domain linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of RANK is able to mediate osteoclast formation and function, using TNFα as a surrogate of RANKL. This chimera can serve as a useful tool for studying RANK signaling in osteoclast differentiation and function. Multiple RANK Cytoplasmic Motifs Are Involved in Osteoclast Formation and Function—Next, we used the chimeric receptor approach to elucidate RANK cytoplasmic motifs that mediate osteoclast formation and function. Previously, several studies collectively suggested that the RANK cytoplasmic domain contains six PTMs that may be able to initiate RANK signaling: PTM1, ILLMTREE286-293 (17Wong B.R. Josien R.

All mutants retained immunoreactivity toward a polyclonal IGFBP-3 antibody, whereas IGF ligand blotting showed that all of the mutants had reduced binding to IGFs. Both solution IGF binding assays and BIAcore analysis indicated that mutations to the N-terminal region caused greater reduction in IGF binding activity than C-terminal mutations. The combined N- and C-terminal mutants showed undetectable binding to IGF-I but retained <10% IGF-II binding activity. Reduced ternary complex formation was seen only in mutants that had considerably reduced IGF-I binding, consistent with previous studies indicating that the binary IGF·IGFBP-3 complex is required for acid-labile subunit binding. Decreased IGF binding was also reflected in the inability of the mutants to inhibit IGF-I signaling in IGF receptor overexpressing cells. However, when present in excess, IGFBP-3 analogs defined as non-IGF-binding by biochemical assays could still inhibit IGF signaling.

Their cellular effects are tightly controlled by a group of structurally related IGF-binding proteins (IGF-BPs). Because IGFBPs have higher affinities for IGFs (KD = ∼10–10m) than does the type I IGF receptor (KD = ∼10–8–10–9m), it is believed that IGFBPs achieve their regulation of IGFs through high affinity binding (5Hwa V.

The stable IGF ternary complexes prolong the half-life of circulating IGFs and act as a reservoir for the delivery of IGFs to the target tissues (9Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1994; 1: 16-21Crossref Google Scholar, 10Gargosky S.E. Owens P.C. Walton P.E. Owens J.A. Robinson J.S. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Apart from its role as a modulator of IGF actions, IGFBP-3 has also been found to possess other cellular functions independently of IGFs (11Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E967-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar), proposed to be mediated through an IGFBP-3 receptor (13Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Leal S.M. Liu Q.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Based on sequence homology, all IGFBPs can be conceptually divided into three discrete domains: N-terminal, C-terminal, and central. There is a high degree of conservation in the N- and C-terminal domains, which are thought to be involved in IGF binding (11Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E967-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central domains, on the other hand, are unique in sequence among the six IGFBPs and are believed to serve as a hinge between the N- and C-terminal domains. Because most of the known posttranslational modifications (glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolysis) occur within the central domain, it is speculated that these modifications may participate in other diverse functions of IGFBPs (5Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Acta Paediatr. Suppl. 1999; 428: 37-45Crossref Google Scholar).Although the solution structures of both IGF-I and -II have been solved (15Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the full structures of IGFBPs have not been reported, thus hindering the understanding of the molecular interactions between IGFs and IGFBPs. In 1998, Kalus et al. (17Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) published a landmark paper on the solution structure of an IGFBP-5 N-terminal fragment, termed mini-IGFBP-5 (Ala40–Ile92), obtained by using NMR spectroscopy. It was revealed that mini-IGFBP-5 has a compact and globular three-dimensional structure that is uniquely folded. A single high affinity binding site for IGF-II was identified in mini-IGFBP-5 that comprises residues Val49, Tyr50, Pro62, and Lys68–Leu74. Several hydrophobic residues including Val49, Leu70, and Leu74 expose their side chain into solution to form a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the mini-IGFBP-5. Because Leu73 and Leu74 of IGFBP-5 are conserved in IGFBP-3, it was predicted that these residues in IGFBP-3 would be among the common determinants for IGF binding. Several subsequent mutagenesis studies on the N termini of IGFBP-3 and -5 have provided evidence to support the existence of the putative N-terminal binding site (18Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsen M. Bang P. Oh Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mutations of some of the implicated residues in the N termini led to greatly reduced IGF binding, supporting the existence of a major IGF-binding site in the N-terminal regions of IGFBPs.In contrast to the N-terminal region, the role of the C-terminal region of IGFBPs in IGF binding is less well defined. Bramani et al. (21Bramani S. Song H. Beattie J. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) previously reported that mutations at conserved residues Gly203 and Gln209 in the C-terminal region of rat IGFBP-5 decreased its binding to IGF-I. To further investigate the IGF binding function of these two residues, they combined mutations in both N- and C-termini and demonstrated a cumulative loss in the ability of the mutant to bind IGF-I (22Shand J.H. Beattie J. Song H. Phillips K. Kelly S.M. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17859-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, this study is inconsistent with previous reports that a total abolition of IGF binding could be demonstrated when mutations were made solely to the N terminus of IGFBP-3 (19Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsen M. Bang P. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or IGFBP-5 (18Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that the minimal IGF-binding site does not involve C-terminal residues. The involvement of C-terminal residues in the high affinity IGF-binding site of IGFBP-3 was recently reported by our laboratory. We showed that although discrete N-terminal (residues 1–88) and C-terminal (residues 185–264) fragments of IGFBP-3 bind IGFs separately, together they show cooperativity in the presence of IGFs to form high affinity binding complexes (23Payet L.D. Wang X.H. Baxter R.C. Firth S.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2797-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).To define the high affinity IGF-binding sites in IGFBP-3 and to clarify the role and relative contribution of N- and C-termini in IGF binding, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a set of IGFBP-3 proteins with mutations made to either the N terminus or the C terminus or both. Characterization of these IGFBP-3 mutants by various biochemical and functional assays has demonstrated the importance of both N- and C-terminal residues in regulating IGF binary and ternary complex formation and IGF receptor activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Recombinant human IGF-II was purchased from GroPep Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Human ALS was purified from serum as described previously (6Baxter R.C. Martin J.L.

Heparin Hi-Trap columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primers were synthesized by Invitrogen Australia Pty. Ltd. (Mulgrave, Australia). 911 retinoblastoma cells and the adenoviral expression system have been described previously (25Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Poronnik P. Cook D.I. Baxter R.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). The type I IGF receptor (IGFRI)-overexpressing cells, NIH-3T3-IGFRI, were a generous gift from Dr. Colin Ward (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Health Sciences and Nutrition (CSIRO), Parkville, Australia). IGF-I columns were made by covalently linking recombinant human IGF-I to Affi-Gel 10 activated agarose (Bio-Rad). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) was purchased from BD Bioscience (Palo Alto, CA). Anti-IGFRI β subunit polyclonal antibody (C-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Silver staining kits were obtained from Bio-Rad. The HPLC column (5 μm, C18, 300 Å) was purchased from Phenomenex (Torrence, CA). All of the radiolabeled proteins used were prepared as described previously (27Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—E1-transformed 911 human embryonic retinoblast cells (28Fallaux F.J. Kranenburg O. Cramer S.J. Houweling A. van Ormondt H. Hoeben R.C. van der Eb A.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 20 mm glutamine. NIH-3T3-IGFRI cells were maintained in the above medium plus 500 μg/ml geneticin. All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Construction of Plasmids Expressing hIGFBP-3 Mutants—Mutations were introduced into hIGFBP-3 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, complementary primers containing the desired mutations were annealed to both strands of an adenoviral shuttle plasmid harboring full-length wild-type IGFBP-3 (pAdTrack-CMV-IGFBP-3) and extended using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase to generate a mutated plasmid. The following primer sequences containing mutagenic mismatches were used: gacgaggcgcgaccgcagcaggcgctgctggac, Leu77 to Gln; cgaccgctgcaggcgcagcaggacggccgcgggctc, Leu80-Leu81 to Gln-Gln; cgaccgctgcaggcggggggggacggccgcgggctc, Leu80-Leu81 to Gly-Gly; aactgtgacaagaagagcttttataagaaaaag, Gly217 to Ser; and ttttataagaaaaaggcgtgtcgcccttccaaa, Gln223 to Ala. Additional mutagenesis steps were carried out on single mutants for multiple site mutations. To mutate Leu77 to Gln in the Gln80-Gln81 mutant, the following primer was used: gacgaggcgcgaccgcagcaggcgcagcaggac. Following amplification, the parental DNA template was digested with DpnI endonuclease followed by transformation of XL-10 Gold ultra-competent cells. Plasmid clones were screened for targeted mutations by DNA sequencing. Plasmids with desired mutations were subsequently introduced into an E1-deficient expression plasmid, pAdEasy-1, by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (26He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). Further DNA sequencing was carried out on all pAdEasy-1 plasmids to verify the mutations and the integrity of the remaining hIGF-BP-3 sequence.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant IGFBP-3—911 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA purified from CsCl2 gradient to generate adenoviruses as previously described (26He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). High titer adenoviruses for wild-type and mutant hIGFBP-3 were generally obtained following three or four rounds of amplification. Wild-type and mutant IGFBP-3 were produced as secreted proteins in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 20 mm glutamine, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (500 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) from 450-cm2 flasks of confluent 911 cells infected with high titer adenoviruses. Conditioned media were collected 48 h after infection, and proteins in the media were purified by either IGF-I affinity or heparin affinity chromatography (for mutants with very low IGF binding). Proteins bound to IGF-I affinity columns were eluted with 1 m acetic acid with unadjusted pH, whereas proteins bound to heparin affinity columns were eluted by a stepwise NaCl gradient as described by Firth et al. (29Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Further purification was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC as previously described (30Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8754-8760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were quantitated by IGFBP-3 radioimmunoassay (RIA) using hIGFBP-3 antibody as described by Baxter and Martin (27Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Purity of the proteins was assessed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE.IGF Ligand Blotting and IGFBP-3 Immunoblotting—Briefly, 40 ng of purified wild-type or mutant protein was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions and transferred onto Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) by electro-blotting using a Multiphor II Novablot unit (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, the blot was blocked for 2–3 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 containing 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGF-II (1 × 106 cpm/25 ml) in the same buffer. The blot was then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and dried before exposure to Hyperfilm MP film (Amersham Biosciences). For sample loading control, immunoblotting with hIGF-BP-3 antibody (R-100) was performed on the same membrane. In brief, the ligand blot was probed with anti-hIGFBP-3 antiserum at a final concentration of 1:10,000 in the above blocking buffer for 2 h at 22 °C. After washing, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 1:100,000 and subjected to ECL detection using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).IGF Solution Binding Assay—Varying amounts (0–100 ng) of wild-type and mutant recombinant human IGFBP-3 were incubated with 10,000 cpm of either 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGF-II in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with 2.5 g/liter bovine serum albumin in 300 μl of reaction volume for 2 h at 22 °C to allow IGF·IGFBP-3 complex formation. To precipitate the binary complexes, the reaction was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μl of hIGFBP-3 antibody followed by precipitation with 2.5 μl of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin in the presence of a 40 g/liter final concentration of polyethylene glycol. Apparent IGF binding activity for each mutant was derived from individual binding curves as the amount of protein required to achieve half-maximum binding.Ternary Complex Formation Assay/ALS Binding Assay—ALS binding for wild-type or mutant forms of IGFBP-3 was measured as described previously (6Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, varying amounts (0–50 ng) of IGFBP-3 were incubated with 10,000 cpm of 125I-ALS in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with 2.5 g/liter bovine serum albumin in 300 μl reaction volume in the absence or presence of 50 ng of IGF-I (in excess of hIGFBP-3). Complexes were allowed to form for 2 h at 22 °C and separated from unbound tracer by immunoprecipitation with hIGFBP-3 antibody as described above.BIAcore Analysis—Wild-type IGFBP-3 or mutant forms of hIGFBP-3 were coupled to activated CM5 surfaces using standard amine coupling conditions (31Lofas S. Johnsson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Google Scholar, 32Carrick F.E. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27120-27128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, IGFBPs were coupled to activated surfaces (2 μg of IGFBP/210 μl in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) at 5 μl/min. Unreacted groups were inactivated with 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. A sensor surface with 600 response units of coupled hIGFBP-3 would routinely result in a response of ∼100 response units with 100 nm IGF-I. Kinetic studies with a range of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nm IGF-I or IGF-II were determined at a flow rate of 40 μl/min running buffer: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA), thereby minimizing mass transfer effects. Association proceeded for 300 s followed by 900 s for dissociation. IGFBP biosensor surfaces were regenerated with 10 mm HCl. For each binding curve, the response obtained using control surfaces (no protein coupled) was subtracted. Dissociation constants were derived using BIAevaluation 3.2 software and a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. This model describes a simple reversible interaction of two molecules in a 1:1 complex. Whereas two-site binding models have been used to describe the interaction between IGFs and IGFBP-3, this was not an appropriate model for analyzing the N- and C-terminal domain mutants. In addition, the low affinity binding component of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 interaction only makes up ∼10% of the total binding (33Heding A. Gill R. Ogawa Y. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13948-13952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All binding experiments were repeated at least twice, and biosensor chips coupled at different times yielded surfaces with comparable binding affinities. Experiments in the opposite orientation using IGFs coupled to the chip were not conducted because of nonspecific binding of IGFBP-3 to sensor surfaces (including CM5 and SA surfaces).IGF-I-induced IGFRI Autophosphorylation—The method was adapted from Devi et al. (34Devi G.R. Yang D.H. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4171-4179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent NIH-3T3-IGFRI cells in 12-well plates were serum-starved for 24 h. Immediately prior to the experiment, the cells were washed with serum-free medium before being exposed for 5 min to either 2.5 ng/ml IGF-I or 10 ng/ml IGF-II that had been preincubated with or without either wild-type or mutant IGFBP-3 in molar ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 (IGF:IGFBP-3) for 2 h at 22°C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 200 μl of cell solubilization buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 137 mm NaCl, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4). To detect IGFRI tyrosine phosphorylation, 10 μl of cell lysate was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-phophotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 at a 1:1,000 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Phosphoproteins were visualized by ECL detection after incubating blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at a 1:2,000 dilution. The same blot was then stripped with “RESTORE” stripping buffer (Pierce) and probed with IGFRI β subunit antibody C-20 for total β subunit protein. The level of IGFRI tyrosine phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry, and the results were normalized to total β subunit protein.RESULTSConstruction and Characterization of hIGFBP-3 Mutants That Have Reduced Affinities for IGFs—N-terminal residues targeted for mutagenesis were chosen based on the NMR study of mini-IGFBP-5 (residues 40–92) by Kalus et al. (17Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The residues implicated in the hydrophobic binding pocket include those between Val49 and Leu74 of IGFBP-5, which correspond to residues between Ile56 and Leu81 in IGFBP-3. Ile56, Leu77, Leu80, and Leu81 in IGFBP-3 have been shown to be involved in IGF binding (19Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsen M. Bang P. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C-terminal residues targeted for mutagenesis were chosen based on the study by Bramani et al. (21Bramani S. Song H. Beattie J. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in which Gly203 and Gln209 in rat IGFBP-5 were shown to be involved in IGF-I binding. The two neutral residues are strictly conserved among all six IGFBPs, and they correspond to Gly217 and Gln223 in IGFBP-3. To test the hypothesis that both the N- and C-terminal regions of IGFBPs are involved in IGF binding, we generated variant proteins with mutations in either N- or C-terminal regions or combined mutations at both N- and C-terminal regions of IGFBP-3. The N-terminal mutants are denoted as Q (Gln77), GG (Gly80-Gly81), QQ (Gln80-Gln81), and QQQ (Gln77-Gln80-Gln81), whereas the C-terminal mutants are S (Ser217), A (Ala223), and SA (Ser217-Ala223). In addition, two other variants with mutations in both the N- and C-terminal regions were generated, QSA (Gln77-Ser217-Ala223) and GGSA (Gly80-Gly81-Ser217-Ala223) (Fig. 1). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to generate the specific mutations are provided under “Experimental Procedures.”Recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of hIGFBP-3 were expressed in 911 cells as secreted proteins. Initial IGF solution binding assays were performed on crude infection media to assess IGF binding of the secreted protein to determine the type of affinity purification method used (Fig. 1). Wild-type and mutant proteins with detectable IGF binding affinity were purified by IGF-I affinity chromatography. Heparin chromatography was performed for QSA and GGSA mutants that had undetectable IGF-I binding by solution binding assay. It was observed that on a stepwise salt gradient, complete elution of these two mutants from a heparin-agarose column occurred at 0.5 m NaCl (data not shown), compared with 0.75 m NaCl for wild-type IGFBP-3 as previously shown (29Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggesting the mutants had reduced binding affinities for heparin. Further purification by reverse-phase HPLC showed that all of the mutant proteins eluted from the column at a similar retention time of 19 min (data not shown). Quantitation of the purified proteins by IGFBP-3 RIA showed that the recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins yielded displacement curves that were parallel to that of serum-derived IGFBP-3 (the standard in the RIA), suggesting that the epitope recognized by the hIGFBP-3 antibody was not significantly altered in the mutant proteins (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting of the proteins with IGFBP-3-specific polyclonal antibody demonstrated that the recombinant IGFBP-3 analogs were similarly glycosylated because they appeared as doublet bands with apparent molecular masses of 42–45 kDa (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2A, RIA dilution curves of wild-type and mutant IGFBP-3. Plasma-derived hIGFBP-3 was used as RIA standard [*], and the purified proteins of wild-type and mutant IGFBP-3 were diluted to a standard range of concentrations from 0.1 to 20 ng/tube. RIA was conducted using IGFBP-3-specific antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B/B0 represents the ratio of IGFBP-3 tracer binding to antibody in the presence of cold, unlabeled IGFBP-3 to that bound in the absence of cold, unlabeled IGFBP-3. The following IGFBP-3 analogs are shown: wild-type IGFBP-3 (•), Q(▴), GG (♦), QQ (▾), QQQ (▪), S(○), A(⋄), SA (□), QSA (□), and GGSA (▿). B, immunoblotting of wild-type and mutant analogs of IGFBP-3. Briefly, 40 ng of each protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with IG-FBP-3 specific antibody.

The membranes were incubated with 125I-IGF-I (C) or 125I-IGF-II (D) overnight at 4 °C before exposure to film. The same blots were immunoblotted with IGFBP-3-specific antibody for sample loading control, shown below the ligand blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutations in hIGFBP-3 Decrease or Abolish Its Bind"
https://openalex.org/W2083333009,"The binding of proteins to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is the prerequisite for a large number of cellular processes and regulatory events and is associated to many pathologies. However, progress in the understanding of these mechanisms has been hampered by the lack of simple and comprehensive analytical tools for the identification of the structural attributes involved in protein/saccharide interaction. Characterization of GAG binding motifs on proteins has so far relied on site-directed mutagenesis studies, protein sequence mapping using synthetic peptides, molecular modeling, or structural analysis. Here, we report the development of a novel approach for identifying protein residues involved in the binding to heparin, the archetypal member of the GAG family. This method, which uses native proteins, is based on the formation of cross-linked complexes of the protein of interest with heparin beads, the proteolytic digestion of these complexes, and the subsequent identification of the heparin binding containing peptides by N terminus sequencing. Analysis of the CC chemokine regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES), the envelope glycoprotein gC from pseudorabies virus and the laminin-5 α3LG4/5 domain validated the techniques and provided novel information on the heparin binding motifs present within these proteins. Our results highlighted this method as a fast and valuable alternative to existing approaches. Application of this technique should greatly contribute to facilitate the structural study of protein/GAG interactions and the understanding of their biological functions.

This method, which uses native proteins, is based on the formation of cross-linked complexes of the protein of interest with heparin beads, the proteolytic digestion of these complexes, and the subsequent identification of the heparin binding containing peptides by N terminus sequencing. Analysis of the CC chemokine regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES), the envelope glycoprotein gC from pseudorabies virus and the laminin-5 α3LG4/5 domain validated the techniques and provided novel information on the heparin binding motifs present within these proteins. Our results highlighted this method as a fast and valuable alternative to existing approaches. Application of this technique should greatly contribute to facilitate the structural study of protein/GAG interactions and the understanding of their biological functions. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride; HBD, heparin binding domain; Hp-bd, heparin bead; HS, heparan sulfate; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; PRV, pseudorabies virus; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride; HBD, heparin binding domain; Hp-bd, heparin bead; HS, heparan sulfate; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; PRV, pseudorabies virus; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are complex polysaccharides abundantly found on cell surfaces and in extracellular matrices. Over the last 15 years, GAGs have emerged as critical regulators of most events involving cell response to its external environment. Through their ability to bind a wide range of proteins, they participate to biological processes as diverse as cell proliferation, cell-matrix interactions, migration and chemoattraction, inflammation, angiogenesis, embryo development and patterning, or viral attachment (1Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3Esko J.D.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). GAG chains consist in a linear succession of disaccharide units comprising alternating uronic acid, either l-iduronic (IdoUA) or d-glucuronic (GlcA), and hexosamine, either d-glucosamine (GlcN) or d-galactosamine (GalN). With the exception of hyaluronic acid, GAGs can be sulfated to a variable extent, leading to a high degree of sequence heterogeneity. For heparin and heparan sulfate (HS), the most sulfated and complex GAGs, both in term of structural variability and biological activities, sulfation occurs at C-2, C-6, and occasionally C-3 of glucosamines and C-2 of uronic acids (mostly IdoUA). This process is finely tuned by the concerted activities of multiple biosynthesis enzyme families and controls the generation of specific motifs with appropriate sulfation pattern that will constitute the binding sites for their protein ligands (6Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 7Gallagher J.T. J. Clin.

Binding of proteins to HS can influence their activity through many ways. HS is involved in storage functions, protection against proteolysis, and formation of chemotactic gradients (9Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 10Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Johnson Z.

It can activate proteins such as antithrombin III (11Petitou M. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), plays a role of coreceptor for a number of growth factors including fibroblast growth factors (12Ornitz D.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 13Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), inhibits binding of interferon γ to its cell surface receptor (14Sadir R. Forest E. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10919-10925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and can direct entry of herpes simplex virus-1 into the cell (15Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P.

These multiple activities are intimately related to the structural features of the polysaccharide. A well documented example is that of basic fibroblast growth factor, for which subtle sulfation variations can lead HS modulatory properties toward inhibition or stimulation of the growth factor signaling activity (16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17Nurcombe V. Smart C.E. Chipperfield H. Cool S.M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30009-30018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Understanding the functional role of HS/protein binding thus requires the identification of the structural determinants involved in the interaction, both on the saccharide and on the protein side. On proteins and in absence of structural data, the characterization of heparan sulfate binding sites remains a complex issue. Among studies based on heparin-binding protein sequence comparison, an early work led to the proposition of two HS binding consensus sequences, the XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX motifs (where B stands for a basic and X for a neutral/hydrophobic amino acid) (18Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, analysis of more HS ligands has seriously challenged the universality of this paradigm. Site-directed mutagenesis (19Yamashita H. Beck K. Kitagawa Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or structural characterization of protein-heparin complexes by x-ray crystallography (20Mulloy B. Linhardt R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), NMR (21Kuschert G.S. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Chung C.W. Cooke R.M. Hubbard R.E. Wells T.N. Sanderson P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11193-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), or molecular modeling (22Lortat-Jacob H. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) clearly indicate that HS binding sites are not exclusively composed of linear sequences. They can also include conformational epitopes comprising distant amino acids organized in a precise spatial orientation through the folding of the protein. Therefore, identification of putative HS binding sites solely on the basis of sequence analysis remains highly speculative. In this study, we have developed an approach, which relies on the proteolytic digestion of protein-heparin stabilized complexes and subsequent analysis of the polysaccharide bound peptides to identify HS binding motifs. This technique has been used to cartograph HS binding sites on three proteins: the pseudorabies virus (PRV) envelope glycoprotein gC participating to the virus-cell attachment process, the CC chemokine RANTES, a small and soluble signaling protein, and the C-terminal fragment of the laminin-5 α3 chain corresponding to the globular domains 4 and 5 (α3LG4/5), which is part of the complex network of structural proteins forming basement membranes. The results obtained confirmed data from earlier studies and provided additional information on the interaction of these proteins with HS and heparin. Materials and Methods—Automated Edman degradation was performed using a model 492 gas-phase sequencer, a model 140C HPLC system, and the model 610A data analysis software package (version 2.1) for protein sequencing from Applied Biosystems. Heparin beads (TSK gel heparin 5PW) were from Tosoh Bioscience. EDC/NHS reagents were supplied by BIAcore. Thermolysin was from Sigma. Production of the α3LG4/5 Fragment—The α3LG4/5 fragment was produced as previously described (23Okamoto O. Bachy S. Odenthal U. Bernaud J. Rigal D. Lortat-Jacob H. Smyth N. Rousselle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44168-44177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA corresponding to the α3LG4/5 fragment (C1354 to the end) was inserted in-frame with the BM-40 signal peptide in the mammalian expression vector pCEP-Pu. Recombinant plasmid was introduced by electroporation into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The secreted recombinant LG4/5 fragment was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography on a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences), and elution was achieved with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.1 to 1.2 m. Protein concentration was determined by microprotein assay using bicinchoninic acid. Coupling of Proteins to Heparin Beads—Heparin Beads (Hp-bds, 25 μl) were first resuspended in PBS, and the carboxyl groups were inactivated with 3 mm EDC and 7.5 mm NHS for 15 min, at room temperature, under agitation. Reactants in excess were inactivated by addition of β-mercaptoethanol (15 mm final) and removed by centrifugation and washing with PBS. RANTES-(9–68), PRV Gc, and laminin-5 α3LG4/5 fragment (0.2–10 μm) were incubated with the activated Hp-bds in 200 μl of PBS for 2 h at room temperature, under agitation. The reaction was then quenched by addition of 20 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and beads were washed with PBS, 2 m NaCl to remove non-covalently bound proteins. Prior to proteolytic digestion and analysis, beads were stored in PBS at 4 °C. Proteolytic Digestion and N-terminal Sequencing of Proteins on Heparin Beads—Proteins on Hp-bds were denatured by heating at 60 °C for 15 min in PBS, 2 m urea, resuspended in 50 μl of PBS, and digested overnight with 53 mIU of thermolysin, at 50 °C under constant agitation. Released peptides were removed by extensive washing with PBS, 2 m NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton. Hp-bds were rinsed in water and packed on a Biobrene-treated filter. Within the filter holder, a5-μm Durapore membrane was fitted underneath the filter to prevent beads being washed throughout the system. Peptides cross-linked to Hp-bds were sequenced using an Edman degradation automated protocol. Phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives removed at each sequencing cycle were identified and quantified on-line by reverse phase HPLC. Retention times and integration values of peaks were compared with chromatograms obtained for a standard mixture of derivatized amino acids. For clarity, irrelevant residues that could not be detected by sequencing for technical reasons (cysteine that cannot be identified or low yield amino acids at the end of the sequenced peptides) were shown as “detected” in the results. All procedures and reagents were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Principle of the Beads Approach—The technique developed in this study is designed to identify heparin binding domains (HBDs) on proteins. The principle of the beads approach (Fig. 1) is based on the capture of the protein of interest on heparin immobilized beads, using a cross-linking reaction between amine-bearing amino acids of the protein and EDC/NHS-activated carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide. The protein/saccharide conjugate formed can be submitted to proteolytic digestion. Finally, peptides remaining attached to the Hp-bds, and thus comprising the HBD, can be identified by N terminus protein sequencing. Contrary to site-directed mutagenesis, this technique does not require any modifications of the protein before the formation of the complex with heparin chains, which thus constitutes a native structure. The cross-linking step used to stabilize the complex was designed to occur specifically within the HBD and to avoid unwanted protein-protein interactions. Finally, proteolytic digestion conditions were setup to apply to all kinds of proteins. Analysis of gC from Pseudorabies Virus—PRV is an α herpes virus that causes Aujesky's disease in swine. Similarly to the prototypical herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the PRV cell entry process involves multiple viral envelope glycoproteins. These include the gC protein, which participates in the virus initial attachment by interacting with HS (24Mettenleiter T.C. Zsak L. Zuckermann F. Sugg N. Kern H. Ben-Porat T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 278-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Liang X. Babiuk L.A. Zamb T.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Karger A. Mettenleiter T.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2138-2145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the 457-amino acid sequence of mature gC, up to seven exact or close matches to the XBBXB or XBBBXXBX heparin binding consensus sequences can be found (Fig. 2A). Among these, sequences HBD1 (75SRRKPPRN82), HBD2 (95AHGRKRI101), and HBD3 (135YRRGRFR141), located within the N-terminal first third of the protein, have been identified as three independent heparin binding sites with distinct saccharide requirements (27Flynn S.J. Ryan P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Trybala E. Bergstrom T. Spillmann D. Svennerholm B. Flynn S.J. Ryan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gC mutants for two of any of the three HBDs could still efficiently bind to heparin (27Flynn S.J. Ryan P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycoprotein gC (∼600 nm) was incubated with EDC/NHS-activated Hp-bds. After removal of unbound protein, the gC-heparin conjugate was submitted to proteolytic digestion, using thermolysin. Released peptides were discarded, while fragments cross-linked to the Hp-bds were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. Results systematically led to the simultaneous identification of two distinct sequences corresponding to domains HBD1 and HBD2 (Fig. 2B, i and ii). Amino acids (marked in red) involved in cross-linking with the polysaccharide were easily identified, as saccharide conjugation prevented their elution, which resulted in a “gap” within the sequences. Saccharide coupling was also found at the level of arginines (Fig. 2B), while the EDC/NHS coupling was supposed to specifically react with the primary amines of lysines. This indicated that the use of the “beads approach” would not be restricted to the identification of lysine containing binding domains. A last interesting observation was that cross-linking was observed at the level of Lys92, a residue located between HBD1 and HBD2, suggesting a participation of this residue in heparin binding and a continuum between both HBDs. In contrast, no sequences corresponding to HBD3 could be detected, even at the highest gC concentration tested (6 μm). Analysis of RANTES-(9–68)—RANTES is a 68-amino acid proinflammatory chemokine displaying chemotactic, leukocyte activating, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus activities (29Appay V. Rowland-Jones S.L. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). As most chemokines, RANTES binds to GAGs and particularly to HS (30Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P. Wittamer V. Parmentier M. Vita C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6303-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Vives R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This interaction may play multiple roles in RANTES biological activity, including protection and storage of the chemokine, formation of chemotactic gradients, or induction of dimerization, which is thought to be a critical step for eliciting chemokine receptor signaling (9Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 10Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). RANTES amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) features two clusters of basic residues, 44RKNR47 and 55KKWVR59, the first one having been identified by site-directed mutagenesis as the primary heparin binding site. However, mutations of all basic residues within the 44RKNR47 cluster did not completely abrogate interaction with heparin, suggesting the existence of complementary binding motifs (32Proudfoot A.E. Fritchley S. Borlat F. Shaw J.P. Vilbois F. Zwahlen C. Trkola A. Marchant D. Clapham P.R. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10620-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To tackle this issue, we decided to further characterize RANTES HBD, using the beads approach. One of the major hurdles in the study of RANTES is its very potent tendency to self-aggregate. To circumvent this difficulty, all analyses were performed on RANTES-(9–68), an N-terminal eight-amino acid truncated form of the chemokine, which remains monomeric in solution (33Ylisastigui L. Vizzavona J. Drakopoulou E. Paindavoine P. Calvo C.F. Parmentier M. Gluckman J.C. Vita C. Benjouad A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RANTES-(9–68) affinity for heparin is similar to that of wild type RANTES, which is in agreement with the presence of the heparin binding residues toward the C terminus of the chemokine (22Lortat-Jacob H. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 31Vives R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Proudfoot A.E. Fritchley S. Borlat F. Shaw J.P. Vilbois F. Zwahlen C. Trkola A. Marchant D. Clapham P.R. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10620-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). RANTES-(9–68) was incubated with EDC/NHS-activated Hp-bds at a concentration of ∼300 nm, which is in the range of the chemokine affinity for the polysaccharide (31Vives R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Typical results yielded a single sequence, 42VTR-NRQ48, which corresponded to the reported HBD (Fig. 3B). Amino acid Lys45 could not be detected, indicating that this residue was the one involved in the cross-linking with the polysaccharide (see above). Incomplete digestions led occasionally to the detection of sequences corresponding to partly degraded or intact material. For instance, in Fig. 3B, ii, peptides PCCFAYI and VTR-NRQ were simultaneously sequenced. While the latter matched RANTES HBD (with an undetected Lys45 involved in cross-linking), the former arose from the N terminus of the undigested protein. However, a participation of such unrelated peptide to heparin binding was easily ruled out, as no cross-linked residues could be identified within this sequence. Our data thus further support the primary role of the 44RKNR47 motif in heparin binding. Increasing the concentration of RANTES-(9–68) incubated with the Hp-bds to the micromolar range (1–10 μm) led to the detection of additional sequences, with cross-linking occurring at the level of a second cluster of basic amino acids: 55KKWVR59 (Fig. 3C, i–iii). This second domain could correspond to an accessory, low affinity binding site that may account for the residual heparin binding activity displayed by mutants for the 44RKNR47 primary binding site (32Proudfoot A.E. Fritchley S. Borlat F. Shaw J.P. Vilbois F. Zwahlen C. Trkola A. Marchant D. Clapham P.R. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10620-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Using RANTES-(9–68) high concentrations, coupling was also occasionally (at a frequency of about 40%) detected at the level of Lys33 (Fig. 3C, iv and v). Our data thus highlighted this residue as a new putative candidate for participating to heparin binding. Analysis of Laminin α3LG4/5 Fragment—Laminins are matrix heterotrimeric glycoproteins formed by the cross-shaped assembly of α, β, and γ chains. Within this family, laminin-5 is composed of α3β3γ2 chains and is a found in basement membranes underlying specific epithelia with secretory or protective functions (34Nishiyama T. Amano S. Tsunenaga M. Kadoya K. Takeda A. Adachi E. Burgeson R.E. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2000; 24: S51-S59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing affects laminin-5 biological activities. The processed protein promotes cell adhesion and hemidesmosome assembly through interaction with α3β1 and α6β4 integrins, contrary to the intact form that is found in migratory conditions (35Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 binds to HS, which plays the role of cell surface receptor. In a recent study, a processing released fragment corresponding to α3 chain C-terminal globular domains 4 and 5 (α3LG4/5) of laminin-5 has been shown to display heparin binding activity (23Okamoto O. Bachy S. Odenthal U. Bernaud J. Rigal D. Lortat-Jacob H. Smyth N. Rousselle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44168-44177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This interaction is thus specific of the unprocessed form that includes this fragment and is believed to take an active part into mechanisms of cell adhesion. Incubation of the α3LG4/5 domain (300 nm) with the Hp-bds and subsequent analysis resulted in the simultaneous sequencing of four different peptides, among which two of them were overlapping (Fig. 4B). Three different sequences could thus be deduced, with cross-linking at the level of residues Arg83, Lys85, Lys144, and Lys260. No additional peptides were detected, even at the highest α3LG4/5 concentration tested (1 μm). Interestingly, Arg83 and Lys85 are located within a highly basic peptide, K80KLRIKSKEK89, whose sequence corresponds to a HBD consensus motif. In contrast, both Lys144 and Lys260 are relatively isolated within the sequence (Fig. 4A). As mentioned before, heparin binding motifs are often partly composed of linear epitopes corresponding to clusters of basic amino acids and remote residues that are added to the motif through folding of the protein. Accordingly, it is likely that the whole K80KLRIKSKEK89 sequence would constitute a heparin binding site, along with Lys144, possibly Lys142, and Lys260. While increasing interest arises from the biological functions of protein/GAG interactions, the lack of simple analytical tools for the structural characterization of these interactions remains one of the major hurdles to their study. Here, we have developed a technique enabling a mapping of protein sequences to locate HBDs. This approach is based on the capture of the protein of interest on heparin immobilized beads, followed by proteolytic digestion of the protein. Peptides retained, i.e. containing amino acids involved in covalent linkages with the polysaccharide, can then be identified by solid phase N-terminal protein sequencing performed directly on the heparin beads (Fig. 1). The first step of the technique corresponds to the immobilization of the protein of interest on the heparin chains. This was achieved, using an adapted protocol of a zero length, two-step cross-linking procedure (38Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Heparin carboxyl groups were activated by incubation with EDC in the presence of NHS to form succinimide esters. Excess of cross-linking reagents were easily removed by both neutralization of free EDC with β-mercaptoethanol and washing of the beads with PBS. The protein was incubated with the activated heparin and was captured upon binding, through formation of covalent linkages between the succinimide esters on the polysaccharide and amine groups present within the HBD of the protein. The use of such a procedure has two major advantages. First, the direct reaction of succinimide esters with amine groups does not introduce any spacer. Cross-linking should thus only occur at the level of the protein HBD. Second, as heparin activation is performed prior to incubation with the protein, the latter is never let in contact with the cross-linking reagents, thus preventing putative protein/protein cross-linking side reactions. Such a technique has been successfully used in the past to study the stoechiometry of protein/GAG complexes (31Vives R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Once cross-linked to the Hp-bds, proteins were submitted to proteolytic digestions. Results showed that this step was critical for the quality of the sequencing data. Incomplete digestions, or the use of enzymes with high cleavage specificities, resulted in the generation of large fragments, with a N terminus remote from the interaction domain. In such cases, sequencing, which is only achievable for a limited number of residues, would not be able to reach and identify heparin cross-linked residues. Moreover, partial digestions generated multiple intermediate fragments with distinct N terminus but overlapping sequences. The presence of these peptides devoid of information dramatically increased the complexity of the amino acid attribution and sequence analysis. In particular, saccharide cross-linking on Lys or Arg residues shared by multiple sequences could not be determined. To prevent this, digestions were routinely performed using thermolysin, a proteolytic enzyme with a very broad specificity (cleavage upstream Leu, Phe, Ile, Val, Met, A"
https://openalex.org/W2098025503,"A number of cell types express inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS2) in response to exogenous insults such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines. Although it has been known for some time that the N-terminal end of NOS2 suffers a post-translational modification, its exact identification has remained elusive. Using radioactive fatty acids, we show herein that NOS2 becomes thioacylated at Cys-3 with palmitic acid. Site-directed mutagenesis of this single residue results in the absence of the radiolabel incorporation. Acylation of NOS2 is completely indispensable for intracellular sorting and ·NO synthesis. In fact, a C3S mutant of NOS2 is completely inactive and accumulates to intracellular membranes that almost totally co-localize with the Golgi marker β-cop. Likewise, low concentrations of the palmitoylation blocking agents 2-Br-palmitate or 8-Br-palmitate severely affected the ·NO synthesis of both NOS2 induced in muscular myotubes and transfected NOS2. However, unlike endothelial NOS, palmitoylation of inducible NOS is not involved in its targeting to caveolae. We have created 16 NOS2-GFP chimeras to inspect the effect of the neighboring residues of Cys-3 on the degree of palmitoylation. In this regard, the hydrophobic residue Pro-4 and the basic residue Lys-6 seem to be indispensable for palmitoylation. In addition, agents that block the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transit such as brefeldin A and monensin drastically reduced NOS2 activity leading to its accumulation in perinuclear areas. In summary, palmitoylation of NOS2 at Cys-3 is required for both its activity and proper intracellular localization. A number of cell types express inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS2) in response to exogenous insults such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines. Although it has been known for some time that the N-terminal end of NOS2 suffers a post-translational modification, its exact identification has remained elusive. Using radioactive fatty acids, we show herein that NOS2 becomes thioacylated at Cys-3 with palmitic acid. Site-directed mutagenesis of this single residue results in the absence of the radiolabel incorporation. Acylation of NOS2 is completely indispensable for intracellular sorting and ·NO synthesis. In fact, a C3S mutant of NOS2 is completely inactive and accumulates to intracellular membranes that almost totally co-localize with the Golgi marker β-cop. Likewise, low concentrations of the palmitoylation blocking agents 2-Br-palmitate or 8-Br-palmitate severely affected the ·NO synthesis of both NOS2 induced in muscular myotubes and transfected NOS2. However, unlike endothelial NOS, palmitoylation of inducible NOS is not involved in its targeting to caveolae. We have created 16 NOS2-GFP chimeras to inspect the effect of the neighboring residues of Cys-3 on the degree of palmitoylation. In this regard, the hydrophobic residue Pro-4 and the basic residue Lys-6 seem to be indispensable for palmitoylation. In addition, agents that block the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transit such as brefeldin A and monensin drastically reduced NOS2 activity leading to its accumulation in perinuclear areas. In summary, palmitoylation of NOS2 at Cys-3 is required for both its activity and proper intracellular localization. The gaseous radical nitric oxide (·NO) 1The abbreviations used are: ·NO, radical nitric oxide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; TGN, trans-Golgi network; WT, wild-type; Br, bromo; β-cop, β-coatomer protein. modulates biological function in a wide range of tissue types, acting either as a signaling molecule or as a toxin. Three human NOS isoforms have been cloned and characterized. Among them, NOS2 (sometimes referred to as inducible NOS or iNOS) is mostly involved in the synthesis of the large amounts of ·NO that appear in inflammatory and immunologic processes (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar, 2Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Both crystallographic and enzymatic studies performed with recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli have shown that the N terminus end of the three mammalian NOSs is not involved in ·NO synthesis but rather in subcellular targeting of the mature polypeptide chain (2Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 3Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). For instance, the PDZ domain of NOS1 (residues 1-90) interacts with dystrophin and becomes localized to the sarcolemma of fast twitch fibers (4Bredt D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In fact, deletion of the first 226 amino acids of NOS1 results in a catalytic protein that synthesizes ·NO at a similar rate than the full-length protein (5Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Likewise, the N-terminal end of NOS3 is covalently and irreversibly myristoylated at Gly-2 and reversibly palmitoylated at Cys-15 and Cys-26 in a well described process responsible for its targeting to caveolae (6Gratton J.P. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. García-Cardeña G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 7Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the first 52 amino acids of NOS3 does not affect catalytic activity, reflecting that this sequence stretch is not part of the enzymatic machinery but is involved in intracellular traffic (8Rodriguez-Crespo I. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loher T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8530-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As in the case of NOS1 and NOS3, the N-terminal end of NOS2 is very likely involved in subcellular targeting. In fact, deletion of the first 65 amino acids of a recombinant NOS2 expressed in E. coli results in a mutant protein that behaves like the wild-type counterpart (9Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the post-translational modifications of NOS2 in vivo within eukaryotic cells, such as acylation, phosphorylation, or its binding to other cellular proteins. Interestingly, when a peptide corresponding to the first 17 amino acids of NOS2 is used to elicit a rabbit antiserum the resulting antibodies recognize a soluble form of the enzyme, but not its membrane-bound counterpart (10Ringheim G.E. Pan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the particulate and the soluble NOS2 were recognized by a serum elicited against the C terminus end of the protein (10Ringheim G.E. Pan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Likewise, the presence of a post-translational modification in NOS2 resulting in membrane attachment with an increased molecular mass has also been reported (11Vodovotz Y. Russell D. Xie Q.W. Bogdan C. Nathan C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar, 12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although this membrane association of NOS2 has been well characterized in a number of tissues (11Vodovotz Y. Russell D. Xie Q.W. Bogdan C. Nathan C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar, 12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J.

Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying the translocation of NOS2 to the particulate fraction and its subsequent dissociation is poorly characterized. We demonstrate in this article that the palmitoylation of NOS2 at Cys-3 is a process necessary for its intracellular transit toward subcellular domains where ·NO synthesis is required. In fact, the site-directed mutant where this Cys-3 has been converted into a Ser residue did not incorporate the radioactive fatty acid and irreversibly aggregated in the Golgi compartment, becoming completely devoid of activity. Cell Culture and Materials—Glutamine, antibiotics, cell culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), sulfanilic acid (4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid), N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, LPS (from Salmonella enteriditis), brefeldin A, monensin, 2-Br-palmitate, 8-Br-palmitate, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, transfection reagents Escort-III and Escort-IV, and Hoescht were purchased from Sigma. Trypsin-EDTA and fetal bovine serum were from BioWhittaker Europe. The source of the various antibodies used in this work is as follows: anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal (C13630) and anti-NOS2 polyclonal (N32030) were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-β-tubulin I (T7816) monoclonal antibody and anti-β-cop (PA1-061) were purchased from ABR and anti-NOS2 monoclonal antibody (N9657) was purchased from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP serum was raised in our laboratory as previously described (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Goat anti-GFP was from Eusera.com. Recombinant human IFN-γ was from PeproTech. Protein A-Sepharose, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, Dowex resin, ECL reagents, Cy2- and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies, and radioisotopes were from Amersham Biosciences. The C2C12 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Differentiation of ∼70% confluent myoblasts into myotubes was performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and glutamine plus 50 nm insulin in the absence of serum for 3 days (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Stimulation of myotubes, transfection, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and determination of the ·NO release was performed essentially as previously reported (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning and Construction of the 16 NOS2 Chimeras—We have previously described the cloning and expression of the full-length wild-type NOS2 (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which possessed the initial sequence MACPWKFLFKVKSYQSD... We have created the following mutant NOS2-GFP constructs: wild-type, the single mutants A2C, C3S, P4K, K6E, and the double mutants K6E/K10E, P4E/K6E, and P4K/W5K. Every construct was obtained as a full-length NOS2-GFP chimera and as a NOS2-(1-94)-GFP chimera. We PCR amplified the NOS2 cDNA introducing the desired mutation together with a novel NcoI site at the 5′ end and a novel BssHII site at the 3′ end. The general design of the NOS chimeras consisted of NOS2 cDNA fused to the enhanced GFP using a BssHII site in the pCDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter as previously described (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified bands were then ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced. We then double-digested the NOS2 in pGEM-T with NcoI plus BssHII and ligated the bands into the corresponding sites of a pUC-linker-GFP construct (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this construct we had a BssHII at the 5′ end of the GFP coding region, as well as a XhoI at the 3′ end followed by a His6 ending with a XbaI site. This NOS2-GFP pUC construct was digested with XbaI for 2 h and EcoRI was then added for 5 min to induce a partial digestion (there are internal EcoRI sites within the NOS2 cDNA). Finally, the larger band obtained from this partial digestion (∼4.2 kb in the case of the large chimeras and 1 kb in the case of the short chimeras) was ligated into pCDNA3 that had been previously double digested with EcoRI plus XbaI. This NOS2-GFP pCDNA3 plasmid was used to transfect myoblasts and myocytes in culture using Escort-III and Escort-IV (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Metabolic Labeling—Dishes of COS7 cells transfected with the desired NOS2 construct were metabolically labeled with [125I]iodopalmitate (16Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.P. Resh M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the case of the NOS2-(1-94)-GFP chimeras described in Fig. 4 and with 3H-tritiated palmitic acid in all the other cases as previously described (15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both methods of radioactive labeling are equally valid and rendered similar results. After a 4-h incubation with 100 μCi per 100-mm dish, the radiolabeling media containing the isotope were removed and cells were washed twice with culture media. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and the radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-GFP antibodies (Eusera.com) and Protein A-Sepharose as previously described (15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A control dish transfected under identical conditions but in the absence of radioactivity was also immunoprecipitated to determine the total amount of NOS2-GFP chimera (palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated) that was present in each experiment. These pilot Coomassie-stained gels were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analysis of various GFP chimeras was performed with the use of the goat polyclonal anti-GFP serum followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Incorporation of [125I]iodopalmitate or 3H-tritiated palmitic acid into the proteins was visualized by phosphorimaging and autoradiography of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A control labeling experiment was equally performed using a chimeric Fyn kinase GFP and its mutant chimera Fyn(G2A) fused to GFP that included the first 15 amino acids of the N-terminal end of the sequence (17McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Assay of NOS2 Activity—Because NOS2-derived nitric oxide decomposes in nitrites and nitrates, we performed the Griess assay according to our published protocol (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A volume of 0.5 ml of sample was incubated with 50 μl of a 100 mm sulfanilic acid solution and 50 μl of a 10 mmN-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride solution. The mixture was allowed to react for 15 min, and the absorbance value at 540 nm was determined. Every sample was analyzed in triplicate. Fresh solutions of sodium nitrite were regularly prepared as standards. In addition, in COS7 cells transfected with the various NOS2 constructs we also performed the l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline assay as previously described (18Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Recombinant Expression of NOS in E. coli and Purification—NOS2 cloned in the expression vector pCWori was used to transform competent BL21 cells (Novagen) where the coexpression vector for calmodulin was already inserted (19Rodriguez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Four liters of 2× YT media were used for protein expression at 22 °C. The protein was purified using two affinity columns as previously described (20Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Incubation of Live Cells with BODIPY-Texas Red-Ceramide—The live COS7 cells transfected with the various GFP chimeras were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and examined for their subcellular distribution after addition of 1,5 μm BODIPY-Texas Redceramide. Fixing was avoided because the methanol distorts significantly the BODIPY-Texas Red-ceramide signal. The cells were kept at 37 °C using a Peltier system. Neutral Hydroxylamine Treatment—The wild-type NOS2-GFP chimera was immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibodies and divided into two fractions that were loaded in separate gels. One of the SDS-PAGE gels was treated with 1 m Tris, pH 7.0, for 24 h, whereas the other gel was incubated with a buffered solution of 1 m hydroxylamine. Palmitoylation of Both Cytokine-induced and Transfected NOS2—When C2C12 muscular myotubes are challenged with a mixture of LPS and IFN-γ a clear NOS2 induction can be observed both by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Incubation of these cells with low concentrations of the palmitoylation inhibitors 2-Br- and 8-Br-palmitate lead to a dose-dependent diminution in ·NO synthesis (Fig. 1A, left panel). Likewise, when NOS2 was transfected in COS7 cells, the dose-dependent addition of 8-Br-palmitate produced a drastic decrease in NOS2 activity (Fig. 1A, right panel), although in both cases the total amount of NOS2 remained unchanged. In agreement with our previous data (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), when we used the wild-type NOS2-GFP construct to transfect COS7 cells a clear particulate distribution throughout the entire cytosol could be observed (Fig. 1B, left panel). This staining changed into a perinuclear distribution upon incubation of the cells with 10 μm 8-Br-palmitate (Fig. 1B, right panel). In consequence, inhibition of NOS2 palmitoylation using both 2-Br- and 8-Br-palmitate resulted in profound changes both in ·NO synthesis and the subcellular distribution of NOS2. NOS2 Is Palmitoylated on Cys-3—Next, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal end of NOS2, changing the Cys residue at position 3 into a Ser. This mutation created a recombinant chimera that, when transfected in COS-7 cells, was devoid of activity and displayed a large degradation pattern according to the immunoblot data. In addition, the C3S NOS2 mutant accumulated to perinuclear areas (Fig. 1C), in clear resemblance with the phenotype shown by the wild-type protein when treated with 8-Br-palmitate. Whereas the wild-type NOS2 transfected in COS7 cells was found both in the soluble and particulate fractions (in an approximate ratio of 40:60), the C3S mutant was completely found in the particulate fraction (Fig. 1C). This finding reveals that either the inactive C3S mutant associates with membrane fractions or the mutation results in an improper folded aggregated protein. These results may also suggest a critical role for the palmitate moiety attached to Cys-3 in the wild-type protein that cannot be replaced by a non-acylated Ser side chain. Hence the proper subcellular sorting of the C3S NOS2 mutant becomes disrupted. To investigate whether Cys-3 of NOS2 was palmitoylated within mammalian cells, we labeled COS7 cells transfected with the constructs of wild-type and C3S mutant with the 125I-fatty acid analogue of palmitic acid as previously described (16Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.P. Resh M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1D the full-length wild-type construct clearly incorporated the radioactive label, unlike the C3S mutant, that failed to show any significant labeling, despite similar amounts of total protein in both cases. When mouse C2C12 myotubes were incubated with radiolabeled palmitic acid and NOS2 expression was induced using a mixture of LPS and IFN-γ (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a clear band appeared at 135 kDa, which could be observed in the total lysate of cells subjected to the proinflammatory insult (Fig. 1E). This band was almost absent in the total lysate of both myoblasts and C2C12 myotubes that had not been treated with the mixture of cytokines (Fig. 1E). In addition, we purified recombinant NOS2 obtained expressed in E. coli as previously described (20Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As expected, the purified enzyme appeared as a single band of ∼135 kDa in a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2A). Using this recombinant NOS2 (in which Cys-3 is not acylated), we tested if increasing concentrations of 8-Br-palmitate altered its enzymatic activity. In contrast with the results obtained with palmitoylation inhibitors of NOS2 tested on mammalian cells, purified NOS2 does not significantly change its ·NO synthesizing activity in the 10-100 μm range of 8-Br-palmitate (Fig. 2A, right panel). Hence, the diminution in activity observed in both transfected and cytokine-induced NOS2 cells when treated with 2- and 8-Br-palmitate must be because of alterations in the normal sorting routes of NOS2 when the incorporation of palmitic acid is abrogated. It is consequently logical to speculate that there is a tight interconnection between palmitoylation of NOS2 and its proper ·NO synthesis. The changes observed in the activity of NOS2 transfected in COS7 cells were also determined using the l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline assay (Fig. 2B). As expected, incubation of wild-type NOS2 with 20 μm 2- and 8-Br-palmitate lead to decreased levels of citrulline, as previously observed when the levels of nitrites were determined using the Griess assay. Likewise, the C3S mutant of NOS2 displayed less than 10% of the activity of its wild-type counterpart. Indeed, a further proof of the existence of a palmitic acid linked to NOS2 through a thioester linkage was attained using the potent nucleophile hydroxylamine (Fig. 2C). When COS7 cells transfected with the wild-type NOS2-GFP chimera and incubated with [3H]palmitic acid were immunoprecipitated followed by treatment with 1 m Tris or 1 m hydroxylamine, cleavage of the S-acyl bond could only be observed in the presence of the latter. These results establish that the linkage between NOS2 and the palmitate moiety occur through a labile thioester bond. Colocalization of NOS2 with the Golgi Markers BODIPY-Texas Red Ceramide and β-Cop—Next, we analyzed the intracellular traffic of both the NOS2 and C3S GFP chimeras when transfected in COS7 cells. We performed a double immunofluorescence of both GFP constructs with a Golgi marker in red (Cy3 or Texas Red) and the cell nuclei in blue (Hoechst) (Fig. 3). BODIPY-Texas Red-ceramide is commonly used as a marker of the late Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network together with certain endosomes (12Navarro-Lérida I. Portolés M.T. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Navarro-Lérida I. Álvarez-Barrientos A. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J.

Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30325-30336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, coatomer proteins are involved in regulating the transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex as well as in intra-Golgi transport. Hence, antibodies against β-cop are frequently used as ER to cis-Golgi markers (22Xu Y. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21783-217839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Tisdale E.J. Wang J. Silver R.B. Artalejo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38015-38021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When the subcellular distribution of the full-length WT and C3S mutant of NOS2 along the sorting pathways were compared, consistent differences could be observed (Fig. 3). Whereas, the non-palmitoylated mutant clearly accumulated in perinuclear areas that colocalized with both BODIPY-Texas Red-ceramide and β-cop, the wild-type phenotype showed a more clear distribution throughout the cytosol. When we quantified the colocalization percentages for the BODIPY-Texas Red-ceramide and β-cop we obtained the data shown in Fig. 3. Although the wild-type NOS2 partially colocalized with the Golgi markers in certain perinuclear locations, the C3S mutant displayed an almost complete overlap with β-cop and BODIPY-Texas Red-ceramide, indicative that the correct sorting of the protein has been interrupted in the Golgi apparatus. Only 17% of the total WT GFP fluorescence colocalizes with BODIPY labeling, whereas 95% of the C3S GFP fluorescence colocalizes with BODIPY staining, reflecting that the wild-type chimera has partially passed through the Golgi in transit to areas closed to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, 12% of WT GFP fluorescence colocalizes with β-cop labeling, in contrast with the C3S mutant, where 63% of its GFP fluorescence overlaps with β-cop staining. When the red-green colocalization is considered, WT GFP fluorescence displays an almost complete colocalization with both the BODIPY and β-cop fluorescences (100 and 99%), whereas the GFP fluorescence of the C3S chimera only “covers” 24% of the total BODIPY fluorescence and 81% of the total β-cop fluorescence. These results not only indicate that the full-length NOS2-GFP chimera moves along the traffic machinery of the COS7 cells in transit through the ER-Golgi-TGN compartments, but also provide direct evidence that the palmitoylation of the cysteine residue located at position 3 of its sequence is required for this process. Subcellular Distribution and Radioactive Labeling of NOS2-GFP Chimeras Mutated in the N-Terminal End—A detailed analysis revealed that the N-terminal end of NOS2 includes hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. Pro, Trp, Phe, Leu, and Val) together with three basic Lys residues at positions 6, 10, and 12 (Fig. 4A). To reveal the requirements for NOS2 palmitoylation, we designed mutations in amino acids located at the N-terminal end of full-length NOS2-GFP (boxed in Fig. 4A) that included an additional Cys residue at position 2 as well as mutants P4K, P4K/W5K, K6E, K6E/K10E, and P4E/K6E (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence data indicated that all the full-length chimeras were excluded from the cell nucleus and associated with perinuclear areas to a different extent (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, introduction of an additional palmitoylable Cys residue rendered a mutant protein that partially associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). Although the substitution of hydrophobic residues for basic residues only seem to result in limited changes when compared with the wild-type phenotype, the introduction of acidic residues at the N-terminal end of NOS2 yielded a slight increase in perinuclear labeling, especially in the K6E NOS2 chimera (Fig. 4B). Because NOS2 activity has been shown to be inhibited by synthetic caveolin peptides (24García-Cardena G. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Skidd P.M. Couet J. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

We report here that the two leucines in the Leu-Glu-Met-Leu-Ala-Pro core motif of a 20-residue peptide corresponding to the sequence around Pro564 in HIF-1α can be replaced by many residues with no or only a modest decrease in its substrate properties or in some cases even a slight increase.

The acidic residues present in the 20-residue peptide also played a distinct role, but alanine substitution for any six of them, and in some combinations even three of them, had no negative effects. Substitution of the proline by 3,4-dehydroproline or l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, but not any other residue, led to a high rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation with no hydroxylation.

The human α subunit has three isoforms, HIF-1α to HIF-3α, of which HIF-1α and HIF-2α are expressed constitutively but are rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions (for reviews see Refs. 1Semenza G.L.

This degradation is mediated by the oxygen-sensitive degradation domain, which contains two critical proline residues. Hydroxylation of at least one of these to 4-hydroxyproline is essential for the binding of HIFα to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and for the subsequent rapid proteasomal degradation (5Ivan M.

All P4Hs belong to the family of 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases and require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (12Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J.

The Km values of the three human HIF-P4Hs for O2 are slightly above the concentration of dissolved O2 in the air (17Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol.

The dimer is then translocated to the nucleus, where it becomes bound to the HIF-responsive elements in a number of hypoxia-inducible genes, such as those for erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glycolytic enzymes, and glucose transporters (1Semenza G.L.

The two critical proline residues in human HIF-1α, Pro402 and Pro564, are located in the Leu-Thr-Leu-Leu-Ala-Pro-Ala and Leu-Glu-Met-Leu-Ala-Pro-Tyr sequences, respectively. Pro564 is the principal hydroxylation site (8Masson N. William C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 10Epstein A.C.R.

All three HIF-P4Hs also hydroxylated 19-residue peptides corresponding to the Cand N-terminal hydroxylation sites in HIF-2α and one in HIF-3α, with the sequences Leu-Glu-Thr-Leu-Ala-Pro-Tyr, Leu-Ala-Gln-Leu-Ala-Pro-Thr, and Leu-Glu-Met-Leu-Ala-Pro-Tyr, respectively, although the second of these had distinctly higher Km values than the other two (17Hirsilä M.

These data are in agreement with the suggestion that the hydroxylation may involve a conserved core sequence Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro (8Masson N. William C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

Initial mutagenesis experiments in fact indicated that substitution of Leu562 by Ala or Ala563 by Gly may prevent any hydroxylation (5Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 9Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). A more recent study has demonstrated, however, that Leu562 → Val, Leu562 → Ala, and Ala563 → Ser mutants were utilized by the three HIF-P4Hs only marginally less effectively than a wild-type substrate, whereas Leu559 → Val was utilized somewhat less effectively (18Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Leu574 has recently been identified as an additional important residue for hydroxylation (19Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K.W. Tian Y-M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. Faseb J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which agrees with the previous finding that the deletion of two residues, Gln573 and Leu574, from the C terminus of a 19-residue HIF-1α C-terminal peptide increased the Km values for HIF-P4Hs 1 and 2 ∼9- and 7-fold, respectively, although the Km for HIF-P4H-3 was unaltered, and the Vmax values for all three isoenzymes were likewise unaffected (17Hirsilä M.

Pro402 and Pro564 have several acidic residues in their vicinity, but mutation of Asp556, Asp558, Glu560, Asp569, or Asp570 to asparagine appeared to have little effect on the hydroxylation (6Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y-M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A.V. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). An Asp558 → Ala and Glu560 → Gln double mutant also served as a substrate, although less efficiently than the wild-type substrate, whereas an Asp569 → Asn, Asp570 → Asn, and Asp571 → Asn triple mutant failed to act as a substrate at all (18Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The C-P4Hs catalyze an uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of all cosubstrates but in the absence of any peptide substrate at a rate that is ∼0.5–1% of that of the hydroxylation reaction observed in the presence of a saturating concentration of the peptide substrate (12Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Some peptides that become bound to the C-P4Hs but do not act as substrates enhance the rate of the uncoupled decarboxylation, but it still remains below ∼2% of that of the complete reaction (12Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 14Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, substitution of the hydroxylatable proline in a peptide substrate by 3,4-dehydroproline gave an uncoupled decarboxylation rate similar to the hydroxylation rate with the nonmodified peptide (21Wu M. Moon H-S. Pirskanen A. Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Begley T.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 1511-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). No data are currently available to indicate whether substitution of the hydroxylatable proline in HIFα model peptides would lead to a similar high rate of uncoupled decarboxylation. We studied here the sequence requirements of the three human HIF-P4Hs by systematically varying each residue preceding the proline in the Leu-Glu-Met-Leu-Ala-Pro sequence of a 20-residue peptide corresponding to the C-terminal hydroxylation site in HIF-1α. In addition, we studied in detail the effects of substitution of any of six of the seven acidic residues in this peptide by alanine, either alone or in combination with other acidic residues and substitution of the hydroxylatable proline by proline analogues. Our data indicate that the two leucines can be replaced by many residues with either no significant decrease or only a modest decrease in substrate properties and that the glutamate and methionine can well be replaced by most, although not all, amino acids, whereas the alanine is a relatively strict requirement. Any of the six acidic residues studied could be substituted by alanine with no decrease in the substrate properties, and even three of them could be substituted in some combinations with no negative effects. Peptides in which the proline was replaced by either 3,4-dehydroproline or l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid gave a very high rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation. The data obtained with the three HIF-P4Hs were in most cases similar, but in some cases HIF-P4H-3 showed distinctly different properties. Generation of Recombinant Baculoviruses for the Expression of FLAGHis-tagged HIF-P4H Isoenzymes—The FLAGHis tag was amplified by PCR from the plasmid d28e6 (Fibrogen Inc.) and cloned into the 3′ ends before the stop codons of the recombinant human HIF-P4H isoenzymes 1, 2, and 3 in the pVL baculovirus expression vector (17Hirsilä M.

Leu559 and Leu562 Can Be Substituted by Many Other Residues with Relatively Small Effects—The 20-residue control peptide used as a substrate in the present study corresponds to the hydroxylation site around Pro564 in HIF-1α and has the sequence 554DTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQ573. It differs from the 19-residue peptide used previously (17Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) in that it contains two additional residues in its N terminus and lacks one, Leu574, in its C terminus. The Km values of a purified version of this peptide for HIF-P4Hs 1, 2, and 3 are 15, 25, and 5 μm, respectively (see below). Because of the high cost of synthetic peptides, all of the initial experiments were performed using crude peptide preparations of less than 50% purity. The nominal peptide concentrations used in the initial experiments were 200 μm, but because of the low degree of purity, the true concentrations were less than 100 μm. Thus the concentration of the control peptide used for HIF-P4Hs 1 and 2 may have been less than 4–6.5 times the Km, and that for HIF-P4H-3 may have been less than 20 times the Km. Consequently, the assays may have been insensitive for substitutions that cause only relatively small Km effects with no changes in Vmax, especially in the case of HIF-P4H-3. Enzyme activity was assayed based on measurement of the radioactivity of the 14CO2 formed during the hydroxylation-coupled stoichiometric decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate using Triton X-100 buffer extracts of homogenates of insect cells expressing recombinant HIF-P4Hs as sources of the enzymes (17Hirsilä M.

https://openalex.org/W2046780323,"KChIP proteins regulate Shal, Kv4.x, channel expression by binding to a conserved sequence at the N terminus of the subunit. The binding of KChIP facilitates a redistribution of Kv4 protein to the cell surface, producing a large increase in current along with significant changes in channel gating kinetics. Recently we have shown that mutants of Kv4.2 lacking the ability to bind an intersubunit Zn2+ between their T1 domains fail to form functional channels because they are unable to assemble to tetramers and remain trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we find that KChIPs are capable of rescuing the function of Zn2+ site mutants by driving the mutant subunits to assemble to tetramers. Thus, in addition to known trafficking effects, KChIPs play a direct role in subunit assembly by binding to monomeric subunits within the endoplasmic reticulum and promoting tetrameric channel assembly. Zn2+-less Kv4.2 channels expressed with KChIP3 demonstrate several distinct kinetic changes in channel gating, including a reduced time to peak and faster entry into the inactivated state as well as extending the time to recover from inactivation by 3–4 fold.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 19-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The common functional core of all Kv channels assembles as a tetramer of pore-forming α-subunits. This tetramer is the core of the future ion channel signal transduction complex, but additional folding steps as well as interactions with auxiliary proteins occur before the final functional channel complex at the cell surface is formed. Many auxiliary subunit proteins that bind to Kv α-subunits have been identified, but precisely when these interactions occur during channel complex formation and what role these interactions play in helping the channels to assemble, traffic, and function are topics of great interest (1Deutsch C.

Through the use of heterologous expression systems and mutagenesis studies, we can expose many of these important interactions and folding events, and reveal the processes by which Kv channel complexes form. A comparison of channel expression and functional properties with and without specific auxiliary proteins reveals how these different processes contribute to the formation and function of ion channel complexes. An early step in Kv channel formation involves the tetramerization of the α-subunit T1 domains at the cytoplasmic N terminus of the protein (5Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 6Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28595-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For Kv4.2 channels, a critical component of the T1 domain interaction involves the coordination of an intersubunit Zn2+ ion found on non-Shaker type Kv channel T1 domains (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Nanao M.H. Zhou W. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Proc.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47885-47890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although Zn2+ binding sites are common in proteins, intersubunit Zn2+ binding sites, as found in the T1 domain, are relatively rare. To determine what functions might be regulated by the T1 intersubunit Zn2+ site, we generated a series of mutations to the Zn2+ coordination residues and tested them for cell surface expression (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We found that mutation to any of the Zn2+ binding site amino acids caused a block of functional channel expression by disrupting subunit tetramerization. This disruption traps the protein within the endoplasmic reticulum and produces a shift in the migration of solubilized subunits on size exclusion chromatography to monomeric molecular weights (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can clearly say that one important function of the Zn2+ site is to stabilize channel assembly. Because functional channels could not be formed without the intact Zn2+ site, we sought to determine if it was possible to rescue these mutant channels by co-expression with KChIP auxiliary subunit proteins that are known to enhance Shal channel expression by 10–50 times (3An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Kv4.2 subunits form channels in the absence of KChIP auxiliary proteins; however, co-expression with KChIP enhances current expression by altering the trafficking of Kv4 channels (11Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I. Sweatt J.D. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

KChIP auxiliary subunits interact with Kv4.2 channels by binding to the first 14 residues of the cytoplasmic N terminus and possibly through direct binding interactions with the T1 domain (3An W.F.

Also, the KChIP subunit itself is capable of multimeric interactions following binding to the Kv4 N terminus, providing an alternative and non-zinc-dependent pathway to channel complex multimerization (12Zhou W. Qian Y. Kunjilwar K. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The KChIP enhancement of expression has been attributed to a trafficking action of KChIPs, causing channel proteins to redistribute to the cell surface (3An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 11Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R.

The mechanism responsible for this redistribution is not known. KChIPs could be acting to enhance channel assembly, enhance folding of the assembled channels, block the action of a retention sequence on Kv4.2 N terminus, providing a stronger surface expression motif to the channel complex, or a combination of effects (1Deutsch C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 19-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to increasing expression, KChIP binding to the Kv4.2 N terminus modulates the functional gating properties of the channels. The most dramatic effects are on the inactivation properties of the channels, where KChIP drastically slows inactivation and speeds the recovery from inactivation. Inactivation is an important feedback mechanism that limits Shal channel function at depolarized potentials and gives these channels their characteristic “A” current waveform. The N terminus of Kv4.2 is clearly involved in inactivation gating, since deletion of this region produces slowed inactivation. Moreover, experiments on the functional properties of the N terminus show that it can act as a pore-binding peptide (15Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Gebauer M. Isbrandt D. Sauter K. Callsen B. Nolting A. Pongs O. Bahring R. Biophys.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 471-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, the gating changes produced by KChIPs might depend on the binding and sequestering of the Kv4 N terminus, causing an alteration to a complex set of allosteric interactions that involve other structural elements of the channel (18Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S.

Here we have tested whether KChIP3 binding promotes assembly of the Zn2+ site mutant Kv4.2 subunit proteins by testing for the rescue of channel tetramerization and cell surface function by KChIP3. We then characterized the resultant complexes as to their assembly and biophysical properties in comparison to wild-type Kv4.2 co-expressed with KChIP3. DNA Subcloning—Rat Kv4.2 cDNA was obtained as a gift from the L. Jan laboratory (pBS-rKv4.2). The Kv4.2 coding region was transferred to a cytomegalovirus-based vector (Clontech, Inc.), and also used to generate a vector for bacterial expression of the T1 domain, as described previously (8Strang C.

KChIP3 was obtained as an EST clone, 2403205, and inserted into the same vector using available XhoI + NotI restriction sites. In addition, as previously described (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), zinc coordinate site mutants were made using the QuikChange™ strategy and reagents (Stratagene, Inc.), with oligonucleotides that were 36–48 bases in length. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis through the entire coding region. Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 40 μg/ml l-proline, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Transfection—CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs using Lipofectamine, as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.). Enhanced GFP (EGFP, Clontech) was coexpressed with the channel to assess transfection efficiency and to identify expressing cells for voltage clamp experiments (26Lilliehook C. Bozdagi O. Yao J. Gomez-Ramirez M. Zaidi N.F. Wasco W. Gandy S. Santucci A.C. Haroutunian V. Huntley G.W. Buxbaum J.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9097-9106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto cover slips. At 18–24 h, confluency of the cells was about 50–60% and considered optimal for transfection. We used a mixture of 0.5 μg of cDNA (Kv4.2 or zinc site mutants), 0.5 μg of GFP, and 3 μl of Lipofectamine in 0.5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for about 2 h after which regular medium was restored. All the recordings were done 18–20 h after transfection. For the Kv4.2 and KChIP3 ratio study, total cDNA used per transfection was fixed at 4.5 μg. The Kv4.2 cDNA level was fixed at 0.8 μg and EGFP cDNA at 0.5 μg in the transfection mix. Different amounts of KChIP3 were used to generate the different expression ratios. Red fluorescent protein cDNA was used as a filler to keep the cDNA total amount fixed. Transfection was carried out as described above. Recordings were done at 18–20 h after transfection. For the comparative studies on the effects of different KChIP3 ratios, the experiment was performed identically with the zinc triple mutant (Kv4.2(-ZnB3)) cDNA level also fixed to 0.8 μg. Because of the limited cDNA capacity of our transfection reagent, this experimental design limited us to a maximal Kv4.2 to KChIP3 cDNA ratio of 4:1. Therefore we could not test whether the mutant expression had completely plateaued. However, a Student's t test between wild type and mutant at this cDNA ratio revealed no significant difference in the expression level. Electrophysiology—Ionic currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using whole cell voltage clamp configuration (27Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1849-C1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Current stimulus protocols and data collection were controlled by pClamp 6.05 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The pipette contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.133 CaCl. The calculated free Ca2+ concentration was ∼10 nm at pH 7.4. The bath solution was (in mm): 2 KCl, 138 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Data were collected at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Transfected cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy using an inverted Diaphot microscope (Nikon, Inc.) equipped for fluorescence detection. Pipettes were pulled on a microprocessor-controlled, multiple stage puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) from borosilicate tubing with resistance from 0.9–1.2 MΩ. Whole cell currents were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz (-3 dB, four pole Bessel filter). Series resistance was compensated by 90–95%. Data were leak-subtracted online using P/8 protocol. The holding potential was -80 mV. Records were digitized with a Digidata-1200B A/D converter (Axon Instruments) and stored directly on a hard disk using pClamp version 6.0.5. All recordings were done at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Transfected cells were solubilized in CHAPS (2% final concentration) and run on a Superose 6 column using an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system as described previously (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fractions were run on SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotted to determine the fractions containing the proteins of interest. Molecular weight standards were run and the standard curve corrected to the appropriate fraction by the dead time between the detector and collector. Kv4.2 protein often runs as a doublet on SDS-PAGE gel, with a fraction of the protein running at a high molecular size. There was no difference in the FPLC profiles for these two bands, and the higher molecular size band appeared to be protein that either remained tetrameric or aggregated in the running of the gel. The Western blots in Fig. 3 only show the profile for the immunoreactive material at the correct size for Kv4.2, ∼70 kDa. Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed using Clampfit version 6.0.5 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 6.1 software (Microcal Software, Inc.). Pooled data are expressed as mean + S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups of data were carried out with the two-tailed Student's t test for paired or unpaired data or 1 way ANOVA using Origin and Analyze-it for Excel (Analyze-it Software). Tests of significance were performed based on standard hypothesis testing approaches. The analysis method of choice depended upon the null hypothesis to be tested: comparison of two variables or sets of variables. Student's t tests were performed to determine if a single measured variable was significantly different between mutant and wild type. ANOVA comparisons were performed to test if a variable range was significantly different between mutant and wild type; for example, if mutants produce overall changes in the time constants of inactivation. Similarly ANOVA comparisons were used to test whether a channel property, such as inactivation time constant, showed significant changes with voltage for mutant or wild type. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Reversal Potential Measurement—Cells were stepped to +50 mV for 15 ms and then to different potentials from -140 mV to +50 mV at 10 mV steps. The holding potential was at -80 mV. An I-V curve was plotted with the peak tail current as y-axis and command potentials as x-axis. The potential where the peak tail current intersected the x-axis was recorded as the reversal potential. Under typical recording conditions, reversal potential was measured as approximately -90 mV. KChIP3 Rescues Function of Zn2+ Site Mutant—The interaction of KChIP auxiliary subunits with Kv4.2 α-subunits is an important step in the formation of functional A-type Kv channels (3An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 11Shibata R.

We were interested in testing if the intersubunit interactions of KChIPs might also have a direct role in channel assembly beyond their established role in redistributing channels onto the cell surface. In order to test this hypothesis, we sought to determine if KChIP co-expression could rescue the loss of A-current produced by Zn2+ site assembly mutants of Kv4.2. For rat Kv4.2, the residues involved in coordination of Zn2+ are His105, Cys111, Cys132, and Cys133 (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that mutations to these sites eliminate functional channel expression by disruption of subunit assembly and trapping of monomeric subunits on intracellular membranes (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For these studies, we have adopted the following nomenclature to refer to these mutations: single mutants are indicated by the mutation in parentheses after the construct name; multiple mutants are called Kv4.2(-ZnB) for “minus Zn2+ binding,” with a specific number to indicate the sites mutated. Thus, Kv4.2(-ZnB2) has the mutations C132A and C133A. Kv4.2(-ZnB3) has the additional mutation C111A, and Kv4.2(-ZnB4) has the additional mutation H105A. In general, we have focused our studies on the Kv4.2(-ZnB3) mutant, lacking all 3 coordinating Cys residues, but have performed complementary expression, assembly, and biophysical studies on other -ZnB mutants and EGFP-tagged versions of these channels, and found that they behave similarly. As expected from our previous results, wild-type Kv4.2 expression produces A-currents in CHO cells (Fig. 1A); however, the Kv4.2(-ZnB3) mutant showed no functional expression without KChIP co-expression (Fig. 1B and Ref. 8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With co-transfection of KChIP3 at a 1:1 cDNA ratio, wild-type Kv4.2 shows a large increase in functional A-current (see Fig. 1C). Interestingly, co-expression with KChIP3 rescues Kv4.2(-ZnB3) mutant subunits, producing functional A-current; however, the level of current seen is only ∼25% of that seen with wild-type Kv4.2 channels (Fig. 1D). We confirmed this basic finding with several other Zn2+ site mutants, and the summary results are presented in Fig. 2A. Although none of the Zn2+ mutants functioned without KChIP3, they were all rescued to a similar degree, ∼25% of wild type, when co-expressed with KChIP3 at a 1:1 cDNA ratio.Fig. 2KChIP3 rescues Zn2+ site mutants. A, functional peak current expression levels with 1:1 co-expression of KChIP3 cDNA with different Zn2+ site mutants of Kv4.2 in CHO-K1 cells recorded at +50 mV. Currents normalized by cell size as measured by cell capacitance. Summary data shown for all constructs with and without KChIP3 addition. Only wild-type Kv4.2 shows any functional current without KChIP. All 5 tested Zn2+ site mutants were functionally rescued to a level of expression ∼25% of that seen with wild-type Kv4.2 co-expressed with KChIP3. A similar rescue of function is seen with EGFP-tagged versions of these mutants (data not shown). One-tailed Student's t tests compared with wild type showed that expression of all mutants were significantly reduced compared with wild type. A one-way ANOVA between the mutants revealed no significant difference between expression levels of different mutants. B, dose response for KChIP3 increase in current expression is right-shifted with Kv4.2(-ZnB3) mutants. CHO-K1 cells were expressed with a constant amount of channel cDNA and differing ratios of KChIP3 cDNA. The total level of cDNA was kept constant in all experiments. Currents were recorded 24 h after transfection. Wild-type Kv4.2 currents (open squares) peak with KChIP3 cDNA at one-tenth (ratio = 0.1) the level of channel cDNA. Mutant Kv4.2(-ZnB3) currents (filled squares) do not reach the same level of expression until the KChIP3 cDNA is 4× greater than channel cDNA(ratio = 4.0). Boltzmann curves were fitted to the data sets and the half-maximal response cDNA ratio, R½, was measured for both Kv4.2 and Kv4.2(-ZnB3). The measured R½ for KChIP3 expression of the Kv4.2(-ZnB3) mutant is 40× greater than for wild-type Kv4.2. One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between the curves for mutant and wild type. A Student's t test performed on the measured half-maximal response cDNA ratio showed a significant difference between mutant and wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether this reduced expression level could be further enhanced with higher levels of KChIP3 expression, we boosted the KChIP3 cDNA levels to be 4× greater than Kv4.2 and retested for A-current levels. Under these conditions, there was no change in wild-type Kv4.2 expression (Fig. 1E); however, the Kv4.2(-ZnB3) current is now 4× larger, reaching the same level of functional expression seen with wild-type channels (Fig. 1F). Higher KChIP3 Levels Are Required to See Zn2+ Mutant Expression—The previous results suggest that there is a distinct dose response relationship for KChIP3 enhancement of Kv4.2 channels versus Kv4.2(-ZnB3). To further explore this effect, we kept the channel cDNA level constant and varied the amount of KChIP3 cDNA, keeping the total amount of cDNA constant. Fig. 2B shows the results of a dose response experiment using different ratios of wild-type Kv4.2 and KChIP3 cDNA. With wild-type Kv4.2, significant increases in current are seen with a 1:30 ratio of KChIP3 to Kv4.2 (Fig. 2B; ratio = 0.033). At a 1:10 ratio (Fig. 2B; ratio = 0.1), the enhancement of expression is maximal, and no further increases in current are seen with higher levels of KChIP3 cDNA. The 10-fold lower requirement for KChIP3 cDNA is likely caused by more efficient synthesis of this soluble protein compared with the synthesis of the polytransmembrane channel protein. With Kv4.2(-ZnB3), the dose response relationship is significantly different, with additional KChIP cDNA required for maximal current expression. No expression of channels was observed with a 1:10 ratio of KChIP3 to Kv4.2(-ZnB3) (see Fig. 2B; ratio = 0.1). Expression was first evident at a ratio of 1:4 (Fig. 2B; ratio = 0.25), with increasing current at increasing KChIP3 to Kv4.2(-ZnB3) ratios until functional expression levels comparable to wild-type channels were achieved at a KChIP3 to Kv4.2 ratio of 4:1 (Fig. 2B; ratio = 4.0). Although, the cDNA ratios obviously do not accurately reflect the amount of protein being expressed, the 40-fold right shift in the curve with Kv4.2(-ZnB3) suggests that a mass action effect is occurring, where KChIP3 binding to Zn2+ site mutant channel subunits is driving functional expression of these channels. These results strongly support our previous hypothesis that the loss of function produced by Zn2+ site mutations is a specific problem in the assembly of the channel rather than a complete nonspecific disruption of the subunit protein, and suggest that the primary action of KChIP3 is to overcome this assembly defect (8Strang C.

To further confirm this conclusion, we sought to determine whether the assembly state of the channel had indeed changed following KChIP3 co-expression. Tetramerization of Zn2+ Site Mutants—Our previous studies have shown that the Kv4.2(-ZnB) subunit protein runs as a monomer on SEC-FPLC compared with the normal tetrameric position of the wild-type channel (8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In order to test the hypothesis that KChIP3 was rescuing the function of Kv4.2(-ZnB) by driving tetramer assembly, cells were transfected with KChIP3 and Kv4.2, either with or without Zn2+ site mutations, and then the proteins were solubilized and the channel assembly state characterized by SEC. In the absence of KChIPs, wild-type Kv4.2 runs in fractions consistent with its self-assembly into tetramers, whereas Kv4.2(-ZnB3) is found in lower molecular size fractions consistent with monomers (see Fig. 3A and Ref. 8Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following co-expression of wild-type Kv4.2 with KChIP3, the channel remains in the tetrameric fractions (Fig. 3B). KChIP3 is found to co-migrate with the channel in addition to the normal low molecular mass position seen for unassembled KChIP3, indicating a stable incorporation into the channel complex (see Fig. 3C). Although KChIP addition is expected to increase the channel protein mass by ∼25%, there was no large change in the position of the channel protein in the fractionation, suggesting that KChIP3 is tightly integrating into the structure and not significantly increasing the hydrodynamic radius.

Although IκBSR neither affected thrombopoietin-dependent nor gp130-mediated growth, it suppressed interleukin-3- and erythropoietin-dependent growth at low concentrations. In addition, IκBSR enhanced factor-deprived apoptosis through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). When expressed in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, IκBSR induced apoptosis even in the presence of appropriate cytokines by accumulating ROS. We also expressed IκBSR in an inducible fashion at various stages of hematopoiesis using the OP9 system, in which hematopoietic cells are induced to develop from embryonic stem cells. When IκBSR was expressed at the stage of Flk-1+ cells (putative hemangioblasts), IκBSR inhibited the development of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells by inducing apoptosis through the ROS accumulation. Furthermore, when IκBSR was expressed after the development of hematopoietic progenitor cells, it inhibited their terminal differentiation toward erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and granulocytes by inducing apoptosis through the ROS accumulation. These results indicate that NF-κB is required for preventing apoptosis at multiple steps of hematopoiesis by eliminating ROS.

These results indicate that NF-κB is required for preventing apoptosis at multiple steps of hematopoiesis by eliminating ROS. The Rel/NF-κB family consists of five members (c-Rel, p65 (RelA), RelB, p50 (NF-B1), and p52 (NF-B2)) (1Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 2Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar). Each subunit shares a conserved N-terminal domain that encompasses sequences required for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization that is called the Rel homology domain. c-Rel, p65, and RelB each possess distinct transactivation domains in the C terminus, whereas p50 and p52, consisting of the only N-terminal domain, lack these intrinsic transactivation domains. Although these members form homodimers or heterodimers in various combinations, a heterodimer, p65/p50, is the most common form in mammalian cells and is specifically called NF-κB. Under the unstimulated condition, the major proportion of Rel/NF-κB is retained in cytoplasm by its inhibitor IκB proteins as an inactive complex. Various stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and viruses activate the IκB kinase complex and phosphorylate IκB. Upon phosphorylation, IκB is degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The released Rel/NF-κB enters the nucleus, binds to target DNA elements, and initiates transcription. Until now, Rel/NF-κB has been reported to promote the expression of over 150 target genes that regulate immune response, stress response, cell growth, or survival. Mice homozygous for null mutations in genes encoding Rel/NF-κB subunits have revealed the unique roles of each family member protein (3Attar R.M. Caamano J. Carrasco D. Iotsova V. Ishikawa H.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6888-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although p65 is not essential for the generation of mature hematopoietic cells, p65–/– mice are embryonic lethal at embryonic day 15 because of the massive apoptosis in the liver (5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Also, the cells from p65–/– mice are susceptible to apoptosis induced by various reagents. In contrast, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52 are dispensable for embryogenesis. c-Rel is specifically expressed in lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and erythroid cells. Although the number of hematopoietic cells is normal in c-Rel–/– mice, both T- and B-lymphocytes have defects in proliferative responses to various mitogens, isotype switching, and cytokine production (6Gerondakis S.

Also, mutant mice lacking RelB, which is specifically expressed in dendric cells and B-lymphocytes, exhibit defects in acquired and innate immunity (10Burkly L. Hession C. Ogata L. Reilly C.

However, p50–/– mice reveal multiple defects in the immune system (12Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Mature quiescent p50–/– B-lymphocytes are susceptible to apoptosis and show poor proliferative responses to the CD40 ligand and lipopolysaccharide (8Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A.

Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Also, knockout mice for p52, of which expression is restricted to the epithelium of the stomach and selected areas of hematopoietic organs such as the thymic medulla and the marginal zone of the spleen, show abnormalities in splenic and lymph node structure (13Caamano J.H. Rizzo C.A. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Raventos-Suarez C. Snapper C.M. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 14Franzoso G. Carlson L. Poljak L. Shores E.W.

These lines of evidence suggest that Rel/NF-κB family proteins are solely important for immune responses mediated by B- and T-lymphocytes. However, the redundancy among these family members was supposed to veil certain phenotypes in the single mutant mice. This hypothesis was supported by the subsequent findings that mice lacking two Rel/NF-κB subunits exhibit novel phenotypes or exaggerated versions of those seen in the single mutants. Examples include the blockage of lymphocyte development in p50–/–p65–/– mice (15Horwitz B.H. Scott M.L. Cherry S.R. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1997; 6: 765-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), greater severity of the inflammatory disease in p50–/–RelB–/– mice than observed in RelB–/– mice (16Weih F.

Furthermore, the combined loss of c-Rel and p65 was shown to result in impaired erythropoiesis and deregulated expansion of granulocytes by transplantation experiments, indicating that, besides lymphopoiesis, Rel/NF-κB is also required for normal hematopoiesis in the other lineages (18Grossmann M.

However, at present, the precise roles of NF-κB in hematopoiesis in the respective lineage remain undetermined. Also, molecular mechanism through which Rel/NF-κB family proteins regulate hematopoiesis is still unknown.

Although ROS are required for the physiologic function of the cells, excessive ROS cause apoptosis through several mechanisms such as activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and/or direct activation of caspase cascades (21Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, ROS are eliminated by antioxidant enzymes. The scavenger enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD) (MnSOD or Cu/ZnSOD), converts superoxide anions to H2O2. H2O2 is subsequently detoxified by catalase or glutathione peroxidase (19Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 20Rhee S.G. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This redox regulation is essential for protecting cells from apoptosis. In the present study, we expressed IκBSR, which can inhibit the function of Rel/NF-κB family proteins as a dominant negative mutant, in IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 and normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and assessed its effects on cytokine-dependent growth and survival. We also evaluated the roles for NF-κB by expressing IκBSR in an inducible manner at various stage of hematopoiesis using the OP9 system, in which hematopoietic cells are induced to develop from embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found here that Rel/NF-κB family proteins play critical roles in preventing apoptosis at multiple steps of hematopoiesis by eliminating ROS.

The sequences of primer sets (a sense primer/an antisense primer) were as follows: Bcl-2, 5′-CTTAGAAAATACAGCATTGCGGAG-3′/5′-GGATGTGCTTTGCATTCTTGG-3′; Bcl-XL, 5′-CACTGTGCGTGGAAAGCGTA-3′/5′-AAAGTGTCCCAGCCGCC-3′; A1, 5′-GATGGCTGAGTCTGAGCTCA-3′/5′-GGCAATCTGCTCTTGTGGAA-3′; MnSOD, 5′-GACCTGCCTTACGACTATGG-3′/5′-GACCTTGCTCCTTATTGAAGC-3′; glutathione peroxidase, 5′-TCGAACCTGACATAGAAACCCT3′/5′-CACCATCATGGAAGAACCG-3′; TRX, 5′-ATCATTTTGCAAGGTCCACA-3′/5′-CAAGGAAGCTTTTCAGGAGG-3′; xanthine oxidase, 5′TTATGTCCCTACTCGCCACA-3′/5′-TGGTGGCTTGGCAGATATAA3′; Prdx1, 5′-GAGCAGCCAGAAGAAACTCTTG-3′/5′-AGAAGATTGGTCTGCCCAAAA-3′; and β-actin, 5′-CATCACTATTGGCAACGAGC-3′/5′-ACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCC-3′. Immunoblot Analysis—Isolation of total cellular lysate, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (26Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Measurement of the Intracellular Glutathione—The amount of intracellular glutathione was measured using the glutathione assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Stable and Inducible Expression of IκBSR in Ba/F3 Cells—A murine IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 was cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 ng/ml of murine IL-3. To stably express IκBSR in Ba/F3 cells, we transfected 30 μg of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing IκBSR by electroporation (300 V, 960 microfarads). After the culture with 1.0 mg/ml of G418, several single clones and a mixed clone were subjected to further analyses. To inducibly express IκBSR, we used a LacSwitch™ II inducible expression system (Stratagene) as described previously (27Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Wakao H. Hattori S. Hashimoto K. Sugahara H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In short, we initially transfected an expression vector for Lac repressor into Ba/F3 cells. After the culture with hygromycin, we selected one clone in which Lac repressor was most intensively expressed. We further transfected pOPRSVI containing IκBSR into this clone and cultured with G418. In this system, the expression of the target cDNA is initiated when isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is added to the culture medium. We selected several clones in which IκBSR was effectively induced by IPTG and performed further experiments. We further introduce the EPO receptor, TPO receptor, and G-CSFR/gp130 consisting of the extracellular domain of G-CSFR and cytoplasmic domain of gp130 (28Kataoka Y. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Nakata S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44178-44187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) into a Lacinducible IκBSR clone using the puromycin (Puro)-resistant plasmid. OP9 System to Develop Hematopoietic Cells from ES Cells—E14tg2a ES cells and OP9 stromal cells were maintained as described previously (29Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 30Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). To induce differentiation toward hematopoietic cells, ES cells were deprived of leukemia inhibitory factor and seeded onto confluent OP9 cells on six-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. After 4.5 days, the cells were harvested by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and Flk-1+ cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting. The sorted cells were replated onto OP9 cells at a density of 105 cells/well of 6-well plate or 7–8 × 105 cells/10-cm dish and cultured under the indicated conditions. Tetracycline-regulated Inducible Expression of IκBSR in ES Cells—To inducibly express IκBSR in ES cells, we utilized a Tet-off system as reported previously (31Era T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in which transcription of the target mRNA is initiated in response to the removal of Tet. Briefly, we initially introduced pCAG20 –1-tTA and pUHD10 –3-puro by electroporation (800 V, 3 microfarads). pCAG20 –1-tTA stably expresses the Tet-regulated transactivator under the control of the modified chicken β-actin promoter, and pUHD10 –3-puro contains the Puro-resistant gene downstream of the Tet-off-cytomegalovirus promoter. Thus, if the Tet-off system efficiently works in the transfected cells, these cells are expected to be Puro-resistant in the Tet– medium and Puro-sensitive in the Tet+ medium. According to this method, we selected one ES clone designated E14 by the culture with 1 μg/ml of Puro and/or 1 μg/ml of Tet, in which the Tet-regulatory system works most effectively. We further transfected pUHD10 –3-IκBSR-IRES-GFP, which can inducibly express IκBSR and GFP as a single mRNA through internal ribosome entry site in response to the removal of Tet, together with the neomycin-resistant plasmid pcDNA3.1-neo. After the culture with 0.2 mg/ml of G418 in the Tet+ medium, we selected several clones that can inducibly express GFP in response to the Tet deprivation. Subsequently, we examined the Tet-regulated expression of IκBSR in the Tet+ and Tet– medium in these clones, and one clone was subjected to further analyses. Preparation of Conditioned Media Containing High Titer Retrovirus Particles—The conditioned media containing high titer retrovirus particles were prepared as described previously (25Ezoe S. Matsumura I. Nakata S. Gale K. Ishihara K. Minegishi N. Machii T. Kitamura T. Yamamoto M. Enver T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, pMSCV-IκBSR-neo or an empty pMSCV-neo (Clontech) was transfected into an ecotropic packaging cell line Plat-E. After 12 h, the cells were washed and cultured for 48 h. Then the supernatant containing virus particles was collected, centrifuged, and concentrated by 50-fold in volume. Retrovirus Transfection into Murine Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells—Bone marrow cells were harvested from 9–12-week-old Balb/c mice pretreated with 150 mg/kg of 5-fluorouracil for 2 days. Lin–Sca-1+ cells were isolated with MACS™ (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of murine (m) IL-3 (10 ng/ml), mSCF (50 ng/ml), mFLT3 ligand (L) (10 ng/ml), and human (h) IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. Then the cells were cultured with 10% volume of conditioned media containing high titer retrovirus and 8 mg/ml of polybrene. After 24 h, the cells were washed and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, the above described cytokines, and 1 mg/ml of G418 for 48 h. Colony Assays—Retrovirus-transduced 1 × 105 cells were cultured in the methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies) containing 1 mg/ml of G418 and cytokines (mSCF 50 ng/ml, mIL-3 10 ng/ml, hIL-6 10 ng/ml, and EPO 3 units/ml) in 35-mm dishes. The number of colonies was counted after 16 days. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. IκBSR Partially Suppressed Cytokine-dependent Growth of Ba/F3 Cells—To examine the roles for Rel/NF-κB in the growth of hematopoietic cells, we stably expressed DN-NF-κB (IκBSR) in a murine IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3; we designated two single clones as Ba/F3/IκBSRCl1 and Ba/F3/IκBSRCl2 and a mixed clone as Ba/F3/IκBSRMix, respectively. We also prepared several Lac-inducible clones from Ba/F3 cells, in which IκBSR was inducibly expressed by the IPTG treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panel), IκBSR was intensively expressed in Ba/F3/IκBSRCl1, Ba/F3/IκBSRCl2, and Ba/F3/IκBSRMix, but not in Ba/F3/Mock. Also, the expression of IκBSR was effectively induced by the IPTG treatment in Lac-inducible clones (Fig. 1A, right panel). To examine the effects of IκBSR on cytokine-dependent growth of Ba/F3 cells, we further introduced EPO receptor, TPO receptor, and G-CSFR/gp130. As shown in Fig. 1B, these clones dose-dependently proliferated in response to IL-3, EPO, TPO, and the gp130 ligand (gp130L) (we here denote G-CSF as gp130L when it acts on G-CSFR/gp130), respectively. Although IPTG-induced IκBSR did not affect TPO- or gp130L-dependent growth, it significantly inhibited IL-3-dependent growth at low concentrations (from 0.001 to 0.03 ng/ml) with a statistical significance (p < 0.05). Also, IκBSR suppressed EPO-dependent growth at low concentrations (from 0.005 to 0.15 unit/ml) with a statistical significance (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). IκBSR Enhanced Factor-deprived Apoptosis in Ba/F3 Cells— Next, we examined the effects of IκBSR on factor-deprived apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells. In DNA content analysis, a subdiploid fraction formed from apoptotic cells was hardly detectable in Ba/F3/Mock cells under IL-3-deprived conditions up to 24 h (Fig. 1C). In contrast, 55.2% of Ba/F3/IκBSRMix cells led to apoptosis after 24-h IL-3 deprivation, indicating that IκBSR enhanced factor-deprived apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells. We also analyzed the changes of ΔΨm during these cultures by flow cytometric analysis, in which the cells with the decreased ΔΨm are detected as those with the increased green fluorescent intensity and decreased red fluorescent intensity in the lower right area (Fig. 1D). After 18 h of IL-3 depletion, ΔΨm decreased in only 6.2% of Ba/F3/Mock, whereas it decreased in a substantial fraction (31.9%) of Ba/F3/IκBSRMix. As for this mechanism, we found that the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL mRNA declined to an undetectable level in both Ba/F3/Mock and Ba/F3/IκBSR after IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 1E). However, we did not detect an apparent difference in their expression levels between these clones that can explain IκBSR-enhanced apoptosis. IκBSR Accumulated ROS in Ba/F3 Cells—Because Rel/NF-κB is involved in the metabolism of ROS (24Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we examined the state of ROS accumulation in Ba/F3/Mock and Ba/F3/IκBSR during IL-3 deprivation. We detected total ROS with a fluorescent sensor Red CC-1, O2. with dihydroethidium, and H2O2 with CM-H2DCFDA by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, a small amount of total ROS, O2., and H2O2 accumulated in Ba/F3/Mock cells after 12 h of IL-3 starvation. As compared with Ba/F3/Mock cells, a far more increased amount of total ROS, O2, and H2O2 were already accumulated in Ba/F3/IκBSRMix cells even in the presence of IL-3, which did not further increase after IL-3 depletion. To access the roles of ROS in IκBSR-enhanced apoptosis, we overexpressed ROS scavenger enzymes MnSOD and TRX in Ba/F3/IκBSRCl1, respectively. Although Mock-transfected cells led to severe apoptosis after IL-3 depletion, MnSOD and TRX almost completely canceled this apoptosis (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the IκBSR-enhanced apoptosis. IκBSR Inhibited Cytokine-dependent Survival of Normal Hematopoietic Cells—We next analyzed the effects of IκBSR on the growth and survival of normal hematopoietic cells. We introduced IκBSR into murine Lin–Sca-1+ cells with the retrovirus system. After the selection with G418, we further cultured these cells in the presence of IL-3, SCF, IL-6, and FLT3L for 7 days. Although only 11.9% of Mock-transfected cells led to apoptosis, 75.9% of IκBSR-transfected cells underwent apoptosis (Fig. 3A). We also examined the effects of IκBSR on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with colony assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, IκBSR drastically reduced the number of CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM. These results indicated that although IκBSR showed little effect on survival of Ba/F3 cells cultured with an appropriate cytokine, it disrupted cytokine-dependent survival of normal hematopoietic cells. As for this mechanism, we found that although ΔΨm decreased in only 18.7% of Mock-transfected cells, ΔΨm was disrupted in 85.7% of IκBSR-transfected cells after 5 days (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed that total ROS, O2., and H2O2 accumulated in IκBSR-transfected cells under the culture with SCF, IL-3, IL-6, and FLT3L (Fig. 3D, upper panel). Similarly, IκBSR induced the ROS accumulation under the cultures with different cytokine combinations (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Regarding the mechanisms of IκBSR-induced ROS accumulation, we found that the intracellular glutathione was reduced in IκBSR-transfected cells (Fig. 3E). Also, the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that the expression of several ROS scavenger enzymes was suppressed in IκBSR-transfected cells: MnSOD, about 80% suppression at 26–35 cycles; glutathione peroxidase, about 30% suppression at 26–32 cycles; and TRX, about 25% suppression at 26–35 cycles (Fig. 3F). In contrast, there was a slight difference in the expression of the ROS-regulating enzymes Prdx1 and xanthine oxidase. In addition, the expression of several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members was also inhibited by IκBSR: Bcl-2, about 60% suppression at 26–35 cycles; and Bcl-XL and A1, about 30% suppression at 26–35 cycles. These results indicated that IκBSR disrupted two major anti-apoptotic systems: ROS scavenger cascades and the Bcl-2 family members. Next, we assessed the roles for ROS in IκBSR-induced apoptosis by adding several ROS scavenger enzymes into the culture medium. As shown in Fig. 3G, MCI, NAC, and TRX efficiently protected normal hematopoietic cells from IκBSR-induced apoptosis, whereas MnTBAP was hardly effective. Because MCI mainly act on NO– and NAC, TRX on H2O2, and MnTBAP on O2·¯, NO– and H2O2 were supposed to be more toxic than O2·¯ in normal hematopoietic cells. IκBSR Inhibited the Development of Hematopoietic Cells from ES Cells—To examine the roles for Rel/NF-κB in the development of hematopoietic cells, we utilized the OP9 system (29Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In this system, ES cells, which are deprived of leukemia inhibitory factor and cultured on OP9 cells, develop into Flk-1+ cells (so-called hemangioblasts that have an ability to differentiate into both endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells) after 4.5-day cultures (Fig. 4A). To develop hematopoietic cells with high purity, we sorted Flk-1+ cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and further cultured on OP9 cells (Fig. 4A). In this system, we inducibly expressed IκBSR with the Tet-off system, in which the expression of IκBSR is induced by the Tet removal from the culture medium (31Era T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, because our Tet-off vector is a bicistronic vector, it can express IκBSR and GFP through internal ribosome entry site as a single mRNA in response to the Tet removal. We cultured ES clo"

Light controls the phosphorylation of Pdc in a cAMP and Ca2+-dependent manner, and phosphorylation in turn regulates the binding of Pdc to Gtβγ or 14-3-3 proteins in vitro. To directly examine the phosphorylation of Pdc in intact retina, we prepared antibodies specific to the three principal phosphorylation sites (Ser-54, Ser-73, and Ser-106) and measured the kinetics of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation during light/dark adaptation and the subsequent effects on Gtβγ binding. Ser-54 phosphorylation increased slowly (t½ ∼ 90 min) during dark adaptation to ∼70% phosphorylated and decreased rapidly (t½ ∼ 2 min) during light adaptation to less than 20% phosphorylated. Ser-73 phosphorylation increased much faster during dark adaptation (t½ ∼ 3 min) to ∼50% phosphorylated and decreased more slowly during light adaptation (t½ ∼ 9 min) to less than 20% phosphorylated. The Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM blocked Ser-54 phosphorylation during dark adaptation but had no effect on Ser-73 phosphorylation. In contrast, Ser-106 was not phosphorylated in either the light or dark. Importantly, Gβγ binding to Pdc was enhanced by Ca2+ chelation and the binding kinetics closely paralleled those of Ser-54 dephosphorylation, indicating that Ser-54 phosphorylation controls Gtβγ binding in vivo. These results suggest a pivotal role of Ser-54 and Ser-73 phosphorylation in determining the interactions of Pdc with its binding partners, Gtβγ and 14-3-3 protein, which may regulate the light-dependent translocation of the photoreceptor G protein.

G protein-coupled receptors mediate cellular responses to a wide variety of signals including hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, chemoattractants, and photons of light. The conversion of light into a neural response by the photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina is initiated by a canonical G protein signaling pathway involving the receptor rhodopsin, the photoreceptor G protein, transducin (Gt), 1The abbreviations used are: Gt, photoreceptor G protein transducin; Pdc, phosducin; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; PP2A, type 2A protein phosphatase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; W, watt. cGMP phosphodiesterase, and cGMP-gated cation channels (1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Closure of the channels in response to light causes a hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell membrane, which triggers the neural response. In addition, channel closure also results in a decrease in Ca2+ in the photoreceptor cell, which orchestrates a number of molecular events that lead to a decrease in sensitivity of the photoreceptor to light, a process termed light adaptation (2Fain G.L.

In contrast, the only known function of the Gtβγ subunit complex is to mediate the interaction of Gtα with rhodopsin, yet in other G protein signaling systems Gβγ plays significant roles in downstream effector activation (9Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 37: 167-203Google Scholar). Besides Gtα, the only other reported binding partner for Gtβγ in photoreceptor cells is phosducin (Pdc), a 28-kDa phosphoprotein expressed at high levels in both photoreceptor cells and pinealocytes (10Lee R.H.

Pdc harbors consensus phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser-73 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at Ser-54, and the results of several studies indicate that PKA and CaMKII are the relevant kinases for Pdc phosphorylation (13Lee R.H.

These results have lead to the hypothesis that Pdc contributes to the process of light adaptation in photoreceptor cells by sequestering Gtβγ from Gtα and thus blocking Gtα activation by rhodopsin when Pdc is dephosphorylated in the light. Subcellular localization studies have raised concerns about a role for Pdc in light adaptation, at least in short term events. Pdc is found in all compartments of the photoreceptor cell, with a distribution expected for a soluble, cytosolic protein (22Nakano K. Chen J. Tarr G.E. Yoshida T. Flynn J.M. Bitensky M.W. Proc.

This notion was confirmed by data from the Pdc knock-out mouse that exhibited no change in initial photoresponse kinetics when compared with wild-type (23Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B.

However, in long term light adaptation, 70–90% of the Gt translocates to the inner segment, nuclear and synaptic terminal regions (23Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), perhaps sequestering Gtβγ until Pdc can be rephosphorylated during subsequent dark adaptation and the Gtβγ can be released to return to the outer segment. Again, this idea is supported by results from the Pdc knock-out mouse that showed significant disruption of light-dependent translocation of Gt in the absence of Pdc (23Sokolov M. Strissel K.J.

Recent studies have suggested another potential role of the Pdc/Gtβγ interaction in the inner segment. In vitro Gtβγ ubiquitination and degradation studies showed that unphosphorylated Pdc protected Gtβγ from ubiquitination and degradation, whereas CaMKII phosphorylated Pdc did not (30Obin M. Lee B.Y. Meinke G. Bohm A. Lee R.H. Gaudet R. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Willardson B.M. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44566-44575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the Pdc knock-out mouse showed a modest decrease (28%) in Gtβ expression compared with wild-type (23Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Pdc could play a role in regulating proteasome-mediated degradation of Gtβγ during its sojourn in the inner segment in the light. Additional information about the function of Pdc comes from the observation that Pdc interacts with the phospho-serine/threonine-binding protein 14-3-3 (16Thulin C.D. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Truscott S.M. Old W.M. Ahn N.G. Resing K.A. Hamm H.E. Bitensky M.W. Willardson B.M. J. Biol.

In vitro, Pdc bound 14-3-3 but only when Ser-54 and Ser-73 were both phosphorylated by CaMKII, and 14-3-3 binding further inhibited the ability of phosphorylated Pdc to bind Gtβγ (16Thulin C.D. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Truscott S.M. Old W.M. Ahn N.G. Resing K.A. Hamm H.E. Bitensky M.W. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23805-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylated Pdc from dark-adapted bovine retina bound a 14-3-3 affinity column, whereas pretreatment of the retina with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM blocked the binding (16Thulin C.D. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Truscott S.M. Old W.M. Ahn N.G. Resing K.A. Hamm H.E. Bitensky M.W. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23805-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that in photoreceptor cells, CaMKII would phosphorylate Pdc at Ser-54 and PKA would phosphorylate Ser-73, which would initiate 14-3-3 binding. From these data, a model for the light-dependent dynamics of Pdc binding could be constructed. Pdc would shuttle between being phosphorylated and bound to 14-3-3 in the dark when photoreceptor Ca2+ (31Krizaj D. Copenhagen D.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2023-d2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cAMP concentration (32Cohen A.I. Blazynski C. Visual Neurosci. 1990; 4: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Nir I. Harrison J.M. Haque R. Low M.J. Grandy D.K. Rubinstein M. Iuvone P.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2063-2073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were high and being dephosphorylated and bound to Gtβγ in the light when photoreceptor Ca2+ and cAMP were low. This model depends on light-dependent changes in the phosphorylation state of Pdc at several serine residues. Unfortunately at none of these sites has phosphorylation been directly shown in vivo. Therefore, to test the applicability of the model in vivo, we have prepared phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to Ser-54, Ser-73, and Ser-106 of Pdc and have measured the kinetics of phosphorylation in response to light, Ca2+ chelation, and phosphatase inhibitors in intact bovine retina. In addition, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation of these sites on the binding of Gtβγ. Our results support the model of light and phosphorylation state-dependent interactions and point to phosphorylation of Ser-54 as the important event in regulating Pdc binding to Gtβγ. Preparation of Antibodies—Phospho-Ser-54, Ser-73, and Ser-106 specific antisera to bovine Pdc were prepared by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) using the synthetic phospho-peptides CEILRQM54SSPQSR (residues 48–59), CSRKM73SVQEYE (residues 69–78), and CMHQKL106SFGPRY (residues 101–111) with the numbers indicating the position of the phospho-serine residue. N-terminal cysteines were added to facilitate linkage of the peptides to the carrier protein or the affinity column matrix. Rabbits were immunized with the peptide/carrier conjugate and antisera were collected. Affinity purified antibodies were prepared from the antisera using an affinity column made by linking the phosphorylated peptides to a Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) and purifying according to the manufacturer's protocol. An antiserum to Gβ1 was also prepared by Alpha Diagnostic using a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 14 residues of Gβ1 (MSELDQL-RQEAEQLC) with a C-terminal Cys also for linkage purposes. An affinity purified antibody to full-length Pdc was prepared from a previously described antiserum (24Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar) using an affinity column made by linking full-length Pdc to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and purifying according to the manufacturer's protocol. The antibody specificity for the Ser-54 site was determined by immunoblotting 30 ng of unphosphorylated or CaMKII phosphorylated His6-tagged S6A,S36A,S106A Pdc using the blotting procedure described below. The antibody specificity for Ser-73 and Ser-106 sites were determined similarly using PKA-phosphorylated S6A,S36A,S106A Pdc and CaMKII-phosphorylated S6A,S54A,S73A Pdc, respectively. Measurement of Pdc Phosphorylation by Immunoblotting—To measure the effects of light or Ca2+ on phosphorylation of Ser-54, Ser-73, or Ser-106, single bovine retinas from light-adapted cattle were removed (taken 5 min postmortem from a local abbattoir) and cut into four approximately equal pieces. One piece was dark-adapted at 23 °C in HEPES/Ringer's buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 mm calcium chloride, 0.2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm dithiothreithol), a second piece was dark-adapted in HEPES/Ringer's without Ca2+ but with 50 μm BAPTA-AM, and another piece was dark-adapted in HEPES/Ringer's with 0.33% Me2SO (the vehicle for the BAPTA-AM) for 2 h. The fourth piece was light adapted in HEPES/Ringer's for 15 min in ambient daylight during transportation to the laboratory followed by 30 min under a 60 W bulb at 30 cm distance at 23 °C. After adaptation, all the samples were homogenized in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreithol, 1 μm microcystin LR, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Dremel tissue tearer. This procedure blocked further phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions by diluting the cellular ATP, chelating the Mg2+ with EDTA, and inhibiting phosphatases with microcystin. The phosphorylation state of Pdc was stable in this buffer for at least 2 h. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Ten μg of total protein from each sample were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted using a 1:1000 dilution of the Ser-54, Ser-73, or Ser-106 phosphorylation site-specific primary antibody and a 1:2000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem). The blots were developed with the ECL Plus chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and the band intensity was quantified using a Storm 860-D phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences) in chemifluorescence mode. To verify that the total amount of Pdc was the same in each sample, parallel blots were probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of an affinity purified antibody to full-length Pdc (24Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of the Stoichiometry of Site-specific Phosphorylation— Extracts from light and dark-adapted retinas were prepared as described above. The indicated amounts of protein from these extracts were mixed with the indicated amounts of purified His6-tagged S6A,S36A,S106A Pdc standards in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Mixtures were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The total amount of Pdc in the extract was determined by probing the blots with the antibody to full-length Pdc and then comparing the band intensities to that of the His6-Pdc standards. The His6 tag added 20 residues to the N terminus of Pdc (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPAGSH (34Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30399-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), allowing the separation of the His6-Pdc standards from the Pdc in the extract by SDS-PAGE. Mixing the standard with the extract in the same sample was done to control for masking of the immunoreactive band intensities by other proteins in the blot, which had been observed. The amount of Pdc in the extract was determined as follows. The volume of the Pdc standard band was divided by the nanograms of purified Pdc added to that well, yielding a Pdc band volume per ng of Pdc. Similarly, the volume of the Pdc band in the extract was divided by the micrograms of total protein in the extract added to that well, giving a Pdc band volume per μg of total protein. The nanograms of Pdc per μg of total protein was calculated by dividing the Pdc band volume per μg of total protein value by the Pdc band volume per ng of Pdc standard. Three different amounts of extract from a single retina and Pdc standard were analyzed in this manner and the results were averaged. The values from 3–6 different retinal extracts were determined and averaged to obtain nanograms of Pdc/μg of total protein values. The amount of Ser-54- or Ser-73-phosphorylated Pdc in the extract was determined in a similar manner using the Ser-54- or Ser-73-specific antibodies and phosphorylated Pdc standards. From these data, the percent of Ser-54 and Ser-73 phosphorylation was calculated by dividing the amount of phosphorylated Pdc by the total Pdc in the extract. The phosphorylated standards consisted of purified His6-tagged S6A,S36A,S106A Pdc, which has been phosphorylated by either CaMKII (16Thulin C.D. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Truscott S.M. Old W.M.

This S/A variant of Pdc was used to simplify the process of determining the degree of phosphorylation of Ser-54 and Ser-73 in the standards, which was assessed by mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphorylated S/A variant. The CaMKII-phosphorylated Pdc had the following distribution of phosphorylated species: no phosphates (2%), one (1%), two (48%), or three (49%). The PKA-phosphorylated Pdc had the following distribution of phosphorylated species: no phosphates (3%), one (5%), two (12%), three (44%), or four (36%). Ser-54 and Ser-73 harbor the consensus sites for phosphorylation by CaMKII and PKA, respectively, and are readily phosphorylated by these kinases (13Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Thulin C.D. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Truscott S.M. Old W.M. Ahn N.G. Resing K.A. Hamm H.E. Bitensky M.W. Willardson B.M.

As a result, Ser-54 and Ser-73 would be phosphorylated in all species containing one or more phosphates. Thus, Ser-54 was 98% phosphorylated in the CaMKII standard and Ser-73 was 97% phosphorylated in the PKA standard. Determination of Dephosphorylation and Phosphorylation Rates— For dephosphorylation experiments during light adaptation, single bovine retinas (5 min postmortem) were removed and cut into five approximately equal pieces. Each set of pieces was incubated in HEPES/Ringer's buffer ± the indicated concentrations of okadaic acid in the dark for 2 h at 23 °C. Samples were then exposed to light from a 60 W lamp at 30 cm distance at 23 °C. At the times indicated, a piece was homogenized, the supernatant was collected, and phosphorylation of Ser-54 or Ser-73 was analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The time course data were fit to a pseudo-first order rate equation for dephosphorylation: P = ((P max – Pmin) × e–kt) + Pmin; where P is the amount of phosphorylated Pdc, Pmax is the amount phosphorylated at time 0 before exposure to light, Pmin is the amount phosphorylated in the light at infinite time when the system has reached equilibrium, k is the psuedo-first order rate constant, and t is the time in minutes. Half-life values (t½) for dephosphorylation were calculated from the rate constant k by the equation, t½ = ln 2/k. For dark-adaptation experiments, similar pieces of a single bovine retina were collected and cut in the light and then dark-adapted in HEPES/Ringer's ± 1 μm okadaic acid at 23 °C. At the times indicated, a retinal piece was homogenized, the supernatant was collected, and phosphorylation of Ser-54 or Ser-73 was analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The time course data were fit to a pseudo-first order rate equation for phosphorylation: P = ((Pmax – Pmin) × (1 – ekt)) + Pmin; where P is the amount of phosphorylated Pdc, Pmax is the amount phosphorylated at infinite time in the dark when the system has reached equilibrium, Pmin is the amount phosphorylated at time 0 in the light before dark adaptation, k is the psuedo-first order rate constant, and t is the time in minutes. Half-life values for phosphorylation were calculated as described above. Measurement of the Pdc/Gtβγ Interaction by Immunoprecipitation—To measure the effects of light or Ca2+ on the Pdc·Gtβγ interaction, single retinas (5 min postmortem) were dark-adapted for 2 h or light-adapted under a 60 W bulb at 30 cm distance for 30 min in the eye cup in HEPES/Ringer's buffer ± 50 μm BAPTA-AM or 0.33% Me2SO at 23 °C. Soluble proteins were then extracted by homogenizing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.85% Igepal CA-630 detergent (PBSI) (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.85% Igepal CA-630, 1 μm microcystin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). This extraction procedure blocked further phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions by diluting the cellular ATP and inhibiting phosphatases with microcystin. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay reagent (Pierce). Eight mg of protein from each sample in 1.0 ml of total volume were incubated with 10 μl of 1.5 μg/μl affinity purified full-length Pdc antibody on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4 °C. Twenty-five μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) were added to each reaction and incubated 30 mi"

Mach F. Libby P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Engagement of CD40 by CD154 leads to B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion, and isotype switching (4Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Arch. Immunol. Ther.

In addition to its direct role in B cell activation, CD40 signaling also induces up-regulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecules as well as inflammatory lymphokines, including interleukin 6 and TNF-α. Our laboratory has previously shown that CD40-mediated Ig secretion is partially TNF-α-dependent, and the TNFR involved on B lymphocytes is CD120b (8Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J.

The fundamental role of CD40 signals in normal immunity and pathological processes has prompted evaluation of CD40-mediated signaling cascades.

Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), since most of these studies have been done in yeast two-hybrid and overexpression systems (13Rothe M.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we compared the ability of CD40 and CD120b to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NFκB and investigated the role TRAF2 plays in these signaling events using previously constructed TRAF2-deficient B cell lines. CD40 required TRAF2 to activate JNK. CD120b activated JNK to a lesser degree, and this pathway was TRAF2-independent. Both CD40 and CD120b activated NFκB transcription in a partially TRAF2-dependent manner; CD120b did so exclusively via the alternate NFκB pathway, in which the p100 precursor is processed to transcriptionally active p52. CD40 was able to activate NFκB using both the classical and alternate pathways. Differences in signaling between CD40 and CD120b were associated with different kinetic profiles of TRAF2 receptor association and degradation. The mouse B cell lines M12.4.1 and CH12.LX as well as their stable transfectants expressing hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b molecules have been previously described (8Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J.

All mouse cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics (B cell medium (BCM)). Hi5 insect cells and Hi5 cells expressing mCD154 have been previously described (18Warren W.D. Berton M.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5637-5646PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bishop G.A. Warren W.D. Berton M.T.

These cells grow at 26 °C and rapidly die to form membrane fragments at 37 °C and, therefore, do not overgrow B cell cultures. Monoclonal antibodies were purified in our laboratory from hybridoma culture supernatants. The 1C10 hybridoma (anti-mCD40, rat IgG2a) (20Heath A.W. Wu W.W. Howard M.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1828-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Frances Lund, Trudeau Institute (Saranac Lake, NY); the monoclonal antibody 72-2 (rat IgG2a isotype control) (21Baniyash M. Eshhar Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1984; 14: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), MOPC-31c (mouse IgG1 isotype control), and the G28–5 (anti-hCD40, mouse IgG1) hybridomas were from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-p52, anti-p100, anti-RelB, anti-JNK (p46/54), and anti-TRAF3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-TRAF2 was purchased from MBL International (Woburn, MA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-IκBα, anti-phosphorylated IκBα and anti-phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/JNK were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-actin antibody (C4) was from Chemicon International (Temicula, CA). Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Recombinant mouse (rm) TNF-α was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Enbrel (CD120b-Fc fusion protein; Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) was obtained from the University of Iowa Hospital Pharmacy, Iowa City, IA. IgM secretion by CH12.LX or CH12.T2–/– cells stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b was measured by hemolytic plaque assay, as previously described (22Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1107-1114PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured for 72 h with various stimuli, then the viable cells were counted by ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining (23Renvoize C. Biola A. Pallardy M. Breard J. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1998; 14: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The B cells were mixed with sheep red blood cells and guinea pig complement, transferred to chamber slides, and incubated for ∼30 min at 37 °C. During this incubation, IgM secreted by activated B cells bound to surrounding sheep red blood cells (expressing the antigen for which CH12.LX IgM is specific, phosphatidylcholine (24Mercolino T.J. Arnold L.W. Haughton G. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)) and fixed complement, causing the red cells to lyse. Zones of clearing or “plaques” surrounding the activated B cells were counted using a low power microscope. Results are presented as the ratio of plaque-forming cells to viable cells. As previously described (22Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1107-1114PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bishop G.A. Pennell C.A. Travis W. Haughton G. Frelinger J.A. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), CH12.LX does not express detectable levels of surface CD32, and thus, intact mouse IgG antibodies do not have CD32-specific effects on these cells. CH12.LX or CH12.T2–/– cells (1.5 × 107) stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were transiently transfected with 20 μg of 4× NFκB luciferase reporter plasmid (26Berberich I. Shu G.L. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4357-4366PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 μg of Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-null; Promega, Madison, WI) by electroporation. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min, then stimulated (2 × 106 cells/ml) for 6 h with 100 ng/ml recombinant TNF-α or 10 μg/ml anti-mCD40, anti-hCD40, or isotype control antibodies. Alternatively, cells were co-cultured with Hi5 insect cells (19Bishop G.A. Warren W.D. Berton M.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (1:4 Hi5:B cells) infected with baculo-virus expressing either mouse or human CD154. In some experiments cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-TNF-α (MP6-XT3 + MP6-XT22), Enbrel, or isotype control antibodies. After stimulation, cells were pelleted, lysed, and assayed for relative luciferase activity (NFκB:Renilla) per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) using a Turner BioSystems (Sunnyvale, CA) 20/20 luminometer, with settings of 2-s delays followed by a 10-s read. M12.4.1 cells (2 × 106), CH12.LX, or CH12.T2–/– cells stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were stimulated in 1 ml of culture medium for various time points (37 °C) with 5 μg(IκBα, TRAF) or 10 μg (JNK) of anti-hCD40 or Hi5 insect cells expressing CD154 (1:4 ratio with B cells, IκBα) to induce degradation (TRAF) or phosphorylation/degradation (IκBα/JNK) of the proteins blotted. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, lysed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Peroxidase-labeled antibodies were visualized on Western blots using a chemiluminescent detection reagent (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 imaging system (Fujifilm Medical Systems, Ltd., Stamford, CT). Total Cell Lysate Analysis—M12.4.1 cells (2 × 106) stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were stimulated in 1 ml of culture medium for various time points (37 °C) with 5 μg of anti-hCD40 (or isotype control) to induce processing of p100 to p52 and RelB activation. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, lysed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In some experiments cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-TNF-α (MP6-XT3 + MP6-XT22). Nuclear Translocation of p52 and RelB—CH12.LX or CH12.T2–/– cells stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were stimulated in 1 ml of culture medium for various time points (37 °C) with 10 μg of anti-hCD40 (or isotype control). Cellular and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (27Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with sucrose buffer (320 mm sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40), and the supernatant saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear fraction was washed once with sucrose buffer without Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in 30 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). High salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 600 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added slowly in two 15-μl additions while mixing. Nuclei were incubated on a rotator for 30–45 min at 4 °C. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to the cellular and nuclear fractions, which were then stored at –20 °C. CH12.LX or CH12.T2–/– cells stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b (2 × 106) were rested for 30 min, then stimulated in 1 ml of culture medium for 5 min (37 °C) with 10 μg of anti-mCD40 or anti-hCD40 (or respective isotype controls). Cell lysates were prepared, and JNK activity was measured using an in vitro kinase assay, as previously described (28Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 871-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography of dried gels. Radiolabeled kinase substrate was quantified with the Packard Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). M12.4.1 cells (1 × 107) stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were stimulated in 1 ml of culture medium for 15, 30, or 60 min (37 °C) with 5 μg of anti-hCD40 (or isotype control), and detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were isolated, as previously described (29Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19433-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 400 μl of Brij lysis buffer (1% Brij 58, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min on ice. Detergent-soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation, and the detergent-insoluble pellet was isolated. The pellet was resuspended and sonicated in 400 μl of lysis buffer containing SDS to dissolve membrane rafts (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Brij 58, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). A portion (50 μl) of the soluble and insoluble fractions for each condition was separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The remaining portion of soluble and insoluble fractions was immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (10 μl of a 50% suspension) conjugated with anti-hCD40 (G28–5) on a rotating mixer at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed several times with lysis buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for TRAFs, actin, or hCD40. To study potential differences in signaling by the cytoplasmic domains of CD40 and CD120b, we previously stably transfected mouse B cells lines M12.4.1, CH12.LX, and CH12.T2–/– with a construct encoding extracellular and transmembrane human CD40 domains fused to the C-terminal cytoplasmic mouse CD120b domain (hCD40-CD120b) (8Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were stably transfected with a construct encoding hCD40. The cytoplasmic domains of mouse and hCD40 are similar in amino acid sequence and indistinguishable in function (30Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar), allowing use of endogenous mCD40 in the B cell lines as an important control. Use of the hybrid hCD40-CD120b molecule avoids the problem of lack of available reagents that efficiently detect or immunoprecipitate endogenous CD120b from mouse cells. Neither normal mouse B cells nor B cell lines express detectable CD120a mRNA or protein, and the hCD40CD120b molecule mimics closely the effects of exogenous TNF-α on B cells (8Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TNF-α was used as a control throughout the study to validate hybrid molecule findings with endogenous CD120b, as technically feasible. The Role of TRAF2 in CD40- and CD120b-mediated IgM Secretion—TNF-α promotes antibody production in vitro and in vivo (31Rieckmann P. Tuscano J.M. Kehrl J.H. Methods. 1997; 11: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that TNF-α induced via CD40 stimulation contributes to CD40-mediated antibody production in B cells via binding to CD120b (8Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both CD40 and CD120b bind TRAF2. Inducible expression of a truncated, dominant negative DN-TRAF2 inhibits CD40 mediated Ig production (16Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar). However, we wanted to examine receptor signaling in the complete absence of TRAF2, avoiding the complications of variable DN-TRAF2 expression and the severe viability and developmental defects of TRAF2–/– mice (32Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To this end, hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b was stably transfected into TRAF2-deficient CH12.T2–/– cells (10Hostager B.S. Haxhinasto S.A. Rowland S.L. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45382-453890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and activation was compared with similarly transfected wild type (WT) CH12.LX cells. Stimulating CH12.LX cells through endogenous mCD40 or the transfected hCD40 molecule resulted in an increase in IgM-secreting B cells. The activation of TRAF2-deficient cells by either stimulus was diminished (Fig. 1). This was true whether stimulating via anti-CD40 Ab (Fig. 1A) or insect cells expressing CD154 (Fig. 1B). Stimulating via the hCD40-CD120b hybrid molecule or using rmTNF-α to activate endogenous CD120b induced IgM-secreting cells to a lesser extent than CD40, as previously reported (8Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This effect was also diminished in the absence of TRAF2. Differential Role of TRAF2 in CD40- and CD120b-mediated JNK Activation—CD40-mediated JNK activation contributes to downstream antibody secretion, and we have previously shown that TRAF2 plays a role in this process (10Hostager B.S. Haxhinasto S.A. Rowland S.L. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45382-453890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that TRAF2 may also be required for CD40 and CD120b-mediated JNK activation. We examined the ability of hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b to stimulate B cell JNK activation in the presence or absence of TRAF2 using an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2A). Stimulating via hCD40-CD120b induced less phosphorylation of the glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun substrate than stimulating B cells via mouse or human CD40 whether using Ab or CD154 as the stimulus. Unlike CD40-induced JNK activation, which was dramatically diminished in CH12.T2–/– cells, no decrease in hCD40-CD120b-induced JNK activation was seen in the absence of TRAF2. We predicted that this result might reflect the phosphorylation state of JNK after hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b activation in the presence or absence of TRAF2. Fig. 2B demonstrates that hCD40-CD120b-mediated activation led to less phosphorylation of JNK than hCD40-mediated activation. However, whereas hCD40-mediated JNK phosphorylation was diminished in CH12.T2–/– cells, hCD40-CD120b-mediated JNK phosphorylation was actually enhanced in the TRAF2-deficient cells. Roles of TNF-α and TRAF2 in hCD40-mediated NFκB Activation—CD40-mediated NFκB activation contributes to immunoglobulin secretion (33Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar), but the relative role of TNF-α in this process is unknown. It is also unclear to what extent CD120b can induce NFκB activation in B cells given the mixed results produced in overexpression systems (34Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 35McFarlane S.M. Pashmi G. Connell M.C. Littlejohn A.F. Tucker S.J. Vandenabeele P. MacEwan D.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To address this question, M12.4.1 cells stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were evaluated for their ability to activate an NFκB-driven luciferase reporter gene upon receptor engagement (Fig. 3A, top panel). Both CD40 (mouse or human) and hCD40-CD120b were able to activate NFκB-mediated transcription. The CD120b response was approximately one-third that of the CD40 response. Blocking TNF-α binding with antagonistic antibodies or Enbrel, a CD120b-Fc fusion protein, before receptor activation caused a 30% decline in hCD40-mediated NFκB activation, demonstrating a possible role for TNF-α in CD40-mediated NFκB activation. As an additional control there was no detectable affect of TNF-α blockade on hCD40-CD120b-mediated NFκB activation (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). To compare the role of TRAF2 in hCD40 versus hCD40-CD120b-mediated NFκB activation, we examined CH12.LX- and TRAF2-deficient CH12.T2–/– cells (Fig. 3B). As in the M12.4.1 cells, both CD40 (mouse and human) and CD120b (via the chimeric receptor or endogenous CD120b stimulated with rmTNF-α) were able to activate NFκB, but CD120b did so to a lesser extent. This was true whether stimulating with anti-hCD40 Ab (Fig. 3B, upper panel), rmTNF-α, or CD154 (Fig. 3B, lower panel). CH12.T2–/– cells showed diminished NFκB activation after CD40 or CD120b stimulation, but activity was not completely abolished. This is in agreement with previous findings that CD40 mutants defective in TRAF2 binding are still able to activate NF-κB (36Hsing Y. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4898-4906PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms of NFκB Activation in B Cells by CD40 Versus CD120b—Early events in NFκB activation have been shown to include phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (37Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggest that an alternate pathway for activating NFκB, in which p100 is processed to p52 and shuttled to the nucleus by RelB, is also used by some TNF receptor family members, including CD40 (38Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), lymphotoxin β receptor (39Muller J.R. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the B cell activating factor of the TNF family receptor (40Kayagaki N. Yan M. Seshasayee D. Wang H. Lee W. French D.M. Grewal I.S. Cochran A.G. Gordon N.C. Yin J. Starovasnik M.A. Dixit V.M.

To test which NFκB activation pathways are utilized by CD40 and CD120b in B cells, M12.4.1 cells were activated via CD40 or hCD40-CD120b and assayed for IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (classical pathway, Fig. 4) or processing of p100 to p52 (alternate pathway, Fig. 5). Both mouse and human CD40 were able to rapidly stimulate phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, but hCD40-CD120b did not, either with a stimulus of agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (Fig. 4, A–B) or CD154 (Fig. 4, C–D). However, both hCD40 and hCD40-CD120b were able to activate the alternate pathway (Fig. 5), and CD120b was more efficient at inducing p100 processing to p52 and RelB activation. Furthermore, CD40-mediated activation of the alternate NFκB pathway was TNF-α dependent, as blocking TNF-α binding before CD40 activation greatly diminished activation of the alternate pathway (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Activation of the nonclassical NFκB2 pathway by hCD40 versus hCD40-CD120b. A, M12.4.1 cells stably transfected with hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b were stimulated with anti-hCD40 Ab (versus isotype control (IC)) or anti-hCD40 Ab plus or minus treatment with anti-TNF-α Ab and lysed, and lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot for p100/p52 or RelB. Blots were stripped and reprobed for actin as a lane-loading control. B, density of bands in A (asterisk, isotype control) as a proportion of BCM (M)-stimulated cells normalized to the value of the actin band of blots shown in A. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm findings in Fig. 5, we examined activation of the alternate pathway by evaluating cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions post-stimulation for p52 and RelB activation in the cytoplasm and movement to the nucleus. To determine the role of TRAF2 in this process, transfected CH12.LX or CH12.T2–/– cells were stimulated via hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b and assayed for p100, p52, and RelB levels (Fig. 6). As in the M12.4.1 cells (Fig. 5), hCD40-CD120b in CH12.LX cells was able to activate the alternate pathway more efficiently than hCD40, with a greater diminution of p100, concomitant increase of p52, and accumulation/degradation of RelB in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6, A–B). This was followed by a greater increase of p52 and RelB levels in the nucleus (Fig. 6, C–D). Activation of the alternate pathway by hCD40 or hCD40-CD120b in TRAF2-deficient cells was appreciably decreased to base-line levels in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 6, A–B) but not completely diminished in the nucleus, especially with hCD40-CD120b stimulation (Fig. 6, C–D). Some TRAF2-independent activation may, thus, occur. Differential Kinetics of TRAF2 and TRAF3 Association and Degradation Induced via CD40 Versus CD120b—Association of TRAFs with CD40 within lipid membrane rafts has been shown to be vital for downstream signaling events, including JNK and NFκB activation (41Brown K.D.

The topology of outer membrane proteins is difficult to predict accurately using computer algorithms, and topology mapping protocols commonly used for α-helical membrane proteins do not work for β-barrel proteins. We present here the topology of the PapC usher, an outer membrane protein required for assembly and secretion of P pili by the chaperone/usher pathway in uropathogenic Escherichia coli. An initial attempt to map PapC topology by insertion of protease cleavage sites was largely unsuccessful due to lack of cleavage at most sites and the requirement to disrupt the outer membrane to identify periplasmic sites. We therefore adapted a site-directed fluorescence labeling technique to permit topology mapping of outer membrane proteins using small molecule probes in intact bacteria. Using this method, we demonstrated that PapC has the potential to encode up to 32 transmembrane β-strands. Based on experimental evidence, we propose that the usher consists of an N-terminal β-barrel domain comprised of 26 β-strands and that a distinct C-terminal domain is not inserted into the membrane but is located instead within the lumen of the N-terminal β-barrel similar to the plug domains encoded by the outer membrane iron-siderophore uptake proteins.

Proteins found in the OM of mitochondria and chloroplasts also adopt similar β-barrel folds (5Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Only six to nine residues are required for a β-strand to cross the central non-polar region of the lipid bilayer (4Koebnik R. Locher K.P. Van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), and only half of these need to be hydrophobic since only alternating residues face into the bilayer. This makes prediction of TM β-strands by sequence analysis difficult. Furthermore protocols typically used to map the topology of α-helical membrane proteins are not applicable to OM proteins. For example, alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) fusions are commonly used to identify periplasmic regions of inner membrane proteins (6Manoil C. Mekalanos J.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PhoA cannot be used to map OM proteins reliably as the large PhoA insertion folds in the periplasm and disrupts proper assembly of proteins in the OM (7Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Michel V. Hofnung M. Charbit A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Smaller insertions are generally tolerated in surface and periplasmic loops of β-barrel proteins, and introduction of epitopes and protease cleavage sites has been used to map OM proteins (7Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Michel V. Hofnung M. Charbit A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Koebnik R. Braun V. J.

However, the mapping of such insertions in whole bacteria may be critically affected by the membrane or protein structure, and mapping of periplasmic regions requires disruption of the OM with the potential for misleading results (7Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Michel V. Hofnung M. Charbit A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C.

To overcome these difficulties, we adapted a site-directed fluorescence labeling protocol for topology mapping of OM proteins. Our method only requires insertion or substitution of single cysteine residues and permits analysis of OM proteins in their native state in intact bacteria. We used this protocol to map the topology of the PapC usher protein, which is required for assembly and secretion of P pili in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (12Dodson K.W. Jacob-Dubuisson F.

Microbiol. 1987; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). P pili are composite structures built from multiple pilus subunits (14Bullitt E. Makowski L. Nature. 1995; 373: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15Kuehn M.J. Heuser J. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The PapG adhesin, located at the pilus tip, binds to Galα(1–4)Gal moieties present in kidney glycolipids, and P pili are key virulence factors for the development of pyelonephritis (16Soto G.E. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bock K. Breimer M.E. Brignole A. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K-A. Larson G. Leffler H. Samuelsson B.E. Strömberg N. Svanborg-Edén C. Thurin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8545-8551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P pili are assembled by the chaperone/usher secretion pathway, which is responsible for biogenesis of a superfamily of surface structures associated with virulence (18Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Hultgren S.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Pilus subunits cross the inner membrane in an unfolded form via the Sec general secretory pathway (19Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) and then must interact with the PapD chaperone in the periplasm. The chaperone acts by a mechanism termed donor strand complementation that couples subunit folding with the simultaneous capping of subunit interactive surfaces (21Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S. Waksman G. Frieden C. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7709-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Choudhury D. Thompson A.

Hultgren S.J. Waksman G. Science. 1999; 285: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Chaperone-subunit complexes must next target to the PapC usher in the OM for pilus biogenesis. The usher serves as a pilus assembly platform as well as a secretion channel (13Norgren M. Baga M. Tennent J.M. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Lombardo M-J. Roth R. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pilus assembly is thought to occur at the periplasmic face of the usher concomitant with secretion of the pilus fiber through the usher to the cell surface (18Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Hultgren S.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Chaperone-subunit complexes initially target to an N-terminal region of the usher consisting of the first 124–139 residues of the mature N terminus (27Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5321-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Nishiyama M. Vetsch M. Puorger C. Jelesarov I. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The complexes subsequently form stable interactions with the usher C terminus, which is required for subunit assembly into pili and secretion to the cell surface (29Saulino E.T. Thanassi D.G. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Pilus assembly occurs by a mechanism termed donor strand exchange in which chaperone-subunit interactions are replaced by subunit-subunit interactions (21Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S. Waksman G. Frieden C. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7709-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Sauer F.G. Pinkner J.S. Waksman G.

Cell. 2003; 113: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Donor strand exchange allows subunits to undergo a topological transition to a lower energy state, presumably providing the driving force for pilus biogenesis at the usher. Mature PapC contains 809 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 88.2 kDa. Computer modeling of the PapC topology predicted 24 TM β-strands, and analysis of PapC by circular dichroism confirmed a largely β-sheet secondary structure (30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The usher C terminus forms a distinct domain that is not required for proper folding of the β-barrel in the OM (30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PapC assembles into an oligomeric complex and forms channels 2–3 nm in diameter (24Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Lombardo M-J. Roth R. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3146-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), large enough to allow secretion of folded pilus subunits. Detailed knowledge of the arrangement of the usher in the lipid bilayer is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of pilus assembly and secretion across the bacterial OM. Based on our topology mapping results and experiments showing that the usher C terminus is tightly associated with the OM, we propose that the usher folds with an N-terminal β-barrel domain comprised of 26 TM β-strands and that the C terminus is located within the barrel channel in a fashion analogous to the plug domains found in OM iron-siderophore uptake proteins (33Ferguson A.D.

Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was used for plasmid manipulations; strain AAEC185 (38Blomfield I.C. McClain M.S. Eisenstein B.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which lacks the chromosomal fim genes coding for type 1 pili, was used for hemagglutination assays (HAs); and strain SF100 (39Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which lacks the OmpT protease, was used for analysis of the PapC constructs and for the topology mapping experiments. Strain XL-3 was used for analysis of the OxlT constructs (40Ye L. Jia Z. Jung T. Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in LB broth containing appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C with aeration. Plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table I. PapC expression was induced at an A600 of 0.6 for 1 h with 0.1% l-arabinose, and the ΔpapC pap operon from plasmid pMJ2 was induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Plasmids expressing the single cysteine OxlT variants G49C or D104C were induced at an A600 of 0.6 for 1 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Plasmids designated pNH (Supplemental Table I), encoding single cysteine substitution or insertion mutants of PapC, were derived from plasmid pMJ3, which encodes WT PapC with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (His tag), using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Supplemental Table I. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Random insertion of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease sites into PapC was performed using the TnTAP transposon as described previously (41Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 64: 13111-13115Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly pMM1 was transformed into DH5α/pMJ3, and a single Ampr, Tetr colony was selected for overnight growth and plasmid isolation. Plasmids were digested with NheI and transformed into DH5α, selecting for Ampr, Kanr, and Tets. The colonies were then screened for PhoA activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate indicator plates. Blue colonies were selected and screened by PCR for insertion of TnTAP into papC using the primer UPSTRMPAPC (5′-GAAGCGCTGGATTACACCCTCAG-3′), which binds upstream of the papC open reading frame, and primer TNTAPPHOA (5′-GCAGTAATATCGCCCTGAGCAGC-3′), which binds to phoA within the TnTAP transposon. Plasmids containing TnTAP insertions in papC were isolated, and the insertion junctions were determined by sequencing using the TNTAPPHOA primer. Finally the phoA and neo reporter genes of TnTAP were removed by digesting the plasmids with NotI and religating to produce the plasmids designated pHG (Supplemental Table I), which code for PapC proteins containing in-frame insertions of the 24-residue sequence LTLIHKFENLYFQSAAAILVYKSQ (the TEV protease recognition site is underlined). HA—Analysis of pilus biogenesis by HA was performed as described previously (30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using AAEC185/pMJ2 (ΔpapC pap operon) complemented with pMON6235Δcat (vector), pMJ3 (WT PapC), or one of the PapC mutants. Heat-modifiable Mobility Shift Assay—Expression and folding of the various PapC mutants in the OM was analyzed using a heat-modifiable mobility shift assay as described previously (27Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5321-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Digestion of TnTAP Insertion Mutants of PapC with TEV Protease— PapC mutants containing TnTAP insertions were tested for susceptibility to cleavage by TEV protease as described previously (41Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 64: 13111-13115Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using whole bacteria or isolated OM. OM was isolated as described previously (30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonic Inc., Gloucester, MA). Cleavage of PapC was monitored by blotting with anti-PapC or anti-His tag (Covance, Richmond, CA) antibodies followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). The blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Site-directed Fluorescence Labeling—This protocol was adapted from the method used by Ye and coworkers (40Ye L. Jia Z. Jung T. Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to map the inner membrane protein OxlT. A 20-ml culture of SF100 expressing WT PapC or one of the PapC mutants was harvested, resuspended in 2.6 ml of buffer A (100 mm potassium sulfate, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0), and divided into two equal aliquots. Freshly prepared 4-acetamido-4′-male-imidylstilbene-2–2′-disulfonic acid (AMS, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to one aliquot to 100 μm final concentration, and the aliquots were incubated at room temperature (RT, 25 °C) for 7 min. Both aliquots were washed three times with buffer A, and then Oregon green 488 maleimide (OGM, Molecular Probes) was added to 40 μm final concentration to both aliquots. The samples were incubated in the dark at RT for 15 min, the reaction was quenched by addition of 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the aliquots were washed three times with buffer A. The bacteria were then resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors for isolation of OM as described previously (27Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5321-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The OM pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5% dodecylmaltoside (DDM, Anatrace, Maumee, OH) and solubilized overnight by rocking at 4 °C. After spinning out insoluble material (16,100 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), imidazole was added to 20 mm final concentration, and the mixture was rocked for 30 min at RT with 50 μl of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) to bind the His-tagged PapC. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was then washed three times with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% DDM. The supernatant was removed, 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the resin, the sample was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, and 18 μl was loaded on a 10% gel. After electrophoresis, the fluorescence profile was obtained by scanning with a STORM fluorescence imaging system (Amersham Biosciences) using the blue fluorescent chemifluorescence mode (excitation wavelength of 450 ± 30 nm). The same gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, scanned using a GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad), and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The fluorescence value for each PapC band was normalized to its protein level determined from Coomassie staining. Then the ratio of the normalized OGM signal without AMS pretreatment to the normalized OGM signal with AMS pretreatment was calculated for each PapC to give the -fold reduction in OGM labeling due to pretreatment with AMS. Control PapC constructs containing cysteines at known surface and periplasmic locations were included in all assays; this was important to monitor the quality of the AMS reagent. All PapC mutants were analyzed at least twice. As an alternative to AMS, Alexa Fluor 594 C5 maleimide (Molecular Probes) was used in the above protocol at a final concentration of 100 μm and an incubation time of 15 min. The specificity of AMS as a blocking agent for surface-exposed residues was tested using the OxlT mutants G49C and D104C, which contain periplasmic cysteines (40Ye L. Jia Z. Jung T. Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The OxlT mutants were assayed using AMS as a blocking agent according to our protocol described above or using methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA) as a blocking agent (2 mm final concentration for 10 min) as described previously (40Ye L. Jia Z. Jung T. Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PapC mutants that did not label with OGM in intact bacteria were subsequently analyzed by labeling with OGM after solubilization with DDM or denaturation with SDS (42Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For labeling of solubilized PapC, OM was extracted with DDM as described above, but before the addition of imidazole samples were incubated for 15 min at RT with 40 μm OGM. The reaction was quenched with 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protein was purified and analyzed as described above. For labeling of denatured PapC, purified protein was isolated as described above but boiled in sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. OGM was added to 1 mm, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at RT. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed as described above. Association of the PapC C Terminus with the OM—OM was isolated from SF100/pMJ3 as described previously (30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A final concentration of 50 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added to 0.2 mg OM (as determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay, Pierce). After incubation on ice for 2 min, digestion was terminated by addition of 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The OM was pelleted by centrifugation (80,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) and resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were treated on ice for 1 h with NaOH (0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 m), urea (4 or 6 m), 1 m NaCl, or 0.2 m Na2CO3 or were sonicated (4 min, 30 s on, and 30 s off) in a water bath sonicator (Misonix). The membrane and soluble fractions were then separated by centrifugation (80,000 × g,1h, 4 °C). The supernatant fractions were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid. Both the membrane and trichloroacetic acid pellets were treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with an anti-His tag antibody as described above. Identification of Two Surface Loops of PapC by TEV Protease Cleavage—As a first approach to map the topology of the usher, we generated random insertions of the TEV protease recognition sequence in PapC using the TnTAP transposon (41Ehrmann M.

TnTAP was designed specifically for analysis of OM proteins and results in a final in-frame insertion of a 24-residue sequence carrying the TEV protease cleavage site. We isolated 29 unique TnTAP insertions in PapC that were stably expressed in the OM (Fig. 1). Approximately one-third of the insertions were isolated more than once with a pronounced hotspot for insertion following residue Val-76 (V76TEVins) in a large periplasmic loop of PapC (Fig. 1). This loop also contained the highest concentration of TnTAP insertions. In other regions of PapC, notably the C terminus, we were unable to isolate insertions. The insertion sites in PapC define regions flexible enough to accommodate the 24-residue TnTAP sequence. The non-random distribution of insertions was thus as least partly attributable to the screening procedure, which selected for stable, in-frame insertions in PapC (41Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 64: 13111-13115Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To confirm that the PapC mutants containing TnTAP insertions were folded properly in the OM, we took advantage of the fact that PapC, in common with other OM β-barrel proteins, is resistant to denaturation by SDS unless incubated at high temperatures and thus exhibits a characteristic heat-modifiable mobility on SDS-PAGE (24Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Lombardo M-J. Roth R. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3146-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Each of the TnTAP insertion mutants exhibited heat-modifiable mobility, indicating proper folding of the PapC β-barrel (data not shown). We next assessed functionality of the TnTAP insertion mutants by testing their ability to complement a ΔpapC pap operon for assembly of adhesive pili by HA. The majority of the insertion mutants (22 of 29, Fig. 1) were defective for pilus biogenesis, having HA titers of 0–8 compared with a WT HA titer of 64 (Supplemental Table II). The functional defects found with the TnTAP insertion mutants are not surprising given the large size of the inserted sequence. Although most of the TnTAP insertion mutants were not functional for pilus biogenesis, we proceeded with topology mapping studies as all were able to adopt a correct β-barrel fold in the OM. TEV protease was added to whole bacteria or to isolated OM, and cleavage of the usher was monitored by immunoblot analysis using anti-His tag or anti-PapC antibody. Three of the TnTAP insertion mutants (A124TEVins, R138TEVins, and S194TEVins) were clearly cleaved in whole bacteria, indicating a surface location (Fig. 2). These insertions occurred in two N-terminal loops predicted to be surface-exposed by a prior modeling study (30Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K.W. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These two loops are also the largest surface loops present in the β-barrel region of PapC (Fig. 1, see below). Three additional TnTAP insertion mutants (G30TEVins, A69TEVins, and D74TEVins) were cleaved by TEV protease in isolated OM but not in whole bacteria, suggesting a periplasmic location (data not shown). However, we could not discriminate against the possibility that these insertions instead were located at the surface but only became exposed upon isolation of the OM. This is a major limitation of topology mapping protocols that require membrane disruption to reach internal sites. None of the remaining TnTAP insertions in PapC was cleaved by TEV protease in either whole bacteria or OM (data not shown). This was surprising given that the insertion mutants were stably expressed, and the large size of the inserted sequence should favor exposure of the cleavage site. The TEV protease may not have been able to recognize the cleavage sites due to local conformational effects, or the sites may have been sterically blocked by protein or membrane structure (7Newton S.M.

Specifically, tin-9.1 and tin-10 RNA interference (RNAi) treatment of nematodes impairs import of the ADP/ATP carrier into isolated mitochondria. Developmental phenotypes are associated with gene knock-down of the mitochondrial import components. RNAi of tomm-7 and ddp-1 resulted in mitochondria with an interconnected morphology in vivo, presumably due to defects in the assembly of outer membrane fission/fusion components. RNAi of the small Tim proteins TIN-9.1, TIN-9.2, and TIN-10 resulted in a small body size, reduced number of progeny produced, and partial embryonic lethality. An additional phenotype of the tin-9.2(RNAi) animals is defective formation of the somatic gonad. The biochemical demonstration that the protein import activity is reduced, under the same conditions that yield the defects in specific tissues and lethality in a later generation, suggests that the developmental abnormalities observed are a consequence of defects in mitochondrial inner membrane biogenesis.

In yeast, the mitochondrial proteome is estimated to contain ∼800 proteins (1Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, as for most organisms, the mitochondrial genome codes for only 12 of the hundreds of mitochondrial polypeptides, most of which are components of the OXPHOS machinery (2Okimoto R. Macfarlane J.L. Clary D.O. Wolstenholme D.R. Genetics. 1992; 130: 471-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrion is a key player in a number of cellular processes including metal ion homeostasis, the synthesis of metabolites, and free radical disproportionation. Ninety eight percent of mitochondrial proteins are translated in the cytosol on free ribosomes and then post- or co-translationally imported into mitochondria. Thus, mitochondrial protein import is a fundamental process in eukaryotic cells (3Baker K.P. Schatz G. Nature. 1991; 349: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 4Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).The mitochondrion consists of an outer and inner membrane, which serves to separate two aqueous compartments, the matrix and the intermembrane space. There is an elaborate set of proteins within each sub-compartment of the mitochondrion for protein import (5Truscott K.N. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Curr.

These translocons are specialized and recognize precursors that possess specific targeting and sorting information. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the outer mitochondrial membrane contains a single translocase for the passage of polypeptides. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of outer membrane; AAC, ADP/ATP carrier; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TIN/TIM, translocase of inner membrane; DDP, deafness dystonia polypeptide; RNAi, RNA interference; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DTCs, distal tip cells; PHB, prohibitin. 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of outer membrane; AAC, ADP/ATP carrier; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TIN/TIM, translocase of inner membrane; DDP, deafness dystonia polypeptide; RNAi, RNA interference; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DTCs, distal tip cells; PHB, prohibitin. complex facilitates translocation across the outer membrane (7Schatz G.

The sorting and assembly machinery, a second complex in the outer membrane, facilitates assembly of outer membrane proteins with complex topologies such as β-barrel structures (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Prinz T. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Once a precursor has passed through the TOM complex to the intermembrane space, the precursor can take one of several routes. Precursors destined for the matrix typically contain an amino-terminal targeting signal that is utilized by the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM)23 complex (11Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 57-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C.

The TIM23 translocon facilitates translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a membrane potential dependent manner. Insertion into the inner membrane is accomplished by a related but functionally distinct translocon, the TIM22 complex (5Truscott K.N. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Curr.

Precursors that utilize the TIM22 translocon such as the carrier family of proteins, Tim22p and Tim23p, have targeting information within the mature polypeptide and lack an amino-terminal targeting sequence. In addition, the TIM22 translocon utilizes two soluble complexes in the intermembrane space, the Tim9p-Tim10p complex and the Tim8p-Tim13p complex, that function to bind to the hydrophobic stretches found in TIM22 substrates as they are escorted across the aqueous intermembrane space (15Koehler C.M.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common factor in a broad range of diseases, and numerous mitochondrial proteins have been identified as regulators of the aging process (22Wallace D.C.

Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The first disease Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome associated with a defect in protein import is caused by mutations in the intermembrane space import component DDP-1 (deafness dystonia polypeptide) (24Tranebjaerg L.

The reverse genetic manipulation used impairs mitochondrial protein translocation in biochemical assays. Gene knock-down of the homologous translocation components led to developmental defects in specific tissues as well. Specifically, knock-down of tin-9.1, tin-9.2, and tin-10 resulted in a small body (Sma) size, reduced brood size, and partial embryonic lethality. tin-9.2(RNAi) animals also had cell migration defects. tomm-7(RNAi) and ddp-1(RNAi) animals displayed defects in mitochondrial morphology. Thus, aspects of human mitochondrial diseases are mimicked in C. elegans and provide an excellent model for understanding the global impact of mitochondrial biogenesis on a multicellular organism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Cloning—Strains were maintained at 20 °C unless otherwise specified by using standard techniques (26Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type genes were cloned from N2 Bristol. The mitochondrial outer membrane YFP marker under the expression of the myo-3 promoter was generously donated by the van der Bliek laboratory. Transgenic worms were obtained as described previously (27Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) by injecting expression constructs and the transformation marker, rol-6(su1006), into the gonad of adult wild-type C. elegans.RNAi constructs were created by PCR amplification of genes from either genomic DNA or cDNA pools generated from purified poly(A)+ RNA (Ambion). The PCR products were then cloned into the L4440 vector, and the Escherichia coli host HT115 was used for feeding RNAi studies (28Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). A genomic clone of tin-9.1 and cDNA clones of tomm-7, ddp-1, tin-9.2, and tin-10 were used.Microscopy and Image Analysis—Live worms were mounted on a film of dried agarose in a small volume of M9 medium. The worms were paralyzed with 10 mm aldicarb. Green fluorescent protein variants were viewed with fluorescein isothiocyanate, YFP, or CFP filter sets (Chroma Technologies Corp.). Worms were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope.RNAi Methods—Eggs were isolated from OP50 fed wild-type worms and allowed to hatch in liquid S-medium overnight in the absence of food. The synchronous L1 larvae were then seeded onto NGM plates containing E. coli expressing double-stranded RNA specific for mitochondrial import components. The plates were incubated at the temperatures stated. At adulthood, worms were moved to fresh RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs for 4 h. The adult animals were then removed, and the second-generation animals were scored for morphological defects. Third generation animals were obtained in a similar manner.Mitochondria Purification—For large scale RNAi, worms grown in liquid culture were prepared as above except the synchronous and starved L1 larvae were diluted to 2000 worms/ml of S-medium containing freshly induced E. coli expressing dsRNA. The worms were fed until adulthood, and then the animals were cleaned by sucrose flotation and washed thoroughly before utilization for mitochondria purification.Mitochondria were purified from lactate-grown yeast cells (29Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or from S-medium-cultured adult worms by a modified protocol derived from Jonassen et al. (30Jonassen T. Davis D.E. Larsen P.L Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51735-51742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The nematodes were resuspended in buffer STEG (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) with 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (PIC, Roche Diagnostics). The samples were kept cold on ice throughout the fractionation procedure. The animals were homogenized with a Kontes ground glass tissue grinder using 15 strokes. The volume was increased to 25 ml with STEG + 1 mm PMSF/PIC and centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were saved, and another 10 ml of STEG +1 mm PMSF, 1× PIC was added to the pellets. The pellets were resuspended and homogenized again with another 15 strokes, and the volumes were increased to 25 ml and centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellets were gently resuspended in 10 ml of STEG without protease inhibitors using a Potter-Elvehjem tissue homogenizer with PTFE pestle (Bellco). The mixture was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, avoiding the pellets, and were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The final mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in STEG. Purified mitochondria were used immediately for in vitro import assays because coupled import-competent organelles could not be recovered after freezing.In Vitro Protein Import Assays—In vitro protein import assays were performed as described (31Rospert S. Schatz G. Celis J.E. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 277-285Google Scholar). Proteins were synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine after in vitro transcription of the corresponding gene by SP6 polymerase. The reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled precursor was incubated with isolated mitochondria at the indicated temperatures in import buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 20 mm K+ HEPES, pH 7.4). Where indicated, the potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane was dissipated with 1 μm valinomycin. Nonimported radiolabeled proteins were removed by treatment with 100 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min on ice; trypsin was inhibited with 400 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Import reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Import was quantified by scanning laser densitometry (Personal Densitometer SI; Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant (version 4.2a; Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSWe performed a phylogenetic analysis of five predicted genes in the C. elegans genome with sequence similarity to the small Tim family of proteins and Tom7p with S. cerevisiae, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. Specifically, we assembled dendrograms for the annotated genes Y93A3CR.4, C06G3.11, a non-annotated gene found on BAC B0564 (32Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Y66D12A.22, and ZK652.2 here referred to as ddp-1, tin-9.1, tin-9.2, tin-10, and tomm-7, respectively (Fig. 1A); trees were assembled using ClustalW (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). Similar to other eukaryotic systems, the C. elegans genome codes for at least one member of each small Tim family: one from the Tim8 family, two Tim9 isoforms, one Tim10/12 family member, and one from Tim13. Therefore, C. elegans shares a similar complement of components in the conserved TIM22 pathway for the import of polytopic inner membrane proteins.The tin-9.2 gene had not been annotated previously, although an SL1 spliced tin-9.2 sequence is present on cDNA EST yk1059h04.5. To confirm that the gene product of this cDNA could be translated and was correctly targeted to the mitochondria, we placed the cDNA clone upstream of and inframe with CFP under the control of the myo-3 gene promoter for expression in muscle cells. This construct was co-injected with a plasmid bearing the rol-6(su1006) mutation which causes the animals carrying the transgenes to move twisting in a circle rather than crawling. TIN-9.2::CFP accumulated in tubular structures in the muscle cells of transgenic animals (Fig. 1B) and co-localized with the mitochondria-specific dye rhodamine 6G (data not shown). Thus, TIN-9.2 localizes to mitochondria as expected.Isolation of Import-competent Mitochondria from C. elegans—Gene knock-down of the translocation components was obtained by RNAi treatment. The transcript levels for the specific genes were down-regulated in RNAi-treated but not control animals when assessed by quantification of RT-PCR products (data not shown). To establish the effectiveness of RNAi treatment and to demonstrate that the C. elegans homologs function as they do in yeast, we developed a protocol that yields import-competent mitochondria. The mitochondria were purified from adult C. elegans essentially as described previously (34Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, C. elegans are grown in a medium containing high levels of Ca2+ that can disrupt mitochondrial function, so we substituted the Ca2+-chelator EGTA for EDTA in the isolation buffer. In organello import assays are well established for fungi and have been instrumental for the fundamental understanding of mitochondrial assembly in a single cell (31Rospert S. Schatz G. Celis J.E. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 277-285Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine and [35S]cysteine precursors for porin, ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), and the synthetic precursor pSu9-DHFR were synthesized in vitro for in organello import assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). The established yeast assay uses porin to test for import into the mitochondrial outer membrane. A membrane potential is not required for this translocation. For all import assays nonimported precursor is removed by protease treatment. Porin was imported into the mitochondrial outer membrane in both nematode and control yeast mitochondria (Fig. 2). Insertion into the outer membrane was confirmed by alkali extraction and flotation through a sucrose density gradient (35Allen R. Egan B. Gabriel K. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Mitochondria isolated from wild-type adults are import-competent. [35S]Methionine- and [35S]cysteine-radiolabeled precursors, porin, AAC, and pSu9-DHFR, were synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate system and incubated with coupled mitochondria isolated from C. elegans or S. cerevisiae. Equal aliquots of the import reaction were removed at the specified time points and treated with trypsin to remove nonimported precursor. The membrane potential (ΔΨ) was dissipated with valinomycin treatment. Porin insertion into the outer membrane was confirmed by carbonate extraction and sucrose flotation (35Allen R. Egan B. Gabriel K. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a control, an aliquot of the porin import reaction was treated with 0.1% Triton X-100. Inner membrane insertion of AAC was confirmed by extraction with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.0 (36Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The Su9-DHFR precursor (p) was processed to the mature (m) form when imported into the mitochondrial matrix in the presence of ΔΨ. Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. As a standard (S), 10% of the translation reaction added to mitochondria was included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The established yeast assay uses the AAC to test for import into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Succinate was added to the mitochondria to maintain a membrane potential and the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and K+ ionophore valinomycin were added to dissipate the membrane potential. The inner membrane substrate AAC was imported into the inner membrane of the purified C. elegans mitochondria in the presence of a membrane potential (ΔΨ) (Fig. 2). The insertion was confirmed by alkali extraction (36Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The synthetic precursor pSu9-DHFR was imported into the matrix of the purified C. elegans mitochondria in a ΔΨ-dependent manner, as it is in yeast, and the presequence was cleaved by the matrix-processing protease (37Isaya G. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In sum, these in organello import assays in samples from C. elegans render this system amenable to the study of mitochondrial protein import.Mitochondria from Worms with RNAi-mediated Gene Knockdown of tin-9.1 and tin-10 Are Defective in Inner Membrane Protein Import—In yeast, Tim9p and Tim10p are essential proteins involved in the TIM22 import pathway that facilitates the insertion of polytopic inner membrane proteins, such as AAC (14Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W. Schmid K. Jarosch E. Dolfini L. Junne T. Schatz G. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6477-6486Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To test whether the nematode homologs TIN-9.1 and TIN-10 also mediate the import of AAC, we used feeding RNAi to down-regulate TIN-9.1 and TIN-10 in C. elegans, and subsequently mitochondria were purified from treated adults. As expected, pSu9-DHFR import and maturation were similar in the RNAi-treated and wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 3, top panel). However, the import of AAC was decreased in mitochondria isolated from tin-9.1(RNAi) and tin-10(RNAi) worms by 76 and 81%, respectively, in comparison to mitochondria from control adults (Fig. 3, bottom panel). This severe decrease suggests that TIN-9.1 and TIN-10 are functionally conserved components of the TIM22 import pathway. In addition, these biochemical studies demonstrate that the RNAi treatment is successful for decreasing TIN-9.1 and TIN-10 expression levels.Fig. 3RNAi of TIN-9.1 and TIN-10 results in an import defect specific for the inner membrane substrate AAC. Import reactions were performed as in Fig. 2, except that mitochondria were isolated from N2 worms fed E. coli expressing dsRNA for tin-9.1 or TIN-10 or no dsRNA (control). Import was quantitated by scanning laser densitometry, and the % import was normalized to the longest time point for control mitochondria in the presence of ΔΨ.

Decreases in nuclear encoded mitochondria-associated gene function lead to an increase in life span (23Lee S.S. Lee R.Y. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat.

The mean life span of tomm-7(RNAi), ddp-1(RNAi), and tin-9.1(RNAi) animals showed no significant difference compared with control animals (Fig. 4). The mean life span of tin-9.2(RNAi) and tin-10(RNAi) animals was decreased 10 and 18%, respectively. We interpret this decrease in life span to be a result of sickness, rather than accelerated aging because these animals exhibit slower movement and increased incidence of protruding vulva (Pvl) phenotypes.Fig. 4RNAi of mitochondrial import components does not influence life span. Eggs from N2 OP50 fed worms were isolated and allowed to hatch on plates seeded with E. coli expressing dsRNA specific for mitochondria translocation components. The plates were incubated at 25 °C and monitored every 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess fertility, we determined the brood size and the fraction of embryonic lethality over three sequential generations (Table I). tomm-7(RNAi), ddp-1(RNAi), and control animals showed similar brood sizes and no embryonic lethality in all generations tested. In contrast, tin-9.1(RNAi) worms showed a decrease in average brood size of 51% in the first generation compared with control animals, 38% in the second generation, and 39% in the third generation. tin-10(RNAi) worms also had smaller brood sizes, and this phenotype was more penetrant than in tin-9.1(RNAi) worms in subsequent generations. Unlike the other translocation components tested, tin-10(RNAi) worms had decreased brood sizes and increased embryonic lethality in the second generation, and the third generation animals that grew to adulthood were sterile. First generation tin-9.2(RNAi) worms showed no defects in brood size. However, the subsequent F2 and F3 progeny had average brood sizes decreased by 59 and 47%, respectively, compared with control animals. The RNAi animals that presented a sterile phenotype were not included in the calculation of the average brood size. The seemingly high standard deviations recorded for the observed phenotypes probably result in part from the combined occurrence of decreased fertility and embryonic lethality. Most interestingly, there were shared reproductive defects in the second and third generation associated with tin-9.1(RNAi), tin-9.2(RNAi), and tin-10(RNAi) worms, which are presumed to function together in the import pathway for polytopic inner membrane proteins. The decrease in viable eggs and larvae is expected, because the homologous genes are essential for viability in yeast.Table IDevelopmental effects of RNAi for mitochondrial import componentsTreatmentaE. coli strain HT115(DE3) expressing either no dsRNA from the empty vector L4440 (control) or dsRNA from vector L4440 encoding specific mitochondrial translocation components, tomm-7, ddp-1, tin-9.1, tin-9.2, or tin-10, were fed to strain N2F1F2F3Average brood sizebBrood sizes were scored for 20 individual F2 and F3 worms given a tin-9.1, tin-9.2, or tin-10 RNAi E. coli food source.

We find confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were quiescent and expressed low levels of cyclooxygenase-2, but expressed cyclooxygenase-2 at levels comparable with cytokine-stimulated cells when present in a subconfluent culture. Mechanically wounding endothelial cell monolayers stimulated rapid cyclooxygenase-2 expression that increased with the level of wounding. Cyclooxygenase-2 re-expression occurred throughout the culture, suggesting signaling from cells proximal to the wound to distal cells. Media from wounded monolayers stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression in confluent monolayers, which correlated with the level of wounding of the donor monolayer. Wounded monolayers and cells in subconfluent cultures secreted enhanced levels of prostaglandin (PG) E2 that depended on cyclooxygenase-2 activity, and PGE2 stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression in confluent endothelial cell monolayers. Cells from subconfluent monolayers migrated through filters more readily than those from confluent monolayers, and the cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitor NS-398 suppressed migration. Adding PGE2 to NS-398-treated cells augmented migration. Endothelial cells also migrated into mechanically denuded areas of confluent monolayers, and this too was suppressed by NS-398. We conclude that endothelial cells not in contact with neighboring cells express cyclooxygenase-2 that results in enhanced release of PGE2, and that this autocrine and paracrine loop enhances endothelial cell migration to cover denuded areas of the endothelium.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting blood vessels, is essential for wound repair, tumor growth, and metastasis (1Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cell migration from the confluent monolayer of endothelial cells of mature vessels into matrix underlies this process. Prostanoids, collectively E2 (PGE2), 1The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ara-C, β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ara-C, β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. PGF2α, PGD2, PGI2, and thromboxane A2, are cyclooxygenase products involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth (2Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1511-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Williams C.S. Tsujii M. Reese J. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Individual prostanoids are recognized by a family of G protein-coupled receptors whose distribution controls the prostanoid signaling axis (4Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, that have both shared and separate functions (5Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-1, found in many tissues, typically is constitutively expressed, although it and not cyclooxygenase-2 is induced in uterine endothelial cells in the third trimester of pregnancy when PGI2 levels and blood flow increase (6Janowiak M.A. Magness R.R. Habermehl D.A. Bird I.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cyclooxgenase-2 typically is absent from endothelial cells and white blood cells but accumulates to high levels in endothelial cells over several hours in response to IL-1β (7Jones D.A. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lipopolysaccharide (8Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accordingly, cyclooxygenase-2 has numerous transcriptional regulatory elements in its 5′-regulatory region (11Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 12Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-2 is dramatically induced by growth factors, tumor promoters and mitogens, and is aberrantly expressed in tumors, including those of colon (14Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), breast, and prostate (15Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenases are the targets of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and NSAIDs decrease cancer risk and suppress tumorigenesis in animal models (15Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). NSAIDs inhibit endothelial cell spreading, migration, and angiogenesis (16Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), processes controlled by PGE2 (17Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), just as genetic ablation of cyclooxygenase-2 blocks the growth of cyclooxygenase-2-replete tumors by suppressing angiogenesis (3Williams C.S. Tsujii M. Reese J. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). These gene-targeted animals show that it is cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the host stromal cells, including endothelium, and not by the tumor cells themselves that is critical and suggest that host autocrine and paracrine signaling has a role in tumorigenesis. Tumors express high levels of PGE2, and pharmacologic suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 activity, and not that of cyclooxygenase-1, depletes PGE2 and blocks tumorigenesis (18Zweifel B.S. Davis T.W. Ornberg R.L. Masferrer J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6706-6711PubMed Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained when PGE2 was depleted with a monoclonal antibody (18Zweifel B.S. Davis T.W. Ornberg R.L. Masferrer J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6706-6711PubMed Google Scholar), so PGE2 is one factor controlling angiogenesis and tumor growth. Endothelial cells migrating during angiogenesis necessarily lack a neighboring cell at the leading edge of the nascent tubule. We find that endothelial cells not completely surrounded by neighboring endothelial cells and those not embedded in a confluent monolayer of cells display a characteristic of highly activated cells, cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Re-expression of cyclooxygenase-2, which was down-regulated as cells formed a monolayer, results in enhanced PGE2 secretion that aids endothelial cell migration to reestablish a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells. Reagents—NS-398 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); the monoclonal antibodies against cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was from BIO-SOURCE, and PGE2 ELISA kits were from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). Calcein AM was the product of Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and the cell cycle inhibitors aphidicolin, mimosine, 5-fluorouracil, Ara-C, and nocodazole were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Transwell inserts with a black membrane (3 μm pores) were from Discovery Labware. IL-1β, phorbol myristate acetate, TNF, lipopolysaccharide, and all other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Monolayer Wounding—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (19Zimmerman G.A. Whatley R.E. McIntyre T.M. Benson D.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 520-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These cells were allowed to achieve confluence, typically in 3-5 days, and then were serum-starved by culturing for 24 h in media containing 1% human serum before initiating our experiments. Cells were maintained in M199 supplemented with 20% pooled human serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The wound repair model used freshly isolated endothelial cells grown to confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates before the cells were mechanically removed from the plate by dragging a 1000-μl pipette tip along the confluent monolayer as the plate rested over a template. Low wounding consisted of seven cell-free lines formed in the monolayer and medium wounding employed 21 parallel wound lines. For the heavily wounded monolayers, the plates were rotated 90° after the first medium wounding, and then an additional 21 parallel lines were etched in the monolayer to form square islands of remaining cells. The monolayers were washed after wounding to remove the debris and fed fresh medium that also contained any agonist to be included in the experiment. Images of the wounded cultures were recorded just after medium wounding (t = 0) and then 24 h later for most experiments. Four fields were recorded for each sample, and the assays were repeated 10 or more times. Endothelial Cell Migration—Migration of endothelial cells was determined with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Briefly, polycarbonate filter wells (3-μm pores, BD Biosciences) were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Endothelial cells from confluent monolayers or individual cells from the same isolation plated at a lower density to preclude monolayer formation were freed from the dish by trypsinization. The cells were then washed by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in culture medium containing a reduced concentration (1%) of human serum. The recovered cells (1.5-2.5 × 104) were added to the upper chamber of a transwell insert, and the filter inserts were incubated in wells of a 24-well culture plate containing 750 μl of medium. NS-398, when present, was added to both the upper and lower chambers. Basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml) was added to the lower chamber as a positive control. After 21-22 h, the cells were stained with calcein AM (4 μg/ml for 30 min), and cell migration was quantitated by measuring the fluorescence of the migrated cells in a fluorescent plate reader (Fusion, Hewlett-Packard) using its bottom reading capability. Alternatively, photographs of the migrated cells were recorded by confocal microscopy. Four randomly selected low power (×10) fields were chosen, and the number of cells in each field was counted. The migration response was expressed as fold increase over base line where each condition was assayed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least twice. Student's t tests (Graph-Pad Instat) showed all changes were significant (p < 0.05). Cell Proliferation—Inhibition of the cell cycle at various points was accomplished by growing the endothelial cells to confluence in 20% human serum, washing the cells, and then starving them in 1% human serum for 17 h in the presence of agents that interfere with cell cycle progression at distinct stages. Aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) and mimosine (1 mm) block cell cycling during late G1/S phase; 5-fluorouracil (10 μm) and 1β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C; 1 μm) interfere with deoxynucleotide synthesis in S phase; and nocodazole (0.5 μg/ml) blocks microtubule depolymerization required for M phase. The monolayers were then wounded, or not, in the high wounding pattern and incubated with the stated agents for 8 h before cellular material was collected for analysis of cyclooxygenase-2 by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—Endothelial cells were grown to confluence in 8-well glass chamber slides coated with fibronectin or maintained at a lower density to preclude monolayer formation as before. Multiple wound lines were made in each chamber of confluent endothelial cells using a 200-μl pipette tip, and the remaining cells were washed and then fed with endothelial cell medium containing 1% human serum. After the specified time, the medium was flicked out of the wells, and chambers were peeled off. Cells on the slides were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.5% TRI301 for 5 min, and incubated with cyclooxygenase-2 antibodies (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the slides were developed with biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (2 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by Alexa 488-labeled streptavidin for 45 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide (15 μg/ml for 5 min) was used to stain the nuclei before the images were recorded by confocal microscopy. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then with iced cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 16 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). A cell scraper removed the cellular material, and the lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Protein content of the supernatants was quantitated using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Thirty micrograms of each sample was mixed with sample buffer and resolved in a 10% acrylamide gel by electrophoresis. Proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the resulting membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% dried milk and then incubated with antigen-specific antibodies (cyclooxygenase-2, Cayman Chemical Co; β-actin, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) and further reacted with appropriate secondary antibody. The horseradish peroxidase of the secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. PGE2ELISA—Endothelial cells were grown to confluence, or their cognate subconfluent cultures from the same cord, in 6-well plates and extensively wounded with a 1000-μl pipette tip as described above. The residual cells were washed with serum-free endothelial cell medium and fed fresh endothelial cell growth medium containing 1% human serum. After 8 h, this medium was collected, and PGE2 was quantitated by a sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocols. Some cultures were supplemented with arachidonic acid by washing the culture with Hanks' buffered saline solution and then adding 20 μm arachidonic acid in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 0.1% human serum for 30 min before the medium was collected for PGE2 ELISA. The data in these experiments were normalized by cell number. Cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE2Production Are Regulated by Cell Contact—Inducible cyclooxygenase-2 has a key role in tumor angiogenesis (15Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 20Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), and the prostaglandin PGE2 it produces stimulates angiogenesis (21Majima M. Isono M. Ikeda Y. Hayashi I. Hatanaka K.

Kuwano M. Ono M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and endothelial cell adhesion and spreading (17Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells primarily exist as a confluent monolayer of quiescent cells (Fig. 1A) but rapidly spread, migrate, and proliferate in response to mechanical denudation as occurs during invasive procedures. We found that confluent monolayers of endothelial cells cultured for 24 h in a reduced amount of serum expressed trace amounts of cyclooxygenase-2 protein by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1A, lower left). However, cells cultured in numbers insufficient to form a monolayer displayed a sharply increased level of cyclooxygenase-2 expression (Fig. 1A, lower right). Staining shows the enzyme was associated with punctate intracellular structures and particularly stained the nuclear membrane, as anticipated (23Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The amount of cyclooxygenase-2 staining by individual cells not organized into a monolayer was equivalent to that found in confluent endothelial cell cultures after treatment with powerful stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β), lipopolysaccharide, or a phorbol ester (Fig. 1B). Cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression in cells maintained in a confluent state was not detectable by Western analysis (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells at 40% of the final density of a confluent monolayer expressed this enzyme, and cells seeded even more sparsely to give a density of 20% of confluent cultures contained more cyclooxygenase-2 than this. These samples were normalized for protein content before electrophoresis, which produced equal levels of staining for β-actin, and so this cyclooxygenase-2 staining reflects average cellular content. This enzyme was fully functional because endothelial cells not organized into a confluent monolayer made and released about 17 times more PGE2 than confluent cultures on a per cell basis when provided with exogenous arachidonate (Fig. 2B). Subconfluent endothelial cells continuously produced twice as much PGE2 as their confluent counterparts even when exogenous arachidonate was not provided to overcome the limiting level of endogenous arachidonate (Fig. 2C). Endothelial cell production of PGE2 from both confluent monolayers and individual cells primarily was a function of cyclooxygenase-2 activity because the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug NS-398 that selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 effectively blocked PGE2 synthesis and release by endothelial cells cultured under either condition (Fig. 2C). Wounding Endothelial Cell Monolayers Stimulates Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression Proximal and Distal to the Wound—Endothelial cells in a confluent monolayer clearly differ from individual cells before they organize and establish intercellular communications. We tested whether an abrupt disruption of a confluent monolayer, as occurs during invasive clinical procedures, affects cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the same way as seeding the culture at a low density. To do this, we denuded sections of tightly confluent monolayers by dragging a pipette tip along the plate in a pattern to create three levels of wounding (Fig. 3A). We found by Western analysis (Fig. 3B) that cyclooxygenase-2 was present in the cells remaining after wounding the monolayer and that the level of protein expression increased with the number of lines drawn through the culture. The amount of cyclooxygenase-2 accumulated by wounded cultures was nearly that reached following phorbol ester stimulation. Cyclooxygenase-1 did not change by wounding the monolayer, although phorbol myristate acetate stimulation modestly enhanced the cellular content of this isoform. We visualized cyclooxygenase-2 expression by wounded monolayers to determine whether cells adjacent to the wound line, which are the cells directly affected by the wounding procedure, were the only cells to express cyclooxygenase-2. We found that each cell adjacent to the wound expressed this enzyme, but many cells distal to the wound also expressed immunoreactive cyclooxygenase-2 (Fig. 3C). Enhanced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was detected just 2 h after wounding the monolayer, with a further enhancement 4-8 h after wounding. In Fig. 3C, the lower two panels are composite images that show the cells remaining between two wound lines, with the wounds being the black acellular area at the ends of the picture marked by the introduction of a white dotted line. These images show that the majority of the green fluorescence representing cyclooxygenase-2, and indeed the brightest cells, was found well away from the wound edge, so cyclooxygenase-2 expression occurs in cells not mechanically affected by the wounding or by loss of neighboring cells. Endothelial Cells Release PGE2after Wounding, Which Stimulates Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression—Confluent cultures of endothelial cells make and release PGE2, and wounding the monolayer increased this secretion (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The amount of PGE2 released from the cells remaining in the mechanically disturbed monolayer varied with the extent of wounding, and the most heavily scored monolayers released the most PGE2. We pretreated the monolayers with NS-398 to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 activity, and we found that nearly all of the PGE2 released from wounded monolayers came from this enzyme (Fig. 4A, lower panel). The positive control for cyclooxygenase-2 expression, phorbol myristoyl acetate, also stimulated PGE2 release from intact monolayers that was also abolished by NS-398 pretreatment. PGE2 stimulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression in some (24Maldve R.E. Kim Y. Muga S.J. Fischer S.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 873-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not all (12Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), contact-inhibited cells, and so we questioned whether PGE2 acted on endothelial cells to induce the rate-limiting enzyme for its synthesis, cyclooxygenase-2. We found that 10 nm PGE2, the lowest concentration we tested, effectively stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression and that stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 accumulation was maximal at 33 nm (Fig. 4B). This observation, coupled with enhanced secretion of PGE2 by wounded monolayers, suggested that the supernatants from wounded monolayers should increase cyclooxygenase-2 expression in confluent endothelial cell cultures. We extensively wounded endothelial cell cultures as before, collected the media overlaying these cells 4 h after wounding, and then incubated new, confluent cultures of endothelial cells containing little cyclooxygenase-2 with this media for 4 h. We found that media from wounded cultures, but not that from unmanipulated monolayers, stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression in target cells maintained as a confluent monolayer (Fig. 4C). The level of this cyclooxygenase-2 expression increased with the level of wounding of the donor culture, just as the amount of secreted PGE2 increased with wounding density (Fig. 4A). We also found that medium from subconfluent endothelial cell cultures induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in confluent monolayers to a greater extent than media from confluent cultures (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase-2 Suppresses Endothelial Cell Migration—Disruption of the integrity of an endothelial barrier causes adjacent cells to fill in the denuded areas by spreading, migration, and proliferation (16Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We established that endothelial cells migrated into the areas denuded by the soft pipette tip, which did not score the plate and create a barrier to migration, over time (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the clean edge just after wounding, individual cells had broken away from the monolayer adjacent to the wound and entered the denuded area 24 h after the wounding. This created a disorganized edge of the wound with a few individual cells migrating individually into the denuded zone. Primarily, however, closure of the wound resulted from the entry of groups of adjacent cells that remained in contact with one another. We found extensive closure of the wound by 34 h, with little movement prior to 6 h (not shown) after wounding the monolayer (Fig. 5A). Endothelial cell migration into the denuded region depended on cyclooxygenase-2 activity because NS-398 suppressed cell entry into the acellular area and wound closure (Fig. 5B). The wound edge after NS-398 treatment remained uniform, although there was a modest decrease in the distance between the remaining endothelial cells. Progression through the Cell Cycle Does Not Control Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression after Monolayer Wounding—Endothelial cell monolayers are growth-arrested, and either release from an enforced cell cycle arrest or the addition of the growth factors in serum stimulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression in serum-starved fibroblasts (25Gilroy D.W. Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Wu K.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We tested the role of progression through the cell cycle on cyclooxygenase-2 expression in endothelial cells after wounding by including agents that interfere with deoxynucleotide synthesis (Ara-C and 5-fluorouracil) in S phase, that introduce a block at the G1/S boundary (aphidicolin and mimosine), or block microtubule cycling during the M phase (nocodazole). We found that wounding increases cyclooxygenase-2 protein in the presence of any of these inhibitors, and so wounding was unlike serum stimulation and was not dependent on cell replication (Fig. 6). Endothelial Cell Motility Is Enhanced by Cyclooxygenase-2 Activity and PGE2—We quantified endothelial cell motility using a modified Boyden chamber by imaging and counting calcein-labeled cells. We found that endothelial cells isolated from confluent cultures migrated through the filter in the absence of an added agonist, and that the addition of the chemoattractant β-fibroblast growth factor increased the number of migrating cells (Fig. 7A). Endothelial cells isolated from subconfluent cultures, however, were inherently more motile than their counterparts isolated from a confluent monolayer of cells. In fact, cells from a subconfluent culture were as motile as cells from a confluent culture after being stimulated with β-fibroblast growth factor. We found that endothelial cell motility was suppressed by about half after treating the cells with NS-398 (Fig. 7B). The effect of NS-398 was statistically significant at the 30 μm we used in other experiments, but we were unable to further reduce endothelial cell motility with higher concentrations of this cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. We conclude that cyclooxygenase products modulate motility but are not essential for cell migration. We inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 activity in cells isolated from subconfluent cultures, which again suppressed a portion of their motility, and then added PGE2 back to the isolated cells. We found that the addition of PGE2 partially restored cell motility in cells treated with NS-398 (Fig. 7C). The increase in migration is a chemokinetic enhancement of cell motility rather than direct chemoattraction by a gradient of PGE2 because PGE2 was added to both the upper and lower well and because a gradient would not be maintained over the 22 h of the experiment. We find that individual endothelial cells not organized into a tightly confluent monolayer of cells express cyclooxygenase-2. Expression of this regulatory enzyme then diminishes as the cells form the intercellular contacts made possible by closely opposed cells in confluent monolayers. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression and PGE2 production were rapidly reestablished after an abrupt loss of neighboring cells when we mechanically wounded cultures of quiescent endothelial cell monolayers. Reactivation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by wounding leads to increased synthesis and release of PGE2 to the surrounding media because the selective inhibitor NS-398 completely suppressed enhanced PGE2 secretion. Juxtacrine signaling, i.e. signaling by a neighboring cell, and paracrine and autocrine signaling by PGE2 are previously unknown mechanisms used to control expression of cyclooxygenase-2. This mode of regulation is relevant to angiogenesis before perfusion of the new vessel can occur, and is one that will have a major effect on the apparent background expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in cultured endothelial cells. Denudation of vascular endothelium is a consequence of invasive clinical procedures from stent placement to grafting to venipuncture. This constitutes an inflammatory signal for the endothelium as shown by the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE2. Endothelial cells remaining after mechanical denudation responded to the extent of monolayer disruption with a graded accumulation of PGE2 and cyclooxygenase-2. Immunocytochemistry showed cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression by both cells adjacent and distal to the wound line, which suggests cells distal to the mechanical wound received information regarding the loss of cellular contacts from the cells immediately adjacent to the wound edge. Disrupting an endothelial cell monolayer with a fine scratch results in a wave of Ca2+ excitation from the injured/surviving cells adjacent to the wound to distal cells that is critical for motility (26Tran P.O. Hinman L.E. Unger G.M. Sammak P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and proliferation (27Tran P.O. Tran Q.H. Hinman L.E. Sammak P.J. Cell Proliferation. 1998; 31: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition to this, we find a positive feed-forward loop involving the prostanoid PGE2 after mechanical disruption of endothelial cell monolayers that aids recovery of monolayer integrity. PGE2 stimulates endothelial cell cyclooxygenase-2 expression at low nanomolar levels, as recently found for cyclooxygenase 2 accumulation in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells after bradykinin stimulation (28Bradbury D.A. Newton R. Zhu Y.M. El-Haroun H. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49954-49964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PGE2 accumulated to levels (∼6 nm) sufficient to stimulate cyclooxygenase-2 expression after wounding confluent monolayers even in the absence of an exogenous source of arachidonate. We cannot directly support the autocrine/paracrine role of PGE2 in stimulating cyclooxygenase-2 in our systems because inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 catalytic activity, including NS-398, themselves induce cyclooxygenase protein expression (12Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The amount of PGE2 made in vivo may be enhanced by exogenous sources of arachidonate such as high density lipoprotein (29Pomerantz K.B. Fleisher L.N. Tall A.R. Cannon P.J. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1984; 97: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar), but blood flow washing over the endothelium will likely restrict PGE2 induction of cyclooxygenase-2 expression to those cells that synthesized the PGE2. The PGE2 feed-forward signaling loop, however, may extend to paracrine signaling in some compartments that are closed. For example, cyclooxygenase-2 accumulates in the endothelium throughout the central nervous system during acute peripheral inflammation (30Ibuki T. Matsumura K. Yamazaki Y. Nozaki T. Tanaka Y. Kobayashi S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or burn injury (31Ozaki-Okayama Y. Matsumura K. Ibuki T. Ueda M. Yamazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Kobayashi S. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 32: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This increases PGE2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid, to 3 and 0.3 nm respectively, and associates with hyperalgesia in these models. PGE2 may also accumulate during angiogenesis where the endothelial cells at the leading edge are not part of an organized monolayer, and any PGE2 released before perfusion of the new microvessel is established will be confined to that area. Endothelial cells express cyclooxygenase-2 in response to diverse soluble agonists ranging from serum (32DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to endotoxin (8Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar) to cytokines (7Jones D.A. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Ther. 2001; 297: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar) to lipid agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (12Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D.

Cyclooxygenase-2 expression has not been characterized as a response to environmental stimuli such as intercellular contacts, although prostaglandin production from arachidonate by endothelial cells is modulated by the number of population doublings (34Ingerman-Wojenski C.M. Silver M.J. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. Prostaglandins. 1988; 36: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and cell density has been shown to affect the amount of PGE2 made in response to IL-1 stimulation of an osteoblast-like cell line (35Laulederkind S.J. Kirtikara K. Raghow R. Ballou L.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-2 is also induced in a fibroblastic cell line after re-addition of serum to cells synchronized by complete serum starvation (25Gilroy D.W. Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Wu K.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but wounding endothelial cell monolayers does not induce cyclooxygenase-2 in this way. Growth factors were not added back to endothelial cell cultures after wounding, and inhibition of the cell cycle at various points did not block the increase in cyclooxygenase-2 induced by disrupting the integrity of the monolayer. Previous work (36Coomber B.L. Gotlieb A.I. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 215-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sholley M.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Cotran R.S. Lab. Investig. 1977; 36: 18-25PubMed Google Scholar) shows that incorporation of [3H]thymidine into endothelial cells adjacent to a wound in a monolayer is a late event that occurs well after our experiments ended. Cells adjacent to the mechanical wound migrate into the area by releasing at least some of their contacts with adjacent cells in the undisturbed portion of the monolayer to migrate as individual cells. Thus, we found a few individual cells in the denuded area 24 h after injuring the monolayer, but we also found a disorganized monolayer edge that extended into the wound space. We can ascribe a role for cyclooxygenase-2 in the migration of endothelial cells into the wound because NS-398 suppressed migration. However, we found it impossible to quantitate the rate of wound edge migration or cellular coverage of the denuded area over time because of the large heterogeneity in the organization of the monolayer edge. Instead, we recovered cells from both confluent and pre-confluent cultures, and we assayed their migration through 3-μm filters to find cells obtained from the pre-confluent condition migrated faster than their counterparts isolated from confluent monolayers. We also found that NS-398 suppressed migration, and so the recovered cells mimicked their counterparts in wounded cultures of endothelial cells. We also found that adding PGE2 back to the NS-398-inhibited cells at least partially overcame the reduction in cell migration caused by the loss of cyclooxygenase-2 activity. Cyclooxygenase-2 activity of host stromal tissue, e.g. the vasculature and supporting structures, has a profound effect on tumorigenesis (15Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-2 products act on tumor cells (3Williams C.S. Tsujii M. Reese J. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) and underpin the angiogenic response of host vasculature induced by tumor cells (38Peterson H.I. Anticancer Res. 1986; 6: 251-253PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Thus, blocking the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2-derived PGE2 with inhibitors (18Zweifel B.S. Davis T.W. Ornberg R.L. Masferrer J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6706-6711PubMed Google Scholar), genetically deleting cyclooxygenase-2 (3Williams C.S. Tsujii M. Reese J. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), or sequestering PGE2 with an antibody suppresses tumor growth (18Zweifel B.S. Davis T.W. Ornberg R.L. Masferrer J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6706-6711PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, cyclooxygenase-2 has a critical role in the angiogenesis induced by inflammatory cytokines (22Kuwano T. Nakao S. Yamamoto H. Tsuneyoshi M. Yamamoto T. Kuwano M. Ono M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and inflammatory insults (40Ghosh A.K. Hirasawa N. Niki H. Ohuchi K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 802-809PubMed Google Scholar). The production of PGE2 also underlies the angiogenic effects of vascular endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (16Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 41Salcedo R. Zhang X. Young H.A. Michael N. Wasserman K. Ma W.H. Martins-Green M. Murphy W.J. Oppenheim J.J. Blood. 2003; 102: 1966-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Accordingly, application of PGE2 into the connective tissue of rat femoral vessels causes intense vascular sprouting (42Diaz-Flores L. Gutierrez R. Valladares F. Varela H. Perez M. Anat. Rec. 1994; 238: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PGE2 functions as an autocrine and paracrine signal to modulate endothelial cell monolayer formation, and the regulatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 is controlled by the integrity of the monolayer.

Rodesch (core director) for this. We acknowledge the aid provided by the University of Utah DNA sequencing core facility.

https://openalex.org/W2040086538,"The α-subunit of G proteins of the G12/13 family stimulate Rho by their direct binding to the RGS-like (RGL) domain of a family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RGL-RhoGEFs) that includes PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), p115RhoGEF, and LARG, thereby regulating cellular functions as diverse as shape and movement, gene expression, and normal and aberrant cell growth. The structural features determining the ability of Gα12/13 to bind RGL domains and the mechanism by which this association results in the activation of RGL-RhoGEFs are still poorly understood. Here, we explored the structural requirements for the functional interaction between Gα13 and RGL-RhoGEFs based on the structure of RGL domains and their similarity with the area by which RGS4 binds the switch region of Gαi proteins. Using Gαi2, which does not bind RGL domains, as the backbone in which Gα13 sequences were swapped or mutated, we observed that the switch region of Gα13 is strictly necessary to bind PRG, and specific residues were identified that are critical for this association, likely by contributing to the binding surface. Surprisingly, the switch region of Gα13 was not sufficient to bind RGL domains, but instead most of its GTPase domain is required. Furthermore, membrane localization of Gα13 and chimeric Gαi2 proteins was also necessary for Rho activation. These findings revealed the structural features by which Gα13 interacts with RGL domains and suggest that molecular interactions occurring at the level of the plasma membrane are required for the functional activation of the RGL-containing family of RhoGEFs.

Rho GTPases, which include Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play a central role in the regulation of a number of basic cellular events such as cell movement and changes in cell shape, as well as in the control of gene expression regulation and cell growth (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). These GTP-binding proteins act as molecular switches that are inactive in their GDP-bound form, and upon exchange of GDP for GTP, they adopt an active conformation in which they can interact with their specific effector molecules, thereby affecting their localization and/or activity (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 3Burridge K.

This nucleotide exchange is promoted by a large family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, dbl-homology; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; SRE, serum responsive element; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; RGL, RGS-like; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, dbl-homology; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; SRE, serum responsive element; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; RGL, RGS-like; HEK, human embryonic kidney. the vast majority of which are characterized by the presence of a dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (2Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 4Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These GEFs also exhibit a number of additional regulatory regions by which they are strictly controlled by a diverse array of upstream signaling pathways, including those initiated by cell adhesion molecules, tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, as well as by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (2Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 5Sah V.P. Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In particular for Rho, this GTPase participates in many physiological and pathological processes that involve the activation of GPCRs. For example, GPCRs such as those for thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) promote cytoskeletal changes and expression from serum responsive element (SRE)-regulated genes by activating Rho (6Buhl A.M.

Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The pathway by which these GPCRs stimulate Rho involves the activation of α-subunits of the G12/13 and Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins. Gα12/13 in turn stimulate Rho through the direct interaction with a group of Rho GEFs characterized by the presence of a RGS-like (RGL) domain (10Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D.

The family of RGL-containing Rho GEFs comprises three members: PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG) and LARG, which contain an N-terminal PDZ domain, and p115-RhoGEF (p115), which lacks this N-terminal protein-protein interaction domain (10Hart M.J.

The RGL domain is followed by DH and PH homology domains, by which they promote the nucleotide exchange on Rho, and a long C-terminal domain that harbors regulatory properties (19Fukuhara S.

The RGL domain is directly recognized by receptor-stimulated Gα12/13, thus providing a molecular bridge for the activation of Rho by Gα12/13 (19Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and in the case of p115, this domain also acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα13 (22Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). However, this GAP activity is not required to couple G13 to Rho activation, as p115 mutants that possess a reduced GAP activity toward Gα13 and a decreased binding ability for this α-subunit, still exhibit a normal ability to stimulate Rho exchange when activated by Gα13 (23Chen Z.

The Gα subunit is composed by a α-helical domain and a GTPase domain, which includes a switch region that changes conformation upon nucleotide exchange, and is directly involved in binding and hydrolysis of GTP (24Hamm H.E.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In the inactive heterotrimer the Gα subunit, with GDP bound to it, keeps stable interactions with the heterodimer Gβγ. Therefore, the effector motifs are covered in the heterotrimer, rendering both Gα and Gβγ unable to activate their respective effectors. Agonists acting on GPCRs induce a structural change that results in the nucleotide exchange and the dissociation of the heterotrimer, allowing the activation of Gα- and Gβγ-dependent effectors. Signaling is terminated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by virtue of the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits, which is further stimulated by the interaction with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins). In this regard, the crystal structure of the complex formed by RGS4-Gαi (26Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and that of the RGL domains of PRG and p115 (27Longenecker K.L. Lewis M.E. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), have provided a model for the likely mechanism by which the activity of Gα subunits is terminated, as well as the process by which Gα13 and RGL-RhoGEFs might establish a functional interaction. Regarding the latter, in the proposed model the region including switch 1 and switch 2 within the GTPase domain of Gα12/13, would be predicted to participate in the interactions with the RGL domain from RGL-RhoGEFs, whereas the N-terminal α-helical domain from Gα12/13 would not establish direct contact interactions with them. As no structural information is yet available for Gα12/13 members, we have addressed in this study the structural requirements for Gα13-dependent stimulation of Rho by engineering chimeric G proteins using Gαi2, which does not activate RGL-RhoGEFs, as the backbone in which Gα13 sequences were swapped or mutated. The emerging results revealed that the entire switch region from Gα13 is necessary but insufficient to exert a Rho-stimulating activity when expressed in the context of Gαi2. In fact, Gα13 depends on most of its GTPase domain, excluding its C-terminal 36 amino acids, for a functional interaction with PRG. Within this region, the integrity of both switch 1 and switch 2 is strictly required for a maximal effect. Furthermore, membrane localization of Gα13 or the Rho-activating chimeric Gαi2 subunits is also necessary for Rho activation, gene expression, and cell transformation. These findings indicate that specific structural features present in Gα13 together with additional molecular interactions occuring at the level of the plasma membrane are required for the effective coupling of Gα13 to the RGL-containing family of RhoGEFs, and ultimately to stimulate Rho. Bioinformatic Tools—The structure of Gαi1/RGS4 (26Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) was analyzed with the CN3D program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml) to identify amino acids in the Gαi-RGS4-contact interface within 3 Å. Sequence alignment corresponding to the switch region from representative members of each Gα protein family was performed using ClustalW (www.ch.embnet.org/software/ClustalW.html) and the figure prepared with Boxshade (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). DNA Constructs—The cDNAs for Gαi2SWα13QL and Gα13SWαi2QL chimeras were obtained by two consecutive PCR reactions, using human Gαi2- and human Gα13 GTPase-deficient mutants as templates, and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCEFL2 by EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites that were introduced with the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The cDNAs corresponding to the N-terminal, switch, and C-terminal regions were first obtained by PCR in which the internal primers were designed to overlap with the sequence of the cDNA of the fragments to be fused with in the second PCR reaction. The corresponding chimeric cDNAs were obtained by a second PCR reaction in which the three initial fragments were mixed as templates. The second set of chimeras in which the content of Gα13 was extended from the switch region toward the extremes was also obtained by PCR, in this case the template for the second PCR was the mixture of two cDNA fragments corresponding to either N- or C-terminal domains, as indicated in the respective figures. From this second series, the chimera in which the content of Gα13 extended from the switch region toward the C-terminal end was used as template for further modifications, which included reduction of the contribution of Gα13 at the C-terminal end by substitution with the corresponding sequences from Gαi2; and point mutations at the putative RGL-contact sites within the switch region and at the N-terminal myristylation signal. Point mutations were performed either by PCR to mutate the N-terminal myristylation signal by substituting Gly for Ala in the second codon, and by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene to substitute the putative RGL contact sites, following the manufacturer's instructions. All chimeric and mutant molecules were sequenced at the NIDCR DNA sequencing facility, and their expression was confirmed by Western blot using antibodies detecting the corresponding N-terminal domain. The sequence for the different primers will be made available upon request. Cell Lines and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfections, tissue culture plates were treated for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg/ml poly-d-lysine before seeding the cells to prevent them from detaching from the plates during the transfection procedure and thereafter. Transient transfections in HEK 293T cells were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum, and were used to monitor the transforming potential of the different chimeras as described (7Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Western Blots and Protein-Protein Interactions—Transfected cells were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Lysates containing ∼50 μg of total cellular protein or affinity isolated proteins (see below) were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) using rabbit anti-Gα13 (SC-410, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-Gαi2 (SC-7276, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) depending on whether the N-terminal domain of the transfected G protein chimeras was from Gαi2 or Gα13 and goat anti-rabbit (Cappel) IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. To test the ability of the different chimeras to interact with RGL domain from PRG, lysates from HEK 293T transfected cells were incubated with bacterially expressed six histidine-tagged recombinant RGL isolated with talon beads (Clontech) as previously described (27Longenecker K.L. Lewis M.E. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—Cells in 24-well plates were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of pSRE luciferase reporter plasmid, pNull Renilla, and pcDNAIII-β-gal (a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Fire-fly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cell lysates were assayed using a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega), and light emission was quantitated using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) as specified by the manufacturer (39Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Tanos T. Bernard O. Narumiya S. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In Vivo Rho Activation Assay—HEK 293T cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent. The day after transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and assayed for Rho activity using the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads to isolate the GTP-bound forms of Rho, as previously described (14Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, serumstarved HEK-293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 1mm Na3VO4, 1mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated with GST-rhotekin-RBD previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed four times with lysis buffer, and associated GTP-bound forms of Rho were released with protein loading buffer and revealed by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (26C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The content of Rho in total cell lysates was determined as a reference. Cell Fractionation—HEK 293T cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the indicated chimeras and grown for 48 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then dislodged from the plate by washing and pelleted at low speed. The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and cells were lysed by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and intact cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C, and the pellet (particulate fraction) was suspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min in a Beckman airfuge to obtain the soluble fraction and mixed with Laemmli sample buffer. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Gαi2 antibody as indicated before. Focus Forming Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with different expression plasmids together with 1 μg of pcDNAIII-β-gal, a plasmid expressing the enzyme β-galactosidase, adjusting the total amount of plasmid DNA with empty vector. The day after transfection, the cells were washed in medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and then maintained in the same medium until foci were scored, 2–3 weeks later. Duplicate plates were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and stained at 37 °C for β-galactosidase activity with a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, and 0.1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to evaluate the transfection efficiency. The Switch Region of Gα13 Is Required but Not Sufficient for Rho Activation—The structure of the RGL domain from two of the three known members of Gα12/13-responsive RhoGEFs has recently been solved (27Longenecker K.L. Lewis M.E. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The similarity of the structures of these RGL domains with the known RGS structures raised the possibility that the functional interaction between Gα12/13 and RGL-RhoGEFs might be similar to that of the complex formed by Gαi and RGS4 shown in Fig. 1A (26Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Residues in Gαi that provide surface areas in direct contact with RGS4 are indicated. In particular, this region can be subdivided into 3 switch areas, which are highly conserved among each G protein α-subunit family. Of interest, all 6 residues involved in the interaction between Gαi and RGS4 are also conserved in Gαs and Gαq, but 3 of them are quite distinct in Gα12 and Gα13, as depicted in Fig. 1B. Nonetheless, as no information regarding the three-dimensional characteristics of Gα13 family members is available, the molecular basis of their interaction with RGL-Rho-GEFs and the consequent activation of Rho remain to be determined. To begin addressing this issue, we first evaluated the possibility that the switch region from Gα13 contains all the structural elements required to elicit Rho activation. For this purpose, we engineered G protein α-subunits in which the switch region from active Gα13, Gα13QL, replaced the corresponding region from active Gαi2, Gαi2QL (Fig. 1B). The resulting chimera, named Gαi2SWα13QL, contains the first 173 amino acids (Met1-Gln173) from Gαi2 followed by a central part (Asp174-Ile266), including de switch region from Gα13QL, and the C-terminal (Leu267-Phe355) from Gαi2, as indicated. The reciprocal chimera, Gα13SWαi2QL, contains the first 194 amino acids (Met1-Gln194) from Gα13 followed by a central part (Asp195-Ile287), including the three switches, from Gαi2Q205L, and the C terminus (Leu288-Gln377) from Gα13. The activity of these chimeras was determined by their ability to stimulate a mutant SRE that responds to Rho (7Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and by their ability to interact with the RGL domain of PRG and to stimulate Rho. The different chimeric G proteins were detected by antibodies recognizing the N-terminal domain of either Gαi2 or Gα13 (Fig. 1C). As expected, a GTPase-deficient Gα13 strongly stimulated Rho-dependent pathways, while active Gαi2 was unable to do so. However, surprisingly, a chimeric Gαi2 containing what was expected to be the critical region for the interaction with RGL-RhoGEFs, did not gain the ability to stimulate Rho or to interact with PRG (Gαi2SWα13QL, Fig. 1C). Gα13, on the other hand, lost these properties when its switch region was replaced by that of Gαi2 (Gα13SWαi2QL, Fig. 1C). Direct evaluation of Rho-GTP content in transfected HEK-293T cells indicated that swapping the switches from Gα13 into Gαi2 provided to the resulting chimera only a very limited ability to stimulate Rho, while the reciprocal chimera was unable to do so (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The Structural Requirements for Rho Activation by Gα13 Extend toward the C-terminal Domain of Gα13—As swapping the switch region from Gα13QL into Gαi2QL was not sufficient to confer to Gαi2 the ability to stimulate Rho, we predicted that additional structural elements from Gα13 were required to support this effect. In order to test this possibility, we engineered additional chimeras where the contribution from Gα13QL into the Gαi2 backbone was extended from the switch region toward their N or C termini (Fig. 2, upper panel). Chimeras in which only the N- or C-terminal domains were swapped were also tested as controls. The expression of each chimera was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2, lower panel). By this approach, we found that a chimeric G protein (Gαi2SW-Cα13QL), that includes the switch region and the C-terminal end, was able to stimulate Rho-dependent luciferase reporter gene comparable to that of the GTPase-deficient Gα13QL (Fig. 2, lower panel). The Active Gαi2SW-Cα13QL Chimera Requires the Integrity of the Switch Region and an Adjacent C-terminal Extension—To narrow down the minimal structural requirements for Gα13QL to stimulate Rho, the active chimera (Gαi2SW-Cα13QL) was further modified by replacing additional sequences for those from Gαi2 corresponding to each of the switch subregions, or the C-terminal domain, as indicated in Fig. 3, upper panel. The expression of this set of chimeras was demonstrated by Western blot (Fig. 3, lower panel). When either switch 1 or switch 1 and 2 in Gαi2SW-Cα13QL were substituted by those from Gαi2, the resulting chimeras, Gαi2SW2, 3-Cα13QL and Gαi2QLSW3-Cα13, respectively, were unable to stimulate Rho-dependent pathways (Fig. 3, lower panel). On the other hand, the contribution from Gα13 at the C-terminal end of Gαi2SW-Cα13QL was narrowed down by substituting it for sequences from Gαi2 as indicated in Fig. 3, upper panel. Based on this approach, we observed that the last 36 amino acids in Gαi2SW-Cα13QL (Pro320-Gln356) could be replaced with those from Gαi2 with no reduction in the Rho-stimulating activity of the resulting chimera, Gαi2SW-320α13QL, whereas a further reduction, replacing the last 61 amino-acids (Pro295-Gln356), resulted in a chimeric G protein, Gαi2SW-295α13QL, that was unable to activate Rho. Gαi2SW-320α13QL was therefore referred to herein as the “minimal active chimera” (Fig. 3, lower panel). Point Mutations on the Putative RGL Contact Sites within Switch 1 and 2 of the Minimal Active Chimera Gαi2SW-320α13QL Reduce Its Activity—Based on the structure shown in Fig. 1A (26Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), amino acids from Gαi2 switch 1 and switch 2 region that were predicted to make contact with RGS4 were re-introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the equivalent positions in Gαi2SW-320α13QL (Fig. 4, upper panel) (SW1 and SW2 mutants). The expression of these mutants was demonstrated by Western blot (Fig. 4, lower panel). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, lower panel, Gαi2SW-320α13QL harboring mutations in the putative RGL contact sites in switch 1 or switch 2 exhibited a reduced ability to stimulate the SRE, which was nearly half of that of Gαi2SW-320α13QL, while the double mutant showed no activity. The ability of these chimeras to interact with PRG and to stimulate the increase in GTP-Rho was aligned"
https://openalex.org/W2062038033,"Point mutants with alterations to amino acid residues Thr247, Pro248, Glu340, Asp813, Arg819, and Arg822 of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase were analyzed by transient kinetic measurements. In the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structures, most of these residues participate in a hydrogen-bonding network between the phosphorylation domain (domain P), the third transmembrane helix (M3), and the cytoplasmic loop connecting the sixth and the seventh transmembrane helices (L6-7). In several of the mutants, a pronounced phosphorylation “overshoot” was observed upon reaction of the Ca2+-bound enzyme with ATP, because of accumulation of dephosphoenzyme at steady state. Mutations of Glu340 and its partners, Thr247 and Arg822, in the bonding network markedly slowed the Ca2+ binding transition (E2 → E1 → Ca2E1) as well as Ca2+ dissociation from Ca2+ site II back toward the cytosol but did not affect the apparent affinity for vanadate. These mutations may have caused a slowing, in both directions, of the conformational change associated directly with Ca2+ interaction at Ca2+ site II. Because mutation of Asp813 inhibited the Ca2+ binding transition, but not Ca2+ dissociation, and increased the apparent affinity for vanadate, the effect on the Ca2+ binding transition seems in this case to be exerted by slowing the E2 → E1 conformational change. Because the rate was not significantly enhanced by a 10-fold increase of the Ca2+ concentration, the slowing is not the consequence of reduced affinity of any pre-binding site for Ca2+. Furthermore, the mutations interfered in specific ways with the phosphoenzyme processing steps of the transport cycle; the transition from ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme to ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (Ca2E1P → E2P) was accelerated by mutations perturbing the interactions mediated by Glu340 and Asp813 and inhibited by mutation of Pro248, and mutations of Thr247 induced charge-specific changes of the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P.

Ca2+ transport by the Ca2+-ATPase is achieved by means of a reaction cycle (Scheme 1), in which the hydrolysis of ATP through sequential formation and decomposition of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate is coupled to protein conformational changes that bring about movement of Ca2+ across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (5Shigekawa M.

Five high resolution structures of four different states of the Ca2+-ATPase, obtained by x-ray crystallography, have been published so far, corresponding to the E2 dephosphoenzyme (stabilized with the inhibitor thapsigargin) and the Ca2E1 state with and without bound nucleotide (AMPPCP or ADP plus AlFx as phosphate analog) (cf.

As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the Ca2+-ATPase consists of 10 membrane-spanning helices (M1–M10) connected to a cytoplasmic headpiece composed of three distinct domains named A (“actuator”), P (“phosphorylation”), and N (“nucleotide binding”). In the Ca2E1 state, the two Ca2+ ions are bound side by side at sites in the transmembrane region. Binding of the two ions occurs sequentially, and it has been determined which of the two binding sites coordinates the first and the second Ca2+ ion (designated “site I” and “site II”, respectively) (11Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-coordinating oxygen atoms of site I are contributed by the side chains of Asn768 and Glu771 of M5, Thr799 and Asp800 of M6, and Glu908 of M8, and two water molecules. Asp800 also contributes an oxygen ligand to site II, which furthermore is composed of side-chain oxygen atoms donated by Asn796 of M6 and Glu309 of M4, as well as three main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the unwound part of M4 between Ile307 and Gly310 (2MacLennan D.H.

In the E2 crystal structure, the high affinity Ca2+ sites are disrupted, because of a shift of M4 toward the luminal side and a rotation of M6 (8Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Comparison of the E2 and Ca2E1 crystal structures suggests that Ca2+ binding is accompanied by global conformational changes, involving in addition to major rearrangements of the transmembrane helices also large movements of the cytoplasmic domains, in accordance with the finding that Ca2+ binding is a rather slow process (12Dupont Y. Leigh J.B. Nature. 1978; 273: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These conformational changes, collectively denoted “the Ca2+ binding transition” (E2 → E1 → Ca2E1 in Scheme 1), induce the ability of the enzyme to become phosphorylated with ATP at Asp351 in domain P. Subsequent to the phosphorylation reaction, a conformational change of the phosphoenzyme, presumably elicited by the dissociation of ADP (3Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev.

A fundamental unanswered question is how the functional interaction over the 50-Å distance between the catalytic site containing Asp351 in domain P and the Ca2+ sites in the membrane is brought about. One possible mediator of such interaction is an extensive network of hydrogen bonds that in the crystal structures appears to physically connect several key parts of the enzyme near the membrane surface, including domain P, the cytoplasmic parts of transmembrane helices M3 and M5, and the cytoplasmic loop between M6 and M7 (“L6-7”), see Fig. 1, B and C. A central residue in this network is Glu340 situated in the P1 helix of domain P. This glutamate is almost universally conserved among P-type ATPases (4Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and appears to link domain P to the cytoplasmic part of M3 and to L6-7 through three hydrogen bonds. Noting that crystal structures represent “frozen” conformations characterized by exceptional stability under certain nonphysiological conditions, it is important to ask the question whether the hydrogen bond interactions apparent from the crystal structures also occur in the native enzyme during the transport cycle, and whether they are functionally important. Motivated by the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structures, we have in the present study undertaken a detailed kinetic analysis of the transport cycle of point mutants with alterations to Glu340 and its partners in the hydrogen bonding network, Arg822 in L6-7 and Thr247 in M3. Furthermore, Pro248 next to the interaction sites in M3 has been included in the study, as well as Asp813 and Arg819 of L6-7. In the various crystal structures, Asp813 appears to hydrogen-bond to either Ser917 in the loop between M8 and M9 and Asn755 in M5 or Arg819 in L6-7 (Fig. 1, B and C), and it is interesting to compare this part of the bonding network functionally with that centered around Glu340. Moreover, the likely importance of Asp813 is suggested by previous findings of multiple functional changes in mutants with triple substitution of Asp813, Asp815, and Asp818 or double substitution of Asp813 and Asp818 (13Menguy T.

Fig. 1B. Open table in a new tab In the present study, we have found that several of the mutants examined, in particular E340A and D813L, display a marked phosphorylation overshoot, which is caused by accumulation of dephosphoenzyme at steady state as a result of slowing of the Ca2+ binding transition of the dephosphoenzyme and acceleration of the Ca2E1P → E2P conformational transition of the phosphoenzyme. Our analysis of the partial reaction steps involved in Ca2+ interaction and phosphoenzyme processing moreover reveals notable functional differences between the two parts of the bonding network involving Glu340 and Asp813, respectively. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Assays of Overall Function—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform) was carried out as described previously (20Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression, the wild-type or mutant cDNA, inserted in the pMT2 or p91023 vector (21Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) by transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation (24Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The concentration of expressed Ca2+-ATPase was quantified by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (25Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by determination of the maximum capacity for phosphorylation with Pi (“active site concentration,” see Ref. 26Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transport of 45Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles was measured by filtration, and the ATPase activity was determined by measuring the amount of Pi liberated as described previously (26Sørensen T.

Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and 32Pi—Manual mixing experiments at various buffer and temperature conditions (detailed in the figure legends) were carried out according to the principles described previously (20Vilsen B.

Transient kinetic experiments at 25 °C were performed using Bio-Logic quench-flow modules QFM-5 and SFM-400/Q, as described (28Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2585-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Even though the two modules gave essentially identical results, each set of experiments was performed exclusively on the same module to ensure maximum reproducibility. Acid quenching of phosphorylated enzyme was performed with 0.5–2 volumes of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mm H3PO4. The acid-precipitated protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 7% polyacrylamide gel at pH 6.0 (27Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by imaging, using a Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. Background phosphorylation levels were subtracted from all data points. The background was determined in parallel experiments, either with control microsomes isolated from mock-transfected COS-1 cells or by adding an excess of EGTA (in ATP-phosphorylation experiments) or an excess of Ca2+ (in Pi-phosphorylation experiments) before initiating the phosphorylation. In some of the dephosphorylation experiments, the constant phosphorylation level reached after the exponential decay was taken as background. Calculations and Data Analysis—Experiments were conducted at least twice, and the complete set of data was analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.) or by computation using the SimZyme program (28Sørensen T.L.

Analysis of the Hydrogen-bonding Network Apparent from the Crystal Structures—The six Ca2+-ATPase amino acid residues examined in this study are highlighted in Fig. 1A (red circles), and B and C show the region containing these residues in the crystal structures of Ca2E1 (without bound nucleotide) and E2, respectively, with indication of possible hydrogen bonds as deduced from the interatomic distances. Table I indicates the relevant interaction distances in all the five crystal structure models published to date (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 8Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 9Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Looking first at the model for the nucleotide-free Ca2E1 form (Fig. 1B, Protein Data Bank accession code 1SU4), Glu340 in the P1 helix of domain P appears to be linked to the top of M3 via two hydrogen bonds from different Glu340 side-chain oxygen atoms, one to the side-chain OH of Thr247 and the other to the main-chain NH of Leu249. The side-chain oxygen atom of Glu340 that interacts with Leu249 is furthermore linked to Arg822 in L6-7 via an intervening water molecule. Thus, Glu340 occupies a central position in the bonding network that connects domain P to the transmembrane sector and L6-7. Asp813 in L6-7 likewise seems to be important for the bonding network. One of the side-chain oxygen atoms of Asp813 forms a hydrogen bond to Asn755 in M5, whereas the other interacts with Ser917 in the loop connecting M8 and M9. In the model of the E2 state (Fig. 1C, Protein Data Bank accession code 1IWO), Asp813 has moved away from Asn755 and Ser917 and now forms a salt bridge to Arg819 in L6-7. The side chain of Arg822 has been repositioned relative to Glu340 and now interacts with Asn755. The Glu340 side chain again seems to form hydrogen bonds to both Thr247 and Leu249, but now from the same oxygen atom (Fig. 1C and Table I). Moreover, the side chain of Thr247 has been rotated relative to its conformation in Ca2E1. Hence, the positions and conformations of the Glu340 and Thr247 side chains have changed significantly between Ca2E1 and E2, with corresponding change of their interaction pattern, suggesting that the hydrogen-bonding network is a rather dynamic feature that changes with functional state. In two of the nucleotide-bound Ca2E1 crystal forms (1T5S and 1T5T), the proposed interaction pattern of Glu340 resembles that described above for nucleotide-free Ca2E1, with one of the Glu340 side-chain oxygen atoms interacting with the side-chain OH of Thr247 and the other interacting with the main-chain NH of Leu249 (see Table I, note that the designation of the oxygen atoms as O-δ1/ϵ1 or O-δ2/ϵ2 is arbitrary). However, in the model of the third nucleotide-bound Ca2E1 crystal form (1VFP), the interaction pattern of the Glu340 side chain seems to differ from both nucleotide-free Ca2E1 and E2 (Table I). Furthermore, in the 1T5S and 1T5T models Asp813 seems to form a salt link to Arg819 as in the E2 form, but simultaneously maintains an interaction with Ser917 similar to that in nucleotide-free Ca2E1. In the 1VFP model of nucleotide-bound Ca2E1, the position of Asp813 is midway between Arg819 and Asn755, suggesting that neither of these residues forms a very stable bond to Asp813. In all the crystal structures, the main-chain carbonyl of Arg819 appears to interact with the side chain of Arg751 in M5, which was shown previously by mutagenesis to be a critical residue (31Sørensen T.L. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression and Analysis of Overall Function and Phosphorylation at Steady State—To study the functional importance of the above-described bonding network, we introduced 10 point mutations to Thr247 and Pro248 in M3, Glu340 in domain P, and Asp813, Arg819, and Arg822 in L6-7. The mutants are listed in Table II. All the mutant Ca2+ pumps prepared for this study could be expressed in COS-1 cells to levels similar to that obtained with wild type. To assess the overall function of the mutants, we measured the maximum rate of Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis at 5 mm MgATP and 37 °C in the presence and absence of calcium ionophore A23187. All 10 mutants were able to hydrolyze ATP, although in most cases at reduced rates compared with wild type (Table II). In the presence of ionophore, T247K, P248A, P248R, E340A, and D813L displayed the most significant reductions of ATPase activity (to 13–34% of the wild-type activity), whereas R819L was wild type like in this respect. The remaining mutants, T247A, T247D, E340L, and R822L, showed intermediate reductions of ATPase activity in the presence of ionophore (54–79% of the wild-type rate).Table IIOverall ATPase reaction and Ca2+ binding properties of wild type and mutantsEnzymeATPase turnover rateaThe maximum rate of Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis was determined at 37 °C in a medium containing 50 mm TES/Tris (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.9 mm CaCl2 (giving a free Ca2+ concentration of 3 μm), and 5 mm ATP, with or without 1 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187.

https://openalex.org/W2114255183,"Recently, we identified a bovine IgA Fc receptor (bFc alpha R), which shows high homology to the human myeloid Fc alpha R, CD89. IgA binding has previously been shown to depend on several specific residues located in the B-C and F-G loops of the membrane-distal extracellular domain 1 of CD89. To compare the ligand binding properties of these two Fc alpha Rs, we have mapped the IgA binding site of bFc alpha R. We show that, in common with CD89, Tyr-35 in the B-C loop is essential for IgA binding. However, in contrast to earlier observations on CD89, mutation of residues in the F-G loop did not significantly inhibit IgA binding."
