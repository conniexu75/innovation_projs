https://openalex.org/W1985161570,"Theory of Growth Control Although quantitative studies of growth in bacterial cultures have been made for over 50 years, the relationship between cell proliferation and gene expression has not been clear. Scott et al. (p. 1099 ; see the Perspective by Lerman and Palsson ) have revealed that mass per cell exponentially increased with linear increases in growth rate and that ribosome abundance increased linearly with growth rate depending on the rate of translation. Hence, the systems properties of the biological processes involved in growth can be derived without any molecular understanding of their basis and can be used to establish fundamental properties for the design of biotechnological procedures."

The crystal structure of the human dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) in complex with the small molecule D2R/D3R-specific antagonist eticlopride reveals important features of the ligand binding pocket and extracellular loops. On the intracellular side of the receptor, a locked conformation of the ionic lock and two distinctly different conformations of intracellular loop 2 are observed. Docking of R-22, a D3R-selective antagonist, reveals an extracellular extension of the eticlopride binding site that comprises a second binding pocket for the aryl amide of R-22, which differs between the highly homologous D2R and D3R. This difference provides direction to the design of D3R-selective agents for treating drug abuse and other neuropsychiatric indications."
https://openalex.org/W2101580126,"Caloric restriction (CR) extends the life span and health span of a variety of species and slows the progression of age-related hearing loss (AHL), a common age-related disorder associated with oxidative stress. Here, we report that CR reduces oxidative DNA damage in multiple tissues and prevents AHL in wild-type mice but fails to modify these phenotypes in mice lacking the mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3, a member of the sirtuin family. In response to CR, Sirt3 directly deacetylates and activates mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (Idh2), leading to increased NADPH levels and an increased ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione in mitochondria. In cultured cells, overexpression of Sirt3 and/or Idh2 increases NADPH levels and protects from oxidative stress-induced cell death. Therefore, our findings identify Sirt3 as an essential player in enhancing the mitochondrial glutathione antioxidant defense system during CR and suggest that Sirt3-dependent mitochondrial adaptations may be a central mechanism of aging retardation in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2060834037,"Turncoat Aphids Aphid color has consequences for the fate of the wearer: Coccinellid beetles prefer to eat red ones and parasitoid wasps attack green ones. What might happen if aphids could change color and outwit their predators? Tsuchida et al. (p. 1102 ) have found that a subpopulation of the pea aphid can do this, but not without help from a previously unknown species of bacterium that lives intimately with the aphid as an endosymbiont and makes red aphids turn green. The bacterium interferes with host pigment biosynthesis—itself borrowed from fungi long ago in evolution—to stimulate blue-green pigment production as the aphid larva matures, turning the red nymph into a green adult. The ecological consequences of this about-turn of color have yet to be tested, but other studies have shown a variety of effects on aphid behavior mediated by endosymbionts in response to adaptation to different food plants, temperature tolerance, and predator avoidance."

Coll et al. (p. 1393 ) have now elucidated the actions of two metacaspases in the small plant Arabidopsis . One metacaspase, AtMC1, promoted cell death, and the other, AtMC2, acted antagonistically to stall cell death. The results help to elucidate the mechanisms by which plants control cell survival during development and defend against pathogen attack."
https://openalex.org/W2015389932,"Quantum Connection A system that is quantum mechanically entangled with another distant system can be predicted by measuring the distant system. This form of “action-at-a-distance,” or nonlocality, seemingly contradicts Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which is one of the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. Oppenheim and Wehner (p. 1072 ) show that the degree of nonlocality in quantum mechanics is actually determined by the uncertainty principle. The unexpected connection between nonlocality and uncertainty holds true for other physical theories besides quantum mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W2041885763,"Macrophages play a central role in the balance and efficiency of the immune response and are at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. Their phenotype is a delicate equilibrium between the M1 (classical, pro-Th1) and M2 (alternative, pro-Th2) profiles. This balance is regulated by cytokines such as interleukin 13 (IL-13), a typical pro-M2-Th2 cytokine that has been related to allergic disease and asthma. IL-13 binds to IL-13 receptor α1 (IL13Rα1), a component of the Type II IL-4 receptor, and exerts its effects by activating the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) through phosphorylation. MicroRNAs are short (∼22 nucleotide) inhibitory non-coding RNAs that block the translation or promote the degradation of their specific mRNA targets. By bioinformatics analysis, we found that microRNA-155 (miR-155) is predicted to target IL13Rα1. This suggested that miR-155 might be involved in the regulation of the M1/M2 balance in macrophages by modulating IL-13 effects. miR-155 has been implicated in the development of a healthy immune system and function as well as in the inflammatory pro-Th1/M1 immune profile. Here we have shown that in human macrophages, miR-155 directly targets IL13Rα1 and reduces the levels of IL13Rα1 protein, leading to diminished activation of STAT6. Finally we also demonstrate that miR-155 affects the IL-13-dependent regulation of several genes (SOCS1, DC-SIGN, CCL18, CD23, and SERPINE) involved in the establishment of an M2/pro-Th2 phenotype in macrophages.

Our work shows a central role for miR-155 in determining the M2 phenotype in human macrophages. Macrophages are key players at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. They arise from circulating monocytes that are recruited to tissues by different stimuli. They work as phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells, promoting inflammation and its resolution. Macrophages present a wide range of phenotypic profiles and defense mechanisms depending on the tissue context and the stimuli present (pathogens, cytokines, apoptotic cells, and so forth). They are generally classified into two main types: M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) macrophages. Classically activated (M1) macrophages are a result of an exposure to pro-Th1 cytokines, whereas alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are generated in a pro-Th2 environment (1Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Vecchi A. Locati M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4533) Google Scholar). Classically activated macrophages are specialized in defense against intracellular pathogens, and upon stimulation with pro-inflammatory stimuli (interferon-γ or LPS), they promote inflammation, causing tissue damage. By contrast, alternative activation of macrophages is induced by a broader range of stimuli including interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 13 (IL-13), interleukin 10 (IL-10), or glucocorticoids, and alternative macrophages are specialized in defense against extracellular pathogens, promoting tissue repair and the resolution of the inflammatory process (2Martinez F.O. Helming L. Gordon S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 451-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Regardless of this classification, one of the most remarkable characteristics of macrophages is their plasticity and heterogeneity, depending on the specific task carried out. This is reflected by their ability to reverse their phenotype and reprogram their M1/pro-Th1 and M2/pro-Th2 gene expression profiles, presenting in between phenotypic profiles and a constituting a heterogeneous population (1Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Vecchi A. Locati M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4533) Google Scholar). The present study has focused on alternatively activated macrophages generated by IL-4 and IL-13 (2Martinez F.O. Helming L. Gordon S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 451-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). IL-13 is a typical Th2 type cytokine that, together with IL-4, drives and modulates the immune response. First described as a Th1 down-regulator (3Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. et al.Nature. 1993; 362: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), its role as an active immune mediator has been described and distinguished from those of IL-4 by several studies (4Hogan S.P.

Interestingly, and underscoring the role of IL-13 in asthma, mice lacking the IL-13 receptor α1 chain (IL13Rα1) 2The abbreviations used are: IL13Rα1interleukin 13 receptor α1DC-SIGNdendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrinmiRmicroRNAqPCRquantitative PCR. showed a complete absence of allergen-induced airway hyper-reactivity and mucus hypersecretion (6Ramalingam T.R.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). IL13Rα1 is an essential component of the Type II IL-4 receptor, which consists of heterodimers of IL4Rα and IL13Rα1 chains. Both IL-4 and IL-13 bind to the Type II receptor, but only IL-4 can bind to the Type I receptor. Therefore, the binding of IL-13 depends solely on the presence of IL13Rα1 (11Hershey G.K.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Jiang H. Harris M.B. Rothman P. J. Allergy Clin.

Engagement of these receptors leads to phosphorylation and activation of Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) proteins, believed to be bound to these cytokine receptors in unstimulated cells. The active phospho-JAK proteins phosphorylate the IL4Rα chain, providing docking sites for STAT6. Once bound to the receptor, STAT6 is also phosphorylated by JAKs, which causes its activation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus, where it exerts its transcriptional roles (13Hebenstreit D.

Since their relatively recent discovery (14Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V. Cell. 1993; 75: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9729) Google Scholar), miRNAs have been shown to play important biological roles in different contexts: during development, cell differentiation, and immune regulation and also in pathologies such as cancer (15Jiang S.

They are small non-coding RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression upon binding to the 3′-UTRs (untranslated regions) of their target mRNAs (18Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29625) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs are firstly transcribed as immature primary miRNAs that are processed in the nucleus into ∼70-nucleotide hairpin pre-miRNAs by Drosha proteins. Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm, where Dicer proteins process them into mature miRNA*-miRNA complexes. The leading strand, miRNA (as opposed to miRNA*, the discarded strand) is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex, where it guides Argonaute proteins toward their target mRNAs (19Eulalio A. Huntzinger E. Izaurralde E. Cell. 2008; 132: 9-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The selectivity of miRNA action is given by the nucleotides 2–7 at their 5′ end (the “seed region”) that pairs to its complementary site in the targeted 3′-UTR by Watson-Crick interactions directing the RNA-induced silencing complex action (18Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29625) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of microRNAs ensues by blocking the target mRNA translation into protein and/or the degradation of the mRNA (20Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs have proven to be key in modulating the immune system (21O'Connell R.M. Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Cheng G. Baltimore D.

Two different knock-out models have been generated showing that mice lacking miR-155 present an abnormal immune function with aberrant B and T cell repertoires and defective antigen-presenting cells (16Rodriguez A.

Several reports present miR-155 as a key player in B cell responses (17Vigorito E. Perks K.L. Abreu-Goodger C. Bunting S. Xiang Z. Kohlhaas S. Das P.P. Miska E.A. Rodriguez A. Bradley A. Smith K.G.

Moreover, miR-155 expression levels increase during inflammation in classically (pro-Th1) activated macrophages (21O'Connell R.M. Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1604-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 27Worm J. Stenvang J. Petri A. Frederiksen K.S. Obad S. Elmén J. Hedtjärn M. Straarup E.M. Hansen J.B. Kauppinen S.

Vigorito E. Clare S. Warren M.V. Couttet P. Soond D.R. van Dongen S. Grocock R.J. Das P.P. Miska E.A. Vetrie D. Okkenhaug K. Enright A.J. Dougan G. Turner M. Bradley A. Science. 2007; 316: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is well established that miR-155 plays a central role not only in the development of a healthy immune system but also as a pro-Th1 microRNA. Using in silico analysis (miRanda (28Betel D. Wilson M. Gabow A. Marks D.S. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D149-D153Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar), RNAHybrid (29Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hochsmann M. Giegerich R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar), and the PITA algorithm (30Kertesz M. Iovino N. Unnerstall U. Gaul U. Segal E. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), we identified IL13Rα1 as a putative target of miR-155. We have shown for the first time that indeed miR-155 down-regulates the effects of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, providing a straightforward link between miR-155 and the Th1/Th2 balance. Our work shows that miR-155 directly targets IL13Rα1 3′-UTR, reducing the levels of IL13Rα1 protein. By doing so, miR-155 affects the IL-4- and IL-13-dependent phosphorylation of STAT6. We finally show that miR-155 levels modulate the response of human macrophages to IL-13, leading to a change in their genetic profile. Therefore, miR-155 contributes to the Th1/Th2 equilibrium, favoring a pro-Th1/classical activation of macrophages by reducing the expression of several pro-Th2/IL-13-dependent genes. This cell line was generated as described before (26Martinez-Nunez R.T. Louafi F. Friedmann P.S. Sanchez-Elsner T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16334-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells were doubly transduced with a doxycycline-inducible (Tet-on) lentiviral system described elsewhere (31Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), in which miR-155 transgene is under the control of a tetracycline response element. Lentiviral vectors were kindly provided by Prof. Didier Trono, and cells were maintained in RPMI 10% FBS (Invitrogen). To induce miR-155 expression, 2.5 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) was added or not to the medium and renewed daily over 96 h of culture. Cytokine treatments were performed as follows. Firstly, cells were incubated or not with doxycycline for 96 h, and then they were starved for an extra 12-h period and then stimulated or not with IL-4 (Immunotools) or IL-13 (R&D Systems). Cell extracts were collected when indicated, after the treatment. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM 10% FBS. Monocytes were obtained from buffy coats from healthy donors over a density gradient (Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS, GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque, and monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction using CD14 magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi). Cells were maintained in RPMI 10% FBS supplemented with 500 units/ml GM-CSF (Immunotools) to allow differentiation. For pcDNA BIC, the genomic region encompassing miR-155 was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 expression vector as described previously (26Martinez-Nunez R.T. Louafi F. Friedmann P.S. Sanchez-Elsner T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16334-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). IL13Rα1 3′-UTR was amplified using plasmid DNA (HmiT009700-MT01, gene Copoeia) as template and the following primers: IL13RA1_3′-UTR forward, 5′-GGC TGT TAG GGG CAG TGG AG-3′ and IL13RA1_3′-UTR reverse, 5′-CAG AGC CTT GGC TGG CTG G-3′. The product was cloned in pCR2.1 TOPO TA (Invitrogen), from where it was removed using BamHI/NotI. After blunt-ending with Klenow DNA polymerase, the product was cloned into the NotI site in pRLTK (Promega); this construct was named henceforth pRLTK__WT_3′-UTR_IL13RA1. Mutagenesis was performed on pRLTK__WT_3′-UTR_IL13RA1 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. For pRLTK_MUT1_3′-UTR_IL13RA1, we used the primers IL13RA1 3′-UTR MUT1 forward, 5′-CTG CTA CTC AAG TCG GTA CCA CTG TGT CTT TGG TTT GTG CTA GGC CCC-3′ and IL13RA1 3′-UTR MUT1 reverse, 5′-GGG GCC TAG CAC AAA CCA AAG ACA CAG TGG TAC CGA CTT GAG TAG CAG-3′. In the case of pRLTK__MUT2_3′-UTR_IL13RA1, the primers used were IL13RA1 3′-UTR MUT2 forward, 5′-CCA TGT GAG GGT TTT CAG GGC CGA TAT TTG TGC ATT TTC TAA ACA G-3′ and IL13RA1 3′-UTR MUT2 reverse, 5′-CTG TTT AGA AAA TGC ACA AAT ATC GGC CCT GAA AAC CCT CAC ATG G-3′. Normalization was performed using pGL3 (Promega). Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Ambion). Reverse transcription was performed using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). MicroRNA detection was performed using TaqMan microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems). For real-time PCR (qPCR), we employed TaqMan® universal PCR master mix, No AmpErase® UNG in a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system machine (both from Applied Biosystems). IL13RA1 qPCR detection was performed using PerfectProbe from PrimerDesign (Southampton, UK) and normalized against GAPDH from the same manufacturer. Genes assayed in the IL-13/STAT6 pathway were TaqMan® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). Total protein lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Antibodies used were: anti-IL13Rα1 (antibody sc-27861, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-STAT6 (antibody 9362, Cell Signaling Technology); anti-phospho-STAT6 (antibody 9361, Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-β-actin antibody loading control (ab8227, Abcam). To determine direct targeting of IL13Rα1 by miR-155, constructs pRLTK_WT_3′-UTR_IL13RA1, pRLTK_MUT1_3′-UTR_IL13RA1, or pRLTK_MUT2_3′-UTR_IL13RA1 were transfected into HeLa cells employing TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) following the manufacturer's instructions. pcDNA BIC or control pcDNA 3.1 empty vector were co-transfected to check miR-155 activity on the 3′-UTR of IL13Rα1. pGL3 (Promega) was used as normalizing vector. Luminometry was performed using a Dual-Glo kit (Promega). Experiments were performed three times in triplicates. Statistical differences were determined using Student's t test and GraphPad Prism software. To reduce the levels of miR-155 in primary macrophages, 100 nm anti-miR-155 inhibitor or Anti-miR inhibitors–negative control #1 (Applied Biosystems) were transfected in human monocytes at day 0 as described previously (26Martinez-Nunez R.T. Louafi F. Friedmann P.S. Sanchez-Elsner T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16334-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto 96-well flat bottom plates at a cell density of 5 × 105 cells/ml with GM-CSF, and oligonucleotides were added at a final concentration of 100 nm and then kept in culture. On day 3, IL-13 was added or not with a renewal dose of GM-CSF, and 24 h later, RNA was collected and subjected to analysis. By performing bioinformatic analysis (miRanda, RNAHybrid, and PITA algorithm), we found that IL13Rα1 has two putative binding sites for miR-155 in the 3′-UTR, and hence, it was predicted to be a direct target for miR-155 (Fig. 1). Both miR-155-IL13RA1-3′-UTR pairs are shown in supplemental Fig. S1, and their free energy is within the range of validated miRNA target pairs (32Watanabe Y. Yachie N. Numata K. Saito R. Kanai A. Tomita M. Gene. 2006; 365: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Site 1 is located between nucleotides 1049 and 1071 of the 3′-UTR (seeding region is a 7-mer), and site 2 is located between nucleotides 1399 and 1424 (seeding region is an 8-mer that includes a G:U wobble pair). The direct targeting by miR-155 of IL13Rα1, a component of the Type II IL-4 receptor, could provide a crucial link between miR-155 and its role as pro-Th1 microRNA; by reducing signaling via the Type II IL-4 receptor, miR-155 would reduce the ability of a cell to respond to the classical pro-Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. To test IL13Rα1 as a direct target for miR-155, we employed a Dual Luciferase assay in HeLa cells. For this purpose, the 3′-UTR sequence of IL13Rα1 harboring the predicted binding sites for miR-155 was cloned into the Renilla luciferase reporter vector pRLTK (named pRLTK_WT_3′-UTR_IL13RA1). To test the contribution of the predicted binding sites for miR-155 action, each site was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations (shown in Fig. 1) were designed according to the predicted abrogation of miR-155 binding using bioinformatics (RNAHybrid). The constructs were named pRLTK_MUT1_3′-UTR_IL13RA1 (mutant in site 1) and pRLTK_MUT2_3′-UTR_IL13RA1 (mutant in site 2). Co-transfection of each Renilla luciferase construct with an expression vector for miR-155 (pcDNA BIC) allowed determination of the effects of this microRNA on the 3′-UTR of IL13Rα1 as well as mapping its binding. When miR-155 was co-transfected with the reporter construct that harbored the wild type 3′-UTR of IL13Rα1 (Fig. 1, WT), the expression of the Renilla luciferase construct was reduced to less than 50% of its activity. When the putative sites for miR-155 binding were mutated individually, both mutants failed to be regulated by miR-155 (Fig. 1, MUT1 and MUT2). Thus, it was concluded that miR-155 directly targets IL13Rα1 and that it binds to the 3′-UTR of IL13Rα1 in positions 1049–1071 and 1399–1424 and that both sites are necessary for miRNA action. Having established that miR-155 directly targets the IL13Rα1 3′-UTR, we aimed to determine the effects of miR-155 on the expression of this receptor chain in human monocytes. It is known that miR-155 is up-regulated by several pro-Th1 factors during the inflammatory response and that it plays a role in the Th1 response in different cell types such as dendritic cells (25Ceppi M.

Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1604-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 27Worm J. Stenvang J. Petri A. Frederiksen K.S. Obad S. Elmén J. Hedtjärn M. Straarup E.M. Hansen J.B. Kauppinen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 5784-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We wondered whether miR-155 could modulate the M2/alternative activation of macrophages by decreasing IL13Rα1 expression. This would also suggest a role for miR-155 in the differentiation of a classically activated pro-Th1 macrophage. For this purpose, we chose a previously established and validated monocytic cell line, THP1-155 (26Martinez-Nunez R.T. Louafi F. Friedmann P.S. Sanchez-Elsner T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16334-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The THP1-155 cell line is a doubly transduced cell line in which an miR-155 transgene is under the control of a Tet-On response element, a regulatory system described elsewhere (31Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Thus, miR-155 expression can be induced upon the addition of tetracycline or a derivative, doxycycline. This system allows miR-155 up-regulation to be isolated from other events that are also triggered by inflammatory stimuli (e.g. LPS) that lead to miR-155 overexpression (21O'Connell R.M. Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1604-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). In this cellular system, we could determine whether increased levels of miR-155 have an effect on the expression of IL13Rα1 both at the protein and at the mRNA levels. Cells were treated with doxycycline for 96 h, allowing miR-155 overexpression to occur. Cells were collected at 24-h intervals during the course of the treatment, for RNA and protein analysis. miR-155 expression was checked by qPCR and showed a 3.5-fold increase (supplemental Fig. S4). miR-155 effects on IL13Rα1 expression were examined at the protein level by Western blotting protein extracts (Fig. 2A). The protein levels of IL13Rα1 (lower band) were down-regulated in parallel with the up-regulation observed for miR-155. Densitometric analysis determined that IL13Rα1 protein levels were reduced to 4% when cell extracts were compared at time 96 and 0 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). We also determined mRNA levels for IL13Rα1 by RT-qPCR and found that the levels did not vary significantly during the course of the treatment (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these findings show that miR-155 regulates the expression of IL13Rα1 in human monocytes. Up-regulation of miR-155 led to a down-regulation of IL13Rα1 at the protein level, whereas its mRNA levels remained stable. These findings suggest that miR-155 is acting by blocking the translation of IL13Rα1 mRNA rather than promoting its degradation in THP1-155 cells. These results, together with the molecular link previously shown between the 3′-UTR of IL13Rα1 and miR-155, prove that IL13Rα1 is a direct target for miR-155 in human monocytes. Having shown that miR-155 directly targets IL13Rα1 in monocytes (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2), we expected that the miR-155-dependent reduction of IL13Rα1 would impair the ability of macrophages to respond to IL-13 and IL-4. Both cytokines bind to the Type II IL-4 receptor, composed of heterodimers of IL13Rα1 and IL4Rα, but only IL-4 can bind to Type I receptors (12Jiang H. Harris M.B. Rothman P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 105: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the Type II receptor, IL-4 and IL-13 initiate a signaling cascade that causes phosphorylation and activation of STAT6, which is then able to perform its transcriptional roles (13Hebenstreit D. Wirnsberger G. Horejs-Hoeck J. Duschl A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). An impaired response to IL-13 and IL-4, cytokines that promote M2/alternative activation in macrophages, would bias the macrophages toward a more M1/classical activation. Hence, we predicted that by down-regulating the levels of IL13Rα1, miR-155 would modulate the downstream signaling cascade and reduce STAT6 phosphorylation. To test the effects of miR-155 levels on STAT6 phosphorylation, we used THP1-155 cells, in which miR-155 overexpression can be induced upon the addition of doxycycline. Moreover, STAT6 phosphorylation can be seen as an indicator of the status of the Th2 pathway (13Hebenstreit D. Wirnsberger G. Horejs-Hoeck J. Duschl A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). THP-1–155 cells were treated (+Doxy)"

In order to investigate the major evolutionary transition represented by these organisms, Denoeud et al. (p. 1381 , published online 18 November) sequenced the genome of Oikopleura dioica , a chordate placed by phylogeny between vertebrates and amphioxus. Surprisingly, the genome showed little conservation in genome architecture when compared to the genomes of other animals. Furthermore, this highly compacted genome contained intron gains and losses, as well as species-specific gene duplications and losses that may be associated with development. Thus, contrary to popular belief, global similarities of genome architecture from sponges to humans are not essential for the preservation of ancestral morphologies."

Barnett et al. (p. 1689 , published online 18 November) designed a drug that inhibits the action of ghrelin, a circulating peptide hormone that increases fat mass and food intake. The drug, a bisubstrate analog called GO-CoA-Tat, is a selective antagonist of ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), an enzyme that catalyzes a posttranslational modification that is essential for ghrelin activity. Injection of GO-CoA-Tat into wild-type mice on a high-fat diet improved glucose tolerance and reduced weight gain, probably through changes in metabolic activity. Because GO-CoA-Tat is a peptide-based drug that requires repeated injection, it is unsuitable for clinical use, but GOAT does represent a potentially valuable target for future drug development efforts in metabolic disease."

Inherent sensitivity to hemoglobin permits PAT to image blood vessels but precludes discriminating neovascular from maturing microvasculature. αvβ3-Gold nanobeacons (αvβ3-GNBs) for neovascular molecular PAT were developed, characterized, and demonstrated in vivo using a mouse Matrigel-plug model of angiogenesis. PAT results were microscopically corroborated with fluorescent αvβ3-GNB localization and supporting immunohistology in RαgïtmlMom Tg(Tie-2-lacZ)182-Sato mice. αvβ3-GNBs (154 nm) had 10-fold greater contrast than blood on an equivolume basis when imaged at 740 nm to 810 nm in blood. The lowest detectable concentration in buffer was 290 nM at 780 nm. Noninvasive PAT of angiogenesis using a 10-MHz ultrasound receiver with αvβ3-GNBs produced a 600% increase in signal in a Matrigel-plug mouse model relative to the inherent hemoglobin contrast pretreatment. In addition to increasing the contrast of neovessels detected at baseline, αvβ3-GNBs allowed visualization of numerous angiogenic sprouts and bridges that were undetectable before contrast injection. Competitive inhibition of αvβ3-GNBs with αvβ3-NBs (no gold particles) almost completely blocked contrast enhancement to pretreatment levels, similar to the signal from animals receiving saline only. Consistent with other studies, nontargeted GNBs passively accumulated in the tortuous neovascular but provided less than half of the contrast enhancement of the targeted agent. Microscopic studies revealed that the vascular constrained, rhodamine-labeled αvβ3-GNBs homed specifically to immature neovasculature (PECAM+, Tie-2) along the immediate tumor periphery, but not to nearby mature microvasculature (PECAM+, Tie-2+). The combination of PAT and αvβ3-GNBs offered sensitive and specific discrimination and quantification of angiogenesis in vivo, which may be clinically applicable to a variety of highly prevalent diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease.—Pan, D., Pramanik, M., Senpan, A., Allen, J.

Here, we present deep-sea [CO(3)(2-)] for five cores from the three major oceans quantified using benthic foraminiferal boron/calcium ratios since the last glacial period. Combined benthic δ(13)C and [CO(3)(2-)] results indicate that deep-sea-released CO(2) during the early deglacial period (17.5 to 14.5 thousand years ago) was preferentially stored in the atmosphere, whereas during the late deglacial period (14 to 10 thousand years ago), besides contributing to the contemporary atmospheric CO(2) rise, a substantial portion of CO(2) released from oceans was absorbed by the terrestrial biosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2133917458,"Current models of sensorimotor transformations emphasize the dominant role of gaze-centered representations for reach planning in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Here we exploit fMRI repetition suppression to test whether the sensory modality of a target determines the reference frame used to define the motor goal in the PPC and premotor cortex. We show that when targets are defined visually, the anterior precuneus selectively encodes the motor goal in gaze-centered coordinates, whereas the parieto-occipital junction, Brodman Area 5 (BA 5), and PMd use a mixed gaze- and body-centered representation. In contrast, when targets are defined by unseen proprioceptive cues, activity in these areas switches to represent the motor goal predominantly in body-centered coordinates. These results support computational models arguing for flexibility in reference frames for action according to sensory context. Critically, they provide neuroanatomical evidence that flexibility is achieved by exploiting a multiplicity of reference frames that can be expressed within individual areas."

https://openalex.org/W1970913648,"The effect of in utero exposure to a maternal high-fat diet on the peripheral circadian system of the fetus is unknown. Using mRNA copy number analysis, we report that the components of the peripheral circadian machinery are transcribed in the nonhuman primate fetal liver in an intact phase-antiphase fashion and that Npas2, a paralog of the Clock transcription factor, serves as the rate-limiting transcript by virtue of its relative low abundance (10- to 1000-fold lower). We show that exposure to a maternal high-fat diet in utero significantly alters the expression of fetal hepatic Npas2 (up to 7.1-fold, P<0.001) compared with that in control diet-exposed animals and is reversible in fetal offspring from obese dams reversed to a control diet (1.3-fold, P>0.05). Although the Npas2 promoter remains largely unmethylated, differential Npas2 promoter occupancy of acetylation of fetal histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac) occurs in response to maternal high-fat diet exposure compared with control diet-exposed animals. Furthermore, we find that disruption of Npas2 is consistent with high-fat diet exposure in juvenile animals, regardless of in utero diet exposure. In summary, the data suggest that peripheral Npas2 expression is uniquely vulnerable to diet exposure."

Cell surface TLRs largely recognize bacterial membrane components, and intracellular TLRs are exclusively involved in sensing nucleic acids. Here we show that TLR11, an innate sensor for the Toxoplasma protein profilin, is an intracellular receptor that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. The 12 membrane-spanning endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein UNC93B1 interacts directly with TLR11 and regulates the activation of dendritic cells in response to Toxoplasma gondii profilin and parasitic infection in vivo. A deficiency in functional UNC93B1 protein abolished TLR11-dependent IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells, attenuated Th1 responses against T. gondii, and dramatically enhanced susceptibility to the parasite. Our results reveal that the association with UNC93B1 and the intracellular localization of TLRs are not unique features of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs but is also essential for TLR11-dependent recognition of T. gondii profilin and for host protection against this parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1989719141,"αB-crystallin (αB) is known as an intracellular Golgi membrane-associated small heat shock protein. Elevated levels of this protein have been linked with a myriad of neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, and age-related macular degeneration. The membrane association of αB has been known for more than 3 decades, yet its physiological import has remained unexplained. In this investigation we show that αB is secreted from human adult retinal pigment epithelial cells via microvesicles (exosomes), independent of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein export pathway. The presence of αB in these lipoprotein structures was confirmed by its susceptibility to digestion by proteinase K only when exosomes were exposed to Triton X-100. Transmission electron microscopy was used to localize αB in immunogold-labeled intact and permeabilized microvesicles. The saucer-shaped exosomes, with a median diameter of 100-200 nm, were characterized by the presence of flotillin-1, α-enolase, and Hsp70, the same proteins that associate with detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRMs), which are known to be involved in their biogenesis. Notably, using polarized adult retinal pigment epithelial cells, we show that the secretion of αB is predominantly apical. Using OptiPrep gradients we demonstrate that αB resides in the DRM fraction. The secretion of αB is inhibited by the cholesterol-depleting drug, methyl β-cyclodextrin, suggesting that the physiological function of this protein and the regulation of its export through exosomes may reside in its association with DRMs/lipid rafts."

However, the profibrogenic role of HIV on hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) has not been fully clarified. We hypothesized that HIV, HCV induce liver fibrosis through altered regulation of the production of extracellular matrix and matrix metalloproteinases. We examined the fibrogenesis- and fibrolysis-related gene activity in LX2 HSC and Huh7.5.1 cells in the presence of inactivated CXCR4 and CCR5 HIV, as well as HCV JFH1 virus. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon fibrosis gene expression was assessed using the ROS inhibitor. Fibrosis-related transcripts including procollagen α1(I) (CoL1A), TIMP1, and MMP3 mRNA were measured by qPCR. TIMP1 and MMP3 protein expression were assessed by ELISA. We found that inactivated CXCR4 HIV and CCR5 HIV increased CoL1A, and TIMP1 expression in both HSC and Huh7.5.1 cells; the addition of JFH1 HCV further increased CoL1A and TIMP1 expression. CXCR4 HIV and CCR5 HIV induced ROS production in HSC and Huh7.5.1 cells which was further enhanced by JFH1 HCV. The ROS inhibitor DPI abrogated HIV-and HCV-induced CoL1A and TIMP1 expression. HIV and HCV-induced CoL1A and TIMP1 expression were also blocked by NFκB siRNA. Our data provide further evidence that HIV and HCV independently regulate hepatic fibrosis progression through the generation of ROS; this regulation occurs in an NFκB-dependent fashion.

(D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals, on the other hand, do not bind to any single AP subunit but to combinations of γ-σ1, α-σ2, and δ-σ3 subunits, as demonstrated by the use of yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) and in vitro binding assays (15Janvier K.

X-ray crystallographic analyses have shed light on the structural basis for the interactions of YXXØ and (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals with the AP-2 complex (18Owen D.J. Evans P.R.

Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Both binding sites are located on the AP-2 “core,” a domain formed by the amino-terminal regions of α and β2, and the entire μ2 and σ2 subunits (Fig. 1). The YXXØ-binding site comprises two hydrophobic pockets on μ2 that accommodate the Y and Ø residues of the signals (18Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The binding site for (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals likely corresponds to that of a dileucine-containing “Q-peptide” from CD4, (RMpSQIKRLLSE), which was recently identified by Kelly et al. (20Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The Q-peptide does not strictly conform to the definition of a (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signal, although the Gln residue at position −4 or the phosphorylated Ser residue at position −5 in the CD4 peptide could behave similar to the Asp or Glu residue at position −4 in the canonical signals (the first critical leucine is considered position 0). This site consists of hydrophobic pockets on σ2 that fit the Leu and (L/I) residues, and a basic patch straddling the boundary of α and σ2 that might bind the Gln, phosphorylated Ser, or (D/E) residues of the signals (20Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The AP-2 core occurs in two conformations: an inactive conformation in which both signal-binding sites are occluded by interaction with different parts of β2 and an active conformation in which both binding sites are exposed on a surface that is coplanar with a PtdIns-4,5-P2-binding site on α (21Jackson L.P.

This conformational change is triggered by phosphorylation of a threonine residue in μ2 (22Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Honing S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and results in increased affinity of AP-2 for PtdIns-4,5-P2-enriched domains of the plasma membrane, thus allowing simultaneous recognition of both types of signal (23Höning S.

The exact location of the signal-binding sites on AP-1 and AP-3, and the mechanistic details of the interactions have not been determined. Herein, we report the use of site-directed mutagenesis and Y3H assays to map the binding sites for (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals on AP-1 and AP-3. We find that these AP complexes have a (D/E)XXXL(L/I)-binding site similar to that of AP-2. Analysis of the fine specificity of interactions of various (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals with AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 subunits, however, reveals both signal- and AP-complex-dependent differences. We also investigated the assembly of different AP-1 subunit isoforms in cells and the ability of these isoforms to recognize (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals. We demonstrate that heterotetramers containing all possible combinations of γ and σ1 isoforms, with the exception of γ2-β1-μ1-σ1C, are assembled in vivo. Finally, we show that the AP-1 γ1-σ1A, γ1-σ1B, and γ1-σ1C hemicomplexes recognize all (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals tested, whereas γ2-σ1A and γ2-σ1B have a more restricted specificity. These findings indicate that AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 share a conserved binding site for (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals, albeit with distinct specificity determined by the exact nature of the signal, as well as the particular AP complex and subunit isoforms involved in the interactions. Based on these observations, we argue that a proper definition of AP complexes must include the specific composition of subunit isoforms. Complementary DNAs encoding HA- or Myc-tagged human σ1A, σ1B, and σ1C (C-terminal tags in all cases) were subcloned in the pXS modification of the pCDL-SRα296 vector (24Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.

Two commercial nylon membranes (Human 12-lane MTNTM Blot and Human MTNTM Blot III, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) with immobilized human poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) from different tissues were used for Northern blot analysis. Membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled human σ1C probe (splice variant 1) prepared using the MegaprimeTM DNA labeling system (GE Healthcare) and [α-32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare). Y3H vector construction and assays were performed as described previously (see Fig. 2A) (15Janvier K. Kato Y. Boehm M. Rose J.R. Martina J.A. Kim B.Y. Venkatesan S. Bonifacino J.S. J.

Double transformants were selected in medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and methionine but containing histidine (+His) and subsequently plated in +His medium, as well as in the same medium lacking histidine (−His). Interactions between dileucine signals and AP subunits result in activation of the GAL4 promoter and activation of HIS3 gene transcription as evidenced by growth on −His plates. Experiments were also performed on −His plates containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), a competitive inhibitor of the His3 protein to minimize background growth due to nonspecific interactions and also to detect differences in the avidity of interactions. Parallel plating on +His plates provided a control for loading and viability of double transformants. M1 human fibroblasts (a gift from Eric Long, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) were stably transfected with pXS-human σ1A-HA, pXS-human σ1B-HA, pXS-human σ1C-HA, or pcDNA3-HA-human γ2 (a gift from K. Nakayama, Kyoto University). Selection of cells stably transfected with pXS was achieved by co-transfection with pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). M1 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3-HA-human γ2 were subsequently subjected to transient transfection with pCR3.1-human σ1A-myc, human σ1B-myc or human σ1C-myc using the FuGENETM reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells (two 150-mm plates per condition) were subjected to metabolic labeling for 12–15 h using EasyTag ExpressTM 35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Science, Waltham, MA). Preparation of Triton X-100 extracts and immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments were performed as described previously (28Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W.

The immunoprecipitates bound to protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads were denatured in 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 10 mm DTT, diluted ∼20-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer and subjected to an additional round of immunoprecipitation (recapture step). The recapture beads were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorautoradiography (Typhoon 9200 PhophorImager, GE Healthcare).

Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In line with our previous studies (15Janvier K. Kato Y. Boehm M. Rose J.R. Martina J.A. Kim B.Y. Venkatesan S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Lindwasser O.W. Smith W.J. Chaudhuri R. Yang P. Hurley J.H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that all of these signals interact with the AP-1 γ1-σ1A, AP-2 αC-σ2, and AP-3 δ-σ3A hemicomplexes but not with the homologous AP-4 ϵ-σ4 hemicomplex (Fig. 2C). These interactions require that both subunits belong to the same AP complex, as mismatched pairs did not show interaction (Fig. 2C). We next examined the structural determinants for interaction of AP-2 with the (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals described above. The crystal structure of the AP-2 core in complex with the dileucine-containing Q-peptide from CD4 showed that most of the residues involved in the interaction were on the σ2 subunit (Fig. 3A) (20Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine whether these σ2 residues were required for interaction with canonical (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals, we mutated them and tested for interaction of the mutant proteins with the Nef and tyrosinase signals using the Y3H assay (Fig. 3B). The results showed that several σ2 mutations, including A63D, V88D, E100A, and L103S, largely abolished the interaction of αC-σ2 with both signals (Fig. 3B). Other σ2 mutations affected the interactions with Nef and tyrosinase differently. For instance, the N92A and L101A mutations had no effect on the interaction with the Nef signal but decreased the interaction with the tyrosinase signal, particularly as seen in the presence of 1 mm 3-AT (Fig. 3B). From these results, we concluded that canonical (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals bind to the same site as the CD4 Q-peptide but exhibit distinct requirements for specific residues within the binding site. The lower sensitivity of the Nef dileucine signal to σ2 substitutions may be due to a stabilizing effect of the previously described diaspartate motif at +10 and +11 from the ENTSLL (Fig. 2B), which is absent in the tyrosinase signal and has been proposed to interact with a basic patch comprising Lys297 and Arg340 on the α subunit (Fig. 3A) (27Chaudhuri R. Mattera R. Lindwasser O.W. Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2518-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether AP-1 and AP-3 have a (D/E)XXXL(L/I)-binding site similar to that on AP-2. The σ2 residues that participate in the interaction with (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals are conserved on σ1A and σ3A (Fig. 4A). We therefore tested the effect of mutating these σ1A and σ3A residues on the interaction with the Nef and tyrosinase signals in Y3H assays. We found that most of these mutations affected the interactions of the corresponding γ1-σ1A and δ-σ3A hemicomplexes with both signals (Fig. 5, A and B). The specific requirements for interaction, however, were signal- and adaptor-dependent. As shown above for αC-σ2, the interactions of γ1-σ1A and δ-σ3A with the Nef signal (Fig. 5, A and B, left panels) were generally less sensitive to substitutions than the corresponding interactions with the tyrosinase signal (Fig. 5, A and B, right panels). In addition, the interaction of both the Nef and tyrosinase signals with γ1-σ1A (Fig. 5A) was stronger and less sensitive to substitutions than the corresponding interactions with δ-σ3A (Fig. 5B). In this context, whereas the interaction with the signals was reduced by most substitutions in σ3A with the exception of L107A (for Nef) and D98A (for tyrosinase) (Fig. 5B), the interaction with σ1A was abolished only by V88D and I103S (for Nef) and also by A63D (for tyrosinase) (Fig. 5A). Among the substitutions that did not abolish binding of the Nef and tyrosinase signals to the γ1-σ1A hemicomplex was σ1A R15E (an effect on Nef was only detected in the presence of 1 mm 3-AT) (Fig. 5A). This substitution involves a basic residue equivalent to σ2 Arg15 which, along with αC Arg21, is part of the positively charged patch that binds to the −4/−5 position of the CD4 Q-peptide (20Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a position occupied by Asp or Glu in canonical (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals. These results indicated that the general features of the AP-2 (D/E)XXXL(L/I)-binding site are conserved on AP-1 and AP-3, although the overall strength of the interactions and the requirement of specific residues on the σ subunits vary for different signals.FIGURE 5Mapping of AP-1 and AP-3 residues involved in interactions with (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals. The interaction of (D/E)XXXL(L/I) motif-based signals with AP-1 γ-σ1 or AP-3 δ-σ3 mutant hemicomplexes is shown in A and B, respectively. Subcloning of cDNAs sequences encoding (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals and AP subunits and plating of double transformants were performed as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Positive controls included the interaction of (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals with the AP-1 γ-σ1 or AP-3 δ-σ3 hemicomplexes, whereas double transformants expressing (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals and discordant γ-σ3 or δ-σ1 pairs were used as negative controls.

Tyrase, tyrosinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also analyzed the role of conserved basic residues on the γ1 and δ subunits at positions equivalent to αC Arg21 (Fig. 4B), given the contribution of this residue to the positively charged patch interacting with the −4/−5 residue of the CD4 Q-peptide (20Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To this end, we compared the binding of the Nef, tyrosinase, and LIMP-II signals to the γ1 R15E, αC R21E, and δ R26E mutants and the corresponding wild-type proteins as hemicomplexes with σ1A, σ2, and σ3A, respectively. The results showed that substitution of these basic residues generally decreased interactions with the signals (Fig. 6). The effects were more marked for the γ1 R15E and δ R26E mutations than for the αC R21E mutation and were also more noticeable for the interaction with the Nef and LIMP-II signals than with the tyrosinase signal (Fig. 6). In addition, we observed that the effects were smaller for the αC R21E mutation than for the σ2 R15E mutation (Fig. 6B), whereas similar reductions were observed when comparing the δ R26E and σ3A R15E mutations (Fig. 6C). This suggests that basic residues on both the α and σ2 subunits of AP-2 and the δ and σ3 subunits of AP-3 contribute to the electrostatic interaction with the acidic residue at position −4 of the signals. This is in line with the observation that mutation of both basic residues in the patch (αC Arg21 and σ2 Arg15) is necessary to decrease binding of the AP-2 core to the CD4 Q-peptide (20Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of γ1 R15E caused a much greater reduction in binding to the (D/E)XXXL(L/I) signals than mutation of σ1A Arg15 (Fig. 6A), indicating that the basic residue contributed by γ1 is the most critical for interaction with the (D/E) residue of the signals. A summary of the results of the mutational analyses is shown in Fig. 7.FIGURE 7Graphic summary of the effects of substitutions in AP subunits on the interaction of (D/E)XXXL(L/I) motif-based signals.

Until recently it was believed that all GBEs belong to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13). Here we describe the cloning and expression of the Thermus thermophilus family GH57-type GBE and report its biochemical properties and crystal structure at 1.35-Å resolution. The enzyme has a central (β/α)(7)-fold catalytic domain A with an inserted domain B between β2 and α5 and an α-helix-rich C-terminal domain, which is shown to be essential for substrate binding and catalysis. A maltotriose was modeled in the active site of the enzyme which suggests that there is insufficient space for simultaneously binding of donor and acceptor substrates, and that the donor substrate must be cleaved before acceptor substrate can bind. The biochemical assessment showed that the GH57 GBE possesses about 4% hydrolytic activity with amylose and in vitro forms a glucan product with a novel fine structure, demonstrating that the GH57 GBE is clearly different from the GH13 GBEs characterized to date."
https://openalex.org/W2018617838,"Fyn, an Src kinase family member, acts as a negative regulator of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Under stressful conditions, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE), activating defensive gene expression. Once Nrf2 completes activation, Fyn phosphorylates tyrosine 568 of Nrf2, resulting in the nuclear export and degradation of Nrf2. The present studies demonstrate that within 0.5 h of antioxidant treatment in human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells, Fyn exports out of the nucleus, allowing Nrf2 unimpeded movement to the ARE. Mutation of tyrosine 213 of Fyn stymied nuclear export, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation controls nuclear export. Mass spectrometry confirmed tyrosine 213 as the site of phosphorylation. ChIP and real-time PCR assays revealed that FynY213A mutant caused decreased binding of Nrf2 to the promoter of defensive gene NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and decreased NQO1 expression by 5-fold (P<0.0001) compared to wild-type Fyn. In addition, a putative nuclear export signal (NES) was identified, and mutation of it also inhibited nuclear export of Fyn. Furthermore, FynY213A caused an increased susceptibility to cell death following treatment with etoposide in mouse hepatoma (Hepa-1) cells. The preinduction regulation of Nrf2 is controlled by the nuclear export of Fyn, allowing for activation of defensive gene expression."

Because GPR34 is highly expressed in mononuclear cells of the immune system, mice were specifically tested for altered functions of these cell types. Following immunization with methylated BSA, the number of granulocytes and macrophages in spleens was significantly lower in GPR34-deficient mice as in wild-type mice. GPR34-deficient mice showed significantly increased paw swelling in the delayed type hypersensitivity test and higher pathogen burden in extrapulmonary tissues after pulmonary infection with Cryptococcus neoformans compared with wild-type mice. The findings in delayed type hypersensitivity and infection tests were accompanied by significantly different basal and stimulated TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ levels in GPR34-deficient animals. Our data point toward a functional role of GPR34 in the cellular response to immunological challenges. The X-chromosomal GPR34 gene encodes an orphan Gi protein-coupled receptor that is highly conserved among vertebrates.

Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1414-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A great number of stimuli, such as light, hormones, neurotransmitters, peptides, and nucleotides, activate the distinct receptors. Nonodorant receptors form about one-third of the GPCR repertoire. Although more than 200 non-odorant GPCR have been assigned to specific agonists and functions, about 155 so-called “orphan” GPCR (2Wigglesworth M.J. Wolfe L.A. Wise A. Ernst Schering Found. Symp. Proc. 2006; : 105-143PubMed Google Scholar) await identification of their physiological relevance. The importance of GPCR in controlling almost every physiological function makes this receptor family the most frequently used target for therapeutic drugs. Therefore, unveiling the function of orphan GPCR is a central issue in academic and industrial research.

Among the five structurally different GPCR families (1Fredriksson R. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1414-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 3Fredriksson R. Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.G. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar), the rhodopsin-like receptors form the largest in humans and other vertebrates. The rhodopsin-like family is divided further into subfamilies and groups. The P2Y12-like receptor group includes the ADP receptors P2Y12 and P2Y13, the UDP-glucose receptor P2Y14, and the orphan receptors GPR87, GPR82, and GPR34 (4Schöneberg T. Hermsdorf T. Engemaier E. Engel K. Liebscher I. Thor D. Zierau K. Römpler H. Schulz A. Purinergic Signal. 2007; 3: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Apart from the ADP receptor P2Y12, which has a central role in platelet aggregation and is the therapeutic target of clopidogrel (5Foster C.J. Prosser D.M. Agans J.M. Zhai Y. Smith M.D. Lachowicz J.E. Zhang F.L. Gustafson E. Monsma Jr., F.J. Wiekowski M.T. Abbondanzo S.J. Cook D.N. Bayne M.L. Lira S.A. Chintala M.S. J. Clin.

Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), very little is known about the function of the other members of this group. GPR34, an orphan receptor of the P2Y12-like receptor group, was first discovered by mining GenBankTM for novel GPCR sequences and homology cloning and has been assigned to the human X chromosome (7Marchese A. Sawzdargo M. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Heng H.H. Nowak T. Im D.S. Lynch K.R. George S.R. O'dowd B.F. Genomics. 1999; 56: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Grosse R. Schade R. Henklein P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic studies revealed that GPR34 has been highly conserved over the past 450 million years of vertebrate evolution, and no GPR34-deficient vertebrate has been identified yet (9Schulz A. Schöneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35531-35541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To date, there is no report of GPR34 deficiency in humans, and sequencing of more than 100 worldwide samples of human genomic DNA revealed no functionally relevant alleles indicating the physiological importance of the gene (10Engemaier E. Römpler H. Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Genomics. 2006; 87: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GPR34 was, however, included in a microdeletion and breakpoints at the Xp11.4 locus in a Turner syndrome patient (11Boucher C.A. Sargent C.A. Ogata T. Affara N.A. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 591-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (12Novak, A., Akasaka, T., Manske, M., Gupta, M., Witzig, T., Dyer, M. J.

GPR34 shows a ubiquitous expression pattern in murine and human tissues (8Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Grosse R. Schade R. Henklein P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More detailed analyses showed GPR34 expression in the myeloid progenitor cell line HL-60 in K562 cells, and WEHI-3B cells, the macrophage cell line RAW 264.1 (10Engemaier E. Römpler H. Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Genomics. 2006; 87: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and in the murine mast cell line P815. These findings suggest a granulocytic/monocytic expression pattern that is consistent with the ubiquitous expression pattern seen in tissues. Recently, several members of the P2Y12-like receptor group have been assigned to agonists, including nucleotide derivates and lipids (14Tabata K. Baba K. Shiraishi A. Ito M. Fujita N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Nonaka Y. Hiramoto T. Fujita N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Specifically, GPR34 was shown to be activated by lyso-phosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) in vitro. lyso-PS is generated by hydrolysis of membrane lipids through phospholipases A1 and A2 when apoptotic cells expose phosphatidylserine on their surface to these phospholipases (17Aoki J. Nagai Y. Hosono H. Inoue K. Arai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Park K.S. Lee H.Y. Kim M.K. Shin E.H. Jo S.H. Kim S.D. Im D.S. Bae Y.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). lyso-PS is a potent activator of histamine release from mast cells (19Bellini F. Viola G. Menegus A.M. Toffano G. Bruni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lyso-PS has been described as a growth inhibitor of T cells and as a chemotactic substance for fibroblasts and tumor cells (18Park K.S. Lee H.Y. Kim M.K. Shin E.H. Jo S.H. Kim S.D. Im D.S. Bae Y.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Bellini F. Viola G. Menegus A.M. Toffano G. Bruni A. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 2008; 374: 147-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest an involvement of GPR34 in cellular chemotaxis and immune response, but proof of this concept has yet to be obtained. We generated and characterized a GPR34-deficient (KO) mouse model with specific focus on immunological functions. We found no evidence that lyso-PS is a natural agonist of the murine and human GPR34. KO mice showed no major alterations in a wide range of tests. However, GPR34 deficiency leads to improper immune response upon antigen and pathogen challenge. If not stated otherwise, all standard substances were purchased from Sigma, Merck, and C. Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany). Cell culture material was obtained from Sarstedt (Nürnbrecht, Germany), and primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. For expression of GPR34 orthologs in yeast, the p416GPD vector (22Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Mark Pausch, Wyeth Research, Princeton, NJ) was used, and mammalian expression was performed using the pcDps vector (23Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt/Main, Germany). “Brain”-lyso-PS whose main component is stearyl-lyso-PS (S-lyso-PS) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Because the P-lyso-PS used by Sugo et al. (16Sugo T. Tachimoto H. Chikatsu T. Murakami Y. Kikukawa Y. Sato S. Kikuchi K. Nagi T. Harada M. Ogi K. Ebisawa M. Mori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was no longer commercially available at Sigma or any other company, P-lyso-PS was synthesized by hydrolysis of 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine with phospholipase A2. P-lyso-PS was purified from the reaction mixture by extraction and thin layer chromatography (for further details see supplemental material). The haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain MPY578t5 (provided by Dr. Mark Pausch) was used for the expression of GPR34 orthologs. Cells were transformed with plasmid DNA using electroporation as described previously (24Thor D. Schulz A. Hermsdorf T. Schöneberg T. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cyclic AMP measurements were performed as described previously (25Römpler H. Stäubert C. Thor D. Schulz A. Hofreiter M. Schöneberg T. Mol. Interv. 2007; 7: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the AlphaScreen® technology. Transient co-transfection experiments of COS-7 cells with the GPR34 constructs and the chimeric G protein Gαqi4 and inositol phosphate accumulation assays (26Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) were essentially performed as described previously (9Schulz A. Schöneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35531-35541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All GPR34 constructs were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pcDps and double-tagged with an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag to monitor and quantify total cellular and plasma membrane expression using ELISA (27Böselt I. Römpler H. Hermsdorf T. Thor D. Busch W. Schulz A. Schöneberg T. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Correctness of all PCR-derived constructs was verified by sequencing. The construction of the GPR34 conditional knock-out allele is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The neomycin cassette was flanked by two loxP sites (28Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and a third loxP site was inserted into the 5′ region of Gpr34. Neomycin-resistant ES cells were screened for homologous recombination. Positive ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts. Chimeric offsprings were fertile and crossed into a C57BL/6 background. Correct homologous recombination was verified by sequencing of PCR products containing sequences of the 5′ and 3′ arms of the targeting constructs and the respective genomic flanking regions, which were not included in the targeting vector. The initial study described here was performed on complete GPR34-deficient mice. To obtain these animals, female heterozygous mice carrying the mutant loxP Gpr34-Neo cassette locus were bred with homozygous male EIIa-Cre mice. Correct deletion of the Gpr34 coding sequence and neomycin cassette was verified by PCR and locus sequencing. Resulting GPR34-deficient mice (referred to as KO mice) were backcrossed for 12 generations onto the C57BL/6 background. Animals were maintained in a controlled animal facility with 21 °C room temperature, 55% humidity, and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. All animal experiments were conducted in accord with accepted standards of humane animal care and approved by the respective regional government agency of the State of Saxony, Germany (TVV 43/07). Routine genotyping of KO and WT mice was performed by PCR using the primers loxP-GP34-2 sense, loxP-GP34-1-2 antisense, and loxP-GP34-3 antisense (supplemental Table S1). The genomic sequence was amplified from mouse tail DNA using a PCR protocol with the following conditions: 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 35 cycles followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. Amplification of the KO allele and the WT allele resulted in 270- and 385-bp fragments, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). Litters of newborn KO and WT mice were followed in respect to genotype, gender, and vitality. The daily observation after birth further included measurement of weight and body length. At 3 months of age, mice were sacrificed. Organs, urine, and blood samples were taken for further examination. Histological slices (5 μm) were prepared from organs being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin wax. Slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Blood cell counting from EDTA blood samples was performed automatically (Scil Vet abc; Scil Corp., Viernheim, Germany) and manually under a light microscope after May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. Electrolytes, metabolites, enzymes, and hormones were analyzed in serum or, where appropriate, in whole blood, according to the guidelines of the German Society of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, using a Hitachi PPE-Modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Acylcarnitine profiles were determined by electrospray ionization-MS/MS (API 2000, Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) (29Müller P. Schulze A. Schindler I. Ethofer T. Buehrdel P. Ceglarek U. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 327: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Ceglarek U. Müller P. Stach B. Bührdel P. Thiery J. Kiess W. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2002; 40: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Blood glucose was measured using the Accu Check® device (Roche Diagnostics). Urine samples were obtained by direct urinary bladder puncture and tested for osmolality differences between the genotypes using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor®, Logan, UT). A modified SHIRPA protocol (31Masuya H. Inoue M. Wada Y. Shimizu A. Nagano J. Kawai A. Inoue A. Kagami T. Hirayama T. Yamaga A. Kaneda H. Kobayashi K. Minowa O. Miura I. Gondo Y. Noda T. Wakana S.

Genome. 1997; 8: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was used to assess a number of motoric, sensoric, and autonomic functions of 8-week-old mice. The open field test and the light-dark test were performed as reported previously (33Plyusnina I. Oskina I. Physiol. Behav. 1997; 61: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Crawley J.

Behav. 2008; 53: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using automated measuring technology (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany). Activity of mice was recorded for a period of 5 min. In a hot plate test (Hot Plate 602001, TSE) the elapsed time until the first reaction of the mice to the heat stimulus (52 °C) was recorded. As end points, shaking or licking of one of the hind paws or jumping off the analgesia meter were used. Hearts were removed from five WT and KO mice at an age of 3 months. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was further purified with RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the RNA clean-up protocol. For microarray analysis, RNA integrity and concentration were quantified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) using the RNA 6.000 LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray expression analysis using GeneChip® Mouse Genome Arrays 430A 2.0 and data analysis were performed as described previously (36Schliebe N. Strotmann R. Busse K. Mitschke D. Biebermann H. Schomburg L. Köhrle J. Bär J. Römpler H. Wess J. Schöneberg T. Sangkuhl K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1177-F1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For quantitative real time PCR analysis (qPCR), total RNA was reversely transcribed (Superscript II, Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primer. cDNA from 500 ng of total RNA was subjected to qPCR using Platinum-SYBR Green® qPCR Supermix (Invitrogen), 0.6 μm forward and reverse primers, and 100 nm ROXTM (5-carboxy-X-rhodamine, passive reference dye). Oligonucleotide primers (supplemental Table S2) were designed with the Primer3 software (37Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Primer3 on the WWW for General Users and for Biologist Programmers. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar) to flank intron sequences. qPCR was performed by an MX 3000P instrument (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following protocol: 2 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. A product melting curve was recorded to confirm the presence of a single amplicon. The correct amplicon size and identity were additionally confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme cleavage or sequencing. Standard curves with serial dilutions of cDNA were generated for each primer pair to assert linear amplification. Threshold cycle (Ct) values were set within the exponential phase of the PCR. After normalization to β2-microglobulin, ΔCt values were used to calculate the relative expression levels (38Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386PubMed Google Scholar). Gene regulation was statistically evaluated by subjecting the ΔΔCt values derived from matched littermate samples to a two-sided Student's t test assuming equal variances. Gene regulation ratios are given as 2ΔΔCt values. Peritoneal mast cells were obtained by peritoneal lavage from 3-month-old mice and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma). A degranulation assay was performed as described previously (16Sugo T. Tachimoto H. Chikatsu T. Murakami Y. Kikukawa Y. Sato S. Kikuchi K. Nagi T. Harada M. Ogi K. Ebisawa M. Mori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, peritoneal mast cells were adjusted to equal numbers per reaction assembly and stimulated with P-lyso-PS (10 μm). After incubation for 20 min, suspensions were centrifuged, and supernatant and pellet were resuspended separately in 1 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free Tyrode's buffer. Histamine was extracted using bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-phosphoric acid in heptane. For quantification through a fluorescence detector, derivatization of histamine was performed with o-phthaldialdehyde. After filtration and degassing of the individual extracts, histamine concentration was obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (KNAUER, Berlin, Germany) with a stationary phase consisting of phenyl on silica gel (Nucleosil®, MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany) and a mobile phase with a sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer/acetonitrile gradient of 5–50%. Chromatograms were recorded and analyzed by Chromgate® version 3.1 software (KNAUER, Berlin, Germany- based on EZChrom Elite®). A chemotaxis assay was performed using transwell plates (Greiner Bio-One, Solingen, Germany) as described previously (18Park K.S. Lee H.Y. Kim M.K. Shin E.H. Jo S.H. Kim S.D. Im D.S. Bae Y.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Bae Y.S. Yi H.J. Lee H.Y. Jo E.J. Kim J.I. Lee T.G. Ye R.D. Kwak J.Y. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6807-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage with PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in DMEM (plus 0.5% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin) for each mouse separately. A dry non-coated polycarbonate filter (8-μm pore size) was placed in a cavity of a 24-well plate, and the upper chamber was filled with 150 μl of cell suspension (3.3 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow adhesion onto the membrane. The next day, different concentrations of S-lyso-PS in a volume of 800 μl were applied to the lower chamber. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, non-migratory cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by scraping, and migrated adherent cells on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with the hemacolor set (Merck). The stained cells were counted in four randomly chosen high power fields (×40) for each well. The number of migrated nonadherent cells in the medium of the lower chamber was determined using a Neubauer counting cell chamber. GPR34 is highly expressed in glial cells (40Bédard A. Tremblay P. Chernomoretz A. Vallières L. Glia. 2007; 55: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) such as astrocytes and microglia (detailed expression data from own studies, see supplemental Table S3). One function of glial cells in brain and retina is the compensation of osmotic imbalances. To assess whether GPR34 is involved in this specific glial function. a retinal glia swelling test was performed. To monitor volume changes of retinal glial cells in response to hypotonic challenge, the somata of glial cells in the inner nuclear layer of retinal slices or the somata of isolated single cells were focused. Filter stripes with the retinal slices (about 1 mm thick) were transferred to recording chambers and kept submerged in extracellular solution. The chambers were mounted on the stage of an upright confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). Retinal slices or isolated cells were loaded with the vital dye Mitotracker Orange (10 μm), which has been shown to stain somata of Müller glial cells selectively in the inner nuclear layer of retinal tissues (41Uckermann O. Iandiev I. Francke M. Franze K. Grosche J. Wolf S. Kohen L. Wiedemann P. Reichenbach A. Bringmann A. Glia. 2004; 45: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After an incubation time of 3 min, slices or cells were continuously perfused with extracellular solution at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and recordings were made with an Achroplan 63×/0.9 water immersion objective. The pinhole was set at 172 μm; the thickness of the optical section was adjusted to 1 μm. Mitotracker Orange was excited at 543 nm with an HeNe laser, and emission was recorded with a 560-nm long pass filter. Images were obtained with an x-y frame size of 256 × 256 pixels (73.1 × 73.1 μm). In the course of the experiments, the Mitotracker Orange-stained somata of Müller glial cells were recorded at the plane of their maximal extension. To ensure that the maximum soma area was precisely measured, the focal plane was continuously adjusted in the course of the experiments. The DTH response test to methylated BSA (mBSA; Sigma) was performed according to Nambu et al. (42Nambu A. Nakae S. Iwakura Y. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At day 1, mice were immunized intradermally with 200 μl of 2 mg/ml mBSA emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. After 8 days, mice were challenged intradermally in one footpad with 20 μl of 5 mg/ml mBSA in 0.9% NaCl solution and an equal volume of solely 0.9% NaCl solution in the other footpad. Footpad swelling was measured every 12 h over a total time period of 48 h using a millimeter screw (Kroeplin GmbH, Schlüchtern, Germany). DTH reaction was determined as difference between thickness of mBSA- and NaCl solution-injected footpad. At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed, and primary spleen cell cultures were established. Thus, spleen tissue of the individual mice was disintegrated through a 100-μm cell strainer to obtain a single cell suspension in PBS. After erythrocyte lysis with Gey's solution, cells were resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's medium with glutamine, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), seeded into 24-well plates, and stimulated with different concentrations of mBSA for 72 h. Cytokine concentrations in supernatants of untreated and mBSA-treated cells were measured in a multiplex assay (Th1/Th2-Kit, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For IL-1β and IL-6 measurements, an ELISA kit (BioLegend, Fell, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Local infection of mice with C. neoformans was carried out as described previously (43Kleinschek M.A. Muller U. Brodie S.J. Stenzel W. Kohler G. Blumenschein W.M. Straubinger R.K. McClanahan T.

Prior to infection, the encapsulated C. neoformans strain 1841, serotype D, was incubated overnight in Sabouraud dextrose medium (2% glucose, 1% peptone; Sigma) at 30 °C. Twenty μl of a 2.5 × 104 cells/ml Cryptococcus cell suspension (500 colony-forming units) were administered into one nostril. During this procedure, mice were intraperitoneally anesthetized with a 1:1 mixture of 10% ketamine (100 mg/ml; Ceva Animal Health) and 2% xylazine (20 mg/ml; Ceva Animal Health). Infected mice were observed daily for any signs of morbidity. After 60 days, animals were sacrificed, and lung, spleen, and brain were removed under sterile conditions. All organs were weighed, and equal organ parts were homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax® (T8; Ika-Werke, Staufen, Germany) in 1 ml of PBS. Serial dilutions of homogenates were administered on Sabouraud-dextrose agar plates, and grown colonies were counted after 72 h of incubation at 30 °C. For cytokine measurements, spleens of sacrificed animals were pooled in groups, and primary spleen cell culture was performed as described above. Cells were incubated with mediu"

https://openalex.org/W2088211150,"Heightened DJ-1 (Park7) expression is associated with a reduction in chemotherapeutic-induced cell death and poor prognosis in several cancers, whereas the loss of DJ-1 function is found in a subgroup of Parkinson disease associated with neuronal death. This study describes a novel pathway by which DJ-1 modulates cell survival. Mass spectrometry shows that DJ-1 interacts with BBS1, CLCF1, MTREF, and Cezanne/OTUD7B/Za20d1. Among these, Cezanne is a known deubiquitination enzyme that inhibits NF-κB activity. DJ-1/Cezanne interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed and endogenous proteins, maps to the amino-terminal 70 residues of DJ-1, and leads to the inhibition of the deubiquitinating activity of Cezanne. Microarray profiling of shRNA-transduced cells shows that DJ-1 and Cezanne regulate IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in opposing directions. Similarly, DJ-1 enhances NF-κB nuclear translocation and cell survival, whereas Cezanne reduces these outcomes. Analysis of mouse Park7(-/-) primary cells confirms the regulation of ICAM-1 by DJ-1 and Cezanne. As NF-κB is important in cellular survival and transformation, IL-8 functions as an angiogenic factor and pro-survival signal, and ICAM-1 has been implicated in tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis; these data provide an additional modality by which DJ-1 controls cell survival and possibly tumor progression via interaction with Cezanne."

However, extraneous classical effects can also cause this reduction, and so, to confirm supersolid formation, Choi et al. (p. 1512 , published online 18 November) performed a slightly different measurement. Rotation was superimposed onto the oscillating motion, and the period and the shear modulus of the system were measured simultaneously. These two quantities exhibited very different responses to the rotation speed, suggesting that supersolidity (rather than classical effects that would also affect the shear modulus) is indeed at the root of the previously observed change in the oscillating period."

Although the signaling cascade linking NOD2 stimulation to NF-κB activation has been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which NOD2, itself, is regulated remain elusive.Upon intracellular exposure to a breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), NOD2 binds to the scaffolding protein kinase, RIP2 (receptor-interacting protein 2), via caspase recruitment domain interactions (1Inohara N.

Following activation of the NOD2-RIP2 complex, the (CARD) IKK scaffolding protein IKKγ (NEMO) becomes polyubiquitinated via Lys63 linkages on Lys285 of NEMO. These ubiquitin chains on NEMO are thought to help nucleate TAK1 (TNF receptor-associated kinase 1) such that it can phosphorylate the activation loop of IKKβ and ultimately activate the NF-κB transcription factors (8Abbott D.W.

MAP3Ks are the upper tier of a sequential cascade of MAPK-activating kinases that ultimately leads to MAPK activation. Specifically, the MAP3K, MEKK4, was identified as a regulator of NOD2. Both basally and in response to MDP, MEKK4 helps the cell to maintain low levels of NF-κB activity (12Clark N.M. Marinis J.M. Cobb B.A. Abbott D.W. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1402-1408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylating MAP2Ks, the MAP3K proteins act as scaffolding proteins for signaling complexes (13Kolch W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). This is evidenced by the fact that one atypical tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family member, TRAF4, has been implicated in MEKK4-dependent signaling pathways. TRAF4 binds to MEKK4, and the TRAF4 knock-out mouse closely resembles both the kinase-inactive MEKK4 knock-in mouse and the MEKK4 knock-out mouse because all of these mice show embryonic lethality with impaired neural tube closure and skeletal malformations (14Abell A.N.

The RING domain of TRAF proteins confers E3 ubiquitin ligase capability. The C terminus contains a TRAF domain that engages in heterotypic protein-protein interactions (18Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TRAF domain of each TRAF family member recognizes unique motifs in their binding partners. Although the TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF6 show similar but separate peptide binding interactions, the peptide binding motif of TRAF4 has not been defined (19Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L.

Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Unlike other TRAF proteins, TRAF4 is largely uncharacterized, with few studies examining its role in inflammatory signaling responses.In this work, we identify TRAF4 as a novel negative regulator of NOD2 signaling. We confirm the interaction of TRAF4 with MEKK4 and find that, like MEKK4, TRAF4 negatively regulates MDP-induced NF-κB activation and killing of intracellular bacteria. Furthermore, we find that TRAF4 binds NOD2, and we map the sites of interaction between NOD2 and TRAF4 to specific regions of these two proteins. We identify two critical amino acid residues within a putative TRAF binding motif in NOD2 that are essential for both binding of TRAF4 and TRAF4 inhibition of NOD2 function. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for regulation of the host response to bacterial infection.DISCUSSIONDownstream signaling events linking NOD2 stimulation to NF-κB activation have been extensively studied. Less well studied are the negative feedback mechanisms that aim to limit the NF-κB signaling pathway after initial NOD2 activation. Many of the negative regulators of NOD2 signaling dampen NF-κB activation downstream of NOD2. For example, the deubiquitinases CYLD and A20 as well as nuclear factor κB inhibitor (IκBα) are among the first genes transcribed upon NOD2 and NF-κB activation, and all help terminate signaling downstream of NOD2 (8Abbott D.W. Wilkins A. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2217-2227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 34Hitotsumatsu O. Ahmad R.C. Tavares R. Wang M. Philpott D.

Asara J.M. Ma A. Cantley L.C. Abbott D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7451-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, studies investigating the mechanisms by which NOD2 is directly regulated are less prominent. In this work, we have identified TRAF4 as a novel negative regulator and binding protein of NOD2. Binding of NOD2 to TRAF4 is observed in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations of overexpressed protein as well as the coprecipitation of endogenous TRAF4 with stably expressed FLAG-NOD2 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The TRAF domain of TRAF family members generally confers heterotypic protein-protein interactions. Consistent with this, NOD2 binding is lost with the expression of a TRAF4 mutant lacking the TRAF domain (ΔTRAF) (Fig. 5). Unable to bind, the ΔTRAF TRAF4 also is unable to inhibit NOD2 signaling (Fig. 5). Given that TRAF4 binding is required for its inhibition of NOD2 signaling, we considered that TRAF4 affected recruitment of the NOD2 effector protein, RIP2. The presence of TRAF4 did not affect NOD2 binding to RIP2 but did inhibit the next proximal signaling events, cIAP1 ubiquitination of RIP2 and RIP2 tyrosine autophosphorylation.Deletion mutants of NOD2 revealed a 36-amino acid region required for TRAF4 binding. This was confirmed with the generation and use of a bacterial recombinant GST-fused peptide of this region, GST-NOD2(260–305) (Fig. 6).The TRAF domains of each TRAF family member recognize and bind a distinct motif in their binding partner proteins (18Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although binding motifs for TRAF2 and TRAF6 have been characterized, a TRAF4 binding motif has not been described (19Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 20Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S.

Biol. 2007; 597: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison by BLAST analysis reveals that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 is more similar to TRAF2 than TRAF6. Thus, we considered that the binding motif of TRAF4 might resemble that of TRAF2. We examined the 36-amino acid region of NOD2 for the presence of potential binding sites and identified two imperfect TRAF2 binding sites. When conservation of these sites was compared, we found that the binding site resembling the major TRAF2 binding site, (P/S/A/T)X(Q/E)E (19Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), was conserved in both mouse and zebrafish. For this reason, we generated NOD2 point mutants with glutamate residues 279 and 280 replaced with alanine residues. TRAF4 binding to the E279A/E280A NOD2 mutant was severely diminished, and TRAF4 could no longer function to inhibit E279A/E280A NOD2 (Fig. 7).In addition to the activation of inflammatory pathways, a role for NOD2 has been documented in maintaining an appropriate intestinal flora. NOD2-deficient mice have increased commensal bacteria and a decreased ability to prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria (37Petnicki-Ocwieja T. Hrncir T. Liu Y.J. Biswas A. Hudcovic T.

The role of TRAF4 in NOD2-induced bacterial killing was examined by observing the effect of TRAF4 on NOD2-induced Salmonella killing in gentamycin protection assays. We find that TRAF4 binding to NOD2 inhibits the ability of NOD2 to kill Salmonella and that this inhibition is lost when mutants are used that abrogate TRAF4 binding to NOD2 (Fig. 4). This is not the first time TRAF4 has been shown to inhibit an innate immune signaling pathway. TRAF4 binds to TRAF6 and TRIF to dampen TLR-mediated NF-κB and IFNβ activation (38Takeshita F. Ishii K.J. Kobiyama K. Kojima Y. Coban C. Sasaki S. Ishii N. Klinman D.M. Okuda K. Akira S. Suzuki K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2477-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, TRAF4 has been shown to affect reactive oxygen species generation. The exact role of TRAF4 in reactive oxygen species generation remains elusive; however, three laboratories have independently shown TRAF4 binding the cytosolic NADPH oxidase complex subunit p47phox (38Takeshita F.

It is possible that decreases in NOD2-induced bacterial killing by TRAF4 are linked to its role in mediating a reactive oxygen species response. This hypothesis is further supported by the recently published data indicating that NOD2 interacts with DUOX2 to mediate NOD2-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species in epithelial cells (41Lipinski S. Till A. Sina C. Arlt A. Grasberger H. Schreiber S. Rosenstiel P. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3522-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and would be an interesting avenue for future investigation.In summary, this study identified a novel NOD2-binding protein and regulator of NOD2 signaling. This finding provides insight that allows further dissection of NOD2 signaling pathways to elucidate how dysregulated NOD2 signaling leads to disease. Having mapped the specific regions of binding provides opportunities to manipulate the system for further research or future drug targeting techniques. Last, having identified a TRAF4 binding motif allows for identification of additional TRAF4-binding proteins within innate immune signaling pathways to elucidate the function of this understudied TRAF family member.

Although the signaling cascade linking NOD2 stimulation to NF-κB activation has been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which NOD2, itself, is regulated remain elusive.Upon intracellular exposure to a breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), NOD2 binds to the scaffolding protein kinase, RIP2 (receptor-interacting protein 2), via caspase recruitment domain interactions (1Inohara N.

Following activation of the NOD2-RIP2 complex, the (CARD) IKK scaffolding protein IKKγ (NEMO) becomes polyubiquitinated via Lys63 linkages on Lys285 of NEMO. These ubiquitin chains on NEMO are thought to help nucleate TAK1 (TNF receptor-associated kinase 1) such that it can phosphorylate the activation loop of IKKβ and ultimately activate the NF-κB transcription factors (8Abbott D.W.

MAP3Ks are the upper tier of a sequential cascade of MAPK-activating kinases that ultimately leads to MAPK activation. Specifically, the MAP3K, MEKK4, was identified as a regulator of NOD2. Both basally and in response to MDP, MEKK4 helps the cell to maintain low levels of NF-κB activity (12Clark N.M. Marinis J.M. Cobb B.A. Abbott D.W. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1402-1408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylating MAP2Ks, the MAP3K proteins act as scaffolding proteins for signaling complexes (13Kolch W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). This is evidenced by the fact that one atypical tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family member, TRAF4, has been implicated in MEKK4-dependent signaling pathways. TRAF4 binds to MEKK4, and the TRAF4 knock-out mouse closely resembles both the kinase-inactive MEKK4 knock-in mouse and the MEKK4 knock-out mouse because all of these mice show embryonic lethality with impaired neural tube closure and skeletal malformations (14Abell A.N.

The RING domain of TRAF proteins confers E3 ubiquitin ligase capability. The C terminus contains a TRAF domain that engages in heterotypic protein-protein interactions (18Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TRAF domain of each TRAF family member recognizes unique motifs in their binding partners. Although the TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF6 show similar but separate peptide binding interactions, the peptide binding motif of TRAF4 has not been defined (19Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L.

Unlike other TRAF proteins, TRAF4 is largely uncharacterized, with few studies examining its role in inflammatory signaling responses.In this work, we identify TRAF4 as a novel negative regulator of NOD2 signaling. We confirm the interaction of TRAF4 with MEKK4 and find that, like MEKK4, TRAF4 negatively regulates MDP-induced NF-κB activation and killing of intracellular bacteria. Furthermore, we find that TRAF4 binds NOD2, and we map the sites of interaction between NOD2 and TRAF4 to specific regions of these two proteins. We identify two critical amino acid residues within a putative TRAF binding motif in NOD2 that are essential for both binding of TRAF4 and TRAF4 inhibition of NOD2 function. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for regulation of the host response to bacterial infection."

Expression of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM)α was reported to be abnormally increased in T cells from SLE patients. CREMα suppresses IL-2 and T cell receptor ζ chain gene transcription by direct binding to the respective promoters. Here, we show that increased CREM expression is the result of enhanced promoter activity.

Protein phosphatase 2A is known to activate SP-1 through dephosphorylation at its serine residue 59. Our results show that nuclei from SLE T cells contain lower levels of Ser59-phosphorylated SP-1 protein and a stronger SP-1 binding to the CREM promoter. We conclude that protein phosphatase 2A accounts for enhanced SP-1 dephosphorylation at Ser59 in SLE T cells. More importantly, CREM promoter activity mirrors reliably disease activity in SLE patients, underscoring its potential role as a biomarker for the prediction of flares in SLE patients.

Isenberg D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). T cells have been demonstrated to be important in the pathogenesis of SLE (2Tenbrock K. Juang Y.T. Kyttaris V.C. Tsokos G.C. Rheumatology. 2007; 46: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Functional abnormalities in SLE T cells are largely underwritten by altered gene transcription, and recent studies have revealed a vast number of transcription factors in SLE T cells displaying changes in their expression levels and function. Among them, the α-isoform of the transcriptional regulator cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) has emerged as a potent regulator of target genes that are crucially involved in T cell physiology, e.g. interleukin (IL)-2, T cell receptor ζ chain, and transcription factor c-fos (3Solomou E.E.

The CREM protein family constitutes a group of transcription factors that belong to the superfamily of basic domain/leucine zipper domain proteins such as cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factors. All of them share high structural similarities and possess the ability to bind specifically cis-regulatory DNA sequences as homo- or heterodimers. The target motifs are palindromic DNA sequences denoted cAMP response elements (CRE, TGACGTCA) as well as the 5′-TGAC half-sites of this palindrome, both of which are highly conserved within numerous promoters of eukaryotic genes (6Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular cAMP levels stimulate a multitude of kinases, e.g. calmodulin kinase IV, that subsequently phosphorylate and thereby activate CREM (7Juang Y.T. Wang Y. Solomou E.E. Li Y. Mawrin C. Tenbrock K. Kyttaris V.C. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our group have provided evidence that CREMα expression is increased in T cells from SLE patients (8Kyttaris V.C. Wang Y. Juang Y.T. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. Lupus. 2006; 15: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have shown that CREMα binds to the −180 site of the IL-2 promoter in SLE T cells and thereby suppresses IL-2 production in these cells. Decreased IL-2 levels render SLE patients more susceptible to infections (9Iliopoulos A.G. Tsokos G.C. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 25: 318-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In turn, suppression of CREMα expression in SLE T cells by introducing a plasmid encoding antisense CREMα into these cells sufficiently restores their IL-2 content and normalizes effector cell function (10Tenbrock K. Juang Y.T. Gourley M.F. Nambiar M.P. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4147-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transcriptional down-regulation of T cell receptor ζ chain by CREMα binding to the corresponding promoter contributes to the structural abnormalities of the CD3 complex in SLE T cells. Because CREMα also represses transcription of the AP-1 family member c-fos, it limits the activity of this transcription enhancer family and thereby indirectly contributes to the defective IL-2 production in SLE T cells (2Tenbrock K. Juang Y.T. Kyttaris V.C. Tsokos G.C. Rheumatology. 2007; 46: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The CREM gene was initially isolated almost 20 years ago and comprises multiple exons (11Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Since that time, a large number of different CREM isoforms has been identified, and the composition of the individual exons in these isoforms determines the functional propensities, e.g. whether they act as transcriptional activators or repressors (12Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to CREB, expression and activity of the various CREM isoforms are finely regulated, not only post-transcriptionally, but also at the level of gene transcription. The CREM gene contains at least two distinct functional promoters. The inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms of the CREM family are transcriptionally controlled through the intronic ICER promoter (11Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). ICER inducibility is highly cell type-specific, and its kinetics is characteristic of the early response genes. So, for example, ICER expression peaks rapidly upon stimulation with corticotrophin-releasing hormone in pituitary gland cells (13Della Fazia M.A. Servillo G. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CREM promoter located at the 5′-end of the CREM gene regulates transcription of the other CREM isoforms and was initially thought to be constitutively activated as expression of most CREM isoforms is ubiquitous and not inducible. However, because we found an increased amount of the transcriptional repressor CREMα mRNA in T cells from patients with SLE compared with healthy individuals (8Kyttaris V.C. Wang Y. Juang Y.T. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. Lupus. 2006; 15: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) we asked whether elevated CREMα mRNA levels may represent the result of enhanced transcriptional activation through the CREM promoter in these cells and what key factors may be involved in CREM gene transcription. All SLE patients included in our studies were diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria (14Hochberg M.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8992) Google Scholar) and were recruited from the Division of Rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, and the Department of Medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD. All 12 SLE patients included in the CREM promoter assessment (as depicted in Fig. 2) were females at a median age of 36.5 years (range 22–62 years), four were of black ethnicity, and two were African-Americans. Six patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases as well as healthy individuals were chosen as controls. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all involved institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. Peripheral venous blood was collected in heparin-lithium tubes, and T cells were purified as described before (8Kyttaris V.C. Wang Y. Juang Y.T. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. Lupus. 2006; 15: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter plasmids driven by serially truncated CREM promoters were generated using pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences for the PCR primers used to amplify different regions of CREM promoters linked to restriction sites of KpnI (forward primers) and NheI (reverse primer) were as follows: CREM-400 forward, 5′-tttggtaccaccctgaagacctgacaa-3′; CREM-500 forward, 5′-tttggtaccggggagatagaggttgcag-3′; CREM-800 forward, 5′-tttggtaccgaagtgttgggattacaggc-3′; CREM-1000 forward, 5′-tttggtacccccaactagctgggactac-3′; CREM-reverse, 5′-tttgctagcgaccaaaagtagcgctgcag-3′. Amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pGL3-Basic vector. Site-directed mutagenesis at the SP-1 binding site denoted −468 (CREM-500mut) was generated using a targeting primer with the following sequence: 5′-gcagagagccgagattacgaaactgcagcccagcctgg-3′. Expression vectors for PP2A and PP2A mutant were kindly provided by B.A. Hemmings (Basel, Switzerland (15Evans D.R. Myles T. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24038-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). The following plasmids were purchased: pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pORF9-hSP1 (Invivogen, San Diego, CA). All plasmid preparations were performed using the Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Three million T cells were transfected with a total of 3 μg of the indicated plasmids and 10 ng of Renilla control vector by an Amaxa transfection system (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). Whenever an effector:reporter co-transfection was performed, the molar ratio between the two was 3:1. Five hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed, and luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual Luciferase Assay system (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Transfection efficiency was quantified by measurement of Renilla enzyme activity. Each effector:reporter transfection experiment was repeated at least three times, and values in the bar diagrams are given as mean ± S.E. Total RNA was isolated from three million T cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Residual genomic DNA contamination was removed by using DNase I (Qiagen). Sequences for PCR primers were as follows: CREM forward, 5′-tcgcgaacttgggacga-3′; CREM reverse, 5′-ctgagctaaagcagggattg-3′; 18 S rRNA forward,: 5′-actcaacacgggaaacctca-3′; 18 S rRNA reverse, 5′-aaccagacaaatcgctccac-3′. Real-time PCR amplification of CREM was carried out using the same primers on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science), and threshold cycles (Ct) values were used to calculate relative mRNA expression by the ΔΔCt relative quantification method against 18 S rRNA expression. Five million T cells from individual subjects were collected and used for preparation of nuclear protein extracts as described before (16Solomou E.E. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5665-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA probes harboring the −468 SP-1 binding site within the CREM-500 promoter (5′-agagccgagaccacgccactgcagcccagcctggacagag-3′) were radiolabeled using a T4-polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 20 mm KCl, 15% Ficoll) containing 2–3 μg of nuclear protein and 1 μg of either poly(dI)·poly(dC) or poly(dG)·poly(dC) in a total volume of 20 μl. Electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described previously (16Solomou E.E. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5665-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Band intensities of protein·DNA complexes were quantified by OptiQuantTM software. For supershift assays, either 4 μg of monoclonal anti-SP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or an unrelated IgG were added to the binding reaction. Sequences for competition oligonucleotides were as follows: compwt (cold, unlabeled CREM-500 (−468) probe); compirrel forward, 5′-agatcaaatggaaaatcaag-3′ (derived from human IL17A promoter); compwt (unlabeled wild-type CREM-500 (−468) probe; compmut1 forward, 5′-agagccgagattacgaaactgcagcccagcctggacagag-3′; compmut2 forward, 5′-agagccgagaccacgccactgcagtttagcttggacagag-3′. ChIP analysis was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T cells (3 × 106/immunoprecipitating antibody) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, lysed, and sonicated. The protein·DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with either a polyclonal anti-SP-1 antibody (Abcam) or an isotype-matched control antibody (Abcam), subjected to a series of washing steps, reverse-cross-linked, and the protein was digested with proteinase K (Qiagen). The DNA was extracted by the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitated and purified DNA was analyzed by PCR using the following primers detecting the relevant sequence of the CREM promoter: forward, 5′-ggggagatagaggttgcag-3′; reverse, 5′-gaccaaaagtagcgctgcag-3′. The corresponding nonimmunoprecipitated DNA (input DNA) was also analyzed by the same method. Whole T cell lysates obtained from SLE patients and healthy controls were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting as described previously (17Moulton V.R. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12490-12496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated SP-1 protein was visualized using an anti-SP-1 antibody kindly provided by B. Kahn-Perles (Marseille, France (18Vicart A. Lefebvre T. Imbert J. Fernandez A. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) that specifically detects SP-1 phosphorylated at its serine 59. Total SP-1 protein was detected using a monoclonal anti-SP-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A polyclonal β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used to show equal protein loading. Band intensities were quantified by OptiQuantTM software. The paired two-tailed Student's t test and the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient r were used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. We generated luciferase reporter constructs containing serially truncated human CREM promoters ranging ∼400, 500, 800, or 1,000 bp from the transcription initiation site (as schematically depicted in Fig. 1B). T cells obtained from at least three pairs of SLE patients and healthy control individuals were transfected with these reporters. Luciferase activity for each reporter was calculated relative to the basal empty reporter activity (Fig. 1B). Activity of the CREM promoter spanning ∼500 bp, denoted CREM-500, was significantly elevated when introduced into SLE T cells compared with T cells from healthy individuals. (3.08 ± 1.90 versus 0.87 ± 0.33, p < 0.05). The activity of other CREM promoter constructs was much lower than that of the CREM-500 reporter, in both normal and SLE T cells. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in these constructs between normal and SLE T cells. We concluded that the CREM-500 promoter contains the crucial cis-regulatory elements mediating transcriptional CREM up-regulation in SLE T cells. We next increased the number of SLE patients and healthy controls to 12 individuals/group and included six patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (Fig. 2A). We purified T cells from these patients and transfected them with the CREM-500 reporter plasmid. The relative CREM-500 promoter activity level was significantly elevated in SLE T cells compared with T cells from healthy controls (3.54 ± 2.23 versus 1.51 ± 1.31, respectively, p < 0.05). In T cells from patients with other autoimmune diseases CREM-500 promoter activity was enhanced as well (2.16 ± 1.66); however, this was not significant compared with T cell from normal individuals (p = 0.39). As there was a fairly broad range of CREM-500 promoter activity levels among T cells from SLE patients, we addressed the question whether disease activity influences CREM promoter activation. Indeed, CREM-500 promoter activity levels correlate significantly with SLE disease activity indices of the respective patients (r = 0.87, p < 0.001, Fig. 2B). To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying CREM-500 promoter activation in SLE T cells we analyzed the promoter sequence with particular focus on those nucleotides that are different between the CREM-500 and CREM-400 construct because the latter did not show any inducibility in SLE T cells (as shown in Fig. 1A). Within this sequence we identified a DNA motif that shares high similarity to the consensus binding site of a transcription factor denoted SP-1 (Fig. 3A). To test whether SP-1 protein participates in the nucleocomplex formation of the proteins bound to this portion of the CREM promoter we performed DNA-binding assays with nuclear T cell extracts and a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide harboring this element. The latter was denoted CREM-500 (−468) because the identified sequence (-ccacggc-) starts 468 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. As can be seen in Fig. 3B (lane 2), addition of an SP-1-specific antibody to the binding reaction decreased the intensity of one particular band (indicated by an arrow) whereas inclusion of an unrelated antibody had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Next, we set out to confirm this finding by competition assays including the unlabeled wild-type (compwt) and an irrelevant (compirrel) probe at a 10- and 50-fold molar excess, respectively. The detected complex was not affected by inclusion of the irrelevant competitor but completely abrogated by the cold wild-type probe (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–5). To prove more specifically that SP-1 binds to this site we extended our competition assays by inclusion of two oligonucleotides, one of which was mutated at the predicted −468 site (compmut1) and the other one mutated at an adjacent position (compmut2). As expected, inclusion of the first one did not significantly alter band intensity whereas the latter one decreased band intensity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, lanes 6–9). Taken together, these DNA-binding analyses indicate that endogenous SP-1 protein specifically interacts with the −468 site within the CREM promoter and participates in the complexes observed with nuclear protein extracts from human T cells. We next determined the trans-regulatory capacities of SP-1 on the CREM promoter using the wild-type CREM-500 luciferase reporter and a CREM-500 plasmid containing a −468 site mutation (Fig. 3D). Human T cells were transiently co-transfected with the respective promoter constructs and either pCDNA3 vector or an expression plasmid encoding SP-1 and subsequently assayed for luciferase activity. Notably, SP-1 significantly trans-activated the CREM-500 promoter (2.00 ± 0.24; p < 0.05), most likely through its binding to the −468 site as mutation at this site renders the CREM-500 reporter not inducible by SP-1 (1.13 ± 0.31; p = 0.69). After we identified SP-1 as a transcriptional regulator at the −468 site within the CREM promoter we next wanted to clarify whether there is a difference in the binding affinity of endogenous SP-1 protein to this sequence between nucleoprotein from SLE patients and normal individuals. Therefore, we obtained T cell nucleoprotein lysates from 11 SLE patients and 8 controls and performed EMSAs using the CREM-500 (−468) oligonucleotide as a probe (Fig. 4A). Indeed, using SLE T cell nucleoprotein resulted in a significantly stronger band intensity of the specific protein·DNA complex (1.52 ± 0.25; p < 0.05) than using nucleoprotein from control T cells. ChIP analyses were performed in normal and SLE T cell samples (n = 2) using a polyclonal SP-1 antibody. Results from these experiments confirmed the EMSA data and indicate increased SP-1 binding to the CREM promoter in SLE T cells in vivo (a representative result of the ChIP is shown in Fig. 4B). SP-1 function is highly dependent on its phosphorylation status, and its serine 59 has been identified as a major target for phosphatase PP2A during cell cycle interphase (18Vicart A. Lefebvre T. Imbert J. Fernandez A. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because we already proved that SP-1 by itself trans-activates CREM-500 promoter (see Fig. 3D), we next asked whether addition of PP2A to this reaction can further increase CREM-500 activation. Human T cells were transfected with the wild-type CREM-500 promoter construct or its mutant CREM-500mut as well as the SP-1-encoding plasmid with and without overexpression of PP2A (Fig. 5A). Inclusion of PP2A enhanced trans-activational capacity of SP-1 on the CREM-500 promoter (1.60 ± 0.26, p < 0.05). As expected, there was no activation of the CREM-500mut reporter (0.69 ± 0.16, p = 0.13). This transcriptional effect was confirmed at the mRNA level using T cells transfected with either SP-1, PP2A, or both expression plasmids (Fig. 5B). Co-expression of SP-1 and its activating phosphatase PP2A yielded a robust 40.5-fold increase of CREM mRNA as quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 5B, bar diagram). Specificity of PP2A effect was further substantiated by using a PP2A construct unable to dephosphorylate substrates due to a site-directed mutation within its active enzymatic domain (15Evans D.R. Myles T. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24038-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This defective PP2A protein was not able to increase SP-1 effect on the wild-type CREM-500 promoter (Fig. 5C). We have previously reported that the PP2A protein amount is increased in T cells from lupus patients to a degree that reflects the respective SLE disease activity status (19Katsiari C.G. Kyttaris V.C. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3193-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PP2A is known to activate specifically SP-1 through dephosphorylation at its serine residue 59. Accordingly, we set out to determine the phosphorylation status of SP-1 protein at Ser59 in SLE T cells versus normal T cells (Fig. 5D). We analyzed nucleoprotein lysates obtained from eight lupus T cell and five normal T cell samples by Western blotting using antibodies against either Ser59-phosphorylated SP-1 or total SP-1 protein. Fig. 5D shows representative results from two normal and two lupus T cell analyses. Densitometry of the respective band intensities of all samples demonstrated a significantly lower ratio of Ser(P)59 SP-1 over total SP-1 protein in T cells from lupus patients compared with normal T cells (0.30 ± 0.18, n = 8 versus 0.76 ± 0.32, n = 5; p < 0.05). This supports the hypothesis that increased PP2A amounts in SLE T cells mediate Ser59 dephosphorylation and thus functional activation of SP-1. In this paper we present evidence that increased expression of the transcriptional repressor CREMα in T cells from SLE patients is due to enhanced activity of the CREM promoter. We show that PP2A, which is also known to be up-regulated in SLE T cells, mediates dephosphorylation and thereby activation of transcription factor SP-1. SP-1 directly binds and trans-activates the CREM promoter. Moreover, CREM promoter activity levels significantly reflect disease activity in SLE patients. We reported previously on CREMα overexpression in SLE T cells (8Kyttaris V.C. Wang Y. Juang Y.T. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. Lupus. 2006; 15: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Increased CREMα levels account for suppressed expression of a multitude of T cell-related genes, including IL-2 and T cell receptor ζ chain (3Solomou E.E. Juang Y.T. Gourley M.F. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4216-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Tenbrock K. Kyttaris V.C. Ahlmann M. Ehrchen J.M. Tolnay M. Melkonyan H. Mawrin C. Roth J. Sorg C. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IL-2 has well been demonstrated to be important in 1) the generation and function of T regulatory cells, 2) activation-induced cell death, and 3) the generation of cytotoxic cells that are necessary for the defense against infections (20Lieberman L.A. Tsokos G.C. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We found that increased transcription activity, as assayed by CREM promoter activity, is responsible for the increased CREM expression in SLE patients. Notably, our analyses displayed a statistically strong correlation between the CREM promoter activity levels and SLE disease activity indices, which are a marker of disease activity capturing both clinical and laboratory manifestations in SLE patients. This result indicates that modulating CREM expression may be beneficial for the control of autoimmune processes and inflammation in SLE patients. Furthermore, CREM promoter activity represents a new candidate biomarker for lupus disease activity. Longitudinal studies need to be conducted to define the temporal relationship between CREM promoter activity and clinical activity. In contrast to most biomarker studies that assay candidate molecules on either mRNA or protein expression level, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to utilize the promoter activity of a gene as read-out system. Replacement of the luciferase gene by a GFP-encoding sequence should allow for an easier assessment of CREM promoter activity. Our current study points to protein phosphatase PP2A as a key player in the CREMα up-regulation in SLE T cells. We demonstrated previously that expression levels of PP2A are increased in SLE T cells. In addition, higher PP2A expression levels are present in patients with higher disease activity. This finding complements our previous results in which we showed that PP2A mediates dephosphorylation of p-CREB, which contributes to the defective production of IL-2 in SLE T cells (19Katsiari C.G. Kyttaris V.C. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3193-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both CREB and CREM are members of the basic domain/leucine zipper domain proteins transcription factor family, although their transcriptional effects on IL-2 regulation are antithetic. Thus, PP2A employs two distinct mechanisms to suppress IL-2 expression in SLE patients: activating a suppressor (CREMα) and concurrently suppressing an activator (p-CREB). Similar mechanisms may also take place in the abnormal expression of other genes in SLE T cells as >3000 genes encode the CRE site on their promoters (5Kyttaris V.C. Juang Y.T. Tenbrock K. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Transcription factor SP-1 is ubiquitously expressed in numerous cell types, and its binding site is present in the promoter of most genes. A closer analysis of the core region of the human CREM promoter revealed at least six sites highly homologous to the consensus SP-1 binding site. Interestingly, our studies indicate that SP-1 binding to one of these sites (at position −468 relative to the transcription initiation site) is responsible for transcriptional activation of the CREM promoter and thus for increased CREM expression in primary human T cells. At this point, we cannot exclude that other SP-1 sites may also become functional for CREM expression in a different context such as different cell development stages. SP-1 function is highly regulated through a number of post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation occurring at multiple serine and threonine residues; however, only serine 59 is specifically dephosphorylated by PP2A (18Vicart A. Lefebvre T. Imbert J. Fernandez A. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This finding corroborates with our previous results that expression of PP2A was increased in SLE T cells and the current finding that nuclear SP-1 protein phosphorylated at serine 59 is decreased in SLE T cells whereas cellular amounts of total SP-1 protein are comparable between T cells from lupus patients and healthy individuals. It was shown previously that dephosphorylation of SP-1 increased its affinity to DNA whereby this enhanced its transcriptional activity. In addition to phosphorylation, O-linked glycosylation has also been reported to regulate the SP-1 activity. Whether O-linked glycosylation is also involved in the PP2A-mediated SP-1 effects on the human CREM promoter deserves further investigation as reciprocal phosphorylation and O-linked glycosylation are common mechanisms regulating the activity of a number of intracellular proteins. Dysregulated function of T cells is central to the disordered immune system in SLE patients. The presented characterization of PP2A > SP-1 > CREM signaling pathway (Fig. 6) unravels another key component of lupus T cell abnormalities and extends our understanding of the pathogenic potential of SLE T cells."

We show that the neuroprotective drug riluzole increased the amount of HSF1 in NG108-15 neuroprogenitor cells by slowing the specific turnover of HSF1 and supporting a more robust and sustained activation of HSF1. Using Hsp70-luciferase as a functional readout of the activity of HSF1, we show that riluzole amplified the heat shock induction of the reporter gene with an optimal increase at 1 μm. Immunocytochemical staining and Western blot quantitation of HSP70 in NG108-15 neuroprogenitor cells and embryonic spinal cord neurons provided corroborative evidence that riluzole amplified the HSF1-dependent regulation of HSP70 expression. Parallel studies on the GLT1 glutamate transporter showed that riluzole increased GLT1-reporter and GLT1 protein expression and that the increase was enhanced by heat shock and coincident with the increased expression of HSP70 and HSP90. This result is consistent with the anti-glutamatergic profile of riluzole and the presence of multiple heat shock elements on the GLT1 gene promoter, suggesting that riluzole may modulate GLT1 expression through HSF1. The increased HSP chaperones and GLT1 transporter blunted glutamate-induced and N-methyl d-aspartate receptor-mediated excitotoxic death.

Induction of the heat shock response (HSR 2The abbreviations used are: HSRheat shock responseHSPheat shock proteinALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisANOVAanalysis of varianceRIPAradioimmunoprecipitation assayHSEheat shock elementSCNspinal cord neuron. ; also known as stress response) is a universally important quality control mechanism in protein homeostasis; it is a primary and evolutionarily conserved response to diverse stressors, mediated by activation of the HSF1 transcription factor, culminating in the induction of a family of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that function as chaperones to assist in the proper folding of non-native proteins and proteases to help in the degradation of damaged proteins for the protection and recovery from cellular damages (1Morimoto R.I.

We are interested in harnessing the cytoprotective activity of HSR/HSF1 to promote cell survival under stress. In particular, we are interested in identifying agents that are not overtly proteotoxic and would not by themselves induce a robust HSR but would amplify the HSR and enhance the expression of HSPs. Riluzole is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for ALS. The mode of action appears to be antiglutamatergic, but the detailed mechanism is not clear as some other anti-glutamate drugs that have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of ALS (11Nirmalananthan N. Greensmith L. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2005; 18: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In a previous study on HeLa cells, we showed that riluzole increases the amount of HSF1 for cytoprotection (12Yang J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we present results of the effect of riluzole on HSF1 in neuronal cell systems and show that in addition to boosting expression of HSPs, HSF1 may mediate the induction of GLT1 glutamate transporter. The increased HSPs and GLT1 support neuronal cell survival under stress. Riluzole was obtained from Sigma and AB Chem Technologies. Both sources of riluzole gave similar results, although the Sigma compound appeared to have a greater cytotoxic effect at concentrations >10 μm. The Hsp70-firefly luciferase reporter gene construct was as described previously (13Khalil S. Luciano J. Chen W. Liu A.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The human GLT1-firefly luciferase was a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein, The Johns Hopkins Medical School, and it was constructed by inserting a 2472-bp human GLT1 promoter into the KpnI/HindIII site of the pGL4 luciferase reporter vector from Promega (14Rothstein J.D.

Humanized Renilla DNA (phRLSV40), Dual-Glo® luciferase assay reagent (E2920), CellTiter-Glo® (G7571), and Caspase-Glo®3/7 (G8091) assay reagents were from Promega. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against HSF1, either the RTG88 antibody (1:10,000 dilution) that we generated against a recombinant histidine-tagged human HSF1 protein (12Yang J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Oza J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. Brain Res. 2008; 1203: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (1:1000 dilution; catalog no. 4356), was used in immuno-Western blot detection and quantitation of HSF1. Other antibodies used include a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the heat-inducible HSP72 protein (1:10,000 for Western blot and 1:200 for immunocytochemistry; catalog no. SPA812, StressGen), a rabbit monoclonal antibody against HSP90 (Cell Signaling 4877), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GLT1 (also known as EAAT2; catalog no. sc-15317, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a mouse monoclonal antibody against EAAT2 (catalog no. ab61859, Abcam). The composition of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer for cell extract preparation was as follows: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. [35S]Methionine/cysteine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (NEG7720). All other biochemical and chemicals were of molecular biology or reagent grade. The NG108-15 and N2a cell lines were used as neuroprogenitor cell models as these cells can differentiate into neuron-like cells and acquire neuron-specific phenotypes, including voltage-gated sodium channels and the ability to synapse with co-cultured muscle cells (15Yang J.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.). Cells were subcultured at or near confluency by minimal trypsinization (0.25% trypsin; Mediatech Inc.) and dispersion into single cell suspension in new growth medium and plating onto new growing surfaces. To induce neuronal differentiation, cells were plated into DMEM containing 2% FBS supplemented with 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (15Yang J. Oza J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y.

Unless indicated otherwise, cells in early stationary phase of growth were used as follows: confluent undifferentiated cells or differentiated cells 2–3 days after dibutyryl cAMP treatment. Primary embryonic spinal cord neuron cultures were prepared as described (18Du Y. Chen C.P. Tseng C.Y. Eisenberg Y. Firestein B.L. Glia. 2007; 55: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, spinal cords were dissected from embryonic day 16 (E16) rat embryos. Meninges were removed, and tissues were dissociated with gentle trituration. Cells were plated at a density of 60,000–100,000 neurons/cm2 in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27, penicillin, and streptomycin. Experiments were done using neurons at 7–10 days in vitro. For riluzole treatment, a 100 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was serially diluted with either Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline or DMEM to a 10× working stock and added to cell culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for the time indicated. An equivalent volume of the vehicle was added to the control. Unless indicated otherwise, heat shock was at 42 °C for a specified time period beginning at 12–18 h after the addition of riluzole. Cells were either harvested immediately after heat shock for Western blot detection of HSF1 or allowed to recover at 37 °C for time periods indicated for analysis of the induction of Hsp70-firefly luciferase reporter gene and HSP70/HSP90/GLT1 protein expression. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and extracts were prepared using either RIPA buffer or lysed and solubilized directly and completely in a 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For Western blot, aliquots of the cell extracts containing the same amount protein (∼10 μg/lane) were size-fractionated using an 8 or a 6–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins on the gel were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Western blot detection of HSF1 and HSP70 was done as described previously (12Yang J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Oza J.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2008; 13: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Detection of the HSP90 protein was performed using a rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; catalog no. 4877, Cell Signaling). GLT1 was probed with either sc-15317 (1:200 dilution; SCBT) or ab61859 (1:500 dilution; Abcam); both gave similar results, although the Abcam antibody gave a lower background. To affirm even loading of protein, membrane was co-probed for actin (42 kDa) or Sirt1 (110 kDa), and select PVDF membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue after Western blot detection. For immunocytochemical staining of the 72-kDa heat-inducible HSP70, we used SPA-812 rabbit polyclonal antibody from StressGen at 1:200 dilution and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were viewed using a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope, and images were captured with a SPOT camera system (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). NG108-15 cells were labeled with 300 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Amersham Biosciences Pro-Mix, a 70:30% mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine) for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of this labeling period, cells were rinsed extensively and refurbished with DMEM containing 2 mm each of cysteine and methionine to initiate chase. To test for the effects of riluzole on the turnover of 35S-labeled HSF1, it was added to designated plates to a final concentration of 2 μm at the beginning of the chase. Cells were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after initiation of the chase in the absence versus the presence of 2 μm riluzole. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of RIPA buffer, and an aliquot (∼50 μl) of the RIPA extract was used for the immunoprecipitation of HSF1. For this, anti-HSF1 antibody was added to the cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antigen-antibody complex was precipitated by the addition of insoluble protein A and incubation at 25 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed three times each with 200 μl of RIPA buffer. The amount of radioactivity present in the immunoprecipitate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical analysis was by one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad InStat program, with p > 0.05 as not significant, between 0.01 and 0.05 as significant, and <0.01 being highly significant. To assess turnover of total cellular protein, cells were labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were then rinsed extensively and refurbished with DMEM containing 2 mm each of cysteine and methionine to initiate the chase. To test for the effects of riluzole on the turnover/decay of the 35S-labeled cellular proteins, it was added to designated plates to a final concentration of 2 μm at the beginning of the chase. Aliquots (in quadruplicate) of the cell culture medium were removed at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after initiation of the chase, and the amount of trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity was determined according to published methods (19Auteri J.S. Okada A. Bochaki V. Dice J.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The two reporter genes used in this study are Hsp70-firefly luciferase and GLT1-firefly luciferase. Reporter gene activity was assayed using standard transient transfection protocol; the reporter DNA was transfected along with the internal control of phRLSV40 (synthetic humanized Renilla luciferase DNA). Unless indicated otherwise, freshly plated 80–90% confluent cells were used, and the amount of each DNA was 0.5 μg/35-mm plate or 1.5 μg/60-mm plate, and the amount of Lipofectamine 2000 (in μl) was three times that of the total amount of DNA (in micrograms). 6 h after DNA transfection, cells were trypsinized and aliquoted into individual wells of a 96 StripwellTM plate (Corning/Costar 9102); these identically transfected cells allowed for testing of the effects of riluzole and heat shock on reporter gene expression. To evaluate the effects of heat shock on reporter gene activity, strips of eight wells or designated wells of cells were placed in a 42 °C incubator for 2 h followed by recovery at 37 °C for 4 h (or as indicated otherwise) prior to harvesting. Riluzole, when used, was added 16 h prior to heat shock unless indicated otherwise. Result is the average ± S.D. of four separate determinations from the same pool of transfected cells. Within each experiment, the reporter gene signal was tight with an ∼10% sample-to-sample variation. Between experiments, there is a range in the magnitude of heat shock induction of reporter gene activity as we have previously reported for the hsp70-reporter (heat shock/control from 20- to >100-fold) (12Yang J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Oza J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y.

Variation in the basal HSF1 activity (20Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and differences in the cell status (confluency, days in culture, etc.) likely contributed to this variation. The Dual-Glo® luciferase assay reagent system from Promega (E2920) was used to assay for first the firefly and then the Renilla luciferase activity according to manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor 2 multiplate reader equipped with dual injectors. Where indicated, results of the Hsp70-firefly luciferase activity (in relative luminescence units) was normalized against that of the Renilla luciferase (relative luminescence units), and to facilitate comparison across experiments for statistical analysis across experiments, this ratio was set at 1 for the control (without heat shock or riluzole treatment). By normalizing the Hsp70-firefly luciferase activity against that of the Renilla luciferase internal control, we effectively negated experimental variables such as differences in cell number, as well as nonselective effects of the treatment conditions/reagents on gene expression. Cells in 96-well plates were used. Riluzole was added to individual wells to final concentrations as indicated and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. For conditioning heat shock, designated strips/wells of cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 2 h followed by recovery at 37 °C for 8 h. To test for cell survival under conditions of glutamatergic challenge, specified concentrations of glutamate along with 50 μm glycine was added to designated wells and incubated at 37 °C for 12–24 h prior to microscopic assessment of cell morphology and assay for cell viability. The N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 (21Wong E.H. Kemp J.A. Priestley T. Knight A.R. Woodruff G.N. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 7104-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), when used, was added to a final concentration of 1 μm at 60 min prior to the addition of glutamate and glycine to the cells. Viability of the cells was determined using the CellTiter-Glo® (G7571, Promega) (13Khalil S. Luciano J. Chen W. Liu A.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The result on cell viability signal of three independent measurements was averaged and normalized against that of the untreated control of 100%. Quantitation of HSP70 staining intensity was done by ImageJ. The mean staining intensity of 30–40 representative cells was scored and averaged, and the result of this ± S.D. is shown. Student's t test was for unpaired data assuming equal variance and two-tailed distribution. For quantitation of protein band intensity on Western blot, the integrated density of specified protein bands determined by the ImageJ program was used. Statistical analysis of the significance of a specific treatment, e.g. effect of riluzole or heat shock on HSF1 or GLT1, was done by paired Student's t test with two-tailed distribution. Repeated measures of ANOVA was done using the GraphPad Instat statistical analysis program. We have also used the ratio t test method to assess the significance of difference between paired samples, e.g. HSF1 intensity without versus with riluzole treatment. For this, the paired t test of the logarithms of integrated densities of specified protein bands was performed using the GraphPad InStat statistical analysis program. An example of this is included in supplemental Fig. 1. Statistical analysis of reporter gene and cell viability was done using Student's t test (paired and unpaired as indicated) assuming equal variance and two-tailed distribution. The calculated probability of difference p > 0.05 is defined as not significant, between 0.01 and 0.05 as significant (*), <0.01 as very significant (**), and <0.001 as extremely significant (***). Induction of the HSR is mediated by activation of the HSF1 transcription factor; stress acutely converts the constitutively expressed dormant, monomeric HSF1 in the cytosol to a nuclearly localized, post-translationally modified HSF1 trimer that binds and transactivates the heat shock genes (22Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar). We used immuno-Western blot techniques to evaluate the effects of riluzole on the expression and duration of activation of HSF1 in NG108-15 cells. As seen in Fig. 1A, heat shock at 42 °C promoted the activation and post-translational modification of HSF1, as indicated by the upward mobility shift of HSF1 in SDS-gel electrophoresis (“supershift”); this activation was transient such that after 5 or 7 h of heat shock little HSF1 signal could be detected (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Whether this was due to degradation, modification, and/or sequestration of HSF1 into entities not readily extractable or detectable by the methods used was not entirely clear. Previous studies showed that heat shock promoted the sequestration of HSF1 into subnuclear structures known as stress granules, and this HSF1 was extractable with Triton X-100 (24Cotto J. Fox S. Morimoto R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jolly C. Morimoto R. Robert-Nicoud M. Vourc'h C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2935-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jolly C. Usson Y. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6769-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 1.5 μm riluzole for 16 h at 37 °C increased the amount of latent HSF1 (compare lanes 1 versus 6 of Fig. 1A, lanes 1 versus lane 2 of B) and supported a sustained activation of HSF1, which remained supershifted after 7 h of heat shock at 42 °C, the longest time point examined (Fig. 1A, lanes 7–10). This effect of riluzole was dose-dependent as preincubation of cells with increasing concentrations of riluzole supported a sustained (>5 h) activation of HSF1 with an optimal effect observed at ∼1 μm (Fig. 1B). The effect of riluzole of increasing the HSF1 reserve was reproducible over the course of a 2-year study. Statistical analysis of the significance of difference in the abundance of HSF1 of control versus riluzole-treated neuroprogenitor cells of 10 independent measurements is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. The calculated p value associated with a Student's paired t test with a two-tailed distribution was <0.001 (extremely significant difference) with an average of 1.86 ± 0.399-fold increase in HSF1 in the riluzole-treated samples over that of the untreated controls. A similar p value of <0.001 was obtained using the ratio t test method to gauge the significance of difference between control and riluzole-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 1). The combined effect of an increase in the amount of latent HSF1 (HSF1 reserve) and a more sustained activation of HSF1 allowed for more robust induction of HSPs. In Fig. 1C, we show that riluzole gave a dose-dependent enhancement in induction of the 72-kDa HSP70 protein by heat shock. At the optimal concentration of 1 μm, riluzole boosted the heat shock induction of HSP70 by ∼2 times. Although the level of HSP70 in the control 37 °C samples was low when compared with that of the heat-shocked samples, we show in Fig. 1C, with a darker film exposure, an effect of riluzole in increasing the amount of HSP70 in cells maintained at 37 °C. The effect of riluzole on HSF1 could be due to either an increase in the expression or a decrease in the turnover of HSF1. A previous study from our laboratory suggests that riluzole has little effect on the transcription and abundance of the mRNAhsf1 (12Yang J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We evaluated the effect of riluzole treatment on the turnover/degradation of HSF1 and total/long lived cellular proteins using a “pulse-chase” protocol where proteins were first labeled with [35S]methionine followed by removal of the radioactivity and “chase” of the 35S-labeled protein in the absence and presence of riluzole. Samples were harvested, and HSF1 was immunoprecipitated at various times after the beginning of chase. In Fig. 2A, we showed that riluzole had a statistically significant effect in slowing the rate of decay of 35S-labeled HSF1 at the 12-h (p between 0.01 and 0.05) and 24-h (p < 0.01) time points of chase. The fractional rate of decay of HSF1 (Kd = 2.303(a/b)) was calculated to be 0.041 and 0.014/h for the control and riluzole-treated NG108-15 cells at the early stationary phase of growth. This result suggests that riluzole slowed the turnover of HSF1 to increase the steady state level of the protein. Importantly, riluzole and chloroquine had different effects on the turnover of long lived cellular proteins (Fig. 2B). Chloroquine had a statistically significant effect in blunting (p < 0.1) the time-dependent protein turnover as assessed by the release/conversion of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 35S-labeled proteins in cells into trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the cell culture medium, whereas riluzole had no significant effect at 2, 4, and 6 h of chase and had a small but statistically significant effect at 24 h when compared with that of the untreated control, suggesting that the mode of action of riluzole is different from bulk inhibition of lysosome function by chloroquine. To assess the functionality of the increased HSF1, we determined the effects of riluzole on Hsp70 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiated NG108-15 cells incubated under basal (37 °C) and heat shock (42 °C) conditions. Preincubation of the cells with riluzole for 16 h at 37 °C followed by heat shock gave a riluzole dose-dependent enhancement of the heat shock induction of Hsp70-firefly luciferase reporter gene expression (Fig. 3, A and B). At the optimal riluzole concentration of 1–2 μm, the heat shock-induced Hsp70-reporter gene activity was ∼2 times higher than that of heat shock alone (without riluzole). Concentrations of riluzole >10 μm caused a significant drop in the Hsp70-reporter gene activity, suggesting cytotoxic effects, and this was later validated in cell viability assay. For subsequent experiments, we set 10 μm as the highest concentration of riluzole used. Analysis of the effects of riluzole on the basal level of expression of Hsp70-luciferase (i.e. 37 °C; inset of Fig. 3B, open and closed circles for undifferentiated and differentiated NG108-15 cells, respectively) revealed a qualitatively similar effect both in terms of the optimal concentration of riluzole (∼1–2 μm) and fold of enhancement. Repeated measures ANOVA of the four groups of data gave p < 0.0001 indicating extremely significant differences. Results presented in our previous study show that both the basal (37 °C) and the induced (42 °C) reporter gene expression requires a functional HSF1 as genetic ablation of the hsf1 gene voided both (12Yang J. Bridges K. Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The effect of riluzole in boosting Hsp70-reporter gene expression required preincubation because the addition of riluzole immediately prior to heat shock had little or no effect (see supplemental Fig. 2). We note that a minimal preincubation period of 4 h with riluzole was"

CCL5 has been shown to play important roles in T cell proliferation, IFN-γ, and IL-2 production, which promotes the differentiation and proliferation of Th1 cells important for immune defense against intracellular infection. In this study we found that tumor-bearing mice were more susceptible to bacterial infection and showed reduced CCL5 levels in serum during endotoxic shock. Our data further demonstrated that the soluble factors secreted by mammary gland tumor cells but not normal mammary gland epithelial cells inhibited CCL5 expression in macrophages in response to LPS, but not to TNF-α stimulation. The inhibitory effect of tumor-secreted molecules on LPS-induced CCL5 expression was regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Blocking PGE2 synthesis by NS398 or through the use of PGE2 receptor antagonists AH-6809 (EP2 antagonist) and AH-23848 (EP4 antagonist) completely reversed the inhibitory effect of tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) on LPS-induced CCL5 expression. Moreover, PGE2 and the cAMP analog forskolin could mimic tumor-mediated CCL5 inhibition, and the inhibitory effects of TCM, PGE2, and cAMP analog on LPS-induced CCL5 expression could be completely reversed by the PKA inhibitor H89. Furthermore, blocking PGE2 synthesis in vivo led to partial recovery of CCL5 production during endotoxic shock. Taken together, our data indicate that PGE2 secreted from breast cancer cells suppresses CCL5 secretion in LPS-activated macrophages through a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which may result in suppression of host immune responses against subsequent bacterial infection.

Solid tumors consist of both tumor and stromal cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix. The interactions between tumor cells and host cells through cytokines, chemokines, lipid molecules, and other factors create a unique microenvironment, which is favorable for tumor progression. Tumor-mediated immune suppression is a general phenomenon in cancer patients, which can be mediated via multiple mechanisms such as tumor-secreted IL-10, TGF-β, and PGE2; induction of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells or through the inhibition of CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ effector T cells (1Nicolini A. Carpi A. Med. Res. Rev. 2009; 29: 436-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Chemokines are small soluble molecules that are best known for their potent abilities to induce cellular migration, particularly by leukocytes, during inflammation and infection (2Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar, 3Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 4Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Migration of leukocytes to the sites of infection is a critical step for initiating a proper immune response against invading pathogens. Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES, CCL5) is a member of the CC chemokine family which also includes monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and I-309. CCL5 was originally discovered by subtractive hybridization in T cells but not in B cells and is expressed in platelets, macrophages, tubular epithelium, synovial fibroblasts, as well as select tumor cells (5Schall T.J. Jongstra J. Dyer B.J. Jorgensen J. Clayberger C. Davis M.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar). CCL5 plays an essential role in inflammation by recruiting T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, NK cells, mast cells, and basophils to the sites of inflammation and infection (6Appay V. Rowland-Jones S.L. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 7Levy J.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 3945-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been reported that CCL5 could activate macrophages to kill Trypanosoma cruzi through the induction of nitric oxide (8Lin P. Buxton J.A. Acheson A. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Channon K.M. Hale L.P. Dewhirst M.W. George S.E. Peters K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8829-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 9Villalta F. Zhang Y.

Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Paine 3rd, R. Greenberger M.J. Danforth J.M. Burdick M.D. Standiford T.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1900-1908PubMed Google Scholar). CCL5 levels inversely correlated with the APACHE (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation) II score predicting poor outcomes (11Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. Fitting C. Adrie C. Payen D. Scand J. Infect Dis. 2003; 35: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Besides its role as a potent chemoattractant, CCL5 plays an important role in T cell responses by facilitating the differentiation and proliferation of Th1 cells, inducing CD8 T cell responses (12Schrum S. Probst P. Fleischer B. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3598-3604PubMed Google Scholar, 13Siveke J.T. Hamann A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 550-554PubMed Google Scholar, 14Makino Y. Cook D.N.

Scheffold A. Rolph M.S. Huser M.B. Kaufmann S.H. Radbruch A. Flesch I.E. Kroczek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, production of CCL5 is important for inducing proper immune responses against infection. 4T1 is a tumor cell line isolated from a single spontaneously arising mammary tumor from a Balb/BfC3H mouse (murine mammary tumor virus, MMTV+) (16Miller F.R. Miller B.E. Heppner G.H. Invasion Metastasis. 1983; 33: 22-31Google Scholar). It is an excellent model for breast cancer research because 4T1 tumor development is well characterized both oncologically and immunologically (17Pulaski B.A. Ostrand-Rosenberg S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1486-1493PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor growth and metastatic spread of 4T1 cells closely mimics stage IV breast cancer (18Mi Z. Guo H. Wai P.Y. Gao C. Wei J. Kuo P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46659-46667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 4T1 tumors spontaneously metastasize to a variety of target organs, including the lungs, heart, bone, brain and liver (19Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Research. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the unique characteristics of 4T1 tumor, this model has been widely used to investigate important issues such as immunotherapy (20Pulaski B.A. Clements V.K. Pipeling M.R. Ostrand-Rosenberg S. Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2000; 49: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), metastasis (21Christensen C.R. Klingelhöfer J. Tarabykina S. Hulgaard E.F. Kramerov D.

Immunother. 2000; 48: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 4T1 tumors are poorly immunogenic in that immunization with irradiated 4T1 cells provides only slight delays in tumor growth which are not sufficient to protect the animal (24Morecki S. Yacovlev L. Slavin S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ours and others work demonstrated that administration of IL-12 to 4T1 tumor-bearing mice resulted in a substantial reduction in tumor size and decreased spontaneous metastases to the lungs, and significantly prolonged their survival time (25Rakhmilevich A.L. Janssen K. Hao Z. Sondel P.M. Yang N.S. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Shi X. Cao S. Mitsuhashi M. Xiang Z. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, CCL5 has been detected in many clinical specimens of breast cancers (27Niwa Y. Akamatsu H. Niwa H. Sumi H. Ozaki Y. Abe A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 285-289PubMed Google Scholar, 28Luboshits G. Shina S. Kaplan O. Engelberg S. Nass D. Lifshitz-Mercer B. Chaitchik S. Keydar I. Ben-Baruch A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4681-4687PubMed Google Scholar) and the presence of a high level of CCL5 in the plasma is a poor prognostic factor in inflammatory breast cancer (29Bièche I. Lerebours F. Tozlu S. Espie M. Marty M. Lidereau R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6789-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Wigler N. Shina S. Kaplan O. Luboshits G. Chaitchik S. Keydar I. Ben-Baruch A. Isr. Med. Assoc. J. 2002; 4: 940-943PubMed Google Scholar). 4T1 tumors also express high levels of CCL5 and blocking CCL5 signaling pathway with Met-RANTES in mice suppressed 4T1 mammary tumor growth (31Robinson S.C. Scott K.A. Wilson J.L. Thompson R.G. Proudfoot A.E. Balkwill F.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8360-8365PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, human and mouse studies indicate that CCL5 produced from tumor cells plays an important role in breast cancer progression. However, little is known about how tumors affect host CCL5 production during infection. It has been recognized for a long time that cancer patients have a high risk of infection (32Taccone F.S. Artigas A.A. Sprung C.L. Moreno R. Sakr Y. Vincent J.L. Crit. Care. 2009; 13: R15Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 33Williams M.D. Braun L.A. Cooper L.M. Johnston J. Weiss R.V. Qualy R.L. Linde-Zwirble W. Crit. Care. 2004; 8: R291-R298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CCL5 belongs to type I chemokine important for Th1 response and induction of CCL5 during endotoxemia correlates with protection (11Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. Fitting C. Adrie C. Payen D. Scand J. Infect Dis. 2003; 35: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate if the presence of tumor could have any negative effect on host CCL5 production during infection. In this study, we found that tumor-bearing mice produced less CCL5 in vivo during septic shock compared with tumor-free mice. Soluble molecules secreted by tumors inhibited CCL5 protein production and mRNA expression in macrophages stimulated with LPS. The inhibitory effect of tumor-secreted molecule on CCL5 expression was regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, we found that tumor-secreted PGE2 mediated this inhibitory effect through a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. 6∼8-week-old female Balb/c mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed in cages with filter tops in a laminar flow hood, fed food, and filtered water ad libitum at Saint Louis University Animal Facilities in accordance with the principles of Animal Care (National Institutes of Health publication number 85-23, revised 1985). For inducing endotoxic shock, mice were injected intraperitoneally (intraperitoneal) with lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 0217:B8 (Sigma-Aldrich) (25 mg/kg). Four hours later, mice were sacrificed for collection of serum and for isolation of spleens. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and 4T1 mammary gland tumor cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin and 10% FBS (Sigma, endotoxin NMT, 10.0 EU/ml). Normal mammary gland epithelial cell line, CommaD Sego cells isolated from mammary glands of female Balb/c mice (34Hollmann C.A. Kittrell F.S. Medina D. Butel J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7645-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Medina (Baylor College of Medicine), and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5 ml HEPES buffer (per 500 ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), EGF (5 ng/ml), and 2% FBS. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained by lavage 3 days after injection of sterile 3% thioglycolate broth (1 ml of intraperitoneal per mouse). Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI containing 10% FBS and standard supplements. Macrophages were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (1 × 106 cells/well). After 2 h of incubation to allow for adherence of macrophages, monolayers were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells, and incubated with RPMI containing 10% FBS and standard supplements. The next day, different amounts of conditioned medium collected from 4T1, B4, and 168 mammary tumor cells were added for different times as indicated in the text. Both B4 and 168 tumor cells were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Kurt at Lafayatte College (35Jayasinghe M.M. Golden J.M. Nair P. O'Donnell C.M. Werner M.T. Kurt R.A. Breast Cancer Res.

After 7 days, NS398 (10 mg/kg) dissolved in DMSO was given intraperitoneally every 3 days until 19 days after 4T1 cell injection. The same amount of DMSO was used as negative control. 19 days after 4T1 tumor cell injection, both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice were euthanized and blood was taken by cardiac puncture, followed by collection of serum for PGE2 and CCL5 protein assay. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained as described above and cultured at 1 × 106 cells/well in 24 well plates. Culture supernatants were collected to measure levels of CCL5 protein, and RNA was isolated from macrophages. CLP was performed according to the protocol published previously (36Rittirsch D. Huber-Lang M.S. Flierl M.A. Ward P.A. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Briefly, 19 days after 4T1 tumor cell injection, both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg per kg body weight). Then, the abdomen was shaved with an electric trimmer and disinfected with alcohol prep pads. A longitudinal skin midline incision (1.5–2 cm) was made with a scalpel. Then, the cecum was located and isolated using blunt anatomical forceps, followed by ligating the cecum at an upside position. The cecum was punctured using a 26 gauge needle and placed back into the abdominal cavity, followed by closure of the abdomen by suture. Mice were returned to clean cages at the end of surgical procedures where water and food were readily available and were closely monitored every 2 h for survival. A plasmid encoding the murine CCL5 promoter that extended from −979 to +8 was generated previously (37Liu J. Guan X. Tamura T. Ozato K. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55609-55617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNA for transfection were prepared with Qiagen Endo-free Maxi-Prep kits (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA). LPS from E. coli 0217:B8 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PGE2 receptor antagonists SC-51322 (EP1), AH-23848 (EP2), AH-6809 (EP4), COX2 inhibitor NS398, and PKA inhibitor H89 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Reverse-transcription (RT) reactions were carried out as follows: 1-μg aliquots of DNase-treated RNA were mixed with 1 μl of oligo dT primers (0.5 mg/ml), 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs and ddH2O to equalize volumes of all samples at 12 μl. The mixture was heated at 65 °C for 5 min, quenched on ice and spun down briefly, followed by adding 8 μl of a Master Mix consisting of 4 μl of 5 × first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl, Invitrogen), and 1 μl of Superscript II (200 μl/μl, Invitrogen). The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min, then at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by 4 °C soak. To each sample (in 20 μl of total volume) 80 μl of ddH2O was added. 5 μl of diluted cDNA was used for each PCR reaction of 25 μl volume. The following primers were used for PCR amplification of mouse CCL5 cDNA: sense, GATGGACATAGAGGACACAACT; antisense, TGGG-ACGGCAGATCTGAGGG; for mouse GAPDH cDNA: sense, AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG; antisense, ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA. To determine the level of mRNA expression by quantitative real time PCR, we used a modified protocol. Briefly, cDNA samples converted from 1 μg of total RNA, were diluted and studied at several concentrations. Diluted cDNA was mixed with a pair of primers (10 μm) targeting mouse CCL5 or GAPDH cDNA sequences as described above, and with SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, CA) in a 15 μl volume. PCR cycling was as followed as: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C for 1 cycle, followed by 40 cycles at 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C. Supernatants from murine peritoneal macrophage and RAW cell cultures were harvested 24 h after stimulation and stored at −70 °C. Mouse CCL5 was detected using the DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of PGE2 in serum and supernatants was detected using the prostaglandin E2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Concentrations were calculated by regression analysis of a standard curve. Transient transfections were performed by electroporation. Briefly, for each condition 0.4 ml of a RAW cell suspension containing 1 × 107 cells was mixed with 16 μg of total DNA (including reporter, effector, internal control and carrier DNA) and electroporated in 0.45 cm electroporation cuvettes (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) at 975 microfarade and 300 V in RPMI 1640 medium without serum. The transfected cells from different cuvettes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μm chloroquine, and antibiotics, added to 24-well plates, and incubated for 48 h prior to harvesting. To measure luciferase activity, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 125 mm Tris-phosphate pH 7.8, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm 1–2-diaminocyclohexane-tetraacetic acid, 50% glycerol, 5% Triton X-100. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. Transfection efficiency was routinely monitored by β-galactosidase (β-gal) assay by co-transfection with 3 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. Variability in β-gal activity between samples was typically within 5%. Lysates were used for both luciferase and β-gal assays. To determine primary transcript of CCL5 gene, cDNA were synthesized with random primers using 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA generated from mouse macrophages stimulated with LPS, LPS plus tumor-conditioned medium, and LPS plus PGE2. The two sets of primers used for measurement of primary transcript by qRT-PCR were: CCL5 intron 1 (sense): TAAAGAGCCCAGCATAGCTGGCAA; CCL5 exon 2 (antisense): ACGACTGCAAGATTGGA GCACTTG, for the first set; CCL5 intron 2 (sense): TGCCTCTGGTTCCAAAGGAGAAGA, CCL5 exon 3 (antisense): TCTTCTCTGGGTTGGCACACACTT, for the second set. Student's t test was performed wherever applicable. Standard deviation of the mean is shown unless otherwise indicated. *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001. To investigate the effects of mammary gland tumor on CCL5 expression during infection, we used an endotoxic shock model by injecting LPS into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, followed by measurement of CCL5 mRNA expression and protein production. Consistent with our previous studies (38Mitsuhashi M. Liu J. Cao S. Shi X. Ma X. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 76: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Shi X. Liu J. Xiang Z. Mitsuhashi M. Wu R.S. Ma X. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 110: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the sizes of tumors reached about 8 mm in diameter 19 days after 4T1 tumor cell injection (Fig. 1A). At this time point, the levels of CCL5 protein in serum (Fig. 1B) and mRNA expression in spleen (Fig. 1C) in tumor-bearing mice were significantly reduced compared with tumor-free mice. To induce endotoxic shock we injected LPS into the peritoneal cavity of both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice and collected sera and spleens for CCL5 detection 4 h later. LPS injection significantly increased CCL5 secretion (Fig. 1D) and mRNA expression (Fig. 1E) in both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice compared with the mice without LPS treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). However, CCL5 protein secretion (Fig. 1D) and mRNA expression (Fig. 1E) in tumor-bearing mice were markedly reduced compared with tumor-free mice. To determine whether tumor-bearing mice indeed were more susceptible to infection, we employed a cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) model to induce peritonitis with endogenous bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1F, tumor-bearing mice not only died earlier than tumor-free mice but none of them survived CLP-induced peritonitis, suggesting that the reduced CCL5 production in tumor-bearing hosts during endotoxemia may compromise host immune competence against bacterial challenge. To investigate the effects of tumor on host CCL5 expression, we tested whether tumor-secreted molecules that can suppress CCL5 expression in macrophages since macrophages are a major producer of CCL5. RAW cells were stimulated with LPS and TCM collected from 4T1 mammary gland tumor cells, followed by measurement of CCL5 protein production and mRNA expression. 4T1 TCM suppressed LPS-induced CCL5 protein production (Fig. 2A) and mRNA expression (Fig. 2B) about 2-fold, which is similar to the levels of inhibition seen in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1, D and E). Mouse peritoneal macrophages had similar responses to TCM as the RAW cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). To exclude the possibility that the soluble factors secreted from normal mammary gland epithelial cells may inhibit CCL5 expression, we collected the conditioned medium (CM) from the CommaD Bgeo cells (normal mammary gland epithelial cells isolated from Balb/c mice) and treated the macrophages with both CommaD Bgeo CM and LPS followed by measurement of CCL5 protein and mRNA expression. The results show that CommaD CM did not inhibit CCL5 protein (Fig. 2C) and mRNA (Fig. 2D) expression, indicating that the soluble factors secreted from tumor cells can suppress LPS-induced CCL5 expression. To evaluate whether the inhibitory effect is restricted to TLR4 signaling pathway, we stimulated the macrophages with TNF-α in the presence of 4T1 TCM. In contrast to LPS stimulation, 4T1 TCM enhanced TNF-α-induced CCL5 protein (Fig. 2E) and mRNA (Fig. 2F) expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that soluble factors secreted from 4T1 tumor cells selectively target TLR4 signaling. We noticed that 4T1 tumor cells secret a lot of CCL5 by themselves (Fig. 2G), which may affect macrophage CCL5 expression in an autocrine manner. To exclude this possibility, we cultured two different mammary gland tumor cell lines lacking of CCL5 expression, 168 and B4 cells, collected TCMs from these two types of tumor cells, and applied these TCMs to LPS-treated cells as described above. Interestingly, both TCMs collected from the 168 (Fig. 2H) and B4 (Fig. 2I) tumor cells were still able to suppress LPS-induced CCL5 expression, indicating that the inhibitory effect of tumor cells on CCL5 expression is not mediated by tumor-secreted CCL5. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of tumor-mediated CCL5 inhibition, we measured primary transcript rates of the CCL5 gene in response to 4T1 CM in RAW cells, with two pairs of primers corresponding to two different regions of the CCL5 gene. The use of primers specific for an intron/exon boundary region allowed us to assess the primary transcript rate of CCL5 inside the nucleus. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows a schematic of the primers used in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, CCL5 primary transcript was induced by LPS as early as 30 min and increased up to 3 h after LPS simulation when both primer pairs were used. To our surprise, the 4T1 TCM did not inhibit LPS-induced CCL5 primary transcript but rather increased it (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that the inhibitory effect of tumor cells on CCL5 expression is mediated at the post-transcriptional level. To further verify the post-transcriptional inhibition of CCL5 by tumor cells, we transiently transfected the mouse CCL5 promoter into RAW cells and treated the transfected cell with different amounts of 4T1 TCM, followed by measurement of luciferase activities in cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3C, consistent with the primary transcript results, LPS strongly activated the CCL5 promoter and 4T1 TCM further increased LPS-induced CCL5 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Because our previous studies demonstrated that 4T1 tumor cells secret many molecules, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that can suppress host immunity (38Mitsuhashi M. Liu J. Cao S. Shi X. Ma X. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 76: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we reasoned that PGE2 might mediate CCL5 inhibition by tumor cells. Therefore, we first measured the effects of PGE2 on LPS-induced CCL5 primary transcript. To our surprise, PGE2 had similar effects on CCL5 primary transcript as the 4T1 TCM in that PGE2 enhanced LPS-induced CCL5 primary transcript (Fig. 3, D and E). Furthermore, PGE2 also increased LPS-induced CCL5 promoter activity (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these data indicate that tumor-secreted molecules suppress CCL5 expression at the post-transcriptional level and PGE2 has a similar effect as the TCM on CCL5 primary transcription. Because the above data showing that PGE2 has similar effect as 4T1 TCM on CCL5 primary transcription, next we wanted to know whether PGE2, like 4T1 TCM, inhibited LPS-induced CCL5 production. Indeed, PGE2 suppressed LPS-induced CCL5 protein (Fig. 4A) and mRNA (Fig, 4B) expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, we treated the 4T1 cells with NS398, a specific COX2 inhibitor which can effectively block PGE2 production, collected the culture supernatants, and stimulated RAW cells with the supernatants collected from the NS398-treated 4T1 cells, followed by measuring CCL5 protein (Fig. 4C) and mRNA (Fig. 4D) expression by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the inhibitory effect of TCM on CCL5 expression was almost completely reversed by blocking tumor PGE2 production, suggesting that PGE2 secreted by mammary gland tumor cells inhibits CCL5 expression in macrophages stimulated with LPS. To confirm the effect of NS398 on PGE2 production, we measured the concentration of PGE2 in 4T1 TCM. 4T1 TCM secreted high amounts of PGE2 and NS398 treatment almost completely abrogated PGE2 secretion from the 4T1 tumor cells (supplemental Fig. S3). To further characterize the molecular mechanism whereby 4T1 TCM inhibits CCL5 production through PGE2, we used various PGE2 receptor antagonists to block PGE2 signaling, followed by testing whether the inhibitory effect of 4T1 TCM was affected. Because there are four prostanoid receptors (EP1-EP4) involved in PGE2 signaling, we blocked these PGE2 receptors individually with SC-51322 (a selective EP1 antagonist), AH-6809 (the EP2 receptor antagonist), and AH-23848 (a selective antagonist for EP4) prior to LPS and 4T1 TCM stimu"

https://openalex.org/W1978129579,"Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) activation/phosphorylation by angiotensin II (Ang II) is a critical signaling event in hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Conventional wisdom asserts that Akt activation occurs mainly in plasma membrane domains. Recent evidence that Akt activation may take place within intracellular compartments challenges this dogma. The spatial identity and mechanistic features of these putative signaling domains have not been defined. Using cell fractionation and fluorescence methods, we demonstrate that the early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1)-positive endosomes are a major site of Ang II-induced Akt activation. Akt moves to and is activated in EEA1 endosomes. The expression of EEA1 is required for phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 as well as for phosphorylation of its downstream targets mTOR and S6 kinase, but not for Erk1/2 activation. Both Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) interact with EEA1. We also found that PKC-α is required for organizing Ang II-induced, EEA1-dependent Akt phosphorylation in VSMC early endosomes. EEA1 expression enables PKC-α phosphorylation, which in turn regulates Akt upstream signaling kinases, PDK1 and p38 MAPK. Our results indicate that PKC-α is a necessary regulator of EEA1-dependent Akt signaling in early endosomes. Finally, EEA1 down-regulation or expression of a dominant negative mutant of PKC-α blunts Ang II-induced leucine incorporation in VSMCs. Thus, EEA1 serves a novel function as an obligate scaffold for Ang II-induced Akt activation in early endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1978971554,"The MARCKS protein (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) is an actin- and calmodulin-binding protein that is expressed in many mammalian tissues. The role of MARCKS in endothelial signaling responses is incompletely understood. We found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of MARCKS in cultured endothelial cells abrogated directed cell movement in a wound healing assay. We used biochemical and cell imaging approaches to explore the role of MARCKS in endothelial signal transduction pathways activated by insulin. Insulin treatment of vascular endothelial cells promoted the dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS. Cell imaging and hydrodynamic approaches revealed that MARCKS is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae and undergoes subcellular translocation in response to insulin. Insulin treatment promoted an increase in levels of the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) in plasmalemmal caveolae. The insulin-stimulated increase in caveolar PIP(2) was blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of MARCKS, as determined using both biochemical assays and imaging studies using FRET-based PIP(2) biosensors. The critical role of PIP(2) in MARCKS responses was explored by examining the PIP(2)- and actin-binding proteins Arp2/3 and N-WASP. Insulin promoted the rapid and robust phosphorylation of both N-WASP and Arp2/3, but these phosphorylation responses were markedly attenuated by siRNA-mediated MARCKS knockdown. Moreover, MARCKS knockdown effectively abrogated N-WASP activation in response to insulin, as determined using a FRET-based N-WASP activity biosensor. Taken together, these studies show that MARCKS plays a key role in insulin-dependent endothelial signaling to PIP(2) and is a critical determinant of actin assembly and directed cell movement in the vascular endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1982832387,"Most bacteria use free enzymes to degrade plant cell walls in nature. However, some bacteria have adopted a different strategy wherein enzymes can either be free or tethered on a protein scaffold forming a complex called a cellulosome. The study of the structure and mechanism of these large macromolecular complexes is an active and ongoing research topic, with the goal of finding ways to improve biomass conversion using cellulosomes. Several mechanisms involved in cellulosome formation remain unknown, including how cellulosomal enzymes assemble on the scaffoldin and what governs the population of cellulosomes created during self-assembly. Here, we present a coarse-grained model to study the self-assembly of cellulosomes. The model captures most of the physical characteristics of three cellulosomal enzymes (Cel5B, CelS, and CbhA) and the scaffoldin (CipA) from Clostridium thermocellum. The protein structures are represented by beads connected by restraints to mimic the flexibility and shapes of these proteins. From a large simulation set, the assembly of cellulosomal enzyme complexes is shown to be dominated by their shape and modularity. The multimodular enzyme, CbhA, binds statistically more frequently to the scaffoldin than CelS or Cel5B. The enhanced binding is attributed to the flexible nature and multimodularity of this enzyme, providing a longer residence time around the scaffoldin. The characterization of the factors influencing the cellulosome assembly process may enable new strategies to create designers cellulosomes."

One of the major nuclear regulators of PP1 is NIPP1 (nuclear inhibitor of PP1), which inhibits the dephosphorylation of a wide range of PP1 substrates (22Bollen M. Beullens M.

Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription is blocked by the expression of NIPP1, and the inhibition is reversed by the co-expression of PP1γ (21Ammosova T. Jerebtsova M. Beullens M. Voloshin Y. Ray P.E.

We showed that in cultured cells, PP1, but not PP2A, likely dephosphorylates CDK9 and contributes to the regulation of activated HIV-1 transcription (25Ammosova T. Washington K. Debebe Z. Brady J. Nekhai S. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we analyzed the effect of the expression of cdNIPP1, an inhibitory 82-residue PP1-binding fragment of the central domain of NIPP1 (cdNIPP1), on the CDK9 phosphorylation and activity and HIV-1 transcription. We further analyzed the effect of cdNIPP1 expression on HIV-1 replication in a physiologically relevant manner by expressing cdNIPP1 as part of the HIV-1 genome in place of nef. Our results indicate that the expression of PP1 inhibitor suppresses HIV-1 replication. 293T cells were purchased from American Type Cultue Collection (Manassas, VA).

Genomic DNA was isolated from parental 293T cells and three different clones that were stably transformed with NIPP1-(143–224)-EGFP. About 500 ng of these genomic DNAs were used as a template in a PCR with the sense primer (5′-ATGGGTGGAGAGGATGATGAACTC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 436–459 of bovine NIPP1 cDNA (accession number Z50748) and the antisense primer (5′-CGTCGCCGTCCAGCTCGACCAG-3′), corresponding to the inverse complement of nucleotides 724–745 of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The amplified PCR products were subcloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced by T7 and SP6 primer.

RNA was isolated from complexes that co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK9 antibodies using TRIzol reagent according the Invitrogen protocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) with the 7SK reverse primer. The following primer sequences were used: forward, 3′-GGATGTGAGGCGATCTGGCTG-5′ and reverse, 3′-TAAAGAAAGGCAGACTGCCAC-5′. These primers were used in a PCR that followed the RT reaction. In semiquantitative PCR, products were resolved on 2% agarose gel and photographed. In real time PCR, PCRs were run with Syber Green on a MioQ PCR machine and quantified using cdNIPP1 expression vector as control for the determination of copy number. 293T and 293T-cdNIPP1 cells were grown in 100-mm plates and then lysed with 0.5 ml of whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g and loaded on top of a 10–30% glycerol (9-ml) gradient. Glycerol gradient buffer contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 200 μm EDTA. The gradient was spun in SW 41Ti rotor (Beckman) at 38,000 rpm for 18 h. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected through a needle inserted into the bottom of the tube and analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. The x-ray films with the immunoblots for NIPP1 and CDK9 phosphorylated on Thr186 were scanned and quantified using OptiQuant software from Packard Cyclone PhosphorImager (Perkin-Elmer). The pixels were adjusted to have the same total amount for the 293T and the cdNIPP1 extracts, and the normalized results were graphed. CEM cells containing integrated HIV-1 LTR EGFP (CEM-GFP obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamine, 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin and streptomycin), and 500 μg/ml G418. CEM-GFP cells were treated in a 96-well plate with purified recombinant Tat added at 0.8 μg/300,000 cells per well in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine and, where indicated supplemented with 50 μm KNSRVTFSED or KNSRATASED peptides. After an 18-h incubation, the cells were precipitated by centrifugation and lysed for 20 min at room temperature in 50 μl of lysis buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA and transferred into 150 μl of PBS. The fluorescence was measured with 480-nm excitation and 510-nm emission on a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) equipped with a robotic 96-well scanner. RT was performed using the SuperscriptTM RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Random hexamers were used for RT-PCR. Primers for PCR were designed for β-actin (forward, GCGGGAAATCGTGCGTGCGTGACATT; reverse, GATGGAGTTGAAGGTAGTTTCGTG) and NIPP1 (forward, AGAATTCAACACTGCCACA; reverse, CACCCGCTTC TTCTTGACTG). Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green Super Mix (Bio-Rad) at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s for 45 cycles on a MyiQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The obtained Ct numbers were converted to the cDNA copy numbers using as a calibration, amplification of NIPP1-expressing plasmid, and primers for NIPP1. We used a 398-6 shuttle vector which was created by subcloning of BamHI-NcoI fragment from pNL4-3 containing nef sequence into a pUC vector and introducing CTCGAGTCTAGAGCGGCCGCTTCGA linker with XhoI, XbaI, and NotI sites into the XhoI site of the nef sequence. Then 398-6 shuttle vector was digested with BamHI and NcoI. The 2-kb fragment containing the linker was subcloned back into the Nco-BamH1 sites of pNL4-3 vector. The insert into the nef gene leads to the deletion of the first 36 amino acids of nef, which are critical for its function (32Ali S.A. Huang M.B. Campbell P.E. Roth W.W. Campbell T. Khan M. Newman G. Villinger F. Powell M.D. Bond V.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2010; 26: 173-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pNL4-3 398 vector was used as positive control in the infection experiment. To subclone cdNIPP1, pNL4-3 398 vector was digested with XhoI and NotI restriction enzymes, and the backbone was used to subclone the NIPP1-EGFP fragment that was obtained by digestion with XhoI and NotI from the WT and mutant NIPP1-(143–224)-EGFP expression vector. Correct cloning was verified by sequencing. Nuclear EGFP expression was verified by fluorescence in transfected 293 cells, and cdNIPP1 expression was verified by Western blotting using anti-NIPP1 antibodies. LDH release, used as an indicator of cell membrane damage, was measured in the culture medium using an LDH assay kit (LDH Cytotoxicity Assay kit; BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, the medium was collected and mixed with 100 μl of reaction mixture provided by the manufacturer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light. High control was generated by treating cells with 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h prior to the beginning of the assay. The colorimetric change was measured with a microtiter reader (Labsystem Multiskan) at 450 nm. HIV-1 viruses were prepared by transfecting HeLa cells with genomic pNL4-3, pNL4-3 398, pNL4-3-cdNIPP1-EGFP, and pNL4-3-cdNIPP1mut-EGFP and collecting media at 72 h after transfection. Viral RT activity was determined and adjusted in the collected media. RT was measured in 10 μl incubated in a 96-well plate with RT reaction mixture containing 1× RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl), 0.1% Triton X-100, 10−2 units poly(A), 10−2 units poly(dT), and [3H]TTP. The mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and 5 μl of the reaction mix was spotted on a DEAE Filtermat paper, washed four times with 5% Na2HPO4 and three times with water, and then dried completely. RT activity was measured in a Betaplate counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). MT4 cells were grown to 70% confluence, inoculated with pNL4-3 viruses, and medium was collected at the indicated time points. The RT activity was determined as described above. We analyzed the effect of the expression of a PP1 inhibitor in an engineered cell line that stably expressed the central, inhibitory domain of NIPP1 (residues 143–224) fused to EGFP (Fig. 1A, lane 2). By Western blotting analyses, the expression of CDK9 or PP1γ was not affected in these cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Next, the distribution of NIPP1 and CDK9 phosphorylated on Thr186 between small and large molecular weight complexes was analyzed in whole cell extracts prepared from 293T or 293T-cdNIPP1 cells after fractionation on glycerol gradients (Fig. 1B). In 293T-cdNIPP1 cells, cdNIPP1-EGFP expression was detected, and the WT NIPP1 was shifted toward the lower molecular weight complexes, compared with 293T cells (Fig. 1B, NIPP1 panels). Quantification of the band densities of NIPP1 immunoblots after adjusting the pixels to equalize the total amount of NIPP1 confirmed this observation (Fig. 1B). By comparison, there was no difference in the distribution of CDK9 (Fig. 1B, CDK9 panel, quantification not shown) and a slight difference in PP1 distribution (Fig. 1B, PP1 panel). The amount of CDK9 phosphorylated on Thr186 was increased in the higher molecular weight fractions (fractions 7–10) of 293T-cdNIPP1 cells (Fig. 1B, CDK9-T186P panel). These results suggest that endogenous NIPP1 is redistributed in 293T-cdNIPP1 cells toward the smaller molecule fractions and that CDK9 phosphorylated on Thr186 is present in higher molecular weight fractions. There were no changes in the distribution of HEXIM1, cyclin T1, or Brd4 in 293T-cdNIPP1 cells versus 293T cells (data not shown). Because the phosphorylation of CDK9 on Thr186 promotes the association of CDK9/cyclin T1 with 7SK RNA (16Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Li Q. Price J.P. Byers S.A. Cheng D. Peng J. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28819-28826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the increased CDK9 phosphorylation affected the association of CDK9 with 7SK RNA. Analysis by quantitative real time PCR showed an increase in the amount of 7SK RNA that precipitated with CDK9 from 293T-cdNIPP1 cells compared with 293T cells (Fig. 1C). These results were replicated in a semiquantitative RT-PCR, which showed 7SK RNA co-precipitating with CDK9 from 293T-cdNIPP1 cell lysate (Fig. 1D, lane 8) in contrast to a little co-precipitation of 7SK RNA with CDK9 from 293T cells (Fig. 1D, lane 4). Pretreatment of the CDK9/7SK complex immunoprecipitated from 293T-cdNIPP1 cells with purified PP1c removed 7SK RNA (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that association of 7SK RNA with CDK9 is phosphorylation-dependent and sensitive to dephosphorylation by PP1. Taken together, these results indicate that CDK9 is additionally phosphorylated on Thr186 in 293T-cdNIPP1 cells and that phosphorylated CDK9 is associated with 7SK RNA in high molecular weight fractions. To investigate the interaction of Tat with PP1, FLAG-tagged Tat was expressed in 293T and 293T-cdNIPP1 cells and then immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2A). The amount of FLAG-Tat expressed in 293T-cdNIPP1 cells was less than in 293T, and less Tat protein was immunoprecipitated from mutant cell line whole cell lysate (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The amount of CDK9 co-precipitated with Tat was slightly reduced in 293T-cdNIPP1 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the amount of PP1 co-precipitated with Tat was reduced substantially in 293T-cdNIP1 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), even comparing with a reduced amount of Tat precipitated from the mutated cell line. Thus, the expression of cdNIPP1 reduced the amount of PP1 available to bind Tat. To investigate the effect of the stable expression of cdNIPP1 on HIV-1 transcription, 293T and 293T-cdNIPP1 cells were transiently transfected with HIV-1 LTR-Lac Z expression vector alone or in combination with Tat (Fig. 2B), and the β-galactosidase results were normalized to the amount of plasmid DNA in the cells, which was determined by real time PCR. Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription was reduced significantly in 293T-cdNIPP1 cells compared with parental 293T cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Basal HIV-1 transcription from a mutant HIV-1 LTR with a deletion of the TAR RNA sequence (HIV-1 LTRΔTAR) was also reduced in 293T-cdNIPP1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Although the CMV-LacZ transcription was also reduced, the effect on HIV-1 promoter was much stronger (factor 4–10 compared with factor 2 for CMV promoter, Fig. 2C) and exceeded the effect on CMV promoter. Overexpression of PP1γ increased HIV-1 transcription in 293T cells over cdNIPP1 cells, and overexpression of PP1γ-D64N-EGFP (DN PP1γ) decreased the transcription (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5 and lanes 6–8), suggesting the involvement of PP1. Co-expression of PP1γ reduced the inhibitory effect of the cdNIPP1 expression on Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 2D). Stable expression of mutant NIPP1 that does not bind PP1 in 84-31 cells did not have an effect on basal or Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 2E). To rule out the possibility that expression of cdNIPP1 causes general cellular toxicity, we analyzed the effect of cdNIPP1 expression on the release of LDH, which is an indicator of cell membrane damage. Measurement of LDH in the medium of 239T cells transfected with EGFP alone was similar to the LDH levels released from cells transfected with EGFP-fused WT or mutant NIPP1, cdNIPP1 or WT or DN PP1γ (supplemental Fig. S1A). The effect of chemically synthesized KNSRVTFSED peptide derived from the central domain of NIPP1 was analyzed in CEM-GFP T cells containing integrated HIV-1 LTR-EGFP reported which was activated by the addition of purified Tat protein to the culture medium (33Nekhai S. Bhat U.G. Ammosova T. Radhakrishnan S.K. Jerebtsova M. Niu X. Foster A. Layden T.J. Gartel A.L. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Addition of purified peptides KNSRVTFSED had small inhibitory and KNSRATASED, slightly stimulatory effect on LTR-driven EGFP expression (supplemental Fig. S1B), confirming the results obtained above with stable expression of cdNIPP1. Analysis by real time PCR showed no difference in the expression of endogenous NIPP1 in the WT and mutant cdNIPP1-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S1C), suggesting that the expression of NIPP1 was not altered. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of cdNIPP1 inhibited HIV-1 transcription and that this inhibition was not due to generalized cellular toxicity of the PP1 inhibitor. To determine directly the effect of cdNIPP1 on HIV-1 viral replication in a more physiologically relevant system, we subcloned the cdNIPP1-EGFP sequence in place of nef into the pNL4-3 vector (Fig. 3A). The expression of cdNIPP1-expressing molecular clones was verified by the nuclear fluorescence of cdNIPP1-EGFP in 293T cells transfected with pNL4-3 cdNIPP1 WT and mutant and compared with the expression of EGPF-AD8 molecular clone (34Vanham G. Penne L. Allemeersch H. Kestens L. Willems B. van der Groen G. Jeang K.T. Toossi Z. Rich E. Aids. 2000; 14: 2299-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The recombinant HIV-1 viruses were created by transfecting HeLa cells with pNL4-3 cdNIPP1 (WT or mutant) and collecting culture supernatants at 48 h after transfection. The viruses were equalized for RT activities and used to infect cultured MT4 cells. As positive controls, we used WT pNL4-3 virus and also pNL4-3 398 virus that contained inactivating insert in the nef gene that deletes 36 N-terminal amino acids of nef critical for the nef function (32Ali S.A. Huang M.B. Campbell P.E. Roth W.W. Campbell T. Khan M. Newman G. Villinger F. Powell M.D. Bond V.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2010; 26: 173-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The expression of NIPP1 in the infected MT4 cells was monitored by Western blotting (not shown). The RT activity was analyzed over the course of 13 days to determine the kinetics of viral replication (Fig. 3C). Compared with the WT pNL4-3, the viruses with the nef inserts showed delayed replication kinetics, likely due to the impairment of the nef function. Expression of cdNIPP1 in the context of an HIV-1 genome significantly inhibited viral replication compared with the expression of a control mutant cdNIPP1 in the same genome (Fig. 3B) or expression of WT pNL4-3 or pNL4-3 398 virus with the inactivating insert in the nef gene. These results verified that productive HIV-1 replication is inhibited when cdNIPP1 is expressed during the course of the viral infection in T cells. Here, we show that expression of a relatively short, 82 residues PP1-binding peptide, derived from NIPP1 redistributed cellular PP1, modified CDK9 phosphorylation and association with 7SK RNA, and inhibited HIV-1 replication. Although the PP1 targets relevant to HIV-1 transcription are still not conclusively understood, one possibility is that PP1 dephosphorylates CDK9 (25Ammosova T. Washington K. Debebe Z. Brady J. Nekhai S. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thr186 of CDK9 can be dephosphorylated by PP1α in vivo (18Chen R. Liu M. Li H. Xue Y. Ramney W.N. He N. Ai N. Luo H. Zhu Y. Zhou N. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our data are in agreement with this previous work because we documented an increased phosphorylation of CDK9 Thr186 and increased association of CDK9 with 7SK RNA when PP1 inhibitor was overexpressed. We previously hypothesized that during HIV-1 infection, the viral Tat protein serves as a PP1-targeting subunit. Here, we found that the expression of cdNIPP1 disrupts the association of Tat with PP1; this disruption could be a mechanism for inhibiting HIV-1 transcription, similar to the previously reported HIV-1 inhibitory effect of Tat mutations that prevented binding of Tat to PP1 (24Ammosova T. Jerebtsova M. Beullens M. Lesage B. Jackson A. Kashanchi F. Southerland W. Gordeuk V.R. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36364-36371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription by a short peptide containing the RVTF sequence, although the effect was relatively small likely due to the problem with cell permeability and inefficient delivery. Another possible biological target for PP1 dephosphorylation in HIV-1 transcription could be the transcription factor Sp1 because it is known to associate with PP1 at many cellular promoters (35Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24039-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sp1 is required by HIV-1 for basal transcription (36Jochmann R. Thurau M. Jung S. Hofmann C. Naschberger E. Kremmer E. Harrer T. Miller M. Schaft N. Stürzl M. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 3704-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and can target cyclin T1 to the LTR in the absence of Tat or TAR RNA (37Yedavalli V.S. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6404-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An increase in Sp1 phosphorylation induced by Tat and DNA-PK can enhance HIV-1 transcription (38Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II could be a third PP1 substrate; we have previously shown that the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is indeed dephosphorylated by PP1 (39Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our recent study showed that NIPP1 can serve as an RNA polymerase II-targeting subunit of PP1 (40Jerebtsova M. Klotchenko S.A. Artamonova T.O. Ammosova T. Washington K. Egorov V.V. Shaldzhyan A.A. Sergeeva M.V. Zatulovskiy E.A. Temkina O.A. Petukhov M.G. Vasin A.V. Khodorkovskii M.A. Orlov Y.N. Nekhai S. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2010; 347: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and thus altered RNA polymerase II dephosphorylation could also be considered as a potential inhibitory mechanism. Interestingly, the results presented here indicate that despite the expression of cdNIPP1, cells remained viable even though the association of CDK9 with 7SK RNA was increased. Also, a transient expression of cdNIPP1 was not toxic. Thus, our observations indicate a future possibility for the design of the HIV-1 inhibitory compounds that affect the interaction of Tat with PP1. Here, we utilized an RVXF-binding peptide (i.e. cdNIPP1) to disrupt the interaction of PP1 with a subset of cellular regulatory subunits and inhibit HIV-1. Recently, a combined approach of in silico screening and a multistep biochemical validation procedure identified many novel PP1 interactors that contained novel PP1 binding motifs, “SILK” and “MyPhoNE” (41Hendrickx A. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Den Abt T. Van Eynde A. Nicolaescu E. Lesage B. Bollen M. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, small molecule compounds that disrupt either of these PP1-binding motifs or an RVXF motif might deregulate subsets of cellular PP1 holoenzymes and selectively target viral or cellular pathways. Taken together, previous studies and our findings here indicate that PP1 is involved in HIV-1 transcription. Efficient inhibition of HIV-1 transcription and replication through the redistribution of PP1 indicate that PP1 can be a future target for antiviral therapeutics.

Here we report the characterization of the fourth member of the family, SLC36A4 or hPAT4, which when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes also encodes a plasma membrane amino acid transporter, but one that is not proton-coupled and has a very high substrate affinity for the amino acids proline and tryptophan. hPAT4 in Xenopus oocytes mediated sodium-independent, electroneutral uptake of [(3)H]proline, with the highest rate of uptake when the uptake medium pH was 7.4 and an affinity of 3.13 μM. Tryptophan was also an excellently transported substrate with a similarly high affinity (1.72 μM). Other amino acids that inhibited [(3)H]proline were isoleucine (K(i) 0.23 mM), glutamine (0.43 mM), methionine (0.44 mM), and alanine (1.48 mM), and with lower affinity, glycine, threonine, and cysteine (K(i) >5 mM for all). Of the amino acids directly tested for transport, only proline, tryptophan, and alanine showed significant uptake, whereas glycine and cysteine did not. Of the non-proteogenic amino acids and drugs tested, only sarcosine produced inhibition (K(i) 1.09 mM), whereas γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), β-alanine, L-Dopa, D-serine, and δ-aminolevulinic acid were without effect on [(3)H]proline uptake. This characterization of hPAT4 as a very high affinity/low capacity non-proton-coupled amino acid transporter raises questions about its physiological role, especially as the transport characteristics of hPAT4 are very similar to the Drosophila orthologue PATH, an amino acid ""transceptor"" that plays a role in nutrient sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2084609127,"Excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) is a high affinity glutamate transporter predominantly expressed in astroglia. Human EAAT2 encompasses eight transmembrane domains and a 74-amino acid C-terminal domain that resides in the cytoplasm. We examined the role of this region by studying various C-terminal truncations and mutations using heterologous expression in mammalian cells, whole-cell patch clamp recording and confocal imaging. Removal of the complete C terminus (K498X EAAT2) results in loss of function because of intracellular retention of truncated proteins in the cytoplasm. However, a short stretch of amino acids (E500X EAAT2) within the C terminus results in correctly processed transporters. E500X reduced glutamate transport currents by 90%. Moreover, the voltage and substrate dependence of E500X EAAT2 anion currents was significantly altered. WT and mutant EAAT2 anion channels are modified by external Na(+) in the presence as well as in the absence of L-glutamate. Whereas Na(+) stimulates EAAT2 anion currents in the presence of L-glutamate, increased [Na(+)] reduces such currents without glutamate. In cells internally dialyzed with Na(+), WT, and truncated EAAT2 display comparable Na(+) dependence. With K(+) as main internal cation, E500X drastically increased the apparent dissociation constant for external Na(+). The effects of E500X can be represented by a kinetic model that allows translocation of the empty transporter from the outward- to the inward-facing conformation and stabilization of the inward-facing conformation by internal K(+). Our results demonstrate that the C terminus modifies the glutamate uptake cycle, possibly affecting the movements of the translocation domain of EAAT2 glutamate transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1979541028,"Mitotic cells undergo extensive changes in shape and size through the altered regulation and function of their membrane trafficking machinery. Disabled 2 (Dab2), a multidomain cargo-specific endocytic adaptor and a mediator of signal transduction, is a potential integrator of trafficking and signaling. Dab2 binds effectors of signaling and trafficking that localize to different intracellular compartments. Thus, differential localization is a putative regulatory mechanism of Dab2 function. Furthermore, Dab2 is phosphorylated in mitosis and is thus regulated in the cell cycle. However, a detailed description of the intracellular localization of Dab2 in the different phases of mitosis and an understanding of the functional consequences of its phosphorylation are lacking. Here, we show that Dab2 is progressively displaced from the membrane in mitosis. This phenomenon is paralleled by a loss of co-localization with clathrin. Both phenomena culminate in metaphase/anaphase and undergo partial recovery in cytokinesis. Treatment with 2-methoxyestradiol, which arrests cells at the spindle assembly checkpoint, induces the same effects observed in metaphase cells. Moreover, 2-methoxyestradiol also induced Dab2 phosphorylation and reduced Dab2/clathrin interactions, endocytic vesicle motility, clathrin exchange dynamics, and the internalization of a receptor endowed with an NPXY endocytic signal. Serine/threonine to alanine mutations, of residues localized to the central region of Dab2, attenuated its phosphorylation, reduced its membrane displacement, and maintained its endocytic abilities in mitosis. We propose that the negative regulation of Dab2 is part of an accommodation of the cell to the altered physicochemical conditions prevalent in mitosis, aimed at allowing endocytic activity throughout the cell cycle.

Thus, at steady state, the long isoform (denominated p96 or p82 in different species) localizes to the plasma membrane (14Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M.

Taken together, the current picture suggests that the function of Dab2 is regulated by intracellular localization, by association with specific interacting factors, and possibly by post-translational modification. However, the interdependence of these different modes of regulation still remains to be determined and is at the center of this study.The mitotic shutdown of endocytosis, a mechanism proposed more than 25 years ago (31Warren G.

Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The notion of a modulation of the functions of endocytic proteins in mitosis is supported by the mitosis-related post-translational modifications of these proteins. Thus, Dab2, epsin, and Eps15 were proposed to undergo a transient cdc2-mediated phosphorylation in mitosis (42Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 43He J. Xu J. Xu X.X. Hall R.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4524-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an alteration in the intracellular localization of Dab2 in mitosis has been suggested (14Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, a thorough description of the cell cycle-dependent alterations to the localization and functional interactions of Dab2 and an assessment of the endocytosis of cargo endowed with different internalization signals in mitosis are currently lacking and will be addressed here.The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) 2The abbreviations used are: SACspindle assembly checkpointCCFcorrelation coefficientLDLRlow density lipoprotein receptorTβRItype I TGF-β receptorVtMvariance to mean ratio2ME22-methoxyestradiolhhumanrrat. is a critical step in the transition from the early to late stages of mitosis (44Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of nocodazole, vinblastine, or 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) induce an arrest of the cell cycle at the SAC without causing massive microtubule depolymerization (45Jordan M.A. Thrower D. Wilson L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 401-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Attalla H. Mäkelä T.P. Adlercreutz H. Andersson L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2225-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cytosol extracts, of cells arrested in this manner, accumulate mitotically phosphorylated endocytic proteins and hamper the invagination of clathrin-coated pits in permeabilized cells (32Pypaert M. Lucocq J.M. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbé J.C. Warren G. J.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4524-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Here, we employ ES-2 ovary cancer cells and 2ME2 to show that the intracellular localization of the p96/p82 isoform of Dab2, its phosphorylation state, and its association with clathrin are cell cycle-dependent. Moreover, in G2/M-arrested cells, the internalization of endocytic cargo endowed with an NPXY signal is inhibited.DISCUSSIONThe notion that the intracellular localization, repertoire of interactions, and function of Dab2 are altered in mitosis is supported by the following lines of evidence: (i) in interphase cells, the intracellular distribution of Dab2 yields a punctate staining characterized by a high variance to mean ratio (VtM); this staining pattern is lost throughout the mitosis of cycling cells and in cells arrested at the SAC with 2ME2, where a diffuse staining pattern is characterized by a low VtM. Importantly, the VtM obtained under these latter conditions is similar to the one observed in the interior of the cell, further supporting the notion of the displacement of Dab2 to the cytosol in mitosis (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, the distribution pattern of Dab2 in cells in cytokinesis yields an intermediate VtM value (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1), stressing the cyclical nature of the displacement of Dab2 in the cell cycle. The notion of the displacement of Dab2 to the cytosol is further supported by the 2ME2-induced alterations observed by cell fractionation (supplemental Fig. 2). (ii) At the plasma membrane of interphase cells, Dab2 and clathrin show a high degree of co-localization, reflected by the high value of the maximal Pearson's CCF of their fluorescence signals. In the course of mitosis, this CCF is significantly reduced (Fig. 2G). Here too, 2ME2-mediated cell cycle arrest emulated the effects observed in mitotic/cycling cells (supplemental Fig. 3B), reinforcing the notion of its appropriateness as a means of enrichment of the mitotic cell population. Importantly, in mitosis, clathrin and Dab2 accumulated in different intracellular compartments. Although clathrin showed a prominent recruitment to the mitotic spindle, Dab2 remained diffuse in the cytoplasm of the cell (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B). Here too, the CCF value obtained in cytokinesis is significantly higher than the minimal value, observed in cells in metaphase (Fig. 2G), reinforcing the notion of the cyclical regulation of Dab2/clathrin interactions. (iii) Dab2 and clathrin co-immunoprecipitate in interphase cells, an interaction that is lost in 2ME2-treated cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, the interaction between Dab2 and myosin VI is maintained in the mitotically arrested cells (Fig. 5A), stressing the specificity of the abrogation of Dab2-clathrin interactions in mitosis. The interaction of Dab2 with myosin VI is mediated through the C-terminal region of Dab2 (56Phichith D. Travaglia M. Yang Z. Liu X. Zong A.B. Safer D. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17320-17324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 57Yu C. Feng W. Wei Z. Miyanoiri Y. Wen W. Zhao Y. Zhang M. Cell. 2009; 138: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas the sequence involved in binding to clathrin localizes to the central exon of Dab2 (14Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Importantly, in mitosis, myosin VI also undergoes marked changes to its intracellular localization and performs important roles, related to membrane traffic in cytokinesis (58Arden S.D. Puri C. Au J.S. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4750-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). (iv) In 2ME2-arrested cells, Dab2 is extensively phosphorylated. This phosphorylation induced a marked shift in the migration of Dab2 in SDS-PAGE, a shift that is abolished by incubation with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the mutation of Ser-393, Ser-394, and Ser-401 to alanines or the deletion of these residues reduced this shift in migration (Fig. 4B). A comparative mass spectrometry analysis of the phosphorylation of p82-WT-h in vehicle/2ME2-treated cells revealed the 2ME2-induced phosphorylation of Ser-326 (or Ser-328). Importantly, these sites, which are present in p82-5A, were not phosphorylated in this molecular context in 2ME2-arrested cells (supplemental Fig. 4). Moreover, p82-WT-h also shows significant phosphorylation on Thr(P)-Pro/Ser(P)-Pro sites (supplemental Fig. 5), suggesting that Ser-326 (or Ser-328), which is not adjacent to prolines, are not the sole sites of its mitotic phosphorylation. Furthermore, the reduction in the phosphorylation of p82-5A correlated with the decrease in its displacement from the membrane (supplemental Fig. 2) and with its continued localization to membrane-bound punctate structures in 2ME2-treated cells (Fig. 4, C and D) and in cycling cells in mitosis (supplemental Fig. 6). (v) In 2ME2-treated cells, the internalization of a receptor endowed with an FDNPXY endocytic motif is specifically inhibited (Fig. 6). Importantly, the 2ME2-induced reduction in the internalization of this receptor is dependent on the displacement of Dab2 from the membrane, as it is rescued in p82-5A-expressing cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Accordingly, we have previously shown that the internalization of this same construct is enhanced upon the expression of GFP-Dab2 in COS7 cells (49Chetrit D. Ziv N. Ehrlich M. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 701-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly, and similarly to what was reported by Boucrot and Kirchhausen (35Boucrot E. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the internalization of an analogous TβRI-based construct endowed with a YXXΦ-like endocytic signal, which is supposedly entirely dependent on AP2, was not reduced in cells arrested in mitosis with 2ME2 (Fig. 6). Thus, arrest of cells in mitosis affects the internalization of only a subpopulation of receptors.In addition to Dab2, epsin and Eps15 are also phosphorylated in G2/M (42Chen H. Slepnev V.I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of both epsin and Eps15 also leads to a decrease in their endocytic function, through the reduction in their interaction with AP2/clathrin (42Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This negative regulation of endocytic proteins in mitosis contrasts with the functionality of AP2/clathrin throughout mitosis (35Boucrot E. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and suggests a differential regulation of endocytic “auxiliary factors” as compared with those defined as “endocytic hubs” (according to the clathrin interactome in Ref. 61Schmid E.M. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2007; 448: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). What are putative causes and consequences of this selectivity? (i) The mitotic cell alters the extent and possibly the nature of its interactions with its neighboring cells, with the extracellular matrix, and with its microenvironment. This dynamic process may demand an alteration in the repertoire of receptors exposed at the cell surface. Selective inhibition of the internalization of a subset of receptors, in the context of a general reduction in surface area (35Boucrot E. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 62Boucrot E. Kirchhausen T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), may be a way of achieving this modulation. (ii) Endocytic proteins perform alternative functions in mitotic cells. Prominent examples of this phenomenon are the recruitment of clathrin to the mitotic spindle (38Yamauchi T. Ishidao T. Nomura T. Shinagawa T. Tanaka Y. Yonemura S. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1852-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Royle S.J. Bright N.A. Lagnado L. Nature. 2005; 434: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the association of the endocytic adaptor ARH with centrosomal proteins (63Lehtonen S. Shah M. Nielsen R. Iino N. Ryan J.J. Zhou H. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2949-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the nonendocytic functions performed by epsin in mitosis (64Liu Z. Zheng Y. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (iii) The mitotic cell is a different physicochemical environment than the interphase cell and may thus present different requirements for the regulation of coated pit/coated vesicle formation. For example, mitotic cells have a reduced volume (62Boucrot E. Kirchhausen T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 65Habela C.W. Sontheimer H. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), enhanced membrane tension (36Raucher D. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and a different organization of the actin cytoskeleton (66Kunda P. Baum B. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), all of which potentially alter endocytosis. Specifically, we employed spinning disk confocal microscopy to measure the volume of ES-2 cells in metaphase and in 2ME2-mediated mitotic arrest, and we found that their volume is reduced by ∼60% in these conditions (data not shown). Such a reduction in volume would imply that the concentration of long lived proteins (the reported half-lives of clathrin and Dab2 are ∼50 and ∼16 h, respectively (10Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 67Acton S.L. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) may be 3-fold higher under these conditions. Interestingly, the endocytic machinery is sensitive to alterations in clathrin concentration (68Moskowitz H.S. Yokoyama C.T. Ryan T.A. Mol Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, although basic cell functions are not affected in the absence of Dab2, which is down-regulated/depleted in the initial phases of tumorigenesis of many tumor types (1Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnell J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12622-12631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 69Karam J.A. Shariat S.F. Huang H.Y.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), an increase in the amounts of Dab2 leads to profound alterations to the organization of clathrin in cells (49Chetrit D. Ziv N. Ehrlich M. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 701-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 70Mettlen M. Loerke D. Yarar D. Danuser G. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 919-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of epsin1 leads to a decrease in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (71Henne W.M. Boucrot E. Meinecke M. Evergren E. Vallis Y. Mittal R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2010; 328: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Interestingly, incubation of cells in hypertonic medium (0.45 m sucrose), which reduces cell volume (by ∼50%, data not shown), induces a massive polymerization of clathrin and Dab2 into unproductive structures (49Chetrit D. Ziv N. Ehrlich M. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 701-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 72Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Thus, a reduction in interactions with the membrane and with clathrin, through mitotic phosphorylation, may be a manner of reducing the concentration of active Dab2 and possibly also of additional auxiliary endocytic factors such as epsin and Eps15. This reduction may be part of a regulatory mechanism aimed at the continuation of endocytosis (of a subset of receptors) in mitosis, despite the broad alterations to the physicochemical environment of the cell. IntroductionDisabled-2 (Dab2) is a multidomain mitotic phosphoprotein that functions as a signal modulator and tumor suppressor (1Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnell J.D. Navone N.

https://openalex.org/W1971459321,"Diabodies (Dbs) and tandem single-chain variable fragments (taFv) are the most widely used recombinant formats for constructing small bispecific antibodies. However, only a few studies have compared these formats, and none have discussed their binding kinetics and cross-linking ability. We previously reported the usefulness for cancer immunotherapy of a humanized bispecific Db (hEx3-Db) and its single-chain format (hEx3-scDb) that target epidermal growth factor receptor and CD3. Here, we converted hEx3-Db into a taFv format to investigate how format affects the function of a small bispecific antibody; our investigation included a cytotoxicity assay, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, thermodynamic analysis, and flow cytometry. The prepared taFv (hEx3-taFv) showed an enhanced cytotoxicity, which may be attributable to a structural superiority to the diabody format in cross-linking target cells but not to differences in the binding affinities of the formats. Comparable cross-linking ability for soluble antigens was observed among hEx3-Db, hEx3-scDb, and hEx3-taFv with surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, drastic increases in cytotoxicity were found in the dimeric form of hEx3-taFv, especially when the two hEx3-taFv were covalently linked. Our results show that converting the format of small bispecific antibodies can improve their function. In particular, for small bispecific antibodies that target tumor and immune cells, a functional orientation that avoids steric hindrance in cross-linking two target cells may be important in enhancing the growth inhibition effect."
https://openalex.org/W2039629461,"The most common cause of cardiac side effects of pharmaco-therapy is acquired long QT syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal cardiac repolarization and most often caused by direct blockade of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG). However, little is known about therapeutic compounds that target ion channels other than hERG. We have discovered that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a very potent antineoplastic compound for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, is proarrhythmic via two separate mechanisms: a well characterized inhibition of hERG/I(Kr) trafficking and a poorly understood increase of cardiac calcium currents. We have analyzed the latter mechanism in the present study using biochemical and electrophysiological methods. We find that oxidative inactivation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN by As(2)O(3) enhances cardiac calcium currents in the therapeutic concentration range via a PI3Kα-dependent increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) production. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, even a modest reduction in PTEN activity is sufficient to increase cellular PIP(3) levels. Under control conditions, PIP(3) levels are kept low by PTEN and do not affect calcium current amplitudes. Based on pharmacological experiments and intracellular infusion of PIP(3), we propose that in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, PIP(3) regulates calcium currents independently of the protein kinase Akt along a pathway that includes a secondary oxidation-sensitive target. Overall, our report describes a novel form of acquired long QT syndrome where the target modified by As(2)O(3) is an intracellular signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1976459377,"We have demonstrated previously that IFN-γ plays a protective role in the initiation of chronic intestinal inflammation through attenuation of Toll-like receptor-mediated IL-23 induction in macrophages. Here, an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) is identified in a region of conserved nucleotide sequences in the Il23a promoter. This ISRE mediated, in part, Il23a promoter induction by LPS and inhibition of LPS-induced activity by IFN-γ. LPS and IFN-γ recruit interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) to the Il23a ISRE in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Functionally, IRF-1 is a negative regulator of Il23a in LPS-stimulated BMMs. IRF-1(-/-) BMMs demonstrated enhanced LPS-induced Il23a expression compared with WT BMMs. Moreover, IRF-1 deficiency resulted in prolonged occupancy of RelA on the Il23a promoter. Consequently, IRF-1(-/-) mice were more susceptible to colonic injury by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, and IL-10/IRF-1 double-deficient (IL-10/IRF-1(-/-)) mice demonstrated more severe colonic inflammation compared with IL-10(-/-) mice. The severity of colitis in both models correlated with increased colonic IL-23. CD11b(+) lamina propria mononuclear cells, comprising predominantly macrophages, were identified as the major source of IL-23 in colitis-prone mice. Basal and heat-killed Escherichia coli-stimulated levels of Il23a were increased in IL-10/IRF-1(-/-) compared with WT and IL-10(-/-) colonic CD11b(+) lamina propria mononuclear cells. In conclusion, these experiments characterize IRF-ISRE interactions on the Il23a promoter, which have in vivo relevance as a homeostatic checkpoint in chronic intestinal inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2070782699,"By transporting serotonin (5-HT) into neurons and other cells, serotonin transporter (SERT) modulates the action of 5-HT at cell surface receptors. SERT itself is modulated by several processes, including the cGMP signaling pathway. Activation of SERT by cGMP requires the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Here we show that in HeLa cells lacking endogenous PKG, expression of PKGIα or PKGIβ was required for 8-bromoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) to stimulate SERT phosphorylation and 5-HT influx. Catalytically inactive PKG mutants and wild-type PKGII did not support this stimulation. However, a mutant PKGII (G2A) that was not myristoylated substituted for functional PKGI, suggesting that myristoylation and subsequent membrane association blocked productive interaction with SERT. PKG also influenced SERT expression and localization. PKGI isoforms increased total and cell surface SERT levels, and PKGII decreased cell surface SERT without altering total expression. Remarkably, these changes did not require 8-Br-cGMP or functional kinase activity and were also observed with a SERT mutant resistant to activation by PKG. Both PKGIα and PKGIβ formed detergent-stable complexes with SERT, and this association did not require catalytic activity. The nonmyristoylated PKGII G2A mutant stimulated SERT expression similar to PKGI isoforms. These results suggest multiple mechanisms by which PKG can modulate SERT and demonstrate that the functional difference between PKG isoforms results from myristoylation of PKGII.

Stimulation of nitric-oxide synthase by A3 activation increased the activity of NO-stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase, leading to activation of PKG. Subsequent studies in cells transfected with SERT showed that generation of NO or addition of 8-bromoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) led to increased SERT phosphorylation and increased activity (9Zhu C.B.

Murphy D.L. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Ramamoorthy S. Samuvel D.J. Buck E.R. Rudnick G. Jayanthi L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11639-11647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, Zhu et al. found an increase in SERT activity and ligand binding in response to activation of A3 receptors or addition of 8-Br-cGMP that was potentiated by sildenafil, an inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase (9Zhu C.B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Zhu C.B. Hewlett W.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Blakely R.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 504: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The association of these effects with an increase in cell surface SERT labeling led the authors to conclude that PKG altered SERT subcellular localization. Furthermore, sensitivity to an inhibitor of p38 MAPK suggested the involvement of this kinase in SERT activation through an increase in catalytic activity (8Zhu C.B. Carneiro A.M. Dostmann W.R.

Although uncertainty remains concerning how PKG stimulates SERT activity, there is general agreement that such activation occurs and that it involves SERT phosphorylation, probably at Thr-276. The I425V SERT mutant, which had higher activity than wild type, was not stimulated by activation of the cGMP signaling pathway (13Kilic F. Murphy D.L. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y.W. Gesmonde J. Ramamoorthy S. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10878-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The increased activity was attributed to a decreased rate of SERT dephosphorylation in the mutant, leading to significant levels of SERT phosphorylation and activation even at basal levels of cGMP (14Zhang Y.W. Gesmonde J. Ramamoorthy S. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10878-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of NO-stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase or PKG in cells expressing SERT I425V (but not wild type) led to a decline in 5-HT transport as the mutant transporter was slowly dephosphorylated (14Zhang Y.W. Gesmonde J. Ramamoorthy S. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10878-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Slower dephosphorylation of I425V was not due to a decrease in association of protein phosphatase 2A. This enzyme was found to associate to a greater degree with SERT activated by 8-Br-cGMP or by the I425V mutation (14Zhang Y.W. Gesmonde J. Ramamoorthy S. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10878-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PKG is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase found in a variety of eukaryotes. Two PKG genes encode PKGI and PKGII. PKGI is encoded by two alternatively spliced mRNAs that produce the isoforms PKGIα and PKGIβ, which differ in their N terminus. PKG Iα and Iβ are soluble proteins, whereas PKGII, encoded by a separate gene, is anchored at the plasma membrane by myristoylation of Gly-2 after removal of the N-terminal methionine residue (19Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Myristoylation and consequent membrane targeting of PKGII are required for its ability to phosphorylate several proteins including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel (20Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Tilly B.C. Houtsmuller A.B. Ehlert E.M. Bot A.G. Edixhoven M. Boomaars W.E. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Structurally, PKG is a homodimer consisting of a typical protein kinase domain at the C terminus, a regulatory domain that binds cGMP, and an N-terminal heptad leucine/isoleucine repeat responsible for dimerization and interaction with substrates (21Lincoln T.M. Komalavilas P. Boerth N.J. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Cornwell T.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 305-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Both PKGI and PKGII are predominantly present in most brain regions and play critical roles in the regulation of brain function (24Geiselhöringer A. Gaisa M. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25el-Husseini A.E. Bladen C. Vincent S.R. J.

Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 27-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Steiner et al. recently investigated the interaction between PKG isoforms and SERT (27Steiner J.A. Carneiro A.M. Wright J. Matthies H.J. Prasad H.C. Nicki C.K. Dostmann W.R. Buchanan C.C. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Blakely R.D. Mol. Brain. 2009; 2: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Their work provided evidence for co-localization of PKGI (but not PKGII) with SERT in cell bodies and processes of RN46A cultured neurons. They also showed that inhibiting PKGI expression or function blocked the ability of 8-Br-cGMP to stimulate SERT activity and that PKGIα and SERT form a stable complex when transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells (27Steiner J.A. Carneiro A.M. Wright J. Matthies H.J. Prasad H.C. Nicki C.K. Dostmann W.R. Buchanan C.C. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Blakely R.D. Mol. Brain. 2009; 2: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we establish that the molecular basis of PKG specificity is the myristoylation of PKGII but not PKGI isoforms. Furthermore, we extend the previous findings to demonstrate that PKG has two isoform-specific effects on SERT: 1) an increase in 5-HT influx that requires a catalytically active kinase and a phosphate acceptor residue on SERT and 2) an effect of PKG on SERT expression that is independent of phosphorylation. Recombinant VTF7-3 vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase was prepared as described previously (28Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 8-Br-cGMP, 5-HT, monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, and 3 × FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS was from Alexis. [3H]5-HT (27.1 Ci/mmol) and carrier-free 32Pi (8500–9120 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The expression plasmids for human vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), PKGIα, PKGIα K390A, PKGIβ, PKGIβ K405A, PKGII, PKGII K482A, and mouse 16C2 monoclonal antibody against phospho-VASP were generous gifts from Dr. S. Lohmann (Institute for Clinical Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University of Würzburg, Germany). Goat anti-PKGIα/β (C-17) and anti-PKGII (N-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The mutated region was excised and subcloned back into the parental construct and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For SERT immunoprecipitation, a C-terminal FLAG-tagged hSERT construct in pcDNA 3.1 was generated. Tagged SERT did not differ in transport rate or kinetics from wild-type SERT. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were plated in 96-well or 6-well culture plates and allowed to grow overnight. The confluent cells were infected with VTF7-3 and transiently transfected, using Lipofectin, with plasmids bearing hSERT or PKG cDNAs or both under the control of T7 promoter. Transfected cells were incubated for 20–22 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and used for further analysis. Protein concentration was determined with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Transfected HeLa cells were incubated at room temperature with or without 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP treatment for 20 min. 5-HT influx was initiated by the addition of 20 nm [3H]5-HT in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM), and the incubation was continued for 10 min. The assay was terminated by washing with ice-cold PBS buffer. The cells were then solubilized, and the extent of [3H]5-HT accumulation was determined by scintillation counting. Saturation kinetic analyses for 5-HT Km and Vmax were performed over a concentration range of 0.02–5 μm 5-HT by adding unlabeled 5-HT to a constant amount of [3H]5-HT. HeLa cells expressing WT PKGII or its mutants (G2A or K482A) were collected after overnight transfection and resuspended in PBS buffer. The cells were then lysed by two cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication, and the resulting homogenates were fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were collected and stored at −80 °C in 0.1-ml aliquots for further use. Surface expression of SERT was determined using the membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) as described previously (29Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, cell surface proteins were labeled at 4 °C with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and isolated from the cell extracts with immobilized streptavidin (Pierce). SERT was detected in the pool of surface proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using SERT-specific antibody (provided generously by Dr. S. Ramamoorthy, Medical University of South Carolina). A HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used to visualize the signal by Super Signal West Femto (Pierce). For comparing total SERT expression, the 68 kDa band of core-glycosylated SERT was quantified as described below. For comparisons of surface SERT, the 95 kDa band of mature SERT was quantified. Approximately 4 × 105 cells co-expressing FLAG-tagged SERT and the indicated PKG isoforms or their inactive mutants were incubated with 1.0 mCi/ml carrier-free 32Pi for 60 min prior to the addition of PKG activators or inhibitors. After incubation for another 30 min with modulators, the cells were washed and then lysed with 800 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100), and SERT was captured by 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, 50% suspension in lysis buffer). The gel was washed five times with lysis buffer and then eluted with 50 μl of 150 ng/μl 3 × FLAG peptide (Sigma). The entire eluted sample was applied to SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled SERT was detected by autoradiography. Samples of total lysates for gel electrophoresis contained 20 μg of protein, corresponding to ∼104 cells. For co-immunoprecipitations, samples prepared from ∼4 × 105 cells (800 μg) expressing FLAG-tagged SERT were lysed with lysis buffer, and the detergent extracts were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubating with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for an additional 1 h at 20 °C. The immunoadsorbents were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer before elution with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein samples (50 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 4–15% linear gradient gel, transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with specific antibodies as indicated. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence and quantified using a UVP Laboratory Imaging and Analysis System. This immunoprecipitation method typically leads to mild SERT aggregation and an anomalously low mobility on SDS-PAGE (compare Fig. 6 with FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5).FIGURE 5PKG isoform specificity for SERT phosphorylation. A and B, HeLa cells were transfected with C-terminal FLAG-tagged SERT wild type or T276A together with PKGI (A) or PKGII (B) isoforms or catalytically inactive mutants. Cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi for 60 min, 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min followed by immunoprecipitation as described in the Fig. 4 legend. The autoradiograms shown are representative of three experiments. C, quantitation of phospho-SERT band densities is shown. Relative intensities of 32P-labeled SERT bands were averages from three phosphorylation experiments. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. (error bars).

HeLa cells expressing C-terminal FLAG-tagged SERT alone or with wild-type PKGIα were incubated with 1.0 mCi/ml 32Pi for 60 min, and then 8-Br-cGMP was added at a concentration of 100 μm as indicated and incubated for an additional 30 min. The specific PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, was added where indicated at a concentration of 100 μm and incubated for 30 min prior to 8-Br-cGMP treatment. The cells were then washed and solubilized, and SERT was captured by immunoprecipitation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 32P incorporation into SERT was detected by autoradiography. The mobility of the principal SERT band in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 corresponds to a molecular mass of about 95 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting algorithm. The statistical analysis given was from multiple experiments. Data with error bars represent the mean ± S.E. for multiple experiments. Statistical analyses comparing control and experimental conditions were performed using Student's paired t tests. To investigate the action of individual PKG isoforms on SERT, we took advantage of the observation that cells in culture tend to lose expression of endogenous PKGs within a few cell divisions (30Smolenski A. Burkhardt A.M. Eigenthaler M. Butt E. Gambaryan S. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 358: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR and functional assays of PKG activity, we selected HeLa cells deficient in the expression of all PKG isoforms (data not shown) and then transfected cells with cDNAs encoding individual PKG isoforms and mutants. To confirm functional expression, we co-transfected each PKG cDNA together with cDNA encoding VASP, a substrate for all PKG isoforms. Cells co-expressing PKG and VASP were treated with 8-Br-cGMP, and PKG-dependent VASP phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (16C2) specific for phosphorylated VASP (31Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Hönig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). 16C2 immunoreactivity indicates VASP phosphorylation at serines 157 and 239, two PKG-preferred phosphorylation sites in VASP (32Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis showed that all wild-type PKGs and a nonmyristoylated PKGII mutant, G2A, phosphorylated VASP (Fig. 1). In contrast, no phosphorylation was detected when VASP was co-transfected with catalytically inactive PKG mutants PKGIα K390A, PKGIβ K405A, and PKGII K482A (33Gambaryan S. Butt E. Marcus K. Glazova M. Palmetshofer A. Guillon G. Smolenski A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29640-29648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). VASP phosphorylation was not observed in nontransfected cells or cells expressing VASP alone. Furthermore, PKG- and 8-Br-cGMP-dependent VASP phosphorylation in these cells was inhibited by the PKG specific inhibitor, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that 8-Br-cGMP stimulated the transport rate (Vmax) for SERT, and this stimulation required co-expression of functional PKG. 8-Br-cGMP did not stimulate SERT activity in cells co-expressing inactive PKG mutants PKGIα K390A, PKGIβ K405A, or PKGII K482A, consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation in SERT activation. In contrast, 8-Br-cGMP did not activate SERT co-expressed with PKGII. However, the G2A mutant, which is not myristoylated, stimulated SERT in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP, suggesting that myristoylation blocked the ability of PKGII to activate SERT, possibly by anchoring PKGII to the membrane. No marked change in the Km for 5-HT was observed in these experiments (data not shown). Myristoylation of PKGII occurs through modification of Gly-2 by the covalent attachment of myristate following removal of the initiator methionine residue by cellular methionyl aminopeptidases, a modification that promotes association of the enzyme with cell membranes (19Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutation of Gly-2 to alanine blocks this modification and renders the mutant largely soluble. Fig. 3 shows Western blotting results demonstrating the effect of mutating Gly-2 and Lys-482 to alanine on the distribution of PKGII between cytosolic and membrane fractions after sedimentation of membranes from cell homogenates. Total expression levels of PKGII mutants, K482A and G2A, were comparable with that of wild type (leftmost three lanes). Wild type PKGII (WT) and K482A were highly enriched in the precipitate (M), with negligible amounts in the supernatant fraction (C). However, distribution of the G2A mutant was dramatically different, with the majority of enzyme found in the cytosolic supernatant fraction (C), although a significant amount of G2A was found associated with the membranes (M), possibly due to specific association with SERT and other membrane proteins as observed by Steiner et al. for PKGI isoforms (27Steiner J.A. Carneiro A.M. Wright J. Matthies H.J. Prasad H.C. Nicki C.K. Dostmann W.R. Buchanan C.C. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Blakely R.D. Mol. Brain. 2009; 2: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine which PKG isoforms phosphorylated SERT, we measured 32P incorporation into co-expressed SERT in cells metabolically labeled with 32PO43−. 32P-labeled, C-terminal FLAG-tagged SERT was measured by immunocapture with an anti-FLAG M2 affinity agarose gel and autoradiographic detection. In PKG-deficient cells, only basal phosphorylation of SERT was detected, and 8-Br-cGMP did not increase the phosphorylation level (Fig. 4). However, 32P incorporation was markedly increased by 8-Br-cGMP when SERT was co-expressed with PKGIα. Moreover, SERT phosphorylation by PKGIα was blocked by the PKG inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS. Of interest is that 32"
https://openalex.org/W1989919169,"Ube2g2 is a human ubiquitin conjugating (E2) enzyme involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, which is responsible for the identification and degradation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment. The Ube2g2-specific role is the assembly of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which constitutes a signal for proteasomal degradation when attached to a substrate protein. NMR chemical shift perturbation and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement approaches were employed to characterize the binding interaction between Ube2g2 and ubiquitin, Lys-48-linked diubiquitin, and Lys-63-linked diubiquitin. Results demonstrate that ubiquitin binds to Ube2g2 with an affinity of 90 μM in two different orientations that are rotated by 180° in models generated by the RosettaDock modeling suite. The binding of Ube2g2 to Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked diubiquitin is primarily driven by interactions with individual ubiquitin subunits, with a clear preference for the subunit containing the free Lys-48 or Lys-63 side chain (i.e. the distal subunit). This preference is particularly striking in the case of Lys-48-linked diubiquitin, which exhibits an ∼3-fold difference in affinities between the two ubiquitin subunits. This difference can be attributed to the partial steric occlusion of the subunit whose Lys-48 side chain is involved in the isopeptide linkage. As such, these results suggest that Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains may be designed to bind certain proteins like Ube2g2 such that the terminal ubiquitin subunit carrying the reactive Lys-48 side chain can be positioned properly for chain elongation regardless of chain length."
