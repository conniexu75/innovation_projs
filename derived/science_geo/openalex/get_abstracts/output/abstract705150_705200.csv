https://openalex.org/W4310700150,"CrCoNi-based medium- and high-entropy alloys display outstanding damage tolerance, especially at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we examined the fracture toughness values of the equiatomic CrCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi alloys at 20 kelvin (K). We found exceptionally high crack-initiation fracture toughnesses of 262 and 459 megapascal-meters½ (MPa·m½) for CrMnFeCoNi and CrCoNi, respectively; CrCoNi displayed a crack-growth toughness exceeding 540 MPa·m½ after 2.25 millimeters of stable cracking. Crack-tip deformation structures at 20 K are quite distinct from those at higher temperatures. They involve nucleation and restricted growth of stacking faults, fine nanotwins, and transformed epsilon martensite, with coherent interfaces that can promote both arrest and transmission of dislocations to generate strength and ductility. We believe that these alloys develop fracture resistance through a progressive synergy of deformation mechanisms, dislocation glide, stacking-fault formation, nanotwinning, and phase transformation, which act in concert to prolong strain hardening that simultaneously elevates strength and ductility, leading to exceptional toughness."

A key barrier to bnAb induction is vaccine priming of rare bnAb-precursor B cells. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial, the HIV vaccine–priming candidate eOD-GT8 60mer adjuvanted with AS01 B had a favorable safety profile and induced VRC01-class bnAb precursors in 97% of vaccine recipients with median frequencies reaching 0.1% among immunoglobulin G B cells in blood. bnAb precursors shared properties with bnAbs and gained somatic hypermutation and affinity with the boost. The results establish clinical proof of concept for germline-targeting vaccine priming, support development of boosting regimens to induce bnAbs, and encourage application of the germline-targeting strategy to other targets in HIV and other pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4310700336,"Neurons harbor high levels of single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) that are targeted to neuronal enhancers, but the source of this endogenous damage remains unclear. Using two systems of postmitotic lineage specification—induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons and transdifferentiated macrophages—we show that thymidine DNA glycosylase (TDG)–driven excision of methylcytosines oxidized with ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET) is a source of SSBs. Although macrophage differentiation favors short-patch base excision repair to fill in single-nucleotide gaps, neurons also frequently use the long-patch subpathway. Disrupting this gap-filling process using anti-neoplastic cytosine analogs triggers a DNA damage response and neuronal cell death, which is dependent on TDG. Thus, TET-mediated active DNA demethylation promotes endogenous DNA damage, a process that normally safeguards cell identity but can also provoke neurotoxicity after anticancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4310705874,"We introduce DeepNash, an autonomous agent that plays the imperfect information game Stratego at a human expert level. Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that artificial intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. It is a game characterized by a twin challenge: It requires long-term strategic thinking as in chess, but it also requires dealing with imperfect information as in poker. The technique underpinning DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego through self-play from scratch. DeepNash beat existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a year-to-date (2022) and all-time top-three ranking on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players."
https://openalex.org/W4310777588,"Monitoring of cell-cell communication in multicellular organisms is fundamental to understanding diverse biological processes such as embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. To track cell-cell contacts in vivo, we developed an intercellular genetic technology to monitor cell-cell contact and to trace cell contact histories by permanently marking contacts between cells. In mice, we engineered an artificial Notch ligand into one cell (the sender cell) and an artificial receptor into another cell (the receiver cell). Contact between the sender and receiver cells triggered a synthetic Notch signaling that activated downstream transcriptional programs in the receiver cell, thereby transiently or permanently labeling it. In vivo cell-cell contact was observed during development, tissue homeostasis, and tumor growth. This technology may be useful for studying dynamic in vivo cell-cell contacts and cell fate plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W4310775269,"In recent years, there has been notable progress in the preparation and control of ultracold gases of diatomic molecules. The next experimental challenge is the production of ultracold polyatomic molecular gases. Here, we report the creation of an ultracold gas of 23Na40K2 triatomic molecules from a mixture of ground-state sodium-23-potassium-40 (23Na40K) molecules and potassium-40 (40K) atoms. The triatomic molecules were created by adiabatic magneto-association through an atom-diatomic molecule Feshbach resonance. We obtained clear evidence for the creation of triatomic molecules by directly detecting them using radio-frequency dissociation. Approximately 4000 triatomic molecules with a high-peak phase-space density of 0.05 could be created. The ultracold triatomic molecules can serve as a launchpad to probe the three-body potential energy surface and may be used to prepare quantum degenerate triatomic molecular gases."
https://openalex.org/W4310702839,"Legume-rhizobium symbiosis in root nodules fixes nitrogen to satisfy the plant's nitrogen demands. The nodules' demand for energy is thought to determine nitrogen fixation rates. How this energy state is sensed to modulate nitrogen fixation is unknown. Here, we identified two soybean (Glycine max) cystathionine β-synthase domain-containing proteins, nodule AMP sensor 1 (GmNAS1) and NAS1-associated protein 1 (GmNAP1). In the high-nodule energy state, GmNAS1 and GmNAP1 form homodimers that interact with the nuclear factor-Y C (NF-YC) subunit (GmNFYC10a) on mitochondria and reduce its nuclear accumulation. Less nuclear GmNFYC10a leads to lower expression of glycolytic genes involved in pyruvate production, which modulates phosphoenolpyruvate allocation to favor nitrogen fixation. Insight into these pathways may help in the design of leguminous crops that have improved carbon use, nitrogen fixation, and growth."
https://openalex.org/W4310506606,"This paper presents the design of a triband antenna that can be electronically configured to operate at different frequencies. The proposed antenna is design to operate at sub-6GHz bands at 2.45 GHz (ISM, Wi-Fi, and WLAN), 3.3, 3.5 &amp; 3.9 GHz (WiMAX), and 4.1 &amp; 4.9 GHz (4G &amp; 5G). This is achieved by connecting two open-ended stubs to a modified triangular patch radiator using PIN diodes. The antenna’s performance was optimized using a 3D electromagnetic solver and its performance was verified through measurements. Moreover, the conformal analysis done on the antenna shows that the proposed technique can be used in moderately flexible wireless devices without compromising the antenna’s gain, radiation efficiency and radiation patterns. These characteristics makes the proposed antenna applicable for various wireless communication systems and devices."
https://openalex.org/W4310703717,"Topological photonics provides a powerful platform to explore topological physics beyond traditional electronic materials and shows promising applications in light transport and lasers. Classical degrees of freedom are routinely used to construct topological light modes in real or synthetic dimensions. Beyond the classical topology, the inherent quantum nature of light provides a wealth of fundamentally distinct topological states. Here we implement experiments on topological states of quantized light in a superconducting circuit, with which one- and two-dimensional Fock-state lattices are constructed. We realize rich topological physics including topological zero-energy states of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, strain-induced pseudo-Landau levels, valley Hall effect, and Haldane chiral edge currents. Our study extends the topological states of light to the quantum regime, bridging topological phases of condensed-matter physics with circuit quantum electrodynamics, and offers a freedom in controlling the quantum states of multiple resonators."
https://openalex.org/W4311071065,"Seismic tomography has provided key insight into Yellowstone's crustal magmatic system that includes attempts to understand the melt distribution in the subsurface and the current stage of the volcano's life cycle. We present new tomographic images of the shear wave speed of the Yellowstone magmatic system based on full waveform inversion of ambient noise correlations, which illuminates shear wave speed reductions of greater than 30% associated with Yellowstone's silicic magma reservoir. The slowest seismic wave speeds (shear wave speed less than 2.3 kilometers per second) are present at depths between 3 and 8 kilometers, overlapping with petrological estimates of the assembly depth of erupted rhyolite bodies. Assuming that Yellowstone's magmatic system is a crystal mush with broadly distributed melt, we estimate a partial melt fraction of 16 to 20%."
https://openalex.org/W4308430751,"The summers of 2019, 2020, and 2021 experienced unprecedented fire activity in northeastern Siberia, driven by record high spring and summer temperatures. Many of these fires burned in permafrost peatlands within the Arctic Circle. We show that early snowmelt together with an anomalous Arctic front jet over northeastern Siberia promoted unusually warm and dry surface conditions, followed by anomalously high lightning and fire activity. Since 1966, spring snowmelt has started 1.7 days earlier each decade. Moreover, Arctic front jet occurrences in summer have more than tripled in frequency over the last 40 years. These interconnected climatological drivers promote extreme fire activity in eastern Siberia, including a northward shift of fires, which may accelerate the degradation of carbon-rich permafrost peatlands."
https://openalex.org/W4310522456,"Introduction Hospital-acquired infections endanger millions of lives around the world, and nurses play a vital role in the prevention of these infections. Knowledge of infection prevention and control (IPC) best practices among nurses is a prerequisite to maintaining standard precautions for the safety of patients. Aim The study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards IPC including associated factors among the nurses of a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh. Methods We conducted this hospital-based cross-sectional study from October 2017 to June 2018 at Dhaka Medical College Hospital among 300 nurses working in all departments. We calculated three KAP scores for each participant reflecting their current state of knowledge and compliance towards IPC measures. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine KAP scores among nurses and their associated factors. Results Average scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 18.6, 5.4, and 15.5 (out of 26, 7, and 24), respectively. The study revealed that the majority (85.2%) of the nurses had a good to moderate level of knowledge, half (51%) of them showed positive attitudes, and only one fifth (17.1%) of the nurses displayed good practices in IPC. The respondents’ age, education, monthly income and years of experience were found to have statistical associations with having moderate to adequate level of KAP scores. Aged and experienced nurses were found more likely to have poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude toward IPC practices. Conclusion The majority of nurses had good IPC knowledge, but their practices did not reflect that knowledge. In particular, nurses needed to improve the proper IPC practice for better patient care and to protect themselves. Regular IPC training and practice monitoring can enhance the IPC practice among nurses."
https://openalex.org/W4310530399,"Developing countries have been facing difficulties in reaching out to low-income and underserved communities for COVID-19 vaccination coverage. The rapidity of vaccine development caused a mistrust among certain subgroups of the population, and hence innovative approaches were taken to reach out to such populations. Using a sample of 1760 respondents in five low-income, informal localities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan, we evaluated a set of interventions involving community engagement by addressing demand and access barriers. We used multi-level mixed effects models to estimate average treatment effects across treatment areas. We found that our interventions increased COVID-19 vaccine willingness in two treatment areas that are furthest from city centers by 7.6% and 6.6% respectively, while vaccine uptake increased in one of the treatment areas by 17.1%, compared to the control area. Our results suggest that personalized information campaigns such as community mobilization help to increase COVID-19 vaccine willingness. Increasing uptake however, requires improving access to the vaccination services. Both information and access may be different for various communities and therefore a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may need to be better localized. Such underserved and marginalized communities are better served if vaccination efforts are contextualized."

https://openalex.org/W4310710437,"Cells need to detect and degrade faulty membrane proteins to maintain homeostasis. In this study, we identify a previously unknown function of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC)-the enzyme that removes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptides-as a membrane protein quality control factor. We show that the SPC cleaves membrane proteins that fail to correctly fold or assemble into their native complexes at otherwise hidden cleavage sites, which our study reveals to be abundant in the human membrane proteome. This posttranslocational cleavage synergizes with ER-associated degradation to sustain membrane protein homeostasis and contributes to cellular fitness. Cryptic SPC cleavage sites thus serve as predetermined breaking points that, when exposed, help to target misfolded or surplus proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining a healthy membrane proteome."
https://openalex.org/W4310506596,"Due to the huge number of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices within a network, denial of service and flooding attacks on networks are on the rise. IoT devices are disrupted and denied service because of these attacks. In this study, we proposed a novel hybrid meta-heuristic adaptive particle swarm optimization-whale optimizer algorithm (APSO-WOA) for optimization of the hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network (APSO-WOA-CNN). The APSO-WOA optimization algorithm's fitness value is defined as the validation set's cross-entropy loss function during CNN model training. In this study, we compare our optimization algorithm with other optimization algorithms, such as the APSO algorithm, for optimization of the hyperparameters of CNN. In model training, the APSO-WOA-CNN algorithm achieved the best performance compared to the FNN algorithm, which used manual parameter settings. We evaluated the APSO-WOA-CNN algorithm against APSO-CNN, SVM, and FNN. The simulation results suggest that APSO-WOA-CNf[N is effective and can reliably detect multi-type IoT network attacks. The results show that the APSO-WOA-CNN algorithm improves accuracy by 1.25%, average precision by 1%, the kappa coefficient by 11%, Hamming loss by 1.2%, and the Jaccard similarity coefficient by 2%, as compared to the APSO-CNN algorithm, and the APSO-CNN algorithm achieves the best performance, as compared to other algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4311069539,"Vultures comprise one of the most threatened groups of birds worldwide. With a total population not exceeding 6700 mature individuals, and in rapid decline across its range, the Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) is listed as a Vulnerable species in the IUCN red list. Local population extinctions and decline are of particular concern in northern South America, where no more than 340 condors may exist at present. Despite this, no quantitative assessments exist in Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela regarding the threats affecting Andean Condor populations. To address this, we compiled records of Andean Condors injured, or killed, between 1979 and 2021. We obtained data of 164 condors affected by different causes of injury, of which 83.5% were reported in Ecuador, 15.2% in Colombia, and 1.2% in Venezuela. Of the total number, 84.7% of the injured individuals died. Between 1979 and 2021, in Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, at least 103 Andean Condors were presumably poisoned, 22 were shot, and 39 individuals were affected by other causes. The total number of individuals affected by different causes represents between 48% and 72% of the total population estimated in northern South America. Of great concern is the fact that, between 2007 and 2021, poisoning and shooting together caused the loss of 19-31% of the estimated population of condors in Ecuador, and 7-21% of the estimated population in Colombia. Given the important mortality induced by humans, environmental education programs, socio-ecological research, application of environmental laws, and management strategies based on scientific evidence to prevent and mitigate human-wildlife conflicts are urgently required for effective Andean Condor conservation in northern South America."
https://openalex.org/W4310500740,"To evaluate the prognostic impact of lymph node dissection (LND) in patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) with bladder cuff excision (BCE) for clinically node-negative (cN0) upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).We retrospectively enrolled 520 patients with cN0 UTUC in a single tertiary referral center from 2000 to 2015. The patients were divided into three groups: patients with and without pathologically proved lymph node metastasis (pN1-3 and pN0, respectively) and patients without LND (pNx). We analyzed associations between overall survival (OS)/ disease-free survival (DFS)/ cancer-specific survival (CSS) and clinical characteristics.The patients were divided into three groups (pN1-3, pN0 and pNx with 20, 303, and 197 patients, respectively). OS/DFS/CSS in the pN1-3 group were significantly worse (all p<0.001) compared with the pN0 group. However, there were no significant differences between the pNx and pN0 groups. In the multivariate analyses, CSS was only affected by age [(hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, p = 0.008]), positive surgical margin (HR = 3.38, p<0.001) and pathological T3-4 stages (HR = 4.07, p<0.001). In the subgroup analyses for patients with LND, locally advanced disease (pT3 and pT4) had significantly more metastases [T3-4: 13.91% (16/115) vs. T0-2: 1.92% (4/208), p<0.001].In the pN0 group, LND for cN0 UTUC did not show therapeutic benefits in terms of DFS, CSS, and OS. However, LND with RNU allowed optimal tumor staging, through patients still had a poor prognosis. Clinically occult LN metastases were found in 6.2% of our patients."
https://openalex.org/W4310530576,"Purpose To evaluate the concentrations of brimonidine and timolol in the vitreous and aqueous humors after instillation of a 0.1% brimonidine tartrate and 0.5% timolol fixed-combination ophthalmic solution. Methods This single-arm open-label interventional study included patients with macular holes or idiopathic epiretinal membranes who were scheduled for vitrectomy. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A 0.1% brimonidine tartrate and 0.5% timolol fixed-combination ophthalmic solution was administered topically twice daily for 1 week preoperatively. The vitreous and aqueous humors were sampled before vitrectomy, and brimonidine and timolol concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem spectrometry. This study was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT, ID jRCTs051200008; date of access and registration: April 28, 2020). The study protocol was approved by the University of Fukui Certified Review Board (CRB) and complied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Results Eight eyes of eight patients (7 phakic eyes and 1 pseudophakic eye) were included in this study. The mean brimonidine concentrations in the vitreous and aqueous humors were 5.04 ± 4.08 nM and 324 ± 172 nM, respectively. Five of the eight patients had brimonidine concentrations &gt;2 nM in the vitreous humor, which is necessary to activate α2 receptors. The mean timolol concentrations in the vitreous and aqueous humors were 65.6 ± 56.0 nM and 3,160 ± 1,570 nM, respectively. Brimonidine concentrations showed significant positive correlations with timolol concentrations in the vitreous humor (P &lt; 0.0001, R 2 = 0.97) and aqueous humor (P &lt; 0.0001, R 2 = 0.96). Conclusions The majority of patients who received a 0.1% brimonidine tartrate and 0.5% timolol topical fixed-combination ophthalmic solution showed a brimonidine concentration &gt;2 nM in the vitreous humor. Brimonidine and timolol may be distributed in the ocular tissues through an identical pathway after topical instillation."
https://openalex.org/W4310530665,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy accounting for approximately 10% of hematological malignancies. Identification of reliable biomarkers for better diagnosis and prognosis remains a major challenge. This study aimed to identify potential serum prognostic biomarkers corresponding to MM disease activity and evaluate their impact on patient outcomes. Serum proteomic profiles of patients with MM and age-matched controls were performed using LC–MS/MS. In the verification and validation phases, the concentration of the candidate biomarkers was measured using an ELISA technique. In addition, the association of the proposed biomarkers with clinical outcomes was assessed. We identified 23 upregulated and 15 downregulated proteins differentially expressed in newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM patients compared with MM patients who achieved at least a very good partial response to treatment (≥VGPR). The top two candidate proteins, metastasis-associated protein-2 (MTA2) and argonaute-2 (AGO2), were selected for further verification and validation studies. Both MTA2 and AGO2 showed significantly higher levels in the disease-active states than in the remission states ( p &lt; 0.001). Regardless of the patient treatment profile, high MTA2 levels were associated with shorter progression-free survival ( p = 0.044; HR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.02 to 6.02). Conversely, high AGO2 levels were associated with IgG and kappa light-chains isotypes and an occurrence of bone involvement features ( p &lt; 0.05) and were associated with prolonged time to response ( p = 0.045; HR = 3.00; 95% CI, 1.03 to 8.76). Moreover, the analytic results using a publicly available NCBI GEO dataset revealed that AGO2 overexpression was associated with shorter overall survival among patients with MM ( p = 0.032, HR = 1.60, 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.46). In conclusion, MTA2 and AGO2 proteins were first identified as potential biomarkers that reflect disease activity, provide prognostic values and could serve as non-invasive indicators for disease monitoring and outcome predicting among patients with MM."

The aim of the present study was to develop a 3D organotypic model of the pleural mesothelium. Specimens of human pleura parietalis were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany. 3D co-culture model of pleura was established from human pleural mesothelial cells and fibroblasts. The model was compared to human pleura tissue by phase-contrast and light microscopy, immunochemistry and -fluorescence as well as solute permeation test. Histological assessment of the 3D co-culture model displayed the presence of both cell types mimicking the morphology of the human pleura. Vimentin and Cytokeratin, PHD1 showed a similar expression pattern in pleural biopsies and 3D model. Expression of Ki-67 indicates the presence of proliferating cells. Tight junctional marker ZO-1 was found localized at contact zones between mesothelial cells. Each of these markers were expressed in both the 3D co-culture model and human biopsies. Permeability of 3D organotypic co-culture model of pleura was found to be higher for 70 kDa-Dextran and no significant difference was seen in the permeability for small dextran (4 kDa). In summary, the presented 3D organoid of pleura functions as a robust assay for pleural research serving as a precise reproduction of the in vivo morphology and microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W4310506582,"Background Blended learning in DESEC only started after the introduction of the internet in recent 5 years. However, there is still no research paying attention to this region, because the area is remote and research subjects are not easily accessible. This article has potential application value in helping the government and educational institutions to make decisions on blended learning strategies supporting poverty alleviation through education in poor and remote areas and ethnic region. The study will be the first to examine satisfaction and continuance intention of blended learning in the DESEC. Objective To identify junior high students’ perception of satisfaction and continuance intention for blended learning in DESEC. To identify the strongest factors affecting junior high students’ satisfaction and continuance intention of blended learning in DESEC. Methods A subsample of 635 junior high students participated online survey with consent of their parents verbally in computer room in schools under teacher’s instruction. Data was coded and analyzed to generate descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Structural equation model was used to evaluate the model of satisfaction and continuance intention of blended learning. Results The level for evaluating students’ agreement on each of item were interpreted “agree” (3.76–3.89). The model explained variances (R 2 ) of Continuance Intention, Satisfaction and Perceived usefulness were 0.665,0.766,0.718 respectively. Information quality, self-efficacy and confirmation directly and indirectly contribute to junior high students’ satisfaction with blended learning, which further confirmed their continuance intention of blended learning. Conclusion Information quality was the strongest factor affecting the junior high students’ continuance intention of using blended learning, while confirmation was the strongest factor affecting the junior high students’ satisfaction of using blended learning in DESEC. Junior high students do not have a strong and distinct perception on satisfaction and continuance intention for blended learning in DESEC."

It has been administered on different population samples and translated into several languages. Nonetheless, the Italian validation of its situational format is missing, and the present study aimed to fill this gap. To this end, the original English version of the scale was translated into Italian and administered to a sample of 682 Italian healthcare workers (HCWs), during the first wave of COVID-19. The Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (EFA and CFA) were performed and led to the validation of the Italian Brief COPE (I-Brief COPE) scale, consisting of 21 items, loading properly on 6 factors, which range from activation (F1) to deactivation (F2), via social support (F3), humorous reframing (F4), religious/spiritual reliance (F5), substances use (F6). The six factors identified represent, according to our analyses, the relevant dimensions of coping in a stressful situation such as COVID-19. The results of this study reveal that the I-Brief Cope can be considered as a valid tool for measuring coping strategies in facing stressful, unpredictable, and damaging events."
https://openalex.org/W4310530585,"In endometrial cancer, occult high-risk subtypes (rooted in histomorphologically low-risk disease) with insensitivity to adjuvant therapies impede improvements in therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to assess the ability of molecular high-risk (MHR) and low-risk (MLR) ECPPF (E2F1, CCNA2, POLE, PPP2R1A, FBXW7) stratification to profile recurrence in early, low-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) and insensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy or radiotherapy (or both) in high-risk EEC. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas endometrial cancer database, we identified 192 EEC cases with available DNA sequencing and RNA expression data. Molecular parameters were integrated with clinicopathologic risk factors and adverse surveillance events. MHR was defined as high (-H) CCNA2 or E2F1 log2 expression (≥2.75), PPP2R1A mutations (-mu), or FBXW7mu; MLR was defined as low (-L) CCNA2 and E2F1 log2 expression (<2.75). We assessed 164 cases, plus another 28 with POLEmu for favorable-outcomes comparisons. MHR and MLR had significantly different progression-free survival (PFS) rates (P < .001), independent of traditional risk factors (eg, TP53mu), except for stage IV disease. PFS of CCNA2-L/E2F1-L paralleled that of POLEmu. ECPPF status stratified responses to adjuvant therapy in stage III-IV EEC (P < .01) and profiled stage I, grade 1-2 cases with risk of recurrence (P < .001). MHR was associated with CTNNB1mu-linked treatment failures (P < .001). Expression of homologous recombination repair (HR) and cell cycle genes was significantly elevated in CCNA2-H/E2F1-H compared with CCNA2-L/E2F1-L (P<1.0E-10), suggesting that HR deficiencies may underlie the favorable PFS in MLR. HRmu were detected in 20.7%. No treatment failures were observed in high-grade or advanced EEC with HRmu (P = .02). Favorable PFS in clinically high-risk EEC was associated with HRmu and MLR ECPPF (P < .001). In summary, MLR ECPPF and HRmu were associated with therapeutic efficacy in EEC. MHR ECPPF was associated with low-risk, early-stage recurrences and insensitivity to adjuvant therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4311069501,"This study examines the association between time spent watching TV, playing video games, using a computer or handheld device (screen time), and BMI among U.S. adolescents, and potential effect modification of these associations by sex, sleep duration, and physical activity.A secondary analysis of 10-17-year-old participants in the 2016-2017 National Survey of Children's Health was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between parent-reported screen time and BMI categories and effect modification by sex, sleep duration and physical activity.The analysis included 29,480 adolescents (49.4% female). Those with ≥1 hour (vs <1 hour) of TV/video games per day were more likely to be overweight/obese (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1-3 hours = 1.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)1.19, 1.65; aOR ≥4 hours = 2.19; 95% CI 1.73, 2.77). This association was stronger in adolescents who did not meet the guidelines for physical activity (aOR ≥ 4 hours = 3.04; 95% CI: 2.1, 4.4) compared with those who did (aOR ≥ 4 hours = 1.64; 95% CI: 0.72, 3.72). Using computers/handheld devices was associated with a smaller increase in odds of overweight/obesity (aOR ≥4 hours = 1.53; 95% CI:1.19, 1.97).Watching TV or playing video games for ≥1 hour per day is associated with obesity in adolescents who did not meet the guidelines for physical activity. Using computers or handheld devices seems to have a weaker association with BMI compared with TV/video games."

During urological consultation, the physician presented the digital model on a computer and used it to explain the disease and available management options. The experience of patients and physicians was recorded in questionnaires.The main findings were as follows: 308 patients and 47 physicians participated in the study. In the patient group, 96.8% reported an improved level of understanding of prostate disease and 90.6% reported an improved ability to ask questions during consultation. Among the physicians, 91.5% reported improved communication skills and 100% reported an improved ability to obtain patient consent for subsequent treatment. At the same time, 76.6% of physicians noted that using the computer model lengthened the consultation.This exploratory study found that the use of a 3D digital anatomy model in urology consultations was received overwhelmingly favorably by both patients and physicians, and it was perceived to improve the quality of communication between patient and physician. A randomized study is needed to confirm the preliminary findings and further quantify the improvements in the quality of patient-physician communication."

After the first assessment during the first lockdown between April and May 2020, there were monthly follow-ups over 6 months.Out of 203 athletes completing the first survey during the first lockdown, 73 athletes (36%) completed all assessments during the entire 6-month follow-up period. Sports performance and training load decreased during the first lockdown and increased again at the beginning of the second lockdown in October 2020, while symptoms of depression and financial fears showed only a transient increase during the first lockdown. Self-reported injuries and illnesses did not change significantly at any timepoint in the study. Stricter COVID-19 restrictions, as measured by the Government Stringency Index (GSI), were associated with reduced subjective sports performance, as well as lower training intensity, increased financial fears, poorer coping with restrictions, and more depressive symptoms, as measured by the 9-item module of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).This study revealed a negative impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on sports performance, training load and mental health among Swiss elite athletes, while the rate of self-reported injuries and illnesses remained unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W4310506492,"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is used for the determination of gene copy number (GCN). GCNs contribute to human disorders, and characterize copy number variation (CNV). The single laboratory method validations of duplex qPCR assays with hydrolysis probes on CYP21A1P and CYP21A2 genes, residing a CNV (RCCX CNV) and related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, were performed using 46 human genomic DNA samples. We also performed the verifications on 5 qPCR assays for the genetic elements of RCCX CNV; C4A, C4B, CNV breakpoint, HERV-K(C4) CNV deletion and insertion alleles. Precision of each qPCR assay was under 1.01 CV%. Accuracy (relative error) ranged from 4.96±4.08% to 9.91±8.93%. Accuracy was not tightly linked to precision, but was significantly correlated with the efficiency of normalization using the RPPH1 internal reference gene (Spearman's ρ: 0.793-0.940, p>0.0001), ambiguity (ρ = 0.671, p = 0.029) and misclassification (ρ = 0.769, p = 0.009). A strong genomic matrix effect was observed, and target-singleplex (one target gene in one assay) qPCR was able to appropriately differentiate 2 GCN from 3 GCN at best. The analysis of all GCNs from the 7 qPCR assays using a multiplex approach increased the resolution of differentiation, and produced 98% of GCNs unambiguously, and all of which were in 100% concordance with GCNs measured by Southern blot, MLPA and aCGH. We conclude that the use of an internal (in one assay with the target gene) reference gene, the use of allele-specific primers or probes, and the multiplex approach (in one assay or different assays) are crucial for GCN determination using qPCR or other methods."
https://openalex.org/W4310506506,"Silencing Mediator of Retinoid and Thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT; NCoR2) is a transcriptional corepressor (CoR) which has been recognized as an important player in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and in somatic development in mouse embryo. SMRT protein is also widely expressed in mouse connective tissues, for example adipocytes and muscle. We recently reported that mice with global deletion of SMRT develop significant obesity and muscle wasting which are independent from thyroid hormone (TH) signaling and thermogenesis. However, the tissue specific role of SMRT in skeletal muscle is still not clear.To clarify role of SMRT in muscle differentiation, we made myogenic C2C12 clones which lack SMRT protein (C2C12-SKO) by using CRISPR-Cas9. Wild-type C2C12 (C2C12-WT) and C2C12-SKO cells were cultured in differentiation medium, and the resulting gene and protein profiles were compared between the two cell lines both before and after differentiation. We also analyzed muscle tissues which were dissected from whole body SMRT knockout (KO) mice and their controls.We found significant up-regulation of muscle specific β-oxidation markers; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) in the C2C12-SKO cells, suggesting that the cells had a similar gene profile to what is found in exercised rodent skeletal muscle. On the other hand, confocal microscopic analysis showed the significant loss of myotubes in C2C12-SKO cells similar to the morphology found in immature myoblasts. Proteomics analysis also confirmed that the C2C12-SKO cells had higher expression of markers of fibrosis (ex. Collagen1A1; COL1A1 and Fibroblast growth factor-2; FGF-2), indicating the up-regulation of Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor signaling. Consistent with this, treatment with a specific TGF-β receptor inhibitor ameliorated both the defects in myotube differentiation and fibrosis.Taken together, we demonstrate that SMRT functions as a pivotal transcriptional mediator for both β-oxidation and the prevention for the fibrosis via TGF-β receptor signaling in the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. In contrast to the results from C2C12 cells, SMRT does not appear to play a role in adult skeletal muscle of whole body SMRT KO mice. Thus, SMRT plays a significant role in the differentiation of myoblasts."

We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of low-dose and high-dose DOACs in patients with AF with similar baseline characteristics. Methods We used a cohort of hospitalized patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AF after discharge to the community, whose data were stored in the Quebec administrative databases, from 2011 to 2017. Older adults with AF newly prescribed with rivaroxaban (15 or 20 mg) or apixaban (2.5 mg or 5 mg) were classified as under treatment (UT) and intent to treat (ITT). We used an inverse probability treatment weighting study of new users of rivaroxaban and apixaban to address confounding by indication. The primary effectiveness outcome was ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE), while the primary safety outcome was major bleeding (MB). We used Cox proportional models to estimate the marginal hazard ratios (HRs). Findings A total of 1,722 and 4,639 patients used low-dose and standard-dose rivaroxaban, respectively, while 3,833 and 6,773 patients used low-dose and standard-dose apixaban, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of comparative stroke/SE and MB between low-dose and standard-dose rivaroxaban, except for the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which was increased with the low dose in the UT analysis. For apixaban, no difference was found in the bleeding rates, but the risk of stroke/SE (HR: 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38–2.76) and death (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.46–2.70) were greater in the low-dose group than in the standard-dose group in the UT analysis. Similar results were observed for the ITT analysis. Conclusion No significant differences were observed in the effectiveness or safety outcome between low-dose and standard-dose rivaroxaban, except for AMI. However, low-dose apixaban was associated with a greater risk of stroke/SE and death without a reduction in the bleeding rates."
https://openalex.org/W4310506625,"This qualitative exploratory study investigated the embodied experiences and the meanings of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) from the viewer's perspective. ASMR research has been sparse and largely quantitative, assuming it to be a predominantly fixed physiological response of ""tingles"", despite the acronym being rooted in pseudoscience. A qualitative research design was adopted to facilitate the exploratory nature of the study in this under-researched area. In contrast to the mostly survey-based research on ASMR, this study employed semi-structured interviews as a means to understand the lived experience of ASMR and to promote participant agency. Six self-identifying ASMR consumers were recruited using a mixture of snowball and opportunity sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted both in person and using Skype to facilitate transnational data collection. Interview transcripts were analysed using an inductive, data-driven approach to thematic analysis. The analysis suggests that ASMR is felt to provide a social environment of comfort rather than a solely physiological-based experience. Three key themes emerged: who and what defines ASMR? (reflecting the variety of what was classed as ASMR and what content was consumed to produce the response); ""real"" intimacy tailored to me (reflecting the idiosyncratic perception of intimacy made possible through ASMR); and emotional relief on my terms (reflecting the role of ASMR in self-soothing). The present data reflect a rich, complex experience of the ASMR consumer, pointing to potential wider applications and informing further research."
https://openalex.org/W4310506633,"Background Mobile app-based interventions have the potential for wide-reach and therefore may be a useful tool in up-scaling physical activity interventions. In larger-scale interventions, face-to-face assessments are less cost-effective, and researchers often rely on surveys or activity trackers to assess outcomes. However, there is limited evidence of valid muscular fitness assessments that can be self-administered within mHealth interventions. As such, this study will evaluate the concurrent validity of upper and lower body muscular fitness that have been independently assessed by participants via the ecofit app, and face-to-face assessments conducted by a trained researcher. Methods This study compared baseline data from two muscular fitness tests from the ecofit two-armed randomised controlled trial and self-assessed data collected via the ecofit smartphone app (i.e., validated 90-degree push-up and 60-second sit-to-stand test). To assess the concurrent validity, the self-assessed push-up and sit-to-stand tests (i.e., collected via the ecofit app) were correlated using Spearman’s correlation coefficient against the researcher-assessed results (i.e., objective results collected during baseline assessment for the ecofit trial). Bland-Altman plots were also used to allow visualisation of the differences between the self- and research-assessed tests. Results Participants (N = 54) completed the push-up (24.1%) and sit-to-stand (100%) tests within 14-days of receiving the app. The results revealed a strong significant correlation for the push-up test (0.83, p &lt;0.001) and a moderate significant correlation for the sit-to-stand test (0.63, p &lt;0.001). Conclusion This study provides support for the concurrent validity of self-reported upper and lower body muscular fitness assessments (i.e., the push-up and sit-to-stand tests) in mHealth. While these tests may be a feasible option for large scale physical activity interventions, more research is needed to determine the generalisability of these results."
https://openalex.org/W4310506634,"Background Studies assessing the effect of suvorexant on delirium prevention included patients treated before development of delirium, which can introduce immortal time bias. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of suvorexant on delirium, comparing patients treated before the onset of delirium with patients treated within 72h of admission using the same dataset. Methods Data from adult patients admitted to the ICU from August 2018 to July 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. In “any time before” analysis, the incidence of delirium was compared for patients who received suvorexant at any time during their ICU stay (suvorexant) (unless delirium developed before treatment) with patients who either did not receive suvorexant or received suvorexant after development of delirium (control). This design was used in previously published studies. In “within 72h” analysis, the incidence of delirium was compared for patients who received suvorexant within 72 hours of admission (suvorexant) and patients who did not receive suvorexant or received it more than 72 hours after admission (control). Patients who developed delirium during the initial 72 hours were excluded from “within 72h” analysis (N = 799). Results “Within 72h” analysis included 1,255 patients, and “any time before” analysis included 2,054 patients (of 6599 admissions). The unadjusted hazard ratio of “any time before” analysis was 0.16 and the 95% confidence interval was 0.13–0.21 (p&lt;0.01). The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.21, and the 95% confidence interval was 0.16–0.27 (p&lt;0.01). “Within 72h” analysis had an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.54 and the 95% confidence interval was 0.36–0.82 (p&lt;0.01). However, this association lost statistical significance after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.65–1.59, p = 0.93). Conclusion Reducing the effect of immortal time bias led to a significantly reduced effect of suvorexant for the prevention of delirium."
https://openalex.org/W4310506814,"As social media has proliferated, a key aspect to making meaningful connections with people online has been revealing important parts of one’s identity. In this work, we study changes that occur in people’s language use after they share a specific piece of their identity: a depression diagnosis. To do so, we collect data from over five thousand users who have made such a statement, which we refer to as an identity claim. Prior to making a depression identity claim, the Reddit user’s language displays evidence of increasingly higher rates of anxiety, sadness, and cognitive processing language compared to matched controls. After the identity claim, these language markers decrease and more closely match the controls. Similarly, first person singular pronoun usage decreases following the identity claim, which was previously previously found to be indicative of self-focus and associated with depression. By further considering how and to whom people express their identity, we find that the observed longitudinal changes are larger for those who do so in ways that are more correlated with seeking help (sharing in a post instead of a comment; sharing in a mental health support forum). This work suggests that there may be benefits to sharing one’s depression diagnosis, especially in a semi-anonymous forum where others are likely to be empathetic."
https://openalex.org/W4310506817,"To learn how high performing primary care practices organized care for patients with diabetes during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic.Semi-structured interviews were conducted between August 10 and December 10, 2020 with 16 leaders from 11 practices that had top quartile performance measures for diabetes outcomes pre-COVID. Each clinic had completed a similar interview and a survey about the existence of care management systems associated with quality outcomes before the pandemic. Transcript analysis utilized a theoretical thematic analysis at the semantic level.The pandemic disrupted the primary care practices' operations and processes considered important for quality prior to the pandemic, particularly clinic reliance on proactive patient care. Safety concerns resulted from the shift to virtual visits, which produced documentation gaps and led practices to reorder their use of proactive patient care processes. Informal interactions with patients also declined. These practices' challenges were mitigated by technical, informational and operational help from the larger organizations of which they were a part. Care management processes had to accommodate both in-person and virtual visits.These high performing practices demonstrated an ability to adapt their use of proactive patient care processes in pursuing quality outcomes for patients with diabetes during the pandemic. Continued clinic transformation and improvements in quality within primary care depend on the ability to restructure the responsibilities of care team members and their interactions with patients."
https://openalex.org/W4310522390,"Objective To evaluate the technical success rate and complications associated with percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) via percutaneous renal access behind the stone and renal calyx dilation in patients with complex renal stones. Materials and methods From January 2010 to February 2021, we identified 69 patients with 70 complex renal stones who underwent PCN. Complex renal stones were classified as simple (renal pelvis only) (27.1%, 19/70), borderline staghorn (8.6%, 6/70), partial staghorn (51.4%, 36/70), or complete staghorn (12.9%, 9/70). All PCNs were performed under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance using one of two renal-entry techniques: puncture behind the stone (56%, 39/70) or renal calyx dilation (44%, 31/70). Then, we retrospectively evaluated the technical success rates and complications associated with each renal entry access technique. Results The overall technical success rate was 100%, and the complication rate was 20.0% (14/70). For those who underwent renal access behind the stone, the complication rate was 15.4% (6/39), and six patients (six PCNs) had transient gross hematuria. For those who underwent dilated renal calyx entry, the complication rate was 25.8% (8/31), and one patient had significant bleeding complications requiring transfusion. Furthermore, seven patients (seven PCNs) had transient gross hematuria. Overall, the complication rates did not differ between the technique groups (p = 0.279) Conclusion PCN for complex renal stones has a high technical success rate and an acceptable complication rate regardless of the specific technique. Renal entry behind the stone is as safe and feasible as approaching via a dilated renal calyx."
https://openalex.org/W4310522393,"Background Paramedics are routinely exposed to shift work. Existing research shows that shift work exposure is associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes. However, the current understanding of the impact of commencing shift work in a paramedic role on health is limited. This can be addressed by recruiting new paramedics before they commence shift work, and conducting regular follow-ups of potential biological, psychological and social changes. The present study aimed to examine changes in biological, psychological and social factors relative to pre-shift work baseline in a cohort of paramedics commencing intern employment with an Australian ambulance service. Method and analysis This observational, mixed-methods, longitudinal study aims to recruit 40 interns from one Australian ambulance service. Data collection will occur at baseline (standard day schedule for initial training), and subsequently at three months, six months, nine months and twelve months, to measure biological, psychological and social changes relative to baseline measurements. Changes in cardiometabolic markers (cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose), microbiome (self-collected stool samples), sleep and physical activity (actigraphy) will be measured. Interns will also complete a battery of self-report questionnaires, sleep diaries and qualitative interviews to explore various psychological and social variables over time. Statistical analyses will be conducted using mixed effects regression, specifying a random effect of subject on the intercept, allowing participants to vary according to individual baseline levels, as well as tracking progress over time, appropriately accounting for serial correlation. Qualitative study components will be analysed via coding and thematic analysis procedures. Discussion The present study protocol is a comprehensive outline of the observational study planned. The study will allow for greater knowledge of any changes in biological, psychological and social factors during a 12-month transition to shift work. The findings from the proposed study will have implications for the development of strategies to support early-career shift workers."

A regional structure, which was mandated to provide independent support in RM, designed a training package.To study the impact of the RM training package on safety culture (SC) in NHs and drivers for improvement in SC scores.This randomised controlled study targeted French NHs. Inclusion criteria were voluntary participation, no external support provided on the topic of adverse incidents upstream of the project, and the commitment of top management to its implementation. The 61 NHs were randomly allocated to one of two groups: the first benefited from a training package; support was given to the second after the impact measurement. Seven dimensions of SC were measured, at an 18-month interval, using the validated Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture questionnaire (22 items), which was administered to all of the professionals working in NHs. Eleven variables were captured, relating to the structural profile of the NH, the choices of top management in terms of healthcare safety, and the implementation of the system. Further modelling identified predictive factors for changes in SC scores.95% of NHs completed both rounds of the questionnaire. The dimension Feedback and communication about incidents (SC = 85.4% before the intervention) significantly improved (+2.8%; p = 0.044). Improvement in the dimension Overall perceptions of resident safety-organizational learning was close to significant (+3.1%; p = 0.075). Drivers for improvement in scores were a pre-existing quality improvement approach, and a steering group that showed RM leadership.The system appears to have improved several dimensions of SC.

Nurses require specific skills to care for this vulnerable group of patients. At the same time, nurses report feeling inadequate and frustrated when they attempt to establish communication with mechanically ventilated, conscious patients.The purpose of this study was to explore the strategies nurses use when taking care of conscious, intubated patients in the intensive care unit and the barriers they encounter in their effort to communicate.For this study, a qualitative design was employed. Data were collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 intensive care nurses working at ICUs in four different hospitals of Cyprus. The data were analyzed by applying thematic analysis.We identified several strategies of unaided (movements-lips, hands, legs-facial expressions, gestures, touching) and aided forms of communication (pen and paper, boards, tablets, mobiles) used by nurses to communicate with patients. However, barriers to communication were reported by the participating nurses mainly pertaining to patients and nurses' characteristics as well as the ICU environment. The health protocols imposed by the pandemic added more obstacles to the communication between nurses and patients mostly related to the use of protective health equipment.The results of this study point to the difficulties nurses in Cyprus face when trying to communicate with conscious patients during mechanical ventilation. It appears that the lack of nurses' training and of appropriate equipment to facilitate augmentative and alternative communication leave the complex communication needs of critically ill patients unaddressed. However, further research including patients' opinions, after they recover, would bring more clarity on this topic. Our study adds evidence to the communication crisis created by the protective health protocols imposed by the pandemic. As such, it highlights the need to educate nurses in augmentative and alternative ways of communication to address communication with mechanically ventilated, conscious patients during their ICU stay."
https://openalex.org/W4311068694,"This study empirically investigates exclusion induced by institutional ranking in engineering faculty hiring and introduces a cycle of winners and losers formed by privileging graduates of high-ranked institutions in the U.S. higher education system. We analyze and visualize academic origin (i.e., institutions faculty graduated from) and destination (i.e., institutions faculty are hired at) of 5,356 tenure-track faculty in four engineering disciplines of Chemical, Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical at the top 20 and bottom 20 of the top 100 engineering institutions according to the 2022 U.S. News &amp; World Report. Our findings indicate that the hiring of engineering faculty in the U.S. higher education system is skewed in favor of graduates from high-ranked institutions, regardless of the discipline. Concerning each engineering discipline, 78% of electrical, 76% of chemical, 71% of mechanical, and 67% of civil engineering faculty of top 20 ranked institutions have academic origins in the top 20 ranked institutions. This hiring practice fosters inequalities by excluding qualified candidates and cementing the ranking system as the sole factor of academic quality. We bring attention to the pitfalls stemming from the exclusion in the U.S. higher education system, including (1) financial resources, (2) faculty and student resources, (3) selectivity and self-selection, and (4) geography. The cascading effect of the ranking practice is the unintended consequence of inaugurating a virtuous and vicious cycle, which creates a cycle of winners and losers that is difficult to break. High-ranked institutions easily dominate and maintain their ascendancy status in the ranking system as benefactors of the virtuous cycle. Low-ranked institutions are entrapped in the vicious cycle that makes it nearly impossible to (1) attract and retain both students and faculty, (2) secure external funding, (3) obtain resources for new programs, and (4) advance engineering research. Unless the U.S. higher education system is intent on squandering talent, confirming the belief that diversity is symbolic, and cementing the ranking system as the sole factor of academic quality, we recommend faculty hiring beyond the standard sociodemographic indicators and academic origins in hiring decisions. A proactive, open-minded, and neutral approach to the faculty selection process void of decision-making based on affinity should be the central tenet of the selection committee."

A (rat) bioassay-guided physicochemical fractionation using ovine materials yielded via Edman degradation a 14-residue amino acid (aa) sequence. As a 14mer synthetic peptide (EPL001) this displayed antiproliferative and reproduction-modulating activity, while representing only a part of the native polypeptide. Even more unexpectedly, a scrambled-sequence control peptide (EPL030) did likewise.Reproduction has been investigated in the nematode Steinernema siamkayai, using a fermentation system supplemented with different concentrations of exogenous hexapeptides. Peptide structure-activity relationships have also been studied using prostate cancer and other mammalian cells in vitro, with peptides in solution or immobilized, and via the use of mammalian assays in vivo and through molecular modelling.Reproduction increased (x3) in the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema siamkayai after exposure to one synthetic peptide (IEPVFT), while fecundity was reduced (x0.5) after exposure to another (KLKMNG), both effects being dose-dependent. These hexamers are opposite ends of the synthetic peptide KLKMNGKNIEPVFT (EPL030). Bioactivity is unexpected as EPL030 is a control compound, based on a scrambled sequence of the test peptide MKPLTGKVKEFNNI (EPL001). EPL030 and EPL001 are both bioinformatically obscure, having no convincing matches to aa sequences in the protein databases. EPL001 has antiproliferative effects on human prostate cancer cells and rat bone marrow cells in vitro. Intracerebroventricular infusion of EPL001 in sheep was associated with elevated growth hormone in peripheral blood and reduced prolactin. The highly dissimilar EPL001 and EPL030 nonetheless have the foregoing biological effects in common in mammalian systems, while being divergently pro- and anti-fecundity respectively in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Peptides up to a 20mer have also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human cancer and other mammalian cells in vitro, with reproductive upregulation demonstrated previously in fish and frogs, as well as nematodes. EPL001 encodes the sheep neuroendocrine prohormone secretogranin II (sSgII), as deduced on the basis of immunoprecipitation using an anti-EPL001 antibody, with bespoke bioinformatics. Six sSgII residues are key to EPL001's bioactivity: MKPLTGKVKEFNNI. A stereospecific bimodular tri-residue signature is described involving simultaneous accessibility for binding of the side chains of two specific trios of amino acids, MKP & VFN. An evolutionarily conserved receptor is conceptualised having dimeric binding sites, each with ligand-matching bimodular stereocentres. The bioactivity of the 14mer control peptide EPL030 and its hexapeptide progeny is due to the fortuitous assembly of subsets of the novel hormonal motif, MKPVFN, a default reproductive and tissue-building OFF signal."

Understanding the pattrens of unemployment rate is critical now a days and has drawn attention of researcher from all fields of study across the globe. As unemployment plays an important role in the planning of a country's monetary progress for policymakers and researcher. Determining the unemployment rate efficiently required an advance modeling approach. Recently,numerous studies have relied on traditional testing methods to estimate the unemployment rate. Unemployment is usually nonstationary in nature. As a result, demonstrating them using traditional methods will lead to unpredictable results. It needs a hybrid approach to deal with the prediction of unemployment rate in order to deal with the issue associated with traditional techniques. This research primary goal is to examine the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the unemployment rate in selected countries of Asia through advanced hybrid modeling approach, using unemployment data of seven developing countries of Asian: Iran, Sri Lanka; Bangladesh; Pakistan; Indonesia; China; and India,and compare the results with conventional modeling approaches. Finding shows that the hybrid ARIMA-ARNN model outperformed over its competitors for Asia developing economies. In addition, the best fitted model was utilised to predict five years ahead unemployment rate. According to the findings, unemployment will rise significantly in developing economies in the next years, and this will have a particularly severe impact on the region's economies that aren't yet developed."

https://openalex.org/W4311068759,"Facing increasingly severe environmental problems, as the largest developing country, achieving regional carbon emission reduction is the performance of China’s fulfillment of the responsibility of a big government and the key to the smooth realization of the global carbon emission reduction goal. Since China’s carbon emission data is updated slowly, in order to better formulate the corresponding emission reduction strategy, it is necessary to propose a more accurate carbon emission prediction model on the basis of fully analyzing the characteristics of carbon emissions at the provincial and regional levels. Given this, this paper first calculated the carbon emissions of eight economic regions in China from 2005 to 2019 according to relevant statistical data. Secondly, with the help of kernel density function, Theil index and decoupling index, the dynamic evolution characteristics of regional carbon emissions are discussed. Finally, an improved particle swarm optimization radial basis function (IPSO-RBF) neural network model is established to compare the simulation and prediction models of China’s carbon emissions. The results show significant differences in carbon emissions in different regions, and the differences between high-value and low-value areas show an apparent expansion trend. The inter-regional carbon emission difference is the main factor in the overall carbon emission difference. The economic region in the middle Yellow River (ERMRYR) has the most considerable contribution to the national carbon emission difference, and the main contributors affecting the overall carbon emission difference in different regions are different. The number of regions with strong decoupling between carbon emissions and economic development is increasing in time series. The results of the carbon emission prediction model can be seen that IPSO-RBF neural network model optimizes the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, making the prediction result in a minor error and higher accuracy. Therefore, when exploring the path of carbon emission reduction in different regions in the future, the IPSO-RBF neural network model is more suitable for predicting carbon emissions and other relevant indicators, laying a foundation for putting forward more scientific and practical emission reduction plans."
https://openalex.org/W4311069422,"Large-scale national and transnational commercial land transactions, or Large-Scale Land Acquisitions (LSLAs), have been gaining a lot of academic attention since the late 2000s and since the reported rush for land, resulting in turn from an increase in demand for arable land. If many data exist to characterize land deals, the analysis of investment networks remain limited and predominantly portrays power asymmetries between countries from the Global North investing in the Global South. The aim of this work is to perform a deeper investigation on the land trade market, specifically focusing on cases that do not follow such narratives. For instance, almost 25% of the countries included in the transnational land trade network do not follow a strict investor/target dichotomy, thus being characterized by a double role, i.e., they both acquire and cede land in the transnational context. In order to globally acknowledge for what was currently considered as abnormal cases, we model open access data about LSLAs extracted from the Land Matrix Initiative (LMI) open-access database into a network graph, and adapt an eigenvector based centrality method originally conceived for online social networks, namely LurkerRank, to identify and rank anomalous profiles in the land trade market. We take into account three different network snapshots: a multi-sector network (including all the transnational deals in the LMI database), and three networks referring to specific investment sectors (agriculture,mines and biofuels). Experimental results show that emerging economies (e.g., China and Malaysia) play a central role in the land trade market, by creating alternative dynamics that escape the classic North/South one. Our analyses also show how African countries that are often seen as targets of land trade transactions in a specific sector, may often acquire foreign land in the context of investments in the same sector (i.e., Zimbabwe for biofuels and the Democratic Republic of Congo for the mining sector)."
https://openalex.org/W4311069540,"More than 1,300 Canadians are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually, which is nearly preventable through human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization. Across Canada, coverage rates remain below the 90% target set out by the Action Plan for the Elimination of Cervical Cancer in Canada (2020–2030). To support this Plan, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer has commissioned the Urban Public Health Network (UPHN) to coordinate a quality improvement project with Canada’s school-based HPV immunization programs. In Alberta, the UPHN partnered with Alberta Health Services (AHS) for this work. This study has one overarching research question: what are parent/guardian and program stakeholder perceived barriers, enablers and opportunities to immunization for youth as part of the school-based HPV immunization program in Alberta? This study uses a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. A survey will be emailed to a sample of Albertans with children aged 11–17 years. Questions will be based on a Conceptual Framework of Access to Health Care. Subsequent qualitative work will explore the survey’s findings. Parents/guardians identifying as vaccine hesitant in the survey will be invited to participate in virtual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Stakeholders of the school-based immunization program will be purposively sampled from AHS’ five health zones for virtual focus groups. Quantitative data will be analyzed using SAS Studio 3.6 to carry out descriptive statistics and, using logistic regression, investigate if Framework constructs are associated with parents’/guardians’ decision to immunize their children. Qualitative data will be analyzed using NVivo 12 to conduct template thematic analysis guided by the Framework. Study results will provide insights for Alberta’s public health practitioners to make evidence-informed decisions when tailoring the school-based HPV immunization program to increase uptake in vaccine hesitant populations. Findings will contribute to the national study, which will culminate in recommendations to increase HPV immunization uptake nationally and progress towards the 90% coverage target."
https://openalex.org/W4311069545,"The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) test is a crucial technology for cervical cancer prevention because it enables programs to identify women with high-risk HPV infection who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations include cervical cancer screening every three years with cervical cytology alone or every five years with either high-risk HPV testing alone or high-risk HPV testing combined with cytology (co-testing). In Argentina, 7,548 new cervical cancer cases are diagnosed each year with 3,932 deaths attributed to this cause. Our study aims to show the clinical implementation of a cervical cancer screening program by concurrent HPV testing and cervical cytology (co-testing); and to evaluate the possible cervical cancer screening scenarios for Latin America, focusing on their performance and average cost. A cervical cancer screening five year program via co-testing algorithm (Hybrid-2-Capture/cytology) was performed on women aged 30-65 years old at a university hospital. Statistical analysis included a multinomial logistic regression, and two cancer screening classification alternatives were tested (cytology-reflex and HPV-reflex). A total of 2,273 women were included, 91.11% of the participants were double-negative, 2.55% double-positive, 5.90% positive-Hybrid-2-Capture-/negative-cytology, and 0.44% negative-Hybrid-2-Capture/positive-cytology. A thorough follow-up was performed in the positive-Hybrid-2-Capture group. Despite our efforts, 21 (10.93%) were lost, mainly because of changes on their health insurance coverage which excluded them from our screening algorithm. Of the 171 women with positive-Hybrid-2-Capture results and follow-up, 68 (39.77%) cleared the virus infection, 64 (37.43%) showed viral persistence, and 39 (22.81%) were adequately treated after detection via colposcopy/biopsy of histological HSIL (High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion). The prevalence of high-risk HPV in this population was 192 women (8.45%), with HSIL histology detection rates of 17 per 1,000 screened women. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed over the women with positive-Hybrid-2-Capture considering the follow up (clearance, persistence and HSIL) as dependent variable, and the cytology test results (positive- or negative-cytology and Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance, ASC-US) as independent variable. The model supported a direct association between cytology test results and follow up: negative-cytology/clearance, ASC-US/persistence, and positive-cytology/HSIL with the following probabilities of occurrence for these pairs 0.5, 0.647 and 0.647, respectively. Cytology could be considered a prognostic-factor in women with a positive-Hybrid-2-Capture. These findings suggest that the introduction of co-testing could diminish the burden of cervical cancer in low-and middle-income-countries, acting as a tool against inequity in healthcare."
