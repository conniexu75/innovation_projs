Treatment of A431 and MDA-468 human tumor cells with 0.1–10 μm AG-1478 inhibited basal and ligand-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation without a decrease in receptor content, EGF-binding sites, or binding affinity. Incubation of A431 cells with 0.1–1 μm AG-1517 abrogated 125I-EGF internalization. Both AG-1478 and AG-1517 markedly inhibited A431 and MDA-468 colony formation in soft agarose at concentrations between 0.01 and 1 μm. Daily injections of AG-1478 at 50 mg/kg delayed A431 tumor formation in athymic nude mice. A transient exposure of A431 cells to AG-1478 resulted in a dose-dependent up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, down-regulation of cyclin D1 and of active MAPK, and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). These changes were temporally associated with recruitment of tumor cells in G1 phase and a marked reduction of the proportion of cells in S phase. Upon removal of the kinase inhibitor, EGFR and Rb phosphorylation and the levels of cyclin D1 protein were quickly restored, but the cells did not reenter S phase until p27 protein levels were decreased. Phosphorothioate p27 oligonucleotides decreased p27 protein in A431 cells and abrogated the quinazoline-mediated G1 arrest. Treatment of A431 cells with PD 098509, a synthetic inhibitor of MEK1, inhibited MAPK activity without inducing G1 arrest or increasing the levels of p27. However, treatment with LY 294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), inhibited basal Akt activity, up-regulated p27, and recruited cells in G1. These data suggest that p27 is required for the growth arrest that follows interruption of the EGFR kinase in receptor-overexpressing cells. In addition, the G1 arrest and up-regulation of p27 resulting from EGFR blockade are not due to the interruption of MAPK, but to the interruption of constitutively active PI3K function.

Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2.Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 3.Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Critical for EGFR function are its tyrosine kinase, which becomes activated upon binding of ligand to the receptor's extracellular domain, and subsequent receptor dimerization (4.Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). The activated tyrosine kinase then autophosphorylates tyrosine residues in the receptor's C terminus, which recruit and phosphorylate several intracellular substrates, leading to mitogenic signaling and other cellular activities (1.Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2.Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 3.Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The requirement for the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in cellular signaling is based upon the observations that receptors with mutations in the ATP-binding site lack kinase function and do not display a full range of biochemical responses following ligand binding (1.Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Several epithelial tumors display EGFR overexpression often associated with increased production of EGFR ligands, which, in turn, activate endogenous receptors via an autocrine mechanism (5.Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). In support of the operative nature of these autocrine pathways in receptor-overexpressing tumor cells, perturbation of the EGFR with bivalent antibodies or with small molecule inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase results in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (6.Baselga J. Mendelsohn J. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neopl. 1997; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The observation that some human tumor cells depend on EGFR function for proliferation and/or viability, the ability to identify EGFR-overexpressing tumors, the association of EGFR overexpression with poor patient outcome, and the lack of an obvious role for this receptor in normal adult physiology have all suggested the EGFR as a rational molecular target for antitumor strategies. Several data have linked EGFR signaling with one aspect of epithelial transformation, i.e. alterations in cell cycle progression. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been proposed as the major mitogenic signaling pathway initiated by the EGFR tyrosine kinase (7.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 8.Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3 (and references therein): 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A number of recent reports have connected the Ras/MAPK pathway with alterations in normal cell cycle progression. In mouse fibroblasts, conditional expression of oncogenic Ras induces shortening of the G1/S transition and degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (8.Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3 (and references therein): 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9.Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p27 is a member of the KIP family, which also includes p21WAF1/CIP1 and p57KIP1 (11.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). KIP molecules interact with the catalytic subunits of all three cyclins that mediate the G1/S transition (Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6) (12.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar) by binding to cyclin-Cdk complexes to either prevent their activation by Cdk-activating kinase or to inhibit directly their kinase activity (11.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 12.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). p27 was originally discovered as a Cdk inhibitory activity induced by extracellular antimitogenic signals (13.Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 14.Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). It accumulates in serum-starved and density-arrested cells, and its overexpression causes cell cycle arrest in G1 (13.Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 14.Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 15.Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of p27 by antisense oligonucleotides prevents cell cycle arrest in serum-deprived cells (15.Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Notably, some reports indicate that perturbation of EGFR signaling with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or bivalent antibodies against the receptor's ectodomain results in stabilization of p27 and G1 arrest (16.Wu X. Rubin M. Fan Z. DeBlasio T. Soos T. Koff A. Mendelsohn J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1397-1403PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Peng D. Fan Z. Lu Y. DeBlasio T. Scher H. Mendelsohn J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3666-3669PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ben-Bassat H. Rosenbaum-Mitrani S. Hartzstark Z. Shlomai Z. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gazit A. Plowman G. Levitzki R. Tsvieli R. Levitzki A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3741-3750PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Fan Z. Shang B.Y. Lu Y. Chou J.L. Mendelsohn J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1943-1948PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of p27 and increased proteasome-dependent degradation of p27 have both been reported in several epithelial neoplasias, suggesting an association between loss of p27 and oncogenesis or tumor progression (reviewed in Ref. 20.Clurman B.E. Porter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15158-15160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that activation of Ras/MAPK results in induction of expression of cyclin D1 and abrogation of the adhesion dependence of kinases associated with cyclins E and A, thus accelerating G1progression and anchorage-independent growth (8.Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3 (and references therein): 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive activation of Ras/MAPK per se can markedly increase cyclin D1 transcription and expression in the absence of added growth factors. Therefore, p27 and cyclin D1 may be essential elements in pathways that connect EGFR-mediated mitogenic signals to the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary. Using small molecule quinazoline inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (21.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 22.Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) as experimental tools, we have studied the cell cycle effects that follow interruption of EGFR function in receptor-overexpressing tumor cells focusing on molecules involved in the G1/S transition. Both of the quinazolines used inhibit the EGFR kinase activity at submicromolar concentrations by reversibly binding to the receptor's ATP site and inducing the formation of inactive EGFR homodimers (23.Arteaga C.L. Ramsey T.T. Shawver L.K. Guyer C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23247-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), thereby preventing the phosphorylation of downstream cellular substrates. In turn, these reversible biochemical responses result in G1 arrest of tumor cells expressing high levels of autoactivated EGFR, thus allowing examination of the temporal correlation between EGFR signal transduction and cell cycle progression. The A431 human epidermoid carcinoma and MDA-468 human breast cancer cell lines, both exhibiting EGFR gene amplification and >1.5 × 106 EGF sites/cell (24.Kawamoto T. Mendelsohn J. Le A. Sato G.H. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7761-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Filmus J. Trent J.M. Pollak M.N. Buick R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cell lines were grown in improved minimal essential medium (IMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The quinazolines AG-1478 and AG-1517 display IC50 values for inhibition of EGFR kinase activity in vitro of 3 and 0.9 nm, respectively (21.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 22.Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Given their high homology, similar mechanism of action, and efficacy against intact cells, both quinazolines were used for these studies. SU-4231 is a tyrphostin inhibitor of the HER2/ErbB-2 kinase with an IC50 of 50 nm in vitro (23.Arteaga C.L. Ramsey T.T. Shawver L.K. Guyer C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23247-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of the quinazolines were made in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and diluted to the appropriate concentrations in culture medium. An equivalent dilution of Me2SO without the inhibitor was used as a control. The MEK1 inhibitor PD 098059, a synthetic inhibitor that prevents the association of p42/44 MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) with its activating enzyme MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and hence selectively blocks the Ras/MAPK pathway (26.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). LY 294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Subconfluent A431 cells in 24-well plates were washed twice and then equilibrated for 15 min in binding buffer (IMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) at 37 °C. To evaluate EGFR internalization, binding medium containing 1 ng/ml 125I-EGF (specific activity, 100,000 cpm/ng; provided by Dr. Graham Carpenter, Vanderbilt University) with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled EGF (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) was then added for 1–6 min at 37 °C. In some cases, 0.1–10 μm AG-1517 was added to the medium containing radiolabeled ligand. After the indicated times, the cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. This was followed by a 6-min incubation on ice with 0.2 macetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.8, to remove surface-bound non-internalized ligand as described previously (27.Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This acid wash was combined with another short rinse with the same acidic solution to determine the amount of surface-bound labeled EGF. Finally, the cells were lysed in 1 m NaOH to quantitate internalized radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was measured for each time point in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled EGF. Data were expressed as a ratio of internalized versus surface radioactivity over time. For determination of the number of EGF-binding sites and receptor binding affinity, A431 cells were seeded on 24-well plates and labeled with different concentration of 125I-EGF ranging from 0.002 to 20 nm in binding buffer (IMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) for 4 h at 4 °C. In some cases, cells were pretreated with 10 μm AG-1517 for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated with radiolabeled ligand in the presence of the kinase inhibitor for 4 h at 4 °C. The labeled monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and 0.2% bovine serum albumin and solubilized in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH, and cpm were determined in a γ-counter. Bound cpm/dish were determined in triplicate and subjected to Scatchard-type analysis (28.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-665Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar) using the program Ligand (29.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). The growth effects of inhibition of the EGFR kinase were tested in vitro in a soft agarose colony survival assay. A431 and MDA-468 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/35-mm dish in triplicate in IMEM, 10% FCS, 0.8% agarose, and 10 mm Hepes in the absence or presence of 0.01–10 μm either AG-1478 or AG-1517. Dishes were incubated in a humidified CO2incubator at 37 °C, and colonies measuring ≥50 μm in diameter were counted after 7 days using an Omnicon FAS III image analyzer (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY). The effects on tumor growth in vivo were tested in a xenograft model in athymic nude mice. A431 cells (7.5 × 106) were injected subcutaneously in 5–6-week-old female Balb/c nu/nu mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Madison, WI) just caudal to the right forelimb. Beginning 1 day post-implant, eight mice per group were randomly allocated to treatment with either 50 mg/kg AG-1478 in Me2SO or Me2SO alone (control) in a 50-μl volume, both given intraperitoneally daily via a 26-gauge needle for 21 days. At different intervals, tumor diameters were measured with calipers, and tumor volumes in mm3 were calculated by the following formula: volume = (width2× length)2. Statistical differences in tumor volumes between AG-1478-treated and control mice were evaluated by Student'st test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in cold PBS, and fixed by adding absolute ethanol while vortexing to a final concentration of 67%. After overnight refrigeration at −20 °C and subsequent rehydration in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, the cell nuclei were stained for 30 min in the dark with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) containing 125 units/ml protease-free RNase (Calbiochem), both diluted in PBS. Cells were filtered through 95-μ pore size nylon mesh (Small Parts, Inc., Miami Lakes, FL), and a total of 15,000 stained nuclei were analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). DNA histograms were modeled off-line using Modfit-LT software (Verity, Topsham, ME). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μmNa3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content of the supernatants was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 7% (for EGFR, Tyr(P), and Rb) or 12.5% (for cyclin D1, activated MAPK, Ser473-phosphorylated Akt, total Akt, and p27) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking the nonspecific binding sites by incubation for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline (25 mmTris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were blotted with mouse monoclonal antibodies against p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), cyclin D1 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), Rb (Pharmingen), phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and EGFR (Transduction Laboratories, Inc., Lexington, KY) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against active MAPK (Promega, Madison, WI), Ser473-phosphorylated Akt (New England Biolabs Inc.), and total Akt (New England Biolabs Inc.). Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film. In some cases, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C using the 986 polyclonal EGFR antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Graham Carpenter) (23.Arteaga C.L. Ramsey T.T. Shawver L.K. Guyer C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23247-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma). After four washes, the EGFR immune complexes were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for subsequent immunoblot analysis as described above. To eliminate the translation of p27 in A431 cells, we used G-clamp-modified 15-mer antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides with half-lives of 24–30 h (30.Flanagan W.M. Wolf J.J. Olson P. Grant D. Lin K.-Y. Wagner R.W. Matteucci M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3513-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The sequences of the antisense p27 and mismatch control oligonucleotides were TGG CTC TCX TGC GCC (GS5413) and TGG CTC XCT TGC GCC (GS5585), respectively, where X = G-clamp (9-aminoethoxy)phenoxazine). The oligonucleotides (final concentration, 10 nm) were heated for 5 min at 65 °C in serum-free medium to denature their secondary structure, mixed with 2 μg/ml cytofectin GS3815 (Glen Research Corp., Sterling, VA) in 400 μl of serum-free minimal Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) in polystyrene tubes, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Thereafter, 1.6 ml of IMEM and 10% FCS were added, and the resulting 2 ml of “transfection volume” were placed on each 60-mm tissue culture dish containing subconfluent A431 cells. To correct for nonspecific effects of cytofectin, some additional controls were incubated under identical conditions with 400 μl of minimal Eagle's medium (containing 2 μg/ml cytofectin) + 1.6 ml of IMEM and 10% FCS. After 5 h, an additional 2 ml of IMEM and 10% FCS were added to each dish, and the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of AG-1478 for an additional 20 h. Experiments were carried out in duplicate dishes. Cells were then harvested and subjected to immunoblot analyses and/or flow cytometric analysis of stained nuclei as described above. We initially studied the inhibitory potency of AG-1517 on basal and ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation in intact A431 and MDA-468 cells. These cells have a doubling time of approximately ≤24 h, exhibit EGFR gene amplification, and secrete TGF-α, thus expressing autoactivated EGFR in the absence of exogenous receptor ligands (31.Van de Vijver M. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ennis B. Valverius E.M. Lippman M.E. Bellot F. Kris R. Schlessinger J. Masui H. Goldenberg A. Mendelsohn J. Dickson R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1830-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A 30-min preincubation with ≥0.1 μmAG-1517 inhibited the basal and TGF-α-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in both tumor cell lines without a detectable change in EGFR protein levels (Fig.1, A andB). In contrast, treatment with SU-4231, a structurally related quinazoline that does not affect the EGFR kinase, but specifically blocks the HER2/ErbB-2 kinase in vitro, had no effect on basal and ligand-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in MDA-468 cells (Fig. 1 B). We next sought to determine the effect of the kinase inhibitor on the number of EGF-binding sites under conditions of binding equilibrium of 125I-EGF. TableI shows the results from Scatchard-type analysis of labeled EGF binding data from A431 cells incubated with or without 10 μm AG-1517. Treatment with the kinase inhibitor doubled the number of EGF sites with a negligible effect on the receptor's equilibrium dissociation constant (K D), indicating that the loss of receptor phosphorylation was not to be explained by a loss of EGF binding capacity. On the other hand, EGFR internalization was markedly altered by inhibition of the EGFR kinase. To measure the rate of EGFR internalization, A431 cells were briefly exposed to 0.2 nm125I-EGF at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 0.1–10 μm AG-1517. At all concentrations tested, AG-1517 prevented 125I-EGF internalization as measured by the rate of accumulation of intracellular radiolabeled EGF relative to the amount of surface-bound radiolabeled ligand (Fig.2). These data are consistent with the requirement of EGFR autophosphorylation for ligand-dependent endocytosis.Table IInfluence of the quinazoline AG-1517 on EGF-binding sites and the EGF binding affinity constant (KD) in EGFR-overexpressing human tumor cellsAG-1517 (10 μm)−+EGF sites (×106)8.314.2K D(nm)2.75.4A431 cells were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.002–20 nm125I-EGF as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In some cases, cells were pretreated and then incubated with radiolabeled ligand in the presence of 10 μmAG-1517. After this incubation, the radiolabeled cells were washed and lysed, and bound cpm were measured in a γ-counter to generate total and nonspecific 125I-EGF binding. Scatchard-type analysis generated with the Ligand program (29.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal.

All determinations were done in triplicate wells. Open table in a new tab A431 cells were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.002–20 nm125I-EGF as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In some cases, cells were pretreated and then incubated with radiolabeled ligand in the presence of 10 μmAG-1517. After this incubation, the radiolabeled cells were washed and lysed, and bound cpm were measured in a γ-counter to generate total and nonspecific 125I-EGF binding. Scatchard-type analysis generated with the Ligand program (29.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal.

All determinations were done in triplicate wells. We next examined the effect of the EGFR kinase inhibitors on growth of receptor-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro andin vivo. Anchorage-independent colony survival of both A431 and MDA-468 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by incubation with either AG-1478 or AG-1517. The IC50 for growth inhibition in this assay with either quinazoline in A431 cells was <0.1 μm, whereas for MDA-468 cells, it was between 0.1 and 1 μm (Fig. 3), consistent with the range of concentrations required to block basal EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Proliferation of A431 cells in monolayer was inhibited 77% relative to untreated controls by a 4-day treatment with 1 μm AG-1478. This effect required the continuous presence of the kinase inhibitor and was totally reversible upon its removal, suggesting that, for adherent cells, the effect was predominantly cytostatic and not cytotoxic. Notably, a similar 4-day treatment of adherent MDA-468 cell monolayers with 1 μmAG-1478 or AG-1517, a concentration that almost completely blocked colony survival on soft agarose (Fig. 3), resulted at best in a modest (20%) inhibition of cell proliferation (data not shown). The inhibitory effect against A431 cells was next confirmed in vivo against subcutaneous A431 xenografts implanted in athymic nude mice. Although all tumors still formed after subcutaneous inoculation of tumor cells, daily intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg/kg AG-1478 markedly delayed A431 tumor growth when compared with controls (p ≤ 0.01) (Fig.4) without any detectable host toxicity. Microscopic examination of both control and treated squamous carcinomas revealed no histological differences between them. To determine the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of growth arrest, we treated exponentially growing tumor cells with concentrations of AG-1478 that were known to inhibit the EGFR kinase activity (Fig. 1). We initially focused on the effects on the G1/S transition in the more sensitive A431 cells. These cells contain wild-type Rb, whereas the MDA-468 cells exhibit a homozygous deletion of most of the Rb gene (33.Wang N.P. To H. Lee W.-H. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-h exposure to 0.1–10 μm AG-1478 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of both EGFR phosphorylation and constitutive MAPK activity, hypophosphorylation of Rb, down-regulation of cy"

Our cells without mitochondrial DNA had low ΔΨm and no functional oxidative phosphorylation. Contrary to our expectation, these cells were more resistant to staurosporine-induced death than were the parental cells. This reduced susceptibility was associated with decreased activation of caspase 3 but not with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Apoptosis in both cell lines was associated with an increase in ΔΨm. Bcl-xL could protect both cell types against caspase 3 activation and apoptosis by a mechanism that does not appear to be mediated by mitochondrial function or modulation of ΔΨm. Nevertheless, we found that Bcl-xL expression can stimulate cell respiration in cells with mitochondrial DNA. Our results showed that the lack of functional oxidative phosphorylation and/or low mitochondrial membrane potential are associated with an antiapoptotic effect, possibly contributing to the development of some types of cancer.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar).The participation of mitochondria in apoptosis has also been substantiated by a large number of reports describing proapoptotic mitochondrial alterations, such as the production of reactive oxygen species, the depletion of ATP, and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)1 (7.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 547Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Opening of the MPTP causes a dissipation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), an increase in the matrix volume, and a consequential disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of intermembrane factors (9.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). This sequence of events is still controversial because many groups have observed either an increase in ΔΨm after an apoptotic stimulus (5.Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar) or cytochromec release preceding a decrease in ΔΨm (10.Bossy-Wetzel E.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). In any case, a large number of proapoptotic factors seem to be released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space early during the apoptotic cascade. Released cytochrome c, for example, interacts with Apaf-1 and activates cytosolic caspases (13.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 14.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Caspases 2 and 9, the latter of which is the main activator of the cytoplasmic death executioner caspase 3, also seem to be present in mitochondria and, like cytochrome c, are released upon an apoptotic stimulus (9.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The release of these factors from the mitochondria in some systems is blocked by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the MPTP. MPTP is a composite ion channel that spans the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes at sites of contact between them (15.Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). The complex is formed by the adenine nucleotide translocator (inner membrane), the voltage-dependent anion channel (outer membrane), and cyclophilin D (matrix) and co-purifies with other apoptosis-regulating factors such as Bax but not Bcl-xL (16.Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). MPTP, a regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+, pH value, ΔΨm, and volume, has been implicated in apoptosis of hepatocytes, neurons, and myocardiocytes induced by toxins, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, and anoxia (17.Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that MPTP constitutes a point of integration of multiple apoptotic pathways because most of them facilitate its opening (18.Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 19.Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar).It also has been proposed that Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL exert at least part of their apoptosis-regulatory function by facilitating (Bax) or inhibiting (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) pore opening and ΔΨm dissipation (20.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). However, mitochondria or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) may not be major players in some apoptosis systems. Caspase activation, for example, can occur without the release of mitochondrial intermembrane factors under certain conditions (21.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar,22.Kitagawa H. Tani E. Ikemoto H. Ozaki I. Nakano A. Omura S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Despite the wealth of information generated in the last few years, cell death mechanisms and the involvement of mitochondria in different cell systems are still poorly understood. However, because of the undisputed importance of OXPHOS and the proposed effects of Bcl-xL at the level of ΔΨm and the MPTP, studies of cell death in cells harboring mitochondria with genetically defined defects in OXPHOS and ΔΨm can provide valuable clues to molecular mechanisms of apoptosis. Our study using osteosarcoma cell lines with and without mtDNA shows that the protective effect of Bcl-xL is not impaired by a low mitochondrial membrane potential and that the lack of functional OXPHOS does not predispose cells to apoptosis.RESULTSAlthough cells devoid of mtDNA can grow normally in culture provided that a glucose-rich medium supplemented with pyruvate and uridine is used, their low mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) could make them more susceptible to undergoing apoptosis. Moreover, the function of factors that can modulate ΔΨm during apoptosis, such as Bcl-xL, could be affected in these cells. We investigated the role of functional OXPHOS and ΔΨm in these processes by studying the susceptibility of osteosarcoma cells with and without mtDNA to STP-induced apoptosis.Characterization of Cell Lines with and without mtDNA overexpressing Bcl-xLThe cell lines 143B and 143B/206ρ0 (hereafter referred to as 206ρ0) were transfected with a plasmid construct expressing a bicistronic RNA coding for Bcl-xL in the 5′ segment and neo resistance in the 3′ segment. The neo resistance can be expressed because of an internal ribosomal entry site between the two coding regions. This vector system (pIRES; CLONTECH) allows the expression of high levels of the cloned gene in cells selected by resistance to high concentrations of G418. Fig.1 shows that individual clones selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 expressed high levels of Bcl-xL (clones 143B/Bx-n and 206/Bx-n). Bcl-xLcould not be detected in untransfected cells, suggesting that, if present, its expression is very low in these osteosarcoma cells. The expression pattern suggested that in both cell lines a significant fraction of the overexpressed Bcl-xL is localized to mitochondria because the Bcl-xL signal co-localizes with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker™ (Fig. 1 C). The same cell lines were transfected with a pIRES vector without Bcl-xL and selected under the same G418 conditions to be used as controls in the subsequent experiments.Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm), Cell Respiration, and Apoptotic Markers in Osteosarcoma CellsAlthough cells with an impaired OXPHOS are expected to have a lower ΔΨm, it has been reported that some ρ0 cells are able to maintain a normal ΔΨm (33.Marchetti P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22983-22989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We used the dye JC-1 to monitor ΔΨm, estimated as the 590:527 nm emission ratio (see “Experimental Procedures”). 206ρ0 and its Bcl-xL-overexpressing derivatives showed a relatively low ΔΨm, approximately 30% of the values obtained for the parental 143B cells. The overexpression of Bcl-xL increased the basal ΔΨm in 143B cells by approximately 35% (p = 0.002 by analysis of variance) but not in 206ρ0 cells (Fig.2 A). This increase in membrane potential was associated with a similar increase in cell respiration (p < 0.0001 by analysis of variance), showing that Bcl-xL can stimulate respiration even under nonapoptotic conditions (Fig. 2 B). As expected, Bcl-xL did not increase the ΔΨm or respiration of 206ρ0 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). As described below, treating these cells for 6 h with the protein kinase inhibitor STP triggered apoptosis. Staurosporine treatment led to an increase in ΔΨm not only in 143B cells but also in 206ρ0 cells. This relative increase (approximately 50%) was less pronounced in 143B cell lines overexpressing Bcl-xL, mainly because of the higher basal ΔΨm observed in these cells. We have also analyzed changes in ΔΨm by FACS (using an emission/excitation filter for JC-1 aggregates; see “Experimental Procedures”) and found that STP induced a similar increase in ΔΨm. Identical results were obtained using 2 or 6.5 μm JC-1. The increase was in the mean of the cell population and not in a subset of cells (data not shown).Figure 2Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and cell respiration in ρ+ and ρ0 cells. A. Cell lines stably transfected with pIRES or pIRES/Bcl-xL were treated with staurosporine (0.5 μg/ml, 6 h). Staurosporine caused an increase in ΔΨm in both the ρ+ and ρ0 cell lines, indicating that this increase does not involve functional OXPHOS complexes I, III, IV, and V. Overexpression of Bcl-xL in cells with mtDNA was associated with an increase in the basal ΔΨm (p = 0.002). B, cell respiration of the control and Bcl-xL-transfected cells showed that Bcl-xL stimulates respiration in cells with mtDNA (p < 0.0001) but not in the 206ρ0 cells.Error bars, the S.D. of the mean of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Apoptosis was monitored in these cells by analyzing phosphatidylserine externalization (annexin V staining), propidium iodide uptake, and nucleosome breakdown. Preliminary results showed that cells treated with STP for 6 and 18 h underwent extensive nucleosome breakdown. Therefore, we used a 6-h STP treatment for all experiments described in this study. Annexin V staining and PI uptake were analyzed by FACS. Surprisingly, after 6 h of STP treatment, 143B cells showed higher annexin V staining and a higher PI uptake than the 206ρ0derivative. Annexin V fluorescence in 206ρ0 cells was 57%, and PI uptake was 77% of the values observed in the parental 143B cells (Fig. 3 A). The relative extent of nucleosome breakdown in these cells is illustrated in Fig. 3 B. In agreement with the FACS results, 206ρ0 cells showed approximately 40% less nucleosome breakage than the parental 143B cells. Basal levels (i.e.without STP treatment) of nucleosome breakdown in the 206ρ0 and 143B cell lines were 2.6 ± 0.1 and 4.0 ± 0.2 OD/mg protein, respectively, and these values were increased as described in Fig. 3 B after STP treatment to 13.2 ± 0.5 and 41.2 ± 6.5 OD/mg protein, respectively. Overexpression of Bcl-xL conferred strong protection against STP-induced apoptosis to both ρ+ and ρ0 cells. On the other hand, CsA, an inhibitor of the MPTP, did not protect either 143B or 206ρ0 cells against STP-induced apoptosis. However, the protective effect of CsA could be observed in STP-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that although mitochondrial permeability transition participates in the apoptotic cascade in some cell types, it does not seem to play such a role in osteosarcoma cells. The combination of aristolochic acid (an inhibitor of phospholipase A and a potentiator of CsA effect on mitochondrial permeability transition) and CsA was also ineffective in protecting 143B and 206ρ0 cells from apoptotic death (data not shown).Figure 3Apoptosis is impaired in ρ0 cells. A, cell lines stably transfected with pIRES or pIRES/Bcl-xL were treated with staurosporine (0.5 μg/ml, 6 h), stained with annexin V and PI, and analyzed by FACS. B, cells were treated as described above, and nucleosome breakdown was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The graph illustrates the increase in nucleosome breakdown relative to untreated cells. A andB show that 206ρ0 cells have impaired apoptosis. As expected, both ρ+ and ρ0cells were protected by the overexpression of Bcl-xL.C shows that osteosarcoma cells undergoing STP-induced apoptosis are not protected by CsA, suggesting that the MPTP does not play a major role in this system. Nuclear apoptosis of Jurkat cells, on the other hand, was strongly inhibited by CsA. D, caspase 3 activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activation of caspase 3 (U = nmol amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin/h/mg protein) was also impaired in 206ρ0 cells. Error bars, the S.D. of the mean of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The lower levels of apoptosis observed in 206ρ0 cells were compatible with the levels of caspase 3 activation in these cells (Fig. 3 D). Caspase 3 activation in 206ρ0 cells was less than half the activation observed in 143B cells after 6 h of treatment with STP. As expected, Bcl-xL strongly inhibited caspase 3 activation, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (Fig.3 D).Cytochrome c Release Does Not Play a Major Role in the STP-induced Apoptotic Cascade of Osteosarcoma Cells with or without mtDNACytochrome c release from the mitochondria has been shown to activate caspases and apoptosis in several cellular systems (11.Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 12.Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). We analyzed the cytochrome c release from osteosarcoma cells after 6 h of STP treatment. The redistribution of cellular factors was investigated by disrupting the cells either by homogenization or nitrogen cavitation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and differential centrifugation. Mitochondrial and cytosolic (S-100) enriched fractions were analyzed by immunoblots. Disruption by Potter-Elvehjem homogenization resulted in a significant detection of cytochrome c in the S-100 fraction, even in the sample that was not treated with STP (data not shown). Therefore, we proceeded by isolating the cellular fractions by nitrogen cavitation, which has been reported to be less damaging to the outer mitochondrial membrane (28.Adachi S. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19892-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 showed that treatment with STP did not trigger a significant cytochromec release from 143B mitochondria. A slightly higher signal for cytochrome c was observed in the S-100 fraction of the 206ρ0 cells treated with STP. Notably, the mtDNA-less 206ρ0 cells showed significantly higher levels of cytochrome c in their mitochondria. For comparison, we included a nonspecific band recognized by the anti-cytochromec antibody (the band labeled nsp) in Fig.4 A. Normalized to this unknown protein, mitochondria of our 206ρ0 cell line had approximately 3.5-fold higher levels of cytochrome c than did 143B cells. This increased amount of cytochrome c in our 206ρ0 cell line was also observed when total cell proteins were analyzed (data not shown). The enrichment of the cellular fractions was confirmed by using antibodies against a mitochondrial marker (COX IV) and a cytosolic marker (SOD-1). Steady-state levels of COX IV have been previously shown to be decreased in ρ0 cells (35.Marusich M.F. Robinson B.H. Taanman J.W. Kim S.J. Schillace R. Smith J.L. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), consistent with our findings.Figure 4Lack of cytochrome credistribution in osteosarcoma cells. A, cells treated for 6 h with 0.5 μg/ml STP were homogenized, and mitochondrial and cytosolic enriched fractions were purified by nitrogen cavitation as under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the antibodies described in the figure. Cytochrome c redistribution from the mitochondria to the cytosol was not observed in these osteosarcoma cell lines. Mitochondria of the 206ρ0 cell line contained 3.5-fold higher levels of cytochrome c than did the parental ρ+ cell line. A nonspecific band in the blot labelednsp was included in the figure for comparison of relative cytochrome c levels. Cytochrome c in 206ρ0 cells showed low levels of cytochrome credistribution, which were not associated with increased apoptosis. The enrich- ment of the subcellular fractions was evident by the use of a mitochondrial marker (COX IV) and a cytosolic marker (SOD-1). B–K, co-localization studies in 143B (B and D--G) and 206ρ0cell lines (C and H–K) cells before (B and C) and after STP treatment ( D--K).

Cells were double stained with a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody and the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker™ (Fig. 4, B–K). Fig. 4,B and C, shows the mitochondrial pattern of the cytochrome c staining in 143B and 206ρ0 cells. STP treatment in both cell lines led to profound changes in morphology, but the cytochrome c signal (green staining) still co-localized with the mitochondria (red staining) in both cell lines. Fig. 4, D and E, exemplifies unusual cells in which the co-localization was not striking. Even in these cells, most cytochrome c co-localized with the mitochondria, but a slightly more diffuse cytochrome cstaining was observed in the cell found in the center of Fig. 4,D and E. However, these same panels illustrate how the mitochondrial network (MitoTracker™ staining) may also show a diffuse pattern of staining after apoptosis (cells found in the lower part of the Fig. 4, D and E).Bcl-xL Interacts with Caspase 9 in Osteosarcoma CellsWe also examined the pattern of Bcl-xLinteractions with other cellular factors by co-immunoprecipitation of cellular extracts with an anti-Bcl-xL antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were labeled with biotin, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed with avidin-HRP by chemiluminescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pattern of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xL was very similar in extracts from 143B/Bx1 and 206/Bx6 (Fig.5). One of the co-immunoprecipitated proteins had a molecular mass of 47,000 Da and could represent caspase 9. The identity of this band was confirmed by immunoblotting the same membrane with an anti-caspase 9 antibody (Fig. 5).Figure 5Caspase 9 co-immunoprecipitates with Bcl-xL. 143B and 206ρ0 overexpressing Bcl-xL (clones 143B/Bx1 and 206ρ0-Bx6) were lysed under nondenaturing conditions, and Bcl-xL was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitated proteins were biotinylated, resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and developed with avidin-HRP using a chemiluminescence system. The same membrane was stripped and subsequently incubated with anti-caspase 9 and anti-Bcl-xL antibodies. The left panel shows that among several proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xL, there was a M r 47,000 band. This band was also detected by the anti-caspase 9 antibody (right panel). The presence of Bcl-xL was also demonstrated by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, plays an important role in normal development and is impaired in many types of cancer (1.LaCasse E.C.

The participation of mitochondria in apoptosis has also been substantiated by a large number of reports describing proapoptotic mitochondrial alterations, such as the production of reactive oxygen species, the depletion of ATP, and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)1 (7.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 547Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Opening of the MPTP causes a dissipation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), an increase in the matrix volume, and a consequential disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of intermembrane factors (9.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). This sequence of events is still controversial because many groups have observed either an increase in ΔΨm after an apoptotic stimulus (5.Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar) or cytochromec release preceding a decrease in ΔΨm (10.Bossy-Wetzel E.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). In any case, a large number of proapoptotic factors seem to be released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space early during the apoptotic cascade. Released cytochrome c, for example, interacts with Apaf-1 and activates cytosolic caspases (13.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 14.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Caspases 2 and 9, the latter of which is the main activator of the cytoplasmic death executioner caspase 3, also seem to be present in mitochondria and, like cytochrome c, are released upon an apoptotic stimulus (9.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The release of these factors from the mitochondria in some systems is blocked by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the MPTP. MPTP is a composite ion channel that spans the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes at sites of contact between them (15.Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). The complex is formed by the adenine nucleotide translocator (inner membrane), the voltage-dependent anion channel (outer membrane), and cyclophilin D (matrix) and co-purifies with other apoptosis-regulating factors such as Bax but not Bcl-xL (16.Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). MPTP, a regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+, pH value, ΔΨm, and volume, has been implicated in apoptosis of hepatocytes, neurons, and myocardiocytes induced by toxins, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, and anoxia (17.Kroemer G.

Genet. 1991; 229: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is controlled by the Rcs (regulation ofcapsule synthesis) regulatory network. Two transcriptional regulators, RcsA and RcsB, are supposed to induce EPS biosynthesis cooperatively. The RcsB protein is highly conserved between different species with about 90% identity (10.Bereswill S. Geider K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and it represents the cytoplasmic activator of a classical bacterial two-component system. RcsB might be activated by the membrane-bound receptor RcsC (3.Jayaratne P. Keenleyside W.J. MacLachlan P.R. Dodgson C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5384-5394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via phosphotransfer to highly conserved aspartic acid residues in the N-terminal domain of RcsB. RcsA and RcsB are both characterized by a LuxR-type C-terminal DNA binding motif, but RcsA does not contain an N-terminal phosphorylation motif. The RcsA protein is limiting for the induction of EPS biosynthesis and is virtually not detectable in the uninduced cell due to its rapid degradation by the Lon protease (13.Torres-Cabassa A.S. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14.Stout V. Torres-Cabassa A. Maurizi M.R. Gutnick D. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of RcsB is absolutely required for capsule biosynthesis, whereas an rcsA minus phenotype can be suppressed by multicopy rcsB (15.Brill J.A. Quinlan-Walshe C. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2599-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RcsA might therefore act as a coinducer of EPS biosynthesis by enhancing the DNA binding activity of RcsB. Recently, genetic evidence for an autoregulation ofrcsA expression in E. coli has been reported and a DNA binding activity of RcsA at the rcsA promoter has been discussed (16.Ebel W. Trempy J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a heterodimer formed by one copy of RcsA and RcsB binds at corresponding regions approximately 500 bp upstream of the translational start sites of amsG andcpsA, the first open reading frames (ORF) in the E. amylovora ams operon for amylovoran biosynthesis, and in theP. stewartii cps operon for stewartan biosynthesis, respectively (17.Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18.Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The two operons are highly homologous, and the activation of Rcs-dependent promoters by a RcsAB heterodimer as a general mechanism remained unclear. In addition, some evidence for modified Rcs-dependent regulation mechanisms in E. coli and S. typhi has been proposed (4.Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,16.Ebel W. Trempy J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that the binding of RcsAB to regulatory DNA regions is a general principle in the Rcs-mediated activation of gene expression. We present RcsAB binding sites identified in the presumed main promoters of EPS biosynthetic operons of E. coli,K. pneumoniae, and S. typhi. RcsAB further modulates the rcsA autoregulation in those species by binding to the rcsA promoters. The compilation of all identified RcsAB binding sites allows us to define the RcsAB box as a new conserved bacterial operator. The RcsAB box was analyzed in vitro and in vivo, and it was found to be essential for full promoter activity in E. coli. The E. coli strains Xl1-Blue (19.Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Stuart J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar), BL21, C600, DH5α (Stratagene), and JB3034 (15.Brill J.A. Quinlan-Walshe C. Gottesman S. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were used for cloning and expression studies. Standard DNA techniques were done as described (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments were amplified from chromosomal DNA of strain Xl1-Blue with Vent polymerase and suitable primers. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are available upon request. RcsA proteins were produced with the plasmids pM-RcsAEA, pM-RcsAEC, and pM-RcsAPS (17.Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen.

RcsB proteins were produced with the plasmids pQ-RcsBEC and pQ-RcsBEA (17.Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal poly(His)6tag in the strain JB3034. The proteins were purified as described (17.Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,18.Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol.

If appropriate, the purified RcsA and RcsB proteins of E. coli, E. amylovora, and P. stewartii were named according to their origin RcsAEC, RcsAEA, RcsAPS, RcsBEC, and RcsBEA, respectively. A BamHI/HindIII restriction fragment from plasmid pQHB (22.Boucher P.E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) containing the coding region ofBordetella pertussis bvgA was cloned into the expression vector pMalc2, resulting in plasmid pM-bvgA. The BvgA protein was produced from strain DH5α × pM-bvgA and purified by affinity chromatography of the crude extract with a dextrin column. Radioactive DNA labeling with [α-32P]dATP and the EMSA technique were done as described previously (17.Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18.Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The RcsAB heterodimer was obtained by mixing equimolar concentrations of the two proteins. For the reconstitution of double-stranded DNA fragments, about 1 μg of each of two complementary oligonucleotides were mixed in 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. The mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature and subsequently labeled. Phosphorylation of BvgA was obtained by incubating the protein in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 mm acetylphosphate for 20 min at 28 °C. SPR measurements were performed with a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Biotinylated DNA (about 60 resonance units) were coupled to the streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA as recommended by the manufacturer. The experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The DNA fragments and proteins were diluted in running buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA). Bovine serum albumin and λ-DNA were added to the protein solutions to a final concentration of 200 and 8 ng/μl, respectively. RcsA/RcsB mixtures of various concentrations ranging from about 47 nm to about 7.5 μm were injected allowing an association time of 120 s and a dissociation time of 300 s. A reference flow cell loaded with a random DNA target of same size as the probe DNA target was used to subtract unspecific DNA/protein interactions. Regeneration of the chip surface was achieved by removing all bound proteins with a pulse of 5 μl of 0.05% SDS in running buffer. Kinetic analyses were done using the BIAevaluation 3.0 program. To determine the binding properties of the proteins, 1:1 Langmuir kinetics provided by the software were used. Plasmid pMW31 was constructed by cloning a 3-kb DNA fragment starting seven nucleotides upstream of the RcsAB box of the wza gene into the BglII andPstI sites of the suicide vector pfdA8 (20.Geider K. Hohmeyer C. Haas R. Meyer T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In plasmid pMW29, four essential nucleotide positions in the RcsAB box TAAAGAAACTCCTA of the 3-kb fragment were modified by PCR, resulting in the sequence GAACTCAACTCCTA, where the mutated bases were underlined. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli C600 by electroporation and selected for kanamycin resistance. The correct insertion of the plasmids by homologous recombination was verified by PCR analysis of the isolated chromosomal DNA. An approximately 1-kb DNA fragment generated by PCR and containing the complete E. coli rcsA gene starting 38 bp upstream of the RcsAB box, was cloned into the vector pBluescript KS+resulting in plasmid prcsA-WT. Four essential positions of the RcsAB box TAAGGATTATCCGA in plasmid prcsA-WT were mutated by PCR upon introduction of an EcoRI restriction site and resulting in the sequence GAATTCTTATCCGA with the mutated bases underlined. EPS were quantified from cells grown on cellophane-covered LB-agar for 24 h at 37 °C. After harvesting, the cell number was determined and the capsules were washed off from the cells by vigorous shaking for 3 min. The cells were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed against water. The polysaccharides were determined as described (23.Dubois M. Giles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39449) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the β-galactosidase was determined with theo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside assay after Miller (24.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The 485-bp PCR fragment Pwza485 containing the putative promoter and the first nine codons ofwza, the first ORF in the operon for colanic acid biosynthesis in E. coli, interacted with RcsABECin EMSAs. Terminal deletions revealed the 55-bp fragment Pwza 55 spanning nucleotide positions −119 to −65 relative to the transcriptional start site of wza (Fig.1) as sufficient for a retardation by the RcsABEC heterodimer (Fig. 2). The extent of retardation was diminished with the 41-bp fragment Pwza 41 from positions −119 to −79, and no retardation was observed with the 27-bp fragment Pwza 27 spanning nucleotide positions −106 to −80. This was also observed with the 38-bp fragment Pwza 38 spanning nucleotide positions −119 to −82. This indicated that the 28-bp region spanning nucleotide positions −106 to −79 relative to the transcriptional start site ofwza was essential but not sufficient for the binding of RcsABEC (Figs. 1 and 2). An extension of the 3′-end of the 55-bp fragment did not further contribute to a better binding of RcsABEC, and the extent of retardation of the 72-bp fragment Pwza 72 spanning positions −119 to −48 was comparable to that of Pwza 55 (data not shown). Incubation at 28 °C compared with 37 °C prior to electrophoresis increased the percent of retardation of the RcsABEC/DNA complex about 3-fold.Figure 2Retardation of the E. coli wzapromoter by RcsAB. Fragments Pwza 27, Pwza 38, Pwza 41, and Pwza 48 were analyzed in EMSAs with RcsABEC at standard conditions. The retardation of fragment Pwza 55 was furthermore analyzed with heterologous RcsAB proteins: RcsAEC/RcsBEC(lane 1), RcsAEC/RcsBEA(lane 2), RcsAEA/RcsBEA(lane 3), and RcsAPS/RcsBEA (lane 4). Proteins were used in concentrations of 1.7 μm for RcsBEC and RcsBAE, and of 5.7 μmfor RcsAEC, RcsAEA, and RcsAPS, respectively.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) implicated several nucleotides in the region from −115 to −96 relative to the transcriptional start site of wza as putative targets for RcsAB (Fig. 1). Suspected positions were further analyzed by the introduction of putative up and down mutations according to the RcsABamsG consensus (TableI). The replacement of the degenerated adenine at position −110 by a conserved guanine in the fragments Pwza 72 (G−109) and Pwza 72 (G−109A−108) increased the extent of retardation by RcsABEC (TableII). In contrast, the retardation was considerably reduced after replacing the highly conserved thymine at position −112 in fragment Pwza 72(G−112) by guanine. The retardation was completely abolished in fragment Pwza 72(C−110T−108C−106) carrying mutations in three conserved positions. A decreased percent of retardation in an EMSA was furthermore observed after the replacement of two less conserved adenines by cytosines in the fragment Pwza 72 (C−98C−96). Interestingly, two mutations adjacent to the putative RcsAB consensus also reduced the extent of retardation of fragment Pwza 72 (G−91C−90) by the two proteins (Table II). This gives evidence for additional DNA/protein interactions neighboring the consensus motif.Table IDefinition of the RcsAB box in ResAB binding sitesGeneSpeciesRcsAB boxaThe RcsAB box is in bold, palindromic nucleotide positions within the RcsAB box are underlined, and the colon represents the center of symmetry.LocationbNucleotide positions relative to the translational start site.Ref.cReference for the corresponding sequences.wzaE. coli K12aacc ta aagaa:actccta aaaa−452 /−439(25.Stout V.

Open table in a new tab To analyze whether the wza promoter exhibits some preference for the recognition by the homologous RcsABEC proteins, we used the 55-bp fragment of the wza promoter as a target in EMSAs with various combinations of the RcsAEA, RcsAEC, RcsAPS, RcsBEA, and RcsBEC proteins (Fig. 2). The wza promoter was recognized by the heterologous Rcs proteins in all combinations tested, and we could not detect significant differences in the extent of retardation of the DNA fragment. We observed no binding of RcsAEC or RcsBEC alone to the 55-bp fragment, or to the 485-bp fragment containing the complete wzapromoter in concentrations up to 4.5 μm. In contrast, approximately 0.2 μm of the two proteins together already retarded these DNA fragments in EMSAs. The DNA fragment Pwza 48 spanning the nucleotide positions −95 to −48, including an inverted repeat sequence, was retarded neither by RcsAEC nor by RcsABEC (Fig. 2). In addition, the mutation of four bases in the inverted repeat sequence of the fragment Pwza 72(C−68G−67G−66A−65) did not show any effect on the retardation by RcsABEC(Table II). The binding kinetics of the RcsABEC heterodimer at Pwza 72 was analyzed by the surface plasmon resonance technique (Fig. 3). With protein concentrations in a range of 47 nm and 7.5 μm, the ka was calculated to 5.4 ± 3.3 × 104m−1s−1 and the kd to 1.4 ± 0.4 × 10−3 s−1, resulting in aKD of 77 ± 28 nm. TheKD of RcsABEC at the E. coli wza promoter corresponds to the KD of RcsABEA at the E. amylovora amsG promoter previously determined by the EMSA technique (18.Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We furthermore analyzed the DNA fragment Pwza 72(G−112C−109T−108C−107), containing four point mutations in highly conserved positions (Fig. 1). This fragment was not retarded by RcsAB in an EMSA (Table II). Theka was calculated to 560 ± 140m−1 s−1 and thekd to 2.4 ± 1.0 × 10−2s−1, resulting in an approximately 103-fold increased KD of 50 ± 30 μm. The chromosomal merodiploids MW29 and MW31 of theE. coli K12 strain C600 were constructed after integration of the two plasmids pMW29 and pMW31 by homologous recombination. Thewza promoter of strain MW31 was truncated just upstream of the RcsAB box, and strain MW29 contained additionally four point mutations in essential bases within the identified RcsAB binding site. The phenotypes of the mutants were assayed after introduction of plasmid pEA101 containing the E. amylovora rcsA gene, which resulted in the wild type strain C600 in the induction of colanic acid biosynthesis by activation of the wza promoter. The EPS production and the phenotype of the control mutant MW31 × pEA101 was not altered compared with the wild type strain C600 × pEA101 (Table III). Thus, the approximately 450-bp fragment upstream of wza is sufficient for full promoter activity. In contrast, the EPS production of the mutant MW29 × pEA101 was drastically reduced and the mutant showed a butyrous colony type (Table III). These results demonstrate the importance of the identified RcsAB binding site for the activation of colanic acid biosynthesis, and they indicate that RcsAB might also bindin vivo to that region.Table IIIPhenotype of mutated RcsAB boxes in E. coliStrainaRelevant genotype.

Open table in a new tab The autoregulation of E. coli rcsA has been reported previously (16.Ebel W. Trempy J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we investigated whether the activation of rcsA promoters is also directed via DNA binding of RcsAB. The 277-bp PCR fragment PrcsA EC277 containing the intergenic region between the E. coli fliR and rcsA genes including the start codon of rcsA EC was clearly retarded by RcsABEC (Fig.4 A). A putative RcsAB binding site was detected at nucleotide positions −264 to −251 relative to the translational start site of rcsA EC (TableI). Accordingly, the reconstituted 34-bp DNA fragment PrcsA EC34 spanning nucleotide positions −274 to −241 was retarded by RcsABEC (Fig. 4 A). Among the most critical positions for RcsAB binding are three conserved purines most likely represented by the sequence GGA at positions −261 to −259 in the rcsA EC promoter. The mutation of the three purines to the sequence TTC in fragment PrcsA ECM completely abolished retardation of the 277-bp fragment by RcsABEC (Fig. 4 A). This demonstrated that the proposed sequence is essential for the in vitro binding of the Rcs proteins to thercsA EC promoter. The rcsAautoregulation appears to be dependent on the presence of both proteins, as neither RcsA nor RcsB alone in concentrations of up to 4.5 μm were able to shift the 277-bp fragment of thercsA EC promoter in EMSAs. If the autoregulation of rcsA expression is a conserved mechanism, an RcsAB binding site should also be present in thercsA promoters of other species. We detected putative RcsAB binding sites in the promoter regions of rcsA genes fromE. amylovora, K. pneumoniae and S. typhi at locations between −321 to − 244 relative to the translational start sites (Table I). We could demonstrate an interaction of RcsABEC with the 29-bp fragment PrcsA EA from −331 to −302 of E"

To activate respiration by endogenous production of ADP in permeabilized cells, ATP was added either alone or together with creatine. In cardiac fibers, while ATP alone activated respiration to half of the maximal rate, creatine plus ATP increased the respiratory rate up to its maximum. To find out whether the stimulation by creatine is a consequence of extramitochondrial [ADP] increase, or whether it directly correlates with ADP generation by mitochondrial CK in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, an exogenous ADP-trap system was added to rephosphorylate all cytosolic ADP. Under these conditions, creatine plus ATP still increased the respiration rate by 2.5 times, compared with ATP alone, for the same extramitochondrial [ADP] of 14 μm. Moreover, this stimulatory effect of creatine, observed in wild-type cardiac fibers disappeared in mitochondrial CK deficient, but not in cytosolic CK-deficient muscle. It is concluded that respiration rates can be dissociated from cytosolic [ADP], and ADP generated by mitochondrial CK is an important regulator of oxidative phosphorylation.

The classical respiratory control phenomenon by ADP was discovered by Chance and Williams (1.Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for mitochondria in vitro. However, it failed to explain why in cardiac cells in vivo, a great increase in the rate of oxygen consumption can be observed under conditions of remarkable metabolic stability, notably at almost constant levels of phosphocreatine (PCr),1 inorganic phosphate (Pi), and ATP, and consequently ADP as calculated from the creatine kinase (CK) equilibrium (Refs. 2.Balaban R.S.

It was proposed that the rates of respiration could be modulated by different effectors, like reducing equivalents (NADH), calcium, proton motive force, and Pi (4.Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C377-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The presence of CK isoenzymes subcellularly compartmentalized has also been considered to play a primordial role in the control of the production and transport of energy into the cytoplasmic compartment. Indeed, cytosolic CK isoenzymes (muscle type MM-CK, brain type BB-CK, and MB-CK) are always co-expressed in a tissue-specific fashion together with a mitochondrial isoform (sarcomeric “ScCKmit” in skeletal muscle and heart or ubiquitous “UbCKmit” in non-muscle tissues). While in all adult skeletal muscle types, exclusively MM-CK and ScCKmit are co-expressed, small amounts of MB-CK, as well as BB-CK, are also found in cardiac muscle. The proportion of the ScCKmitversus total CK activity depends on the type of metabolism. This ratio is relatively high in oxidative muscle (heart and slow-twitch skeletal muscle), and it is low in glycolytic muscle (fast-twitch skeletal muscle). It has been proposed that in muscle cells, the different isoenzymes are functionally and/or structurally coupled either to sites of energy consumption (cellular ATPases, such as actomyosin ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) or sites of energy production (glycolysis and mitochondria) to facilitate energy transport in the cytoplasmic compartment with creatine (Cr) and PCr as diffusible intermediates. According to this model, ADP produced by high free-energy demand in myofibrils is immediately rephosphorylated into ATP through the action of cytosolic CK, using the phosphoryl group from PCr, while Cr diffuses back to mitochondria to be rephosphorylated into PCr through the action of ScCKmit bound to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. For an update on the PCr/CK system see Ref. 9.Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem.

The ScCKmit, the structure of which is known now at an atomic resolution (11.Schnyder T. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. J. Mol.

Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is in a position to control the metabolic fluxes between mitochondria and cytoplasm, and to respond adequately to an increased energy demand in oxidative muscles. Considering the functional coupling of the ScCKmit with the ATP-ADP carrier and the restricted permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane for adenine nucleotides (5.Saks V.A. Khuchua Z.A. Vasilyeva E.V. Belikova O.Yu. Kuznetsov A.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 155-192Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14.Gellerich F.N. Laterveer F.D. Korzeniewski B. Zierz S. Nicolay K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the ADP produced in the intermembrane space by ScCKmit could be more efficient to stimulate the respiration than ADP produced directly in the cytoplasm (15.Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 69-83Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The increase of apparent affinity of oxidative phosphorylation for ADP in the presence of Cr in the respiratory medium surrounding permeabilized cardiac fibers or cardiomyocytes, as compared with affinity determined in the absence of Cr, supports this hypothesis (5.Saks V.A.

However, the relative role of the local (mitochondrial intermembrane space) ADP production by ScCKmit in the control of respiration, in comparison to cytoplasmic ADP, has not been directly evaluated. With different transgenic CK null mutant mice at hand (17.Van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. Ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 18.Steeghs K. Heerschap A. De Haan A. Ruitenbeek W. Oerlemans F. Van Deursen J. Perryman B. Pette D. Bruckwilder M.

Methods. 1997; 71: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), M-CK and ScCKmit-deficient mice, as well as double knock-out mice, we were in a position to determine the relative roles of different CK isoenzymes and particularly that of ScCKmit in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in different types of muscles. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the characteristics of the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and its stimulation by Cr in heart, soleus, and white gastrocnemius taken from wild-type and transgenic mice, by using the permeabilized fiber technique (7.Saks V.A. Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Kay L. Sikk P. Tiivel T. Tranqui L. Olivares J. Winkler K. Wiedemann F. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results show the control of the mitochondrial respiration rate by ADP generated via functionally coupled ScCKmit in close vicinity of the ATP-ADP carrier in the intermembrane space. It is proposed that this control of respiration by ScCKmit in oxidative fibers is due to both the functional coupling between ScCKmit and ATP-ADP carrier and the restricted permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane for adenine nucleotides. In this study, we used wild-type C57BL/6 mice as controls and three transgenic mice models, derived by homologous recombination of stem cells, in which the genes of different CK isoforms have been ablated: (i) M-CK deficient mice that no longer express cytosolic muscle-type MM-CK (M-CK(−/−) group) (17.Van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. Ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), (ii) mice deficient in sarcomeric mitochondrial CK (ScCKmit(−/−) group) (18.Steeghs K. Heerschap A. De Haan A. Ruitenbeek W. Oerlemans F. Van Deursen J. Perryman B. Pette D. Bruckwilder M. Koudijs J. Wieringa B. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as (iii) mice lacking both M-CK and ScCKmit isoforms (CK(−/−) group). It should be noted that residual BB-CK, which is expressed in heart (1–5% of total CK in wild-type) is still present in these mutant types. There is no compensatory effect on the expression of any of the other CK isoforms in the different CK-mutants. However, some adaptational changes were described (17.Van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. Ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 18.Steeghs K. Heerschap A. De Haan A. Ruitenbeek W.

Biochem. 1998; 184: 183-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the mitochondrial design changes most prominently in the fast fibers of M-CK single and double-CK(−/−) mutants, it seems to be unchanged either in the fast fibers of ScCKmit(−/−) mutants or in cardiac fibers whatever the mutant types. The investigation conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985). Permeabilized fibers were prepared according to the method described earlier (7.Saks V.A. Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Kay L. Sikk P. Tiivel T. Tranqui L. Olivares J. Winkler K. Wiedemann F. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Sharov V.G. Kapelko V.I. Saks V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The animals were anesthetized with Nembutal (100 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Then, the heart, still beating, and skeletal muscles (soleus and white gastrocnemius) were rapidly excised and placed into pre-cooled solution A containing in mm: CaK2EGTA, 2.77; K2EGTA, 7.23; MgCl2, 6.56; dithiothreitol, 0.5; potassium methanesulfonate, 50; imidazole, 20; taurine, 20; Na2ATP, 5.3; PCr, 15, pH 7.1, adjusted at 25 °C. All following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Muscle bundles were isolated (parallel to the main fiber direction) from left ventricles and both skeletal muscle types. After mechanical dilaceration of these bundles using needles to separate fibers from each other, samples were incubated with saponin (50 μg/ml solution A) at mild stirring for 30 min for complete solubilization of the sarcolemma. Permeabilized fibers were then washed (3 times to remove completely all saponin and metabolites) for 10 min in solution B containing in mm: CaK2EGTA, 2.77; K2EGTA, 7.23; MgCl2, 1.38; dithiothreitol, 0.5; potassium methanesulfonate, 100; imidazole, 20; taurine, 20; K2HPO4, 3, pH 7.1, adjusted at 25 °C. The rates of oxygen consumption were recorded by using the two-channel high resolution respirometer (Oroboros Oxygraph, Paar KG, Graz, Austria) or Yellow Spring Clark oxygen electrode in 2 ml of solution B, supplemented with respiratory substrates (5 mm glutamate and 2 mm malate) and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The determinations were carried out at 25 °C. The solubility of oxygen was taken as 215 nmol of O2/ml (20.Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Sharov V.G. Kapelko V.I. Saks V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After measurements, the fiber bundles were carefully removed, washed in distilled water, and the dry weight was determined (after 48 h at 80 °C) in order to express the absolute values of respiratory rates in nmol of O2/min/mg dry weight. The oxygraphic samples (1 ml), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, were stored at −80 °C until [ADP] was determined. All proteins (bovine serum albumin) present in the respiratory medium were precipitated by 60% perchloric acid (100 μl). Then, the samples were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C). The supernatants (600 μl) were neutralized by a solution 2 m KHCO3(420–470 μl depending on the samples). The samples were spun once more at 17,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C) and the supernatants loaded directly onto the HPLC column. The adequate separation of adenine nucleotides was performed by reversed phase chromatography on a HPLC system using a PepRPC HR 5/5 column and a gradient system, as described previously (21.Dickinson K. Science Tools. 1992; 36: 6-8Google Scholar). The injection volume was 40 μl for standards or neutralized extracts. Eluent A contained 50 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmtetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, pH 6.0, and Eluent B contained 50 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmtetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 40% methanol, pH 6.0. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. After 3 min with Eluent A alone, an increasing gradient from 0 to 70% of Eluent B was performed in 14 min. Then, the gradient was increased to 100% Eluent B (40% methanol) in 1 min and maintained during 3 min to clean the column as much as possible. To return to Eluent A, a decreasing gradient from 100% to 0% Eluent B within 2 min was used. Using this procedure, the elution of ADP occurred at 12.3 min. For the calculation of [ADP] in oxygraphic samples, the calibration was made by injecting known quantities of ADP standard (previously determined by spectrophotometric method: absorbance of a standard ADP solution was measured at neutral pH and λ = 259 nm, and [ADP] calculated using an extinction coefficient equal to 15.4 × 10−3m−1). All reagents were purchased from Sigma, or Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany) for ATP and ADP. The results are expressed by mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using the Anova test (variance analysis and Fisher test), and p < 0.05 was taken as the level of statistical significance. Due to the compartmentation of the ADP production within muscle cells in vivo, e.g. in the cytosol or within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (22.Gellerich F.N. Schlame M. Bohnensack R. Kunz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is important to know what the relative efficiencies of stimulation of mitochondrial respiration by ADP from these different intracellular sources are. To address this question, investigations were carried out on permeabilized fibers in which there was a powerful ADP-regenerating system. Indeed, while soluble cytoplasmic constituents including BB-, MB-CK, and unbound MM-CK (around 50, and 80% of total CK activity, respectively, for heart and skeletal muscle) were lost during the permeabilization procedures of sarcolemma, mitochondria, and other intracellular structures such as myofilaments and sarcoplasmic reticulum were intact. Moreover, proteins connected to these structures such as ATPase and bound MM-CK were still present. Thus, it is possible to stimulate mitochondrial respiration by activating the endogenous production of ADP. In this study, we stimulated mitochondrial respiration by the addition of either 1.0 mm ATP or 1.0 mm ATP together with 20 mm Cr. Depending on these conditions, three different pathways led to ADP generation: 1) high myofibrillar ATPase activity occurred under saturating [ATP] of 1 mm; 2) compartmentalized adenylate kinase (AK) activity participated also to ADP production from ATP and AMP; 3) compartmentalized CK, not only ScCKmit in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (corresponding to around 60 and 20% of total CK activity remaining in the permeabilized fibers of heart and skeletal muscle, respectively) but also bound MM-CK to myofibrils and sarcoplasmic reticulum (corresponding to around 40 and 80% of total CK activity remaining in the permeabilized fibers of heart and skeletal muscle, respectively). These relative contents of ScCKmit and MM-CK in permeabilized fiber extracts were estimated, after cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis, by staining for CK activity (not shown). By activating these different pathways for ADP generation, our protocol reproduced most closely what occurs in the intracellular medium inside the cell. To assay the extramitochondrial steady state [ADP], aliquots of the medium surrounding the permeabilized fibers were taken in each oxygraphic experiment. As there is a rapid diffusional equilibrium of metabolites between the intracellular bulk phase and the surrounding medium (23.Ovadi J. Cell Architecture and Metabolic Channelling. Springer Verlag, New York1995: 1-250Google Scholar), the [ADP] measured in samples is supposed to reflect the cytosolic [ADP]. In order to determine the relative contribution of ScCKmit and bound MM-CK in the control of mitochondrial respiration observed in permeabilized wild-type fibers, we performed all the experiments in muscles from the three different types of CK-deficient mice. As the control of mitochondrial respirationin vivo depends on the specific metabolic properties of the muscle (16.Kuznetsov A.V. Tiivel T. Sikk P. Käämbre T. Kay L. Daneshrad Z. Rossi A. Kadaja L. Peet N. Seppet E. Saks V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), our experiments were carried out on three different muscles: heart and soleus (oxidative type), as well as white gastrocnemius (glycolytic type). While a high apparentK m for exogenous ADP (around 150–200 μm for control mouse) was observed in oxidative slow-twitch permeabilized fibers, a very low apparentK m for exogenous ADP (around 5–10 μm) characterized the white fast-twitch permeabilized fibers. These data are not shown, but appeared similar to those previously published (24.Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Anflous K. Mateo P. van Deursen J. Wieringa B. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19921-19929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,25.Boehm E. Veksler V. Mateo P. Lenoble C. Wieringa B. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We observed a significant decrease of the apparentK m for ADP in heart fibers from M-CK-deficient mice (102 ± 11 versus 157 ± 6 μm in wild-type fibers), and a significant increase of the apparentK m for ADP in gastrocnemius fibers from M-CK-deficient mice (8.7 ± 0.8 versus 4.6 ± 1.0 μm in wild-type fibers). This last observation was also made in gastrocnemius fibers from ScCKmit and double knock-out mice. But we did not observe any modification of the K mfor ADP in heart and soleus fibers from ScCKmit and double knock-out mice. Fig. 1 shows representative oxygraph readings for permeabilized cardiac fibers from wild-type (A) and ScCKmit-deficient mice (B), when mitochondrial respiration was stimulated by 1 mm ATP in the presence or absence of Cr. In wild-type fibers, addition of ATP alone activated the oxygen consumption (VO2) to half its maximal value (15.78 ± 0.83 nmol of O2/min/mg dry weight). In the presence of 20 mm Cr in the respiratory medium, a similar addition of ATP increased the VO2 up to the maximal value (29.06 ± 1.18 nmol of O2/min/mg dry weight), as it was observed at a saturating [ADP] of 1 mm (not shown). This stimulating effect of Cr was not observed in fibers from ScCKmit knock-out mice (Fig. 1 B). In order to facilitate the comparison between groups in each type of muscle, the stimulation of respiration by 1 mm ATP was expressed by the ratioV ATP/V 0, whereV 0 is the VO2 before ATP addition. Fig. 2 A presents the mean values of this ratio obtained in cardiac fibers for each group of mice, and Fig. 2 B those of the extramitochondrial [ADP] corresponding to the steady state, after 1 mm ATP addition alone or in the presence of Cr. While we observed an [ADP] of 51 ± 7 μm when respiration (around 50% of maximal activation) was induced by 1 mm ATP alone, an [ADP] of 89 ± 9 μm was measured under maximal stimulation of the respiration by Cr together with ATP. In cardiac fibers from M-CK-deficient mice, we observed qualitatively the same results as those obtained in cardiac wild-type fibers (Fig. 2, A andB), although the activation of respiration by Cr was slightly lower. By contrast, both the stimulation of respiration and the increase of [ADP], caused by the presence of Cr, were drastically decreased and completely suppressed in cardiac fibers from ScCKmit and double-CK knock-out mice, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2Determination of mitochondrial respiratory stimulation and extramitochondrial [ADP] when ADP is produced by different ways: study in permeabilized cardiac fibers. Thegraph in panel A shows statistical data of the experiments presented in Fig. 1 for the wild-type (WT) and the three different types of transgenic CK mice (see “Materials and Methods”). The stimulation of respiration by 1 mm ATP was evaluated by the ratio of the respiration rate in the presence of 1 mm ATP on the respiration rate with substrates only, before ATP addition, (V ATP 1 mm/V 0).V 0 values were close to 6 nmol of O2/min/mg dry weight for all groups. The same evaluations were made in respiratory medium supplemented with 20 mm Cr (hatched bars). In panel B, the steady-state extramitochondrial [ADP] after stimulation of respiration by 1 mm ATP alone or in the presence of Cr was determined in the medium surrounding the fibers, by HPLC method. The values are expressed in micromolar.

Concerning the data obtained in soleus (oxidative) fibers, the very same conclusions can be drawn as for cardiac fibers. In both cases, the comparison between wild-type and transgenic groups showed that the increase of both respiration and cytosolic [ADP] observed in the presence of Cr was related to the ScCKmit reaction. In glycolytic type fibers from wild-type mice (Fig. 3 II), the addition of 1 mm ATP induced a VO2 close to the maximal value, as it was reached with saturating [ADP], being around 0.1 mm [ADP] in this type of fibers (not shown). While the V ATP/V 0 ratio was not changed by the presence of Cr, cytosolic [ADP] was increased from 60 ± 6 μm in the absence of Cr to 160 ± 22 μm in its presence. In gastrocnemius fibers from double-CK knock-out mice, as observed before with oxidative fibers, the [ADP] was not changed in the presence of Cr, the values being even significantly lower than the control value. However, by contrast to what was found in oxidative fibers, the elevation of [ADP] in the presence of Cr was as high in glycolytic fibers from ScCKmit-deficient mice as that in wild-type fibers, and it was of smaller magnitude in glycolytic fibers from M-CK knock-out mice. Therefore, while the elevation of [ADP] in the presence of Cr was related to the ScCKmit activity in oxidative permeabilized fibers (heart and soleus), it seemed that the M-CK rather than the ScCKmit was mainly implicated in the accumulation of ADP into the cytosol of glycolytic fibers (Figs.2 B and 3 B). This observation can be related to the presence of a larger amount of M-CK (lower amount of ScCKmit) in glycolytic than in oxidative fibers. Furthermore, it could be noticed that the stimulation of respiration by ATP alone tended to be lower in the transgenic groups than in the wild-type group. In gastrocnemius fibers, considering that the level of ADP produced from 1 mm ATP added was close to the saturating [ADP], and the apparent K m for ADP was significantly higher in the three mutant type groups than in wild-type group, the decreasedV ATP could be explained by a cytosolic [ADP] below the saturating concentration. When the [ADP] was maintained to saturating concentration by M-CK or ScCKmit activity in the presence of Cr, V ATP was maximal. In gastrocnemius fibers from double-CK knock-out mice, the significant increase ofV 0 was also partly responsible for decreasing the ratio of V ATP/V 0. Although in oxidative fibers, we observed parallel tendencies for elevation of VO2 and [ADP] in the cytosol, this increase of the extramitochondrial [ADP] could not alone explain the stimulation of respiration at maximal rate. Indeed, Cr increased the [ADP] to a value close to 90 μm, which, however, was still much lower than needed for maximal VO2 (1 mm ADP). Thus, to find out whether the stimulation of respiration by Cr in oxidative fibers was only a consequence of extramitochondrial [ADP] increase, or, as we supposed it, directly correlated with ADP generation by ScCKmit in the intermembrane space, we repeated the first experiment (stimulation of respiration by ATP ± Cr), followed by the addition of pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), at saturating levels of 10 units/ml and 5 mm, respectively, in order to rephosphorylate and thus eliminate cytosolic ADP. Finally, Ap5A was used at a saturating concentration of 200 μm to eliminate an interference of AK. Under these conditions, there was a competition for ADP between oxidative phosphorylation and the ADP-trap system. After respiratory rates were stationary, samples were taken for the determination of [ADP] by HPLC. This experiment was carried out only on cardiac fibers. Fig. 4 A illustrates the principle of the method used. As AK was inhibited by Ap5A, only CK isoenzymes are represented in the scheme. In the absence of PK + PEP system, supposedly cytosolic ADP contributes to the control of mitochondrial respiration. In the presence of an ADP-trap system, the role played by cytosolic ADP in the control of the respiration should be reduced to a minimum. This gives the possibility to evaluate the importance of ADP production, in the intermembrane space, by ScCKmit for the stimulation of respiration. Panel B of Fig. 4 shows the profile of adenine nucleotide contents present in the medium surrounding permeabilized fibers when respiration was stimulated by 1 mm ATP in the absence"
https://openalex.org/W2008251866,"Perlecan is a multifaceted heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is expressed not only as an intrinsic constituent of basement membranes but also as a cell-surface and pericellular proteoglycan. Perlecan functions as a ligand reservoir for various growth factors that become stabilized against misfolding or proteolysis and acts as a co-receptor for basic fibroblast growth factor by augmenting high affinity binding and receptor activation. These biological properties are mediated by the heparan sulfate moiety. Rather little is known about the protein core's mediation of functions. We have recently discovered that fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7) binds to perlecan protein core and that exogenous perlecan efficiently reconstitutes FGF7 mitogenic activity in perlecan-deficient cells. In this report we examined the specific binding of FGF7 to various domains and subdomains of perlecan protein core. Using several experimental approaches including overlay protein assays, radioligand binding experiments, and the yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrate that FGF7 binds specifically to the N-terminal half of domain III and to a lesser extent to domain V, with affinity constants in the range of 60 nm. Thus, perlecan protein core should be considered a novel biological ligand for FGF7, an interaction that could influence cancer growth and tissue remodeling."

Here we describe a solution to this problem for diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), an integral membrane protein from Escherichia coli. Twelve enhanced stability mutants of DGK were obtained using a simple screen. Four of the mutations were combined to create a quadruple mutant that had improved stability in a wide range of detergents. Inn-octylglucoside, the wild-type DGK had a thermal inactivation half-life of 6 min at 55 °C, while the quadruple mutant displayed a half-life of 35 min at 80 °C. In addition, the quadruple mutant had improved thermodynamic stability. Our approach should be applicable to other membrane proteins that can be conveniently assayed."
https://openalex.org/W2024789766,"Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that increased competence to glycosylate ceramide conferred adriamycin resistance in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Liu, Y. Y., Han, T. Y., Giuliano, A. E., and M. C. Cabot. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1140–1146). This was achieved by cellular transfection with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the enzyme that converts ceramide to glucosylceramide. With this, we hypothesized that a decrease in cellular ceramide glycosylation would result in heightened drug sensitivity and reverse adriamycin resistance. To down-regulate ceramide glycosylation potential, we transfected adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7-AdrR) with GCS antisense (asGCS), using a pcDNA 3.1/his A vector and developed a new cell line, MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and Western blot analysis revealed marked decreases in both GCS mRNA and protein in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells compared with the MCF-7-AdrR parental cells. MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells exhibited 30% less GCS activity by in vitro enzyme assay (19.7 ± 1.1 versus 27.4 ± 2.3 pmol GC/h/μg protein,p < 0.001) and were 28-fold more sensitive to adriamycin (EC50, 0.44 ± 0.01 versus12.4 ± 0.7 μm, p < 0.0001). GCS antisense transfected cells were also 2.4-fold more sensitive to C6-ceramide compared with parental cells (EC50= 4.0 ± 0.03 versus 9.6 ± 0.5 μm,p < 0.0005). Under adriamycin stress, GCS antisense transfected cells compared with parental cells displayed time- and dose-dependent increases in endogenous ceramide and dramatically higher levels of apoptotic effector, caspase-3. Western blotting showed that adriamycin sensitivity, introduced by asGCS gene transfection, was independent of P-glycoprotein and Bcl-2 expression. In summary, this work shows that transfection of GCS antisense tempers the expression of native GCS and restores cell sensitivity to adriamycin. Therefore, limiting the potential to glycosylate ceramide, which is an apoptotic signal in chemotherapy and radiotherapy, provides a promising approach to combat drug resistance.

Other reaction components included sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 m), pH 7.8, EDTA (2.0 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), dithiothreitol (1.0 mm), β-NAD (2.0 mm), and [3H]UDP-glucose (0.5 mm). Radiolabeled and unlabeled UDP-glucose were diluted to achieve the desired radiospecific activity (4,700 dpm/nmol). To terminate the reaction, tubes were placed on ice, and 0.5 ml of isopropanol and 0.4 ml of Na2SO4 were added. After brief vortex mixing, 3 ml of t-butyl methyl ether was added, and the tubes were mixed for 30 s. After centrifugation, 0.5 ml of upper phase, which contained GC, was withdrawn and mixed with 4.5 ml of EcoLume for analysis of radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Cellular mRNA was purified using a mRNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal amounts of mRNA (5.0 ng) were used for RT-PCR. Under upstream primer (5′-CCTTTCCTCTCCCCACCTTCCTCT-3′) and downstream primer conditions (5′-GGTTTCAGAAGAGAGACACCTGGG-3′), a 302-base pair fragment in the 5′-terminal region of the GCS gene was produced using the ProSTAR HF single-tube RT-PCR system (High Fidelity, Stratagene) in a thermocycler (Mastercycler Gradient, Eppendorf). mRNAs were reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 15 min. DNA was amplified with TaqPlus Precision DNA polymerase in a 40-cycle PCR reaction, using the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 120 s. RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. β-Actin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as control for even loading. Assays were performed as described previously (7.Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2,000 cells/well) in 0.1 ml RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h before addition of drug. Drugs were added in FBS-free medium (0.1 ml), and cells were cultured at 37 °C for the indicated periods. Drug cytotoxicity was determined using the Promega 96 Aqueous cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a Microplate Fluorescent Reader, model FL600 (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Analysis was performed as described previously (7.Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E.

After 24 h, cells were shifted to 5% FBS medium with or without adriamycin and grown for the indicated times. Cellular lipids were radiolabeled by adding [3H]palmitic acid (2.5 μCi/ml culture medium) for 24 h. After removal of medium, cells were rinsed twice with PBS (pH 7.4), and total lipids were extracted as described (8.Lavie Y. Cao H.T. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The resulting organic lower phase was withdrawn and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and aliquots were applied to TLC plates. Ceramide was resolved using a solvent system containing chloroform/acetic acid (90:10, v/v). Commercial lipid standards were co-chromatographed. After development, lipids were visualized by iodine vapor staining, and the ceramide area was scraped into 0.5 ml of water. EcoLume counting fluid (4.5 ml) was added, the samples were mixed, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Caspase-3 activity was assayed by DEVD-AFC cleavage, using the ApoAlert Caspase-3 assay kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The assay was performed as described previously (15.Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Cabot M.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes (500,000 cells/dish) in 10% FBS RPMI 1640 medium. After 24 h, cells were shifted to 5% FBS RPMI 1640 medium without or with adriamycin and grown for 24 and 48 h. Following harvest, cells (106/vial) were lysed on ice for 10 min with 50 μl of lysis buffer, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The soluble fraction was incubated with 50 μm conjugated substrate DEVD-AFC in a 100-μl reaction volume at 37 °C for 60 min. The free AFC fluoresce was measured at λexcitation 400 nm and λemission 505 nm using a FL600 Microplate Fluorescence Reader. The caspase-3 inhibitor, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, was used to exclude nonspecific background in the enzymatic reaction. Western blots were performed using a modified procedure (7.Liu Y.Y.

Confluent cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and detached with trypsin-EDTA solution. Cells, pelleted by centrifugation, were solubilized in 1.0 ml of cold TNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0% aprotinin) for 60 min with shaking. The insoluble debris was excluded by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The detergent soluble fraction was loaded in equal aliquots, by protein and resolved using 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The transferred blot was blocked (3% fat-free milk powder in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) and was immunoblotted with GCS antiserum (1:1000) in binding solution (0.5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C for 18 h. To detect Xpress tag, P-glycoprotein, and Bcl-2, the antibodies of anti-Xpress tag (1:500), C219 (5 μg/ml), and Ab-1 (2.5 μg/ml), respectively, were used in place of GCS antiserum. Detection employing enzyme-linked chemiluminescence was performed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All data represent the means ± S.D. Experiments were repeated two or three times. Student's ttest was used to compare mean values. The structure of pcDNA 3.1/his A-asGCS is shown in Fig.1 A. The GCS antisense was cloned into the EcoRI site, just downstream from the anti-Xpress tag sequence in pcDNA 3.1/his A. This plasmid was introduced into MCF-7-AdrR cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. G418 was used to select transfectants. We found that the number of G418-resistant clones in MCF-7-AdrR asGCS transfected cells was much lower than in MCF-7-AdrR cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/his A vector (54/106 versus 251/106). G418-resistant clones were further selected by measuring GCS activity using the cell-free radioenzymatic assay. In all, fifty-four G418-resistant clones of MCF-7-AdrR asGCS-transfected cells were obtained, and we identified one clone that exhibited a stable 30% decrease in GCS activity (Fig. 1 B). Compared with 27.4 ± 2.3 pmol of GC synthesized by MCF-7-AdrR parental cells, GCS activity in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS was decreased to 19.7 ± 1.1 pmol of GC (Fig. 1 B, p < 0.001). There were no differences in GCS activities between the pcDNA 3.1/his A vector-transfected cells and parental MCF-7-AdrR cells (Fig.1 B). The asGCS-transfected and parental MCF-7-AdrR cells were stained with Giemsa. Representative photomicrographs are shown in Fig.1 C. MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells, including nuclei, are flatter and larger than the dome-shaped, more stellate MCF-7-AdrR cells. The asGCS cell line is also more cuboidal with less dense cytoplasm. The population doubling times for both cell lines were similar, 32 and 30 h for MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS and MCF-7-AdrR cells, respectively. Consistent with diminished GCS activity, GCS mRNA and GCS protein were reduced in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells, compared with MCF-7-AdrR cells. Total mRNA was isolated from both cell lines and reverse transcribed and amplified through RT-PCR. A representative RT-PCR gel electropherograph is shown in Fig.2 A. As with that revealed by densitometric scanning, the mRNA in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells was reduced 3-fold compared with that in MCF-7-AdrR cells (25.4%versus 77.5% of β-actin). GCS protein in cell lysates was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified using GCS antiserum. Western blotting showed that the total amount of GCS protein in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells decreased by 32% compared with MCF-7-AdrR parental cells (77,520 and 112,860 optical density units, respectively) (Fig. 2 B, right and center bands). However, MCF-7-AdrR cells that were transfected with pcDNA 3.1/his A-GCS expressed greater amounts of GCS (Fig.2 B, left band, AdrR/GCS). MCF-7-AdrR/GCS cells were developed by stable transfection of sense orientation pcDNA 3.1/his A-GCS vector in MCF-7-AdrR cells. This GCS-transfected cell line displays 80% higher GCS activity than MCF-7-AdrR cells as measured by radioenzymatic assay. After transfection with pcDNA 3.1/his A-GCS vector, although the expressed GCS was fused with Xpress tag (-Asp-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-), the upward shift in molecular mass (about 800 daltons) was undetectable by Western blot (Fig.2 B). To evaluate the expression of transfected GCS antisense gene, we employed a Xpress antibody to detect the production of Xpress-GCS fused protein (Fig. 1 A). We did not find the GCS-Xpress tag in either MCF-7-AdrR or MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells (Fig.2 C). However, the tag protein was highly expressed in MCF-7-AdrR GCS transfected cells (Fig. 2 C, center band). In MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells, what appears to be the Xpress-asGCS protein (Fig. 2 C, faint band) had a higher molecular mass compared with Xpress-GCS protein of MCF-7-AdrR/GCS and was present at only 15% the level of the latter (Fig. 2C, center band). Previous work from our laboratory revealed that overexpression of GCS elicits adriamycin resistance (7.Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After transfection of GCS antisense, we used adriamycin to assess the influence of antisense on cellular response to anthracyclines. Parental and antisense transfected cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of adriamycin for a three day period. Fig.3 A shows that MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells, compared with MCF-7-AdrR cells, were markedly more sensitive to adriamycin. At concentrations of 0.5 μm and higher, survival of MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells was significantly lower than MCF-7-AdrR cells (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3 A). The amount of drug provoking 50% cell death (EC50) was determined. The EC50 of adriamycin decreased 28-fold in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells (0.44 ± 0.01 versus 12.4 ± 0.7 μm, p < 0.0001, Fig.3 B). As expected, we observed that MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells were also sensitive to ceramide. At higher concentrations of C6-ceramide (5–10 μm), MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cell survival was significantly lower than MCF-7-AdrR cells (p < 0.0001). The EC50 of C6-ceramide in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells was 2.4-fold less than that observed in MCF-7 AdrR cells (4.0 ± 0.03versus 9.6 ± 0.5 μm, p< 0.0005, Fig. 3 B). To further elucidate the dynamics of ceramide metabolism in drug sensitivity, we measured ceramide generation in the two cell lines. We found that adriamycin exposure dramatically elevated ceramide levels in GCS antisense-transfected cells. As shown in Fig.4, adriamycin treatment increased the levels of ceramide in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At 24 and 48 h post-treatment, ceramide levels in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells increased 200 and 250%, respectively (Fig. 4 A). In sharp contrast, adriamycin treatment did not greatly modify ceramide levels in MCF-7-AdrR cells, which at 48 h increased only 16% above control. The result of increasing adriamycin dose on ceramide metabolism in the cell lines is shown in Fig. 4 B. Adriamycin at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 μm enhanced ceramide levels by 181, 188, and 246%, respectively, in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells (Fig. 1 B), whereas MCF-7-AdrR cells displayed minimal response over the same dose range. In mammalian cells, ceramide induces apoptosis directly through effector caspases, such as caspase-3 (21.Yoshimura S. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Takenaka K. Sakai H. Nishimura Y. Sakai N. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22.Monney L. Olivier R. Otter I. Jansen B. Poirier G.G. Borner C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To identify whether an alteration in ceramide metabolism in asGCS cells is related to adriamycin sensitivity via signal cascades, we analyzed caspase-3 activity in the parental and transfected cell lines. The data demonstrate that increased effector caspase-3 activity is consistent with changes in ceramide metabolism. At 10 μm adriamycin, the EC50 in MCF-7-AdrR cells, caspase-3 activity in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS increased 290 and 980% over control, at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 5). In contrast, adriamycin treatment increased caspase-3 by 160% in MCF-7-AdrR cells, albeit only at 48 h (Fig. 5). In summary, caspase-3 activity in the GCS antisense-transfected cells was 3- and 6-fold greater in response to adriamycin treatment than observed in parental cells (p < 0.0001). This suggests that impaired GCS activity permits cells to maintain high levels of ceramide under adriamycin stress, activating caspase-3 for progression of programmed cell death. Because GCS antisense transfection resulted in enhanced drug sensitivity, we evaluated the expression of P-glycoprotein and Bcl-2. A representative Western blot of P-glycoprotein is shown in Fig.6 A. P-glycoprotein was found only in trace amounts in MCF-7 cells (adriamycin sensitive). Decreased expression of P-glycoprotein was not evident in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells, when compared with the parent MCF-7-AdrR cell line (Fig.6 A). Bcl-2 was found only in trace amounts in MCF-7-AdrR and in MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cells (Fig. 6 B), although Bcl-2 was highly expressed in MCF-7 cells, consistent with our prior finding (7.Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have introduced GCS antisense DNA into chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells and revealed that this transfection reverses cellular resistance to adriamycin and to C6-ceramide in the resulting MCF-7-AdrR/asGCS cell line. The parent line, MCF-7-AdrR was selected from MCF-7 cells by culturing in the presence of adriamycin (16.Cowan K.H. Bastist"

Oxalic acid has also been found to be involved in the attacking mechanism of several phytopathogenic fungi. A full-length cDNA for oxalate decarboxylase, an oxalate-catabolizing enzyme, was isolated by using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction of a partial cDNA as cloned earlier from our laboratory (Mehta, A., and Datta, A. (1991) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 266, 23548–23553). By screening a genomic library from <i>Collybia velutipes</i> with this cDNA as a probe, a genomic clone has been isolated. Sequence analyses and comparison of the genomic sequence with the cDNA sequence revealed that the cDNA is interrupted with 17 small introns. The cDNA has been successfully expressed in cytosol and vacuole of transgenic tobacco and tomato plants. The transgenic plants show normal phenotype, and the transferred trait is stably inherited to the next generation. The recombinant enzyme is partially glycosylated and shows oxalate decarboxylase activity <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo.</i> Transgenic tobacco and tomato plants expressing oxalate decarboxylase show remarkable resistance to phytopathogenic fungus <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> that utilizes oxalic acid during infestation. The result presented in the paper represents a novel approach to develop transgenic plants resistant to fungal infection."

Immunotherapy or other effective treatments for HCV infection are not yet available, and administration of interferon in combination with ribavirin has several limitations because of toxicity (1.Weiland O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized targets for HCV therapy is the serine protease of NS3 protein. The NS3 protease domain constitutes the N terminus of the NS3 protein, which, when associated to the NS4A polypeptide, gets activated and therefore is responsible for maturation of the viral polyprotein (2.Bartenschlager R. Intervirology. 1997; 40: 378-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structure determination of the HCV NS3 protease complexed with a truncated NS4A cofactor (residues 21–34) revealed a shallow, nonpolar P1 specificity pocket. Because of the unusual substrate specificity of this enzyme it has been inferred that the design of highly selective inhibitors that could bind to the NS3 protease would be unlikely (3.Kim J.L.

We have found that capped tri-peptide α-ketoacids, incorporating difluoro aminobutyric acid in the P1 position, are potent, slow binding inhibitors of this enzyme (5.Narjes F. Brunetti M.

Their mechanism of inhibition is biphasic. The first kinetic phase involves the rapid formation of a noncovalent collision complex with association rate constants >0.2 s−1, and the second kinetic phase consists of a slow isomerization with rate constants between 5 × 10−3and 7.5 × 10−3 s−1. This results in the formation of a very tight complex with dissociation rate constants between 1.2 × 10−5 and 1.8 × 10−5s−1 and with half-lives of 11–16 h. The overallK i values are between 27 and 67 nm(5.Narjes F. Brunetti M. Colarusso S. Gerlach B. Koch U. Biasol G. Fattori D. De Francesco R. Matassa V.G. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The inhibitors described here span the P1–P4 residues and contain an activated carbonyl in an α-ketoacid moiety as the active-site serine trap. To investigate the binding mode of these compounds, an hexagonal crystal form of the NS3 protease domain (J strain) complexed with the truncated NS4A cofactor, amenable to soaking experiments, was obtained. The crystal structures of the noninhibited NS3/4A complex (2.4 Å) and with two inhibitors (Fig. 1 A), inhibitor I, α-ketoacid t, BOC-L, Glu-L, Leu-L(difluoro)aminobutyric acid (2.1 Å), and inhibitor II, α-ketoacid Z-L, Ile-L, Leu-L(difluoro)aminobutyric acid (2.4 Å), were solved. A DNA fragment encoding the serine protease domain of NS3J (amino acids 1–187) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of full-length cDNA and cloned in the pT7–7 vector. The NS3 protein was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) as described previously (6.De Francesco R. Urbani A. Nardi M.C. Tomei L. Steinkühler C. Tramontano A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13282-13287Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purified protein was characterized by N-terminal sequencing, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, and HPLC activity assay. Results obtained from the N-terminal sequencing were confirmed by the molecular mass determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Met-NS3J (1–187)). Molecular size estimation, determined by light scattering, showed NS3J and NS3J/4A complex to have hydrodynamic radii (R H) of 2.6 and 2.2 nm, respectively, which correspond to estimated molecular masses of 29 kDa for NS3J and 20 kDa for the NS3J/4A complex, respectively. These results indicate a more compact protein state for the complex compared with NS3 alone and correlate with the activation of the protease because of complex formation with the cofactor, as determined by HPLC activity assay following the protocol previously described (7.Steinkühler C.

The kinetics of inhibition of the NS3 protease by the α-ketoacids were determined by stopped flow experiments, as described by Narjes et al. (5.Narjes F. Brunetti M. Colarusso S. Gerlach B. Koch U.

The NS3 protein (1 mg·ml−1) was incubated (4 °C) with the NS4A cofactor peptide, containing a solubilizing lysine tag at its N and C termini (KGSVVIVGRIILSGRK) at a molar ratio of 1:2 and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 290 μm. NS3J/4A crystals, with a maximum size of 0.6 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm3, were obtained by both “hanging” and “sitting drop” vapor diffusion methods, after 2 weeks at room temperature, with 3.4 m NaCl, 4.8 mmcyclohexyl-pentyl-β-d-maltoside, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.02% NaN3 in 0.1 mcitrate buffer, pH 5.1. The ternary complexes with inhibitors were prepared by adding to the stabilized NS3J/4A crystals (in 4.5m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mcitrate buffer, pH 5.1), 5 mm inhibitor I, or 2.5 mm inhibitor II and equilibrated for 2–3 weeks before mounting. Inhibitor binding inside the crystal was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beam lines X11 and X31 (EMBL, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany) and ID14/EH3 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France), using 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite (8.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38287) Google Scholar) and with the CCP4 suite (9.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr.

A summary of the diffraction data is presented in TableI. The noninhibited structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (10.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

The starting models of the inhibited structures were obtained by rigid body refinement of the refined native coordinates within AMoRe. In each case, the unique inhibitor was built into the initial, clearly interpretable 2F o − F cand F o − F c density maps. Refinement, using a maximum likelihood target function, was performed with REFMAC (11.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab The coordinates of the three structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1dxp, 1dy8, and 1dyg). Two crystal forms of the NS3/4A complex (H and BK strains), have been reported (3.Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Lin C. Fox T. Dwyer M.D. Landro J.A. Chambers S.P. Markland W. Lepre C.A. O'Malley E.T.

Sardana M. Steinkuehler C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. Kuo L.C. Chen Z. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Likewise, the NS3J/4A complex contains a C-terminal domain (residues 94–175) with a six-stranded β-barrel that ends with a C-terminal helix. The N-terminal domain (NS3 residues 1–93 and NS4A residues 21–34), also a β-barrel, contains eight β-strands, with one of the two additional strands contributed by the N-terminal region of the protease and the other by the NS4A cofactor (Fig. 1 B). The cofactor assumes an extended conformation forming main chain hydrogen bonds with the protease in an anti-parallel fashion. The N terminus is well ordered in both molecules of the asymmetric unit, and, as such, it is similar to the NS3BK/4A crystal structure (4.Yan Y. Li Y. Munshi S. Sardana V. Cole J.L. Sardana M. Steinkuehler C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. Kuo L.C. Chen Z. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the NS3H/4A structure (3.Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Lin C. Fox T. Dwyer M.D. Landro J.A. Chambers S.P. Markland W. Lepre C.A. O'Malley E.T. Harbeson S.L. Rice C.M. Murcko M.A. Caron P.R. Thomson J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), only one N terminus is ordered. Both inhibitors bind at the active site (His57, Asp81, and Ser139) located at the crevice between the two domains and are rather solvent exposed (Fig. 1 B). In one of the two molecules of the asymmetric unit of the noninhibited enzyme, a glycerol molecule is bound at the oxyanion hole through a hydrogen bonding system (Fig. 3 A). This finding correlates with biochemical data showing glycerol-induced stabilization of NS3/4A complex (15.Urbani A. Biasol G. Brunetti M. Volpari C. Di Marco S. Sollazzo M. Orru‘ S. Dal Piaz F. Casbarra A. Pucci P. Nardi C. Gallinari P. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At the metal binding site, the Zn2+ion is present in the noninhibited structure (Fig. 3 B) and is coordinated to Cys97, Cys99, Cys145 and, via a water molecule, to the imidazole ring of His149. The electron density at this site is very well defined. On the contrary, in the inhibited structures, the metal ion is absent or present only with a low occupancy, and this site is quite disordered. The absence of Zn2+ is likely due to the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (∼5%), necessary to dissolve the inhibitors. This is the only region where there is a large root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the C-α distance (∼0.6–1.0 Å) between the noninhibited and inhibited structures. Otherwise the r.m.s.d. is within the coordinate experimental error. Perturbations at the Zn2+ site do not affect the NS3/4A complex and the active site conformation in our crystal structures. This appears to be in conflict with folding studies (6.De Francesco R. Urbani A. Nardi M.C. Tomei L. Steinkühler C. Tramontano A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13282-13287Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although, as of today, it has not been formally shown that the removal of Zn2+ from the folded NS3 protease has an effect on the activity or the structure. The binding mode of the two inhibitors is equivalent, forming an antiparallel β-sheet with the protease, with one strand contributed by the inhibitor and one by the protease (Fig.1, B and C). Two pathways leading to different conformations (Fig. 4) are possible, depending on the stereochemistry of the nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the ketoacid by the serine OH group. In the x-ray crystal structures of thrombin and trypsin complexed withp-amidinophenylpyruvate (16.Chen Z. Li Y. Mulichak A.M. Lewis S. Shafer J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17.Walter J. Bode W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) the attack is from there-side (Fig. 4, complex I). In the case of HCV NS3 protease, the carbonyl carbon of the inhibitor is attacked from thesi-side by the catalytic serine, forming a covalent bond (1.44 Å) with the inhibitor via the Oγ, resulting in the tetrahedral intermediate shown in Fig. 4 (complex II). The carbonyl oxygen does not point into the oxyanion hole, as observed for thrombin and trypsin (16.Chen Z. Li Y. Mulichak A.M. Lewis S. Shafer J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17.Walter J. Bode W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), instead it is hydrogen bonded to the Nε2 of His57. The two carboxyl oxygens point into the oxyanion hole: one forms a hydrogen bond with Ser139nitrogen, the other is hydrogen bonded with Gly137nitrogen. This different binding mode may be influenced by the soaking conditions, although it explains the remarkable discrepancy between the kinetics of hemiketal formation in thep-amidinophenylpyruvate/trypsin complex (18.Tanizawa K. Kanaoka Y. Wos J.D. Lawson W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) compared with the kinetics of covalent bond formation in the α-ketoacid/NS3 complexes (5.Narjes F. Brunetti M. Colarusso S. Gerlach B. Koch U. Biasol G. Fattori D. De Francesco R. Matassa V.G. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A biphasic kinetic behavior, analogous to that reported for our inhibitors (5.Narjes F. Brunetti M. Colarusso S. Gerlach B. Koch U. Biasol G. Fattori D. De Francesco R. Matassa V.G. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was observed for the reaction between trypsin and p-amidinophenylpyruvate. In the latter case, the rate constants describing the equilibrium between the initial complex and the covalent complex were determined to be 3.15 and 0.1 s−1, respectively (18.Tanizawa K. Kanaoka Y. Wos J.D. Lawson W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These data should be compared with 7.5 × 10−3 s−1 and 1.2 × 10−5 s−1, for the NS3-inhibitor I and to 5 × 10−3 and 1.8 × 10−5s−1, for the NS3-inhibitor II complexes, respectively. Therefore, these results suggest a significantly larger energy barrier for both the formation and the dissociation of the covalent complex, in the case of the NS3 protease, and correlate with the structural differences of the final covalent complexes (Fig. 4). Another characteristic of our structures is that His57makes two strong hydrogen bonds (ranging from 2.33 to 2.75 Å for all three structures; Fig. 1 C); one with its Nδ1 to the Oδ2 of Asp81, another with its main chain nitrogen to the Oδ1 of the same aspartate. The presence of these particularly short hydrogen bonds is consistent with the structure of the subtilisin protease from Bacillus lentus, solved at 0.78 Å (19.Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More generally, the existence of hydrogen bonds with a partially covalent character has been demonstrated by a recent Compton scattering study (20.Martin T.W. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The His57-Asp81 interaction is missing in the structures of the noninhibited NS3 without the NS4A cofactor (21.Love R.A. Parge H.E.

Nardi M.C. Steinkühler C. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Bazzo R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas it is present in our noninhibited NS3/4A complex (Fig.3 A). The solvent exposed residue, Lys136, close to the active site likely stabilizes the carboxylate bound at the oxyanion hole (Fig. 1, C and D). The P1 and P2 sites for both inhibitors are the same, (difluoro)aminobutyric acid and Leu, respectively (Fig. 1, Band C). The S1 pocket constitutes a small nonpolar depression on the protease surface and is formed by Val132, Leu135, and Phe154, which, together with the aliphatic part of Lys136, can make lipophilic interactions, thus explaining the preference for a Cys residue in the P1 position of substrates. The P1 residue of both inhibitors, a chemically inert fluorocarbon group, mimics the cysteine thiol of natural substrates (5.Narjes F. Brunetti M. Colarusso S. Gerlach B. Koch U. Biasol G. Fattori D. De Francesco R. Matassa V.G. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and makes hydrophobic interactions with Val132, Leu135, the aliphatic part of Lys136, and Phe154 (Fig. 1 D). In addition, attractive interactions between the fluorine lone pairs and the aromatic C-H of Phe154 are possible. In the S2 region, Ala156side chain together with His57 and the aliphatic part of Arg155 provide a small hydrophobic patch on the protein surface (Fig. 1 D). The side chains of His57, Arg155, and Ala156 sterically limit the space available to the P2 residue. Because of this steric hindrance, hydrophobic β-branched amino acids cannot be accommodated in S2, hence explaining the lower activity of inhibitors with Val or Ile in P2 (23.Ingallinella P. Altamura S. Bianchi E. Taliani M. Ingenito R. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Pessi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8906-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas Leu in P2 fits well. Inhibitor binding is further reinforced through its main chain N1 and O3, which form hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Arg155 and the main chain amide of Ala157, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The S3 surface, an extension of the S1 pocket, is formed by the hydrophobic side chains of Ala157 and Cys159and makes lipophilic interactions with the nonpolar part of the P3 side chain of the inhibitors (Fig. 1 D; Glu for inhibitor I and Ile for inhibitor II). In the structure of NS3/4A in complex with inhibitor I, the carboxylate of Glu forms a salt bridge with the NZ of Lys136 (Fig. 1 C). Because of the bulky nature of the P3 side chain of inhibitor II, Lys136 is sterically restricted and also visible, whereas it is disordered in the noninhibited structure. In addition, at the P3 position, a carbon-sulfur interaction with the enzyme residue Cys159 is possible, thereby helping to stabilize the inhibitor in an extended conformation. A hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone N2 of the inhibitors and the main chain carbonyl of Ala157 (Fig.1 C). The S4 site consists of a solvent exposed hydrophobic patch, created by Arg123 and Val158 (Fig.1 D). This small hydrophobic area should favor hydrophobic amino acids. The preference for bulky hydrophobic amino acids in P4, shown previously (23.Ingallinella P. Altamura S. Bianchi E. Taliani M. Ingenito R. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Pessi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8906-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), can be explained by the hydrophobic interaction of the P4 residue (tert-butyl in inhibitor I and benzyl capping group in inhibitor II) with Arg123 and Val158 of the enzyme and by the intramolecular hydrophobic contact with Leu in P2 (Fig. 1 D). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the crystal structure of inhibitors bound to the HCV NS3/4A complex and permits the interpretation of structure/activity relationship data (5.Narjes F. Brunetti M. Colarusso S. Gerlach B. Koch U. Biasol G. Fattori D. De Francesco R. Matassa V.G. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These structures show that even in the presence of an inhibitor, the substrate-binding region remains largely featureless and solvent-exposed and underscores the likely difficulties of developing small drug-like inhibitors.

Members of this class of enzymes are considered attractive therapeutic targets in several disease states, e.g. diabetes, cancer, and inflammation.

It is generally believed that low molecular weight, selective PTP inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases such as diabetes, autoimmunity, and cancer (1Fischer E.H.

It is particularly encouraging that highly selective, active site-directed PTP1B inhibitors have been reported (9Taing M. Keng Y.F. Shen K. Wu L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3793-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, although significant progress has been made toward developing PTP inhibitors, most compounds have features that make them unsuitable as starting points for optimization to orally active drugs (for a recent review, see Ref. 6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As an example, peroxovanadium compounds have contributed significantly to our understanding of insulin signaling (10Drake P.G. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G.Y. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but appear to be too toxic and unspecific for use as drugs. Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, have been shown to inhibit PTPs, but their inherent affinity for bone is likely to prevent their general use in other target tissues (12Murakami H. Takahashi N.

Furthermore, several of these inhibitors are time-dependent and seem to act through covalent modification of the catalytic cysteine in PTPs (13Schmidt A. Rutledge S.J. Endo N. Opas E.E. Tanaka H.

The most specific inhibitors produced so far have either been phosphonates (9Taing M. Keng Y.F. Shen K. Wu L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3793-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).The phosphonate requirements of most of the previously described PTP inhibitors have their natural justification, in that they have all addressed the active site of PTPs and thus mimic substrate binding. This site comprise the phosphate binding P-loop Cys215-(X)5-Arg221 in the base of the site, extending from a β-strand (β12) going over into an α-helix (α4) (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Several other conserved loop residues participate in substrate and inhibitor binding, including the WPD loop residues Asp181-Phe182, and residues Tyr46, Val49, Lys120, and Gln262. At the rim of the active site, Arg47and Asp48 are located giving rise to a total depth of 8–9 Å for the site (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar).Based on the potential therapeutic usefulness of selective, non-peptide inhibitors we initiated high throughput screening of a diverse compound library using PTP1B and a synthetic 33P-phosphorylated peptide as substrate. It was our aim to identify compounds that fulfilled a set of selection criteria, which would allow further optimization. We decided to include general PTP inhibitors only. The main reason for this criteria is our wish to develop a set of inhibitors that selectively inhibit different PTPs. Therefore, the common starting point should be a general PTP inhibitor that could be optimized for selectivity and potency using structure-based approaches. To secure such a general mechanism of inhibition, the compounds should be active site-directed reversible inhibitors and show classical competitive inhibition. In particular, we wanted to avoid time-dependent inhibitors that might be difficult to optimize for specificity against different PTPs utilizing structural information for the target PTPs. Also, since it is our goal to develop inhibitors that might be orally active drug candidates, only low molecular weight compounds were included. 2-(Oxalylamino)-benzoic acid (Fig. 1, compound 1) was identified during these studies and found to be one of the most efficient phenyl phosphate mimetics identified so far.DISCUSSIONSeveral attempts to make PTP inhibitors by replacing the phosphate functionality of Tyr(P) containing peptide substrates with non-hydrolyzable phosphate mimetics have been reported.

Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In most studies, the Tyr(P) mimetics were incorporated in peptides known to be substrates for PTPases. In particular, one peptide derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGF-R922–993(Ac-DADEXL-NH2, where X denotes Tyr(P) or Tyr(P) mimetics), has been useful (6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). When difluorophosphonomethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp) is introduced in the EGF-R922–993 peptide, a potent inhibitor of PTP1B is obtained with K i = 180 nm (15Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since the “minimal unit” of F2Pmp, α,α-difluorobenzyl phosphonic acid, shows a K i of 2.5 mmfor PTP1B (28Yao Z.J. Ye B. Wu X.-W. Wang S.M. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this suggests that the peptide part of the inhibitor contributes significantly to the overall binding affinity. Incorporation of O-malonyltyrosine and fluoro-O-malonyltyrosine in the Ac-DADEXL-NH2peptide leads to PTP1B inhibitors with IC50 values of 10 and 1 μm, respectively (42Akamatsu M. Roller P.P. Chen L. Zhang Z.-Y. Ye B. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Burke Jr., T.R. Ye B. Akamatsu M. Ford H. Yan X.J. Kole H.K. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Roller P.P. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is difficult to make a direct comparison of OBA with the above phenyl phosphate/Tyr(P) mimetics. Nonetheless, given the fact that OBA at neutral pH (without being incorporated in a peptide) displays a K i of 200 μm for PTP1B would indicate that this compound is one of the most potent minimal unit active site PTP1B inhibitors identified so far.The o-carboxylic acid of OBA occupies a different part of the active site when compared with the Tyr(P) substrate. A unique arrangement is thus formed with a salt bridge connecting theo-carboxylic acid and Lys120. Furthermore, theo-carboxylic acid is in hydrogen bond distance with Tyr46 and Asp181. This arrangement is critical for the observed affinity for PTP1B since removal of theo-carboxy group from compound 1 increases theK i value to >2000 μm (not shown). In this context, it is of interest that Burke and co-workers (41Burke Jr., T.R. Yao Z.-J. Zhao H. Milne G.W.A. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Voigt J.H. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) recently showed that introduction of a o-carboxy group into 4-(O-carboxymethyl)-l-tyrosine increased the potency more than 100-fold when incorporated in the above Ac-DADEXL-NH2peptide.Only one x-ray structure of PTP1B in complex with a non-phosphonate PTP inhibitor, a fluoromalonyl tyrosine-based cyclic peptide, has been reported (30Groves M.R. Yao Z.-J. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17773-17783Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the fluoromalonyl tyrosine peptide binds to the PTP signature motif of the active site of PTP1B, this was not accompanied by closure of the WPD loop. In contrast, we found that the WPD loop closes in all structures reported here. This motion brings (i) the side chain of Phe182 into a favorable position for aromatic-aromatic interaction with OBA and its derivatives, (ii) the side chain of Asp181 close to the o-carboxylic acid of OBA. The optimal positioning of both of the carboxy groups of OBA is likely to contribute significantly to the potency of this class of compounds.When comparing with the complexes of PTP1B and Tyr(P) containing peptides (26Jia Z.C. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), several structural differences have been identified in the present study. Thus, in addition to the above movement of Lys120, a minor rotation of the Phe182 side chain is observed (Fig. 5 B), most likely due to the shift seen in the aromatic cores between OBA and Tyr(P) (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, the different orientation of the Asp181 side chain might be due partly to the shift in the aromatic core, partly to interaction with the o-carboxylic acid group. This demonstrates that the active site of PTP1B, although fairly rigid, possesses the capacity to accommodate other ligands that have no or limited similarity to the natural substrate. This accommodation process is observed in the surface exposed loop regions, whereas no differences in the PTP loop are observed between the Tyr(P) and OBA complex structures. As indicated above, the potency of OBA for PTP1B (and possibly most other PTPs) appears to arise from (i) OBA's ability to closely mimic the Tyr(P) substrate (phosphate and aromatic ring) and (ii) as well as the formation of a novel set of contacts with residues Asp181, Lys120, and Tyr46.The general interest in phosphate recognition sites as drug targets (e.g. in serine and tyrosine phosphatases, SH2 domains, PTB domains, and also kinases) points to the importance of identification of novel biologically active phosphate mimetics. Compounds containing one or more carboxylic acids have been particularly useful in the design of PTP inhibitors (6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, although significant progress has been made in this area, the current study emphasizes the need for correctly positioning the carboxy groups in the active site. It appears that the unique combination of a phosphate mimetic (the oxamic acid part), the o-carboxy group, and an aromatic ring in the OBA structure provides a significant improvement over other known carboxylic acid-based PTP inhibitors. Interestingly, Beaulieu and co-workers (44Beaulieu P.L. Cameron D.R. Ferland J.M. Gauthier J. Ghiro E. Gillard J. Gorys V. Poirier M. Rancourt J. Wernic D. Llinas-Brunet M. Betageri R. Cardozo M. Hickey E.R. Ingraham R. Jakes S. Kabcenell A. Kirrane T. Lukas S. Patel U. Proudfoot J. Sharma R. Tong L. Moss N. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) recently reported the replacement of phosphate with the non-hydrolyzable oxamic acid group in peptide-based SH2 domain ligands. Although 20 times less potent than phosphate, these findings add to the notion of oxamic acid as a phosphate mimetic.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that OBA is a (i) novel, (ii) general, (iii) low molecular weight, (iv) classical, competitive, and (v) active site inhibitor of PTPs. Detailed enzyme kinetic analyses in combination with extensive x-ray crystallographic evaluation of OBA and three derivatives have shown that this class of inhibitors, in addition to utilizing many of the interaction points of the natural substrate Tyr(P), also create a unique binding mode. We anticipate that OBA will be an essential tool in future explorations of the structure and function of PTPs. Furthermore, the structural insight provided here should make OBA an ideal starting point in our search for potent and selective PTP inhibitors. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation reactions play pivotal roles in most cellular signaling processes. Protein-tyrosine kinases phosphorylate cellular substrates on tyrosine residues and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 remove phosphate from these residues (for reviews, see Refs. 1Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar and 2Hunter T. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that low molecular weight, selective PTP inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases such as diabetes, autoimmunity, and cancer (1Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 2Hunter T. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided important insight to some of the basic structural requirements for PTP-substrate and -inhibitor interactions (reviewed in Refs. 3Barford D. Jia Z.C. Tonks N.K. Nat.

It is particularly encouraging that highly selective, active site-directed PTP1B inhibitors have been reported (9Taing M. Keng Y.F. Shen K. Wu L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3793-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, although significant progress has been made toward developing PTP inhibitors, most compounds have features that make them unsuitable as starting points for optimization to orally active drugs (for a recent review, see Ref. 6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As an example, peroxovanadium compounds have contributed significantly to our understanding of insulin signaling (10Drake P.G. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G.Y. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but appear to be too toxic and unspecific for use as drugs. Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, have been shown to inhibit PTPs, but their inherent affinity for bone is likely to prevent their general use in other target tissues (12Murakami H. Takahashi N. Tanaka S. Nakamura I. Udagawa N. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. Abe M. Yuda Y. Konno F. Barbier A. Suda T. Bone. 1997; 20: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of these inhibitors are time-dependent and seem to act through covalent modification of the catalytic cysteine in PTPs (13Schmidt A. Rutledge S.J. Endo N. Opas E.E. Tanaka H. Wesolowski G. Leu C.T. Huang Z. Ramachandaran C. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J.

The most specific inhibitors produced so far have either been phosphonates (9Taing M. Keng Y.F. Shen K. Wu L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3793-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or those based on peptides that are not suited for clinical use due to their lack of oral bioavailability and metabolic instability (reviewed in Ref. 6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The phosphonate requirements of most of the previously described PTP inhibitors have their natural justification, in that they have all addressed the active site of PTPs and thus mimic substrate binding. This site comprise the phosphate binding P-loop Cys215-(X)5-Arg221 in the base of the site, extending from a β-strand (β12) going over into an α-helix (α4) (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Several other conserved loop residues participate in substrate and inhibitor binding, including the WPD loop residues Asp181-Phe182, and residues Tyr46, Val49, Lys120, and Gln262. At the rim of the active site, Arg47and Asp48 are located giving rise to a total depth of 8–9 Å for the site (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Based on the potential therapeutic usefulness of selective, non-peptide inhibitors we initiated high throughput screening of a diverse compound library using PTP1B and a synthetic 33P-phosphorylated peptide as substrate. It was our aim to identify compounds that fulfilled a set of selection criteria, which would allow further optimization. We decided to include general PTP inhibitors only. The main reason for this criteria is our wish to develop a set of inhibitors that selectively inhibit different PTPs. Therefore, the common starting point should be a general PTP inhibitor that could be optimized for selectivity and potency using structure-based approaches. To secure such a general mechanism of inhibition, the compounds should be active site-directed reversible inhibitors and show classical competitive inhibition. In particular, we wanted to avoid time-dependent inhibitors that might be difficult to optimize for specificity against different PTPs utilizing structural information for the target PTPs. Also, since it is our goal to develop inhibitors that might be orally active drug candidates, only low molecular weight compounds were included. 2-(Oxalylamino)-benzoic acid (Fig. 1, compound 1) was identified during these studies and found to be one of the most efficient phenyl phosphate mimetics identified so far. DISCUSSIONSeveral attempts to make PTP inhibitors by replacing the phosphate functionality of Tyr(P) containing peptide substrates with non-hydrolyzable phosphate mimetics have been reported. Initial experiments included sulfotyrosyl (34Desmarais S. Jia Z. Ramachandaran C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Kole H.K. Garant M.J. Kole S.

Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In most studies, the Tyr(P) mimetics were incorporated in peptides known to be substrates for PTPases. In particular, one peptide derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGF-R922–993(Ac-DADEXL-NH2, where X denotes Tyr(P) or Tyr(P) mimetics), has been useful (6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). When difluorophosphonomethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp) is introduced in the EGF-R922–993 peptide, a potent inhibitor of PTP1B is obtained with K i = 180 nm (15Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since the “minimal unit” of F2Pmp, α,α-difluorobenzyl phosphonic acid, shows a K i of 2.5 mmfor PTP1B (28Yao Z.J. Ye B. Wu X.-W. Wang S.M. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this suggests that the peptide part of the inhibitor contributes significantly to the overall binding affinity. Incorporation of O-malonyltyrosine and fluoro-O-malonyltyrosine in the Ac-DADEXL-NH2peptide leads to PTP1B inhibitors with IC50 values of 10 and 1 μm, respectively (42Akamatsu M. Roller P.P. Chen L. Zhang Z.-Y. Ye B. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Burke Jr., T.R. Ye B. Akamatsu M. Ford H. Yan X.J. Kole H.K. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Roller P.P. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is difficult to make a direct comparison of OBA with the above phenyl phosphate/Tyr(P) mimetics. Nonetheless, given the fact that OBA at neutral pH (without being incorporated in a peptide) displays a K i of 200 μm for PTP1B would indicate that this compound is one of the most potent minimal unit active site PTP1B inhibitors identified so far.The o-carboxylic acid of OBA occupies a different part of the active site when compared with the Tyr(P) substrate. A unique arrangement is thus formed with a salt bridge connecting theo-carboxylic acid and Lys120. Furthermore, theo-carboxylic acid is in hydrogen bond distance with Tyr46 and Asp181. This arrangement is critical for the observed affinity for PTP1B since removal of theo-carboxy group from compound 1 increases theK i value to >2000 μm (not shown). In this context, it is of interest that Burke and co-workers (41Burke Jr., T.R. Yao Z.-J. Zhao H. Milne G.W.A. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Voigt J.H. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) recently showed that introduction of a o-carboxy group into 4-(O-carboxymethyl)-l-tyrosine increased the potency more than 100-fold when incorporated in the above Ac-DADEXL-NH2peptide.Only one x-ray structure of PTP1B in complex with a non-phosphonate PTP inhibitor, a fluoromalonyl tyrosine-based cyclic peptide, has been reported (30Groves M.R. Yao Z.-J. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17773-17783Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the fluoromalonyl tyrosine peptide binds to the PTP signature motif of the active site of PTP1B, this was not accompanied by closure of the WPD loop. In contrast, we found that the WPD loop closes in all structures reported here. This motion brings (i) the side chain of Phe182 into a favorable position for aromatic-aromatic interaction with OBA and its derivatives, (ii) the side chain of Asp181 close to the o-carboxylic acid of OBA. The optimal positioning of both of the carboxy groups of OBA is likely to contribute significantly to the potency of this class of compounds.When comparing with the complexes of PTP1B and Tyr(P) containing peptides (26Jia Z.C. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), several structural differences have been identified in the present study. Thus, in addition to the above movement of Lys120, a minor rotation of the Phe182 side chain is observed (Fig. 5 B), most likely due to the shift seen in the aromatic cores between OBA and Tyr(P) (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, the different orientation of the Asp181 side chain might be due partly to the shift in the aromatic core, partly to interaction with the o-carboxylic acid group. This demonstrates that the active site of PTP1B, although fairly rigid, possesses the capacity to accommodate other ligands that have no or limited similarity to the natural substrate. This accommodation process is observed in the surface exposed loop regions, whereas no differences in the PTP loop are observed between the Tyr(P) and OBA complex structures. As indicated above, the potency of OBA for PTP1B (and possibly most other PTPs) appears to arise from (i) OBA's ability to closely mimic the Tyr(P) substrate (phosphate and aromatic ring) and (ii) as well as the formation of a novel set of contacts with residues Asp181, Lys120, and Tyr46.The general interest in phosphate recognition sites as drug targets (e.g. in serine and tyrosine phosphatases, SH2 domains, PTB domains, and also kinases) points to the importance of identification of novel biologically active phosphate mimetics. Compounds containing one or more carboxylic acids have been particularly useful in the design of PTP inhibitors (6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, although significant progress has been made in this area, the current study emphasizes the need for correctly positioning the carboxy groups in the active site. It appears that the unique combination of a phosphate mimetic (the oxamic acid part), the o-carboxy group, and an aromatic ring in the OBA structure provides a significant improvement over other known carboxylic acid-based PTP inhibitors. Interestingly, Beaulieu and co-workers (44Beaulieu P.L. Cameron D.R. Ferland J.M. Gauthier J. Ghiro E. Gillard J. Gorys V. Poirier M. Rancourt J. Wernic D. Llinas-Brunet M. Betageri R. Cardozo M.

Chem. 1999; 42: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) recently reported the replacement of phosphate with the non-hydrolyzable oxamic acid group in peptide-based SH2 domain ligands. Although 20 times less potent than phosphate, these findings add to the notion of oxamic acid as a phosphate mimetic.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that OBA is a (i) novel, (ii) general, (iii) low molecular weight, (iv) classical, competitive, and (v) active site inhibitor of PTPs. Detailed enzyme kinetic analyses in combination with extensive x-ray crystallographic evaluation of OBA and three derivatives have shown that this class of inhibitors, in addition to utilizing many of the interaction points of the natural substrate Tyr(P), also create a unique binding mode. We anticipate that OBA will be an essential tool in future explorations of the structure and function of PTPs.

In particular, one peptide derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGF-R922–993(Ac-DADEXL-NH2, where X denotes Tyr(P) or Tyr(P) mimetics), has been useful (6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). When difluorophosphonomethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp) is introduced in the EGF-R922–993 peptide, a potent inhibitor of PTP1B is obtained with K i = 180 nm (15Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since the “minimal unit” of F2Pmp, α,α-difluorobenzyl phosphonic acid, shows a K i of 2.5 mmfor PTP1B (28Yao Z.J. Ye B. Wu X.-W. Wang S.M. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this suggests that the peptide part of the inhibitor contributes significantly to the overall binding affinity. Incorporation of O-malonyltyrosine and fluoro-O-malonyltyrosine in the Ac-DADEXL-NH2peptide leads to PTP1B inhibitors with IC50 values of 10 and 1 μm, respectively (42Akamatsu M. Roller P.P. Chen L. Zhang Z.-Y. Ye B. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Burke Jr., T.R. Ye B. Akamatsu M. Ford H. Yan X.J. Kole H.K. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Roller P.P. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is difficult to make a direct comparison of OBA with the above phenyl phosphate/Tyr(P) mimetics. Nonetheless, given the fact that OBA at neutral pH (without being incorporated in a peptide) displays a K i of 200 μm for PTP1B would indicate that this compound is one of the most potent minimal unit active site PTP1B inhibitors identified so far. The o-carboxylic acid of OBA occupies a different part of the active site when compared with the Tyr(P) substrate. A unique arrangement is thus formed with a salt bridge connecting theo-carboxylic acid and Lys120. Furthermore, theo-carboxylic acid is in hydrogen bond distance with Tyr46 and Asp181. This arrangement is critical for the observed affinity for PTP1B since removal of theo-carboxy group from compound 1 increases theK i value to >2000 μm (not shown). In this context, it is of interest that Burke and co-workers (41Burke Jr., T.R. Yao Z.-J. Zhao H. Milne G.W.A. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Voigt J.H. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) recently showed that introduction of a o-carboxy group into 4-(O-carboxymethyl)-l-tyrosine increased the potency more than 100-fold when incorporated in the above Ac-DADEXL-NH2peptide. Only one x-ray structure of PTP1B in complex with a non-phosphonate PTP inhibitor, a fluoromalonyl tyrosine-based cyclic peptide, has been reported (30Groves M.R. Yao Z.-J. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17773-17783Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the fluoromalonyl tyrosine peptide binds to the PTP signature motif of the active site of PTP1B, this was not accompanied by closure of the WPD loop. In contrast, we found that the WPD loop closes in all structures reported here. This motion brings (i) the side chain of Phe182 into a favorable position for aromatic-aromatic interaction with OBA and its derivatives, (ii) the side chain of Asp181 close to the o-carboxylic acid of OBA. The optimal positioning of both of the carboxy groups of OBA is likely to contribute significantly to the potency of this class of compounds. When comparing with the complexes of PTP1B and Tyr(P) containing peptides (26Jia Z.C. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), several structural differences have been identified in the present study. Thus, in addition to the above movement of Lys120, a minor rotation of the Phe182 side chain is observed (Fig. 5 B), most likely due to the shift seen in the aromatic cores between OBA and Tyr(P) (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, the different orientation of the Asp181 side chain might be due partly to the shift in the aromatic core, partly to interaction with the o-carboxylic acid group. This demonstrates that the active site of PTP1B, although fairly rigid, possesses the capacity to accommodate other ligands that have no or limited similarity to the natural substrate. This accommodation process is observed in the surface exposed loop regions, whereas no differences in the PTP loop are observed between the Tyr(P) and OBA complex structures. As indicated above, the potency of OBA for PTP1B (and possibly most other PTPs) appears to arise from (i) OBA's ability to closely mimic the Tyr(P) substrate (phosphate and aromatic ring) and (ii) as well as the formation of a novel set of contacts with residues Asp181, Lys120, and Tyr46. The general interest in phosphate recognition sites as drug targets (e.g. in serine and tyrosine phosphatases, SH2 domains, PTB domains, and also kinases) points to the importance of identification of novel biologically active phosphate mimetics. Compounds containing one or more carboxylic acids have been particularly useful in the design of PTP inhibitors (6Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers (Pept. Sci.). 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, although significant progress has been made in this area, the current study emphasizes the need for correctly positioning the carboxy groups in the active site. It appears that the unique combination of a phosphate mimetic (the oxamic acid part), the o-carboxy group, and an aromatic ring in the OBA structure provides a significant improvement over other known carboxylic acid-based PTP inhibitors. Interestingly, Beaulieu and co-workers (44Beaulieu P.L. Cameron D.R. Ferland J.M. Gauthier J. Ghiro E. Gillard J. Gorys V. Poirier M. Rancourt J. Wernic D. Llinas-Brunet M. Betageri R. Cardozo M. Hickey E.R. Ingraham R. Jakes S. Kabcenell A. Kirrane T. Lukas S. Patel U. Proudfoot J. Sharma R. Tong L. Moss N. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) recently reported the replacement of phosphate with the non-hydrolyzable oxamic acid group in peptide-based SH2 domain ligands. Although 20 times less potent than phosphate, these findings add to the notion of oxamic acid as a phosphate mimetic. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that OBA is a (i) novel, (ii) general, (iii) low molecular weight, (iv) classical, competitive, and (v) active site inhibitor of PTPs. Detailed enzyme kinetic analyses in combination with extensive x-ray crystallographic evaluation of OBA and three derivatives have shown that this class of inhibitors, in addition to utilizing many of the interaction points of the natural substrate Tyr(P), also create a unique binding mode. We anticipate that OBA will be an essential tool in future explorations of the structure and function of PTPs. Furthermore, the structural insight provided here should make OBA an ideal starting point in our search for potent and selective PTP inhibitors.

Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar and 2.Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The specificity in the system is conferred by a selective recognition of the cargo, its specific sequestration in appropriate transport vesicles at the budding site, and discriminating docking at the target membrane. Instrumental in the initiating events of the vesicular trafficking are cytosolic proteins that assemble at the vesicle budding sites to form “coats.” The best known coats involve heterotetrameric protein complexes called adaptor complexes 1 and 2 (AP-1 and AP-2), which mediate the recruitment of clathrin to the vesicle budding site and are associated with trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the late endocytic pathway and from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes, respectively. Other thoroughly studied coats are formed by the “coatamer” proteins COPI and COPII, which are responsible for vesicle formation in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi and in the early secretory pathway, respectively. COP proteins are not associated with clathrin (3.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 4.Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). AP-3, another adaptor complex originally thought to be associated with non-clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking in the trans-Golgi network, has also been shown to bind clathrin (5.Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). All the AP proteins have a similar heterotetrameric structure, being composed of two heavy chains (adaptins) and one medium (μ) and one small (ς) chain (6.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The compositions of the AP proteins are as follows. AP-1: γ- and β1-adaptins/μ1/ς1; AP-2: α- and β2-adaptins/μ2/ς2; and AP-3: δ- and β3-adaptins/μ3/ς3. In electron microscopy, AP proteins show an overall structure consisting of a bulky body that is formed by the N-terminal “head” domains of the two adaptins and by the smaller subunits embedded between them and of “ears” that protrude from the body and that correspond to the C termini of the adaptins (6.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 7.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 8.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There is also a considerable degree of sequence similarity between the various subunits and between the subunits in different species, suggesting conserved functional features. The β-adaptins are ∼85% identical, whereas the others are <50% similar. All the adaptins have a similar domain structure: a large N-terminal head domain, a proline- and glycine-rich hinge region, and a C-terminal appendage or ear (7.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 9.Ponnambalam S. Robinson M.S. Jackson A.P. Peiperl L. Parham P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4814-4820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α- and γ-adaptins have the least overall identity (only 25%). There are similarities also between μ- and ς-subunits (10.Traub L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on morphological and functional studies, it is suggested that there are at least 12 different sorting events in vesicular membrane trafficking that putatively employ coat proteins (11.Lewin D.A. Mellman I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, not as many coat proteins are known, calling for the presence of novel adaptor or coat proteins. Indeed, several novel isoforms or homologs of known adaptor/coat proteins (see Refs. 12.Brodsky F.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 175-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 13.Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently been described in both mammals and yeast, suggesting that related but variable sets of subunits may be utilized to match the specificity requirements of the trafficking events. There is also an emerging group of proteins that are thought to be involved in the determination of the specificity of the vesicle fusion events. They are loosely called “tethering” proteins due to their extended shape and capacity to mediate interactions between different membrane compartments (16.Clague M.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R258-R260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17.Warren G. Malhotra V. Curr. Opin.

One of the best studied is Hrs, which contains a VHS and a FYVE domain, forms coiled-coil structures, and associates with endocytic vesicles (19.Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the molecular cloning and initial characterization of a novel Golgi-associated protein that contains a VHS domain, which is characteristic of endocytosis-associated proteins (20.Lohi O. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21.Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal end similar to the ear domain of γ-adaptin. It shows a distinct membrane association and a Golgi-associated localization as determined by cell fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and transfection experiments. Due to these features, we suggest that it plays a role in vesicular trafficking events in or in the immediate vicinity of the Golgi complex. Based on the sequence similarities (VHS domain andear domain of γ-adaptin), we call this protein “Vear.” Standard solutions; buffers; and procedures for purification and precipitation of DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation reactions were as described by Sambrooket al. (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring1989: 1.3-1.85Google Scholar). Sequencing was done using an automated ABI PRISM 377XL DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For sequence analysis and alignments, the Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package Program Suite 9.0 and CLUSTAL X (23.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) programs were used. BLAST searches (24.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schlaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) of EST1 data bases were carried out on a World Wide Web server at NCBI. As a query, nucleotides 13–420 of the sequence encoding the VHS domain of EAST (GenBankTM accession number AJ224514) (25.Lohi O. Poussu A. Meriläinen J. Kellokumpu S. Wasenius V.-M. Lehto V.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21408-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were used. In reiterative runs, several matching and overlapping EST clones were found. The cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 501–950 of the coding region of Vear was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and used as a probe. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an Oligolabelling Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern analysis of multiple human mRNAs was performed on a multiple-tissue Northern blot filter (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from the cell lines was prepared using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). 20 μg of total RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N nylon filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were stripped and reprobed with the control β-actin cDNA as recommended by the manufacturer. Autoradiographic images were acquired using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). COS-7 and MDBK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Culture medium for MDBK cells was also supplemented with amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml). MDCK and HeLa cells and human embryonic skin fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Antibodies to Vear were raised as follows. The full-length sequence of Vear was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The product was subcloned into the BamHI/NotI cloning site of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression of the fusion protein in bacterial cells was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.25 mm) at room temperature for 3–5 h. The cells were spun down, resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed several times in PBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits. The antisera were collected and affinity-purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coated with the fusion protein. The monoclonal anti-γ-adaptin antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (A36120). The polyclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-805). For immunoblotting, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and then scraped in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 μm ZnCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and used in the assays. Immunoblotting was carried out essentially as described previously (26.Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cDNAs used for the transfection experiments were produced by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Full-length Vear (amino acids 1–612; Vearfull), the VHS domain of Vear (amino acids 29–165; VearVHS), the C-terminal end of Vear (amino acids 170–612; VearC), and the ear domain of Vear (amino acids 483–605; Vearear) were cloned into theBamHI/NotI cloning site of the pRK5 vector (a gift from Dr. J. Schlessinger). The HA epitope tag was added to the C terminus of the constructs by primer design. The authenticity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections were done using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells transfected with HA-Vearfull in the pRK5 vector were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were then resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors) and sonicated. The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was then centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to obtain cytosolic and total membrane fractions. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Equal amounts of cytosolic and membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were grown on glass coverslips. They were washed in Hanks' salt solution and then fixed either with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mmEGTA, 2 mm MgCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min or with −20 °C methanol for 10 min. After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS/glycine for 30 min. They were then overlaid with the primary antibody for 30 min; washed; and incubated with the appropriate Texas Red-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Caltag Laboratories), or Oregon Green-conjugated (Molecular Probes, Inc.) secondary antibody for another 30 min. The cells were viewed under an Olympus BH2 fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters. The effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on the distribution of Vear was studied by adding BFA (Alexis Corp.) to a culture medium of MDCK cells at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After incubation for 2, 5, and 30 min at +37 °C, the cells were fixed with −20 °C methanol for 10 min and handled for the immunofluorescence detection of Vear and γ-adaptin as described above. EST data bases were utilized to identify novel proteins that could qualify as proteins involved in vesicular trafficking by virtue of their domain structure. We were especially interested in proteins carrying a VHS domain, a recently discovered domain present in several endocytic proteins (20.Lohi O. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A search using the BLAST algorithm and the nucleotide sequence encoding the VHS domain of EAST (nucleotides 13–420) as a query yielded six matching and overlapping ESTs: AA671009, AA279107,AA235896, AA307157, AA070902, and AI017433. Aligning the sequences suggested the presence of an open reading frame encoding a protein of 613 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67,149 Da. EST clone AA070902 was purchased from the Human Genome Mapping Project Research Center (Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Sequencing of it yielded a nucleotide sequence that was identical to that derived from the aligned sequences of AA671009, AA279107, AA235896, AA307157,AA070902 and AI017433. The sequence consists of a 5′-untranslated region of 21 nucleotides, an open reading frame of 1842 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 134 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1 A. Based on the structural features of the protein, we call it Vear (see below). A schematic representation of the structural features and the domain structure of the protein is shown in Fig. 1 B. Later on, we noticed that a human chromosome 16 bacterial artificial chromosome clone, CIT987SK-A-735G6 (GenBankTM accession number AC002400), describes a putative protein sequence identical to that derived from the EST clones. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Vear with the protein sequences in the data bases revealed the presence of a VHS domain in the N terminus and a high degree of similarity to the C-terminal ear domain of γ-adaptin in the C terminus. Comparison of the N terminus of Vear with various VHS domains and comparison of the C terminus of Vear with the ear domain of γ- and γ2-adaptins, as generated by CLUSTAL X (23.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar), are shown in Fig.2. The VHS domain of Vear showed a high degree of similarity to the VHS domains of the following proteins (Fig.2 A): Tom1 (CAA07361), a v-myb target gene of unknown function (27.Burk O. Worpenberg S.

In the C terminus, there was a high degree of similarity to γ-adaptin (O43747), the heavy subunit of the AP-1 complex (8.Robinson M.S. J.

Mellman I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). The homologous sequence in γ-adaptin spans amino acids 705–820, corresponding to its C-terminal ear domain (8.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,32.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There was no significant overall sequence homology to any protein in the data banks, and a separate comparison of residues 170–480 did not show any significant similarity to the proteins in the data banks. A distinct feature of this middle region is its high content of prolines. In the beginning of the linker region (amino acids 200–250), there is an area with a predicted high α-helical content and a propensity to coiled-coil organization as predicted by the Coilscan program. Due to the sequence homologies, we call the protein Vear (for VHS and ear). Northern blot analysis of human tissues revealed two major messages of 3.5 and 3.9 kb that were most abundant in kidney, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle (Fig.3 A). They were also seen at a lower level in placenta, lung, thymus, and spleen. In kidney, an abundant message of 5.2 kb was also seen. It was expressed at a lower level also in the other tissues mentioned above. A low level of expression of these species was seen in brain, colon, and small intestine. The nature of the multiple RNA species seen in some tissues is currently unknown, but could correspond to alternatively spliced forms of the Vear mRNA. We also carried out Northern hybridization of the total RNAs isolated from HeLa, COS-7, MDBK, and MDCK cells. A distinct band of 3.5 kb, corresponding to a similar-sized band in tissues, was seen in all cell lines. In HeLa and COS-7 cells, messages of 3.9 and 5.2 kb, respectively, were also seen (Fig.3 B). Western blot analysis of the cell solubilizates with anti-Vear antibody detected a single band of 75 kDa in COS-7, HeLa, MDBK, and MDCK cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–8). No bands were detected using a preimmune serum, attesting to the specificity of the reaction (lanes 1–4). The detection of a single band in all cell lines suggests a correspondence with the 3.5-kb mRNA species, which was also shared by all the cells tested (Fig. 3 B). The results from Western blotting of the COS-7 cells transfected with the truncated parts of Vear with anti-Vear and anti-HA antibodies are shown in Fig. 4 B. A distinct binding of anti-Vear antibody to the C-terminal part (lane 3), but not to the VHS or ear domain (lanes 1 and 2), of Vear is shown. The positive reaction with anti-HA antibody of all the HA-tagged proteins (lanes 4–6) indicates that the peptides were appropriately expressed and transferred to the filter. These results show that the epitope recognized by anti-Vear antibody lies between amino acids 170 and 482, an area that shows no significant homology to any other protein in the data banks. The subcellular distribution of Vear in MDCK, COS-7, HeLa, and human embryonic skin cells (Fig.5, a, c,e, and g) was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-Vear antibody. In all cells tested, Vear was localized to a mostly tubular perinuclear structure closely resembling the Golgi complex both in localization and appearance. No staining was seen when preimmune serum was substituted for anti-Vear antibody. Moreover, the staining was completely inhibited by preincubating the antibodies with the recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-Vear fusion protein (Fig. 5 h,inset) but not with glutathione S-transferase alone (data not shown). This shows that anti-Vear antibody detects endogenous Vear, that the staining reaction is specific, and that Vear is probably associated with the Golgi in different types of cells. To explore more closely the putative Golgi association of Vear, we compared the distribution of Vear with the localization of γ-adaptin, a well established marker of the Golgi complex (33.Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 34.Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Using double staining immunofluorescence microscopy for Vear (Fig. 5, a,c, e, and g) and for γ-adaptin (Fig.5, b, d, f, and h), an extensive codistribution was seen between Vear and γ-adaptin in MDCK, COS-7, HeLa, and human embryonic skin cells. However, within the Golgi-like structure, the staining patterns were nonidentical; Vear was always seen in coarser, slightly tubular structures, whereas γ-adaptin was seen associated with more delicate vesicular or dot-like structures. BFA is a fungal metabolite that inhibits coat formation in Golgi membranes, thereby causing reversible apparent dissolution of the Golgi complex in many cells (35.Morinaga N. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12856-12860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Due to this property, treatment with BFA can be used to explore the putative association of proteins with the Golgi apparatus and also their functional features (36.Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 37.Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwarz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar, 38.Tang B.L. Low S.H. Hong W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Adaptin and β-COP are examples of Golgi proteins that are “sensitive” to BFA, i.e. they show an altered subcellular distribution upon BFA treatment of cells (34.Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the distribution of Vear and γ-adaptin in MDCK cells treated with BFA for 0, 5, and 30 min. No distinct changes were seen in cells treated for up to 2 min. In cells exposed to BFA for 5 min (Fig. 6 c) or 30 min (Fig.6 e), on the other hand, a distinct disassembly of the tubular Vear-positive structure to numerous and more widely distributed vesicles was seen. A similar but not identical change was seen in the distribution of γ-adaptin (Fig. 6, d and f). These results strongly suggest that Vear is associated with a BFA-sensitive subcompartment of the Golgi. The subcellular distribution of Vear was also studied by subjecting Vear-transfected COS-7 cells to fractionation by ultracentrifugation, followed by Western blotting of the post-nuclear membrane and cytosolic fractions using anti-Vear antibody. Vear was seen to be present almost exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. 7); only a faint band corresponding to Vear was seen in the cytosolic fraction after a longer exposure (data not shown). This indicates that most of Vear is associated with cellular membranes and is well in line with the immunofluorescence microscopy observations that showed a Golgi-associated localization without any major cytosolic distribution. To further investigate the localization and function of Vear in cultured cells, we tagged recombinant full-length Vear and its distinct domain regions with the HA epitope (HA-Vear) and transiently overexpressed these in cultured COS-7 cells (Fig. 8) and MDCK cells (data not shown). In most transfected cells, HA-Vearfull was seen confined to the Golgi-like perinuclear structure. Double staining with anti-γ-adaptin antibodies showed a distinct codistribution verifying the Golgi-associated localization (Fig. 8, a and b). In most HA-Vearfull-transfected cells, a distinctly dense, sharply delineated, “compacted” staining pattern was seen with anti-HA antibody. This was always associated with a correspondingly condensed γ-adaptin distribution, which clearly differed from the more “non-compacted” distribution seen in nontransfected cells (Fig.8 b). A similar distribution was seen with HA-VearC. In most cells, HA-VearC showed a perinuclear Golgi-like distribution (Fig. 8 c), which was similar to the compacted distribution of HA-Vearfull and completely coincided with the distribution of γ-adaptin (Fig.8 d). In nontransfected cells, a less compact and wider Golgi-associated distribution of γ-adaptin was seen (Fig. 8,b and d, asterisks). In HA-Vearear-transfected cells (Fig. 8 e), a Golgi-associated staining was also seen. However, there was no distinct change in the morphology of the Golgi as judged by staining for γ-adaptin in transfected and nontransfected cells (Fig.8 f). In marked contrast to the above, HA-VearVHSshowed a widespread membrane- and vesicle-associated distribution in the cytoplasm without any preferential localization to the Golgi complex (Fig. 8 g). Its pattern was clearly different from that of the Golgi and was not associated with any change in the Golgi morphology as judged by staining with anti-γ-adaptin antibody (Fig.8 h). In this study, we have identified and characterized Vear, a novel Golgi-associated protein with a unique domain structure. Vear is expressed at low levels in most human tissues and at a high level in kidney and skeletal and cardiac muscle. Both endogenous and exogenously expressed Vear proteins are confined to the Golgi complex, in which they colocalize with the Golgi marker γ-adaptin. The Golgi association of Vear was demonstrated by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation studies. Moreover, HA-tagged Vear assembled on the Golgi upon cell transfection. No significant cytosolic pool of either endogenous or exogenously expressed Vear was identified, attesting to the predominantly membrane-associated localization. Comparison with γ-adaptin showed a close codistribution in cultured cells, suggesting a Golgi-associated localization, which was further supported by a similar response of both Vear and γ-adaptin to treatment with BFA. It is noteworthy, however, that, in closer detail, the localizations of γ-adaptin and Vear differ; instead of a finely vesicular arrangement along the Golgi, characteristic of γ-adaptin, Vear was seen mostly associated with more elongated, tubule-like structures. This suggests a localization for Vear that is wider than just the trans-Golgi network, a Golgi subcompartment marked by the presence of γ-adaptin (39.Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A more accurate assignment of Vear as to the substructure of the Golgi remains, however, to be determined. The Golgi association of Vear was also supported by the distribution pattern of exogenously expressed Vear; it also showed a codistribution with γ-adaptin. Intriguingly, however, in many transfected cells, overexpression of Vear was accompanied by an occurrence of a compacted Golgi. This differed from the distribution of endogenous Vear and γ-adaptin in nontransfected cells in that it was denser and more sharply delineated. Moreover, in cells with a compacted Golgi, there were less scattered Vear-positive vesicles around the periphery of the Golgi. This suggests that the overexpression of Vear could cause the “compaction” either by preventing a “physiological” dispersal of the structure or by causing coalescence of the scattered vesicles on the Golgi structure. Separate expression of the N-terminal VHS domain and the C-terminal end of Vear encompassing both the α-helical and proline-rich middle regions and the ear or the ear alone showed interesting differences that could be indicative of the function of Vear. Clearly, overexpression of the VHS domain led to a very widespread, mostly membrane-associated distribution that had no specific relation to or effect on the Golgi. The ear domain-containing constructs that were devoid of VHS, on the other hand, showed a Golgi-associated localization. Moreover, VearC seemed to cause a compaction of the Golgi that was similar to that seen with full-length Vear. All in all, this strongly suggests that the VHS and ear domains of Vear serve different targeting functions; the VHS domain probably binds to a ligand that is widely present in cellular membranes, whereas the ear domain seems to bind specifically to a Golgi-associated ligand. The VHS domain occurs almost invariably in proteins known to be involved in endocytosis or vesicular trafficking (21.Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar, 40.Ponting C.P. Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), but its precise function is not known. It is noteworthy, however, that when expressed alone, the VHS domain of EAST associates with the plasma membrane as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy (25.Lohi O. Poussu A. Meriläinen J. Kellokumpu S. Wasenius V.-M. Lehto V.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21408-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A function for targeting to vesicular membranes is also supported by its presence in endocytic vesicle-associated Hrs and by targeting to vesicles of Hrs severed of the FYVE domain, a known membrane targeting signal (19.Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is quite likely that the VHS domain binds to a target that is widely present on cytoplasmic vesicles and membranes. The presence in Vear of the ear domain is of special interest, first, because in adaptins, it has been suggested to have a targeting function (32.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39.Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and, second, because it has not been found outside the realm of adaptins before. In adaptins, ear domains have a lower degree of similarity than, for example, the head domains, which have been shown to account, at least partially, for the specific membrane targeting and for the interaction with ς-subunits in α- and γ-adaptins (32.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,39.Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies employing chimeric and mutant α- and γ-adaptins have shown that the ear domains also contribute to membrane binding possibly by stabilizing an association initiated by some other determinants (39.Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Clearly, this, together with the distinct localization of the exogenously expressed ear domain of Vear in the Golgi, strongly speaks in favor of it critically determining the Golgi-based localization of Vear. The distinct difference seen in the Golgi organization of cells transfected with VearC and Vearear (compactedversus non-compacted Golgi) points to a potential importance of the middle portion of Vear. Interestingly, it encompasses a region with a propensity to coiled-coil arrangement and a proline-rich region. Supposedly, the presence of the coiled-coil region could lead either to homodimerization of Vear or to heterodimer formation with some other proteins. This could potentially lead to not only targeting of Vear, but also to bringing to a closer apposition the target organelles associated with the ends of Vear and/or of its putative dimerization partner. In this sense, Vear could be a novel member of a newly described group of tethering proteins that have been described in the vesicular transport systems such as the Golgi and that typically form bridges between different membrane elements (41.Muuro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42.Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether, analogously to the Golgi-associated members of this class of proteins, Vear could be involved in the docking of the vesicles to the membranes or in the stacking of the cisternae in the Golgi.

However, some internalized Tg is transcytosed intact into the bloodstream, thereby avoiding proteolytic cleavage. Here we show that megalin (gp330), a Tg receptor on thyroid cells, plays a role in Tg transcytosis. Following incubation with exogenous rat Tg at 37 °C, Fisher rat thyroid (FRTL-5) cells, a differentiated thyroid cell line, released T3 into the medium. However, when cells were incubated with Tg plus either of two megalin competitors, T3 release was increased, suggesting that Tg internalized by megalin bypassed the lysosomal pathway, possibly with release of undegraded Tg from cells. To assess this possibility, we performed experiments in which FRTL-5 cells were incubated with either unlabeled or 125I-labeled Tg at 37 °C to allow internalization, treated with heparin to remove cell surface-bound Tg, and further incubated at 37 °C to allow Tg release. Intact 330-kDa Tg was released into the medium, and the amount released was markedly reduced by megalin competitors. To investigate whether Tg release resulted from transcytosis, we studied FRTL-5 cells cultured as polarized layers with tight junctions on permeable filters in the upper chamber of dual chambered devices. Following the addition of Tg to the upper chamber and incubation at 37 °C, intact 330-kDa Tg was found in fluids collected from the lower chamber. The amount recovered was markedly reduced by megalin competitors, indicating that megalin mediates Tg transcytosis. We also studied Tg transcytosis in vivo, using a rat model of goiter induced by aminotriazole, in which increased release of thyrotropin induces massive colloid endocytosis. This was associated with increased megalin expression on thyrocytes and increased serum Tg levels, with reduced serum T3 levels, supporting the conclusion that megalin mediates Tg transcytosis. Tg transcytosis is a novel function of megalin, which usually transports ligands to lysosomes. Megalin-mediated transcytosis may regulate the extent of thyroid hormone release.

Based on the assumption that physiological ligands are present in fluids to which megalin is exposed (24.Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Abbate M. Andres G. Brown D. Stamenkovic I. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we postulated that megalin on thyrocytes serves as a receptor for Tg. In support of this possibility, we demonstrated in previous studies (11.Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Marinò M. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12898-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that megalin is a high affinity Tg receptor and that it can mediate endocytosis of Tg by FRTL-5 cells, a differentiated Fisher rat thyroid cell line (25.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S.

Here we show that megalin-mediated endocytosis of Tg by thyroid cells results in transcytosis rather than in proteolytic cleavage in the lysosomal pathway. Tg was purified from frozen rat thyroids by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column fractionation, as described (27.Esquivel P.S. Rose N.R. Kong Y.M. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1250-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Tg preparations were analyzed by both nonreducing and reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting, using a rabbit anti-human Tg antibody cross-reactive with Tg from other species (Axle, Westbury, NY). Radiolabeled Tg was prepared with 125I-Na (NEN Life Science Products) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of the preparations ranged from 1500 to 7000 cpm/ng. Biotinylated Tg was prepared using a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The receptor-associated protein (RAP) was used as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein. DH5α bacteria harboring the pGEX-RAP expression construct were kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The production of RAP-GST and GST was performed as described (28.Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin (Sigma) was used because it effectively releases megalin-bound Tg (11.Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T.

Sim R.B. Christensen E.I. Nexo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Lactoferrin, a known megalin ligand (15.Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was purchased from Sigma. A rabbit antibody, designated A55, prepared against immunoaffinity-purified megalin and a mouse monoclonal antibody, designated 1H2, which reacts with megalin ectodomain epitopes in the second cluster of ligand binding repeats, were previously described (30.Raychowdhury R. Zheng G. Brown D. McCluskey R.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1613-1623PubMed Google Scholar). A goat anti-GST antibody was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Bio-Rad. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin was from Vector (Burlingame, CA), Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Cappel (Durham, NC). FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG was from The Binding Site (San Diego, CA). FRTL-5 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described (25.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 26.Bidey S.P. Chiovato L. Day A. Turmaine M. Gould R.P. Ekins R.P. Marshall N.J. J. Endocrinol. 1984; 101: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in Coon's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and a mixture of six hormones. An immortalized rat renal proximal tubule cell line (IRPT) was established as described (31.Jung F.F. Bachinsky D.R. Tang S.S. Zheng G. Diamant D. Haveran L. McCluskey R.T. Ingelfinger J.R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 358-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). IRPT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. FRTL-5 cells were cultured in six-well plates until 80% confluence was reached. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI medium without serum, followed by incubation at 37 °C with [35S]methionine (from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 100 μCi/well in 2 ml of methionine and cysteine-free RPMI medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and the six-hormone mixture). After 1 h, the medium containing [35S]methionine was removed, cells were extensively washed with serum-free medium, and complete FRTL-5 tissue culture medium was readded. At different time points (0–48 h), the tissue culture medium was collected, and cell extracts were prepared. For this purpose, cells were detached with EDTA, washed with PBS, and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate (Fisher) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mmε-amino-n-caproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine (all from Sigma), and 10 mm EDTA (Fisher). To assess synthesis of Tg, following radiometabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with cell extracts. Samples were incubated overnight with protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with the rabbit anti-Tg antibody or, as a control, with normal rabbit IgG. Beads were extensively washed and resuspended in nonreducing Laemmli buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To assess secretion of Tg, following radiometabolic labeling, tissue culture media were added to plastic microtiter wells coated overnight with the anti-Tg antibody (1:500 in PBS) or, as a control, with normal rabbit IgG (20 μg/ml). After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, wells were washed four times and cut out. Radioactivity was measured with a β-counter. Radioactivity in wells coated with normal rabbit IgG was subtracted, as background. FRTL-5 cells were cultured in 24-well plates until 80–100% confluence was reached. The mean number of cells used in these experiments was 3.48 × 105 cells/well. The mean amount of protein in cell lysates was 35.3 μg/well, as assessed using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). Cells were incubated at 37 °C with unlabeled Tg, in Coon's F-12 medium containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5% ovalbumin (Sigma). After 6 h, the medium was collected, and T3 was measured at the Massachusetts General Hospital Chemistry Laboratory by chemiluminescence. Values were normalized for the total amount of protein in the cell lysates. In certain experiments, Tg was added to the cells together with the megalin competitor RAP-GST (200 μg/ml) or the anti-megalin antibody 1H2 (200 μg/ml) or, as control, with GST (200 μg/ml) or normal mouse IgG (200 μg/ml) FRTL-5 cells were cultured in 96-well plates. Cells were cultured until 80–100% confluence was reached. The mean number of cells used in the experiments was 5.36 × 104 cells/well with a mean total amount of protein in cell lysates of 5.65 μg/well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with unlabeled Tg (50 μg/ml in 100 μl of Coon's F-12 medium, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% ovalbumin), to allow internalization. After 6 h, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with ice-cold heparin (100 units/ml) to remove cell-bound Tg (12.Marinò M. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12898-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The medium containing heparin was removed, and cells were washed with warmed PBS, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with PBS to allow release of internalized Tg. Released Tg was detected in the PBS by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) and by Western blotting. In inhibition experiments, Tg was added to the cells together with RAP-GST (200 μg/ml), 1H2 (200 μg/ml), GST (200 μg/ml), or normal mouse IgG (200 μg/ml). Similar experiments were performed with 125I-labeled Tg. For this purpose, we used FRTL-5 cells cultured in 24-well plates.125I-Tg was added to the cells in a volume of 500 μl, at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, followed by heparin treatment and further incubation at 37 °C with PBS. The PBS was collected, and radioactivity was measured with a γ-counter. FRTL-5 and IRPT cells were cultured in high density large pore (3-μm) filters in cell culture inserts (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) placed in 24-well plates. These devices allow polarization of the cells and make it possible to trace transport of molecules across the cell layer, from the upper (insert) to the lower (cell culture well) chamber (32.Mostov K.E.

The mean number of cells at confluence was 5.1 × 104 cells/well, and the mean amount of protein in cell lysates was 4.96 μg/well. Polarization of confluent FRTL-5 and IRPT cells was first assessed by immunofluorescence staining for megalin. Cryostat frozen sections cut perpendicular to the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-l-lysine-sodium periodate and treated with 0.2 m ammonium chloride and then with 30% sucrose, followed by incubation with the rabbit anti-megalin antibody A55 and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. For counterstaining, sections were incubated with 0.01% Evans Blue. Sections were mounted in Vectorshields (Vector) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. To further assess polarization of FRTL-5 and IRPT cells, we performed electron microscopy. For this purpose, confluent cells cultured on permeable filters were fixed with 2% glutharaldehyde in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections cut perpendicular to the filter were examined and photographed using a Philips CM10 electron microscope. The tightness of cell layers was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), by determining the expression of the tight junction-associated protein occludin (38.Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and by measuring the paracellular transport of [3H]mannitol. TER of FRTL-5 and IRPT cells was measured using a Millicell-ERS conductivity meter from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a blank, TER was measured in filters without cells. TER values were expressed as ohms × cm2. The expression of occludin by FRTL-5 and IRPT cells was assessed by Western blotting, using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human occludin, cross-reactive with rat occludin (38.Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Twelve-day confluent FRTL-5 cells or 9-day confluent IRPT cells were detached from the filters, washed, and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mmε-amino-n-caproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, and 10 mm EDTA. Cell extracts were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with the anti-occludin antibody (1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Transport of [3H]mannitol was measured in confluent FRTL-5 and IRPT cells as follows. Four μCi of [3H]mannitol (NEN Life Science Products) were added to the upper chamber, in a volume of 500 μl, in complete cell culture medium containing unlabeled mannitol (1 mm). The lower chamber was rinsed with 1 ml of medium without [3H]mannitol. Aliquots of the medium from the lower chamber were collected at various time points. Radioactivity was measured with a β-counter. Results were compared with those obtained in filters without cells. Twelve-day confluent FRTL-5 cells or 9-day confluent IRPT cells on permeable filters were incubated at 37 °C with unlabeled Tg or lactoferrin (50 μg/ml in Coon's F-12 medium, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% ovalbumin). The ligands were added in a volume of 200 μl to the upper chamber, and the lower chamber was rinsed with 200 μl of buffer without ligands. After 6 h, the medium from the lower chamber was collected, and ligands were measured by ELISA or Western blotting. In inhibition experiments, Tg was added to the cells together with RAP-GST (200 μg/ml), 1H2 (200 μg/ml), GST (200 μg/ml), or normal mouse IgG (200 μg/ml). In certain experiments, incubations were performed at 4 °C, at which temperature transcytosis is inhibited (33.Mostov K.E. Simister N.E. Cell. 1985; 43: 389-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To assess the effect on Tg transport of the microtubule agent colchicine (39.Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam S. Dahms N.M. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13135-13140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with colchicine (Sigma) added both to the upper and the lower chamber at various concentrations (1–5 μm) in binding buffer. Before adding Tg, the buffer containing colchicine was removed, cells were washed, and transcytosis experiments were performed as described above. FRTL-5 cells, cultured in 96-well plates, were incubated at 37 °C with unlabeled Tg (50 μg/ml in Coon's F-12 medium, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% ovalbumin), for 6 h, as described previously (12.Marinò M. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12898-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with ice-cold heparin (100 units/ml), to release cell-bound Tg. The heparin wash was collected, and cells were lysed with H2O on ice. Cell-bound Tg was detected in the heparin wash by ELISA, whereas internalized Tg was measured in cell lysates. In inhibition experiments, Tg was added to the cells together with RAP-GST (200 μg/ml), 1H2 (200 μg/ml), GST (200 μg/ml), or normal mouse IgG (200 μg/ml). For ELISAs, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with the samples to be tested for Tg and were incubated with the rabbit anti-Tg antibody (1:500), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) andp-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance was determined at 405 nm. The amount of Tg in samples to be tested was estimated, using as a reference value the absorbance produced by a Tg standard curve, obtained by coating microtiter wells with 1–1000 mg of purified Tg. Similar ELISA experiments were performed to measure lactoferrin, using a sheep anti-lactoferrin antibody (The Binding Site), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Bio-Rad). For Western blotting, samples to be tested for Tg were subjected to SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing or reducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with the rabbit anti-Tg antibody (1:500) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500). Bands were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate kit (Kirkegaard & Perry). Similar experiments were performed for lactoferrin, using a sheep anti-lactoferrin antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Bio-Rad). The model of aminotriazole goiter in rats was used (40.Strum J.M. Karnovsky M.J. Lab. Invest. 1971; 24: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Female Lewis rats weighing 100–120 g (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) received aminotriazole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; Sigma) in drinking water, 0.04% for 2 days (two rats), 4 days (two rats), 6 days (six rats), 8 days (four rats), 10 days (two rats), or 12 days (six rats). Six rats treated with aminotriazole also received l-thyroxine (T4) (Sigma), which was administered daily (20 μg) by intraperitoneal injection for 6 days. Six rats not given aminotriazole were used as controls. Animal care and sacrifice procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines. One lobe of the thyroid and a block of kidney were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN) and frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunofluorescence studies. The other thyroid lobe and the remaining renal tissue were frozen and stored at −80 °C for Western blotting. To evaluate megalin expression by immunofluorescence, frozen thyroid, parathyroid, and kidney sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-l-lysine-sodium periodate and incubated with 1H2 (20 μg/ml) or, as a control, with mouse IgG, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The incubation buffer was PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Washings were performed with PBS. To evaluate megalin expression by Western blotting, frozen thyroids and kidneys were thawed, minced, and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mmε-amino-n-caproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, and 10 mm EDTA. Insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation, and samples containing 50 μg of protein were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, performed using 1H2 (5 μg/ml) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The pixel density (PD) of bands obtained by Western blotting was measured using a molecular analyzer, and it was expressed as pixels/mm2. Western blotting for Tg was also performed in thyroid extracts, as described above. To evaluate binding of RAP to thyrocytes, thyroid sections were incubated with RAP-GST or GST alone, followed by the goat anti-GST antibody and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, in Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 5% fetal bovine serum. The sections were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Serum TSH was measured by ELISA, using a commercial kit for rat TSH (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Serum T3 was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Serum Tg was measured by Western blotting, as described earlier, or by ELISA, as follows.

Sedimentation studies demonstrate that NT-A is quantitatively monomeric, with a highly asymmetric shape. Contrary to dogma, the N-terminal region is structured as demonstrated by limited proteolysis. However, N-terminal structure is strongly stabilized by the DNA binding domain, possibly explaining the lack of structure seen in isolated activation domains. Upon DNA binding, NT-A undergoes N-terminal mediated assembly, suggestive of DNA-induced allostery, and consistent with changes in protease accessibility of sites outside the DNA binding domain. Microsequencing reveals that protease-accessible regions are limited to previously identified phosphorylation motifs and to functional domain boundaries.

O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). In normal and malignant tissues, there are two naturally occurring PR isoforms: 82-kDa A-receptors and 99-kDa B-receptors (2.Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The proteins are identical except for a 164-amino acid extension (BUS) at the N terminus of B-receptors. Each isoform contains two well characterized autonomous units: a C-terminal hormone binding domain (HBD), and a centrally located DNA binding domain (DBD). The two domains are linked by a short nuclear localization signal and a 50-amino acid “hinge” sequence of unclear function. Although critically important to activity, the DBD and HBD together comprise only 52% and 44% of the mass of the A- and B-receptors, respectively. The remaining sequences N-terminal to the DBD are poorly characterized. The N-terminal regions of both isoforms contain a 91-amino acid transcriptional activation domain (AF1) adjacent to the DBD (3.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Additionally, B-receptors contain a context-dependent activation domain (AF3) within BUS (4.Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The 291 amino acid region between BUS and AF1 is transcriptionally inhibitory (5.Hovland A.R. Powell R.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite their close structural similarity, the two isoforms have very different functional properties. B-receptors are generally stronger transcriptional activators than A-receptors (3.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Certain antiprogestins are partial agonists on B-receptors but lack transcriptional activity on A-receptors (3.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Activated A-receptors are dominant inhibitors of B-receptors and other members of the steroid receptor family (6.Vegeto E. Shahbaz M.M. Wen D.X. Goldman M.E. O'Malley B.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).With the exception of estrogen receptors, PR and other steroid receptors including androgen, glucocorticoid (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptors, have highly homologous DBDs and HBDs, and bind to similar DNA response elements (7.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar). Their N-terminal regions differ extensively, however, ranging in size from 403 to 603 amino acids, with less than 15% amino acid identity. This suggests that structural differences within these regions explain the transcriptional specificity of these receptors. Moreover, in PR, N-terminal transcriptional activity is often dependent upon the homologous DBD (4.Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,5.Hovland A.R. Powell R.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); N-terminal functional domains fused to heterologous DBDs can be transcriptionally inactive. These observations suggest that the function of the N-terminal region is structurally dependent on surrounding domains, particularly the DBD. Indeed, the DBDs and the progesterone response elements (PREs) to which they bind may act as allosteric effectors, transducing information to N-terminal AFs (8.Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For example, DNA binding does not alter the structure of the Ets-1 DBD, but induces helical unfolding in regions distant from the DNA binding interface (9.Peterson J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W.

Alternatively, N-terminal regions may acquire structure upon interaction with target proteins such as other transcription factors and/or coregulatory proteins (10.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Such “induced fold” mechanisms may also explain some of the context-dependent effects of steroid receptor N-terminal regions.We speculate that context-dependent structural differences within the N-terminal regions, generated by either induced fold or allosteric mechanisms, may explain the differences in PR isoform function. Thus, we have undertaken structural studies of the PR N-terminal regions. Here we characterize the N-terminal region of the A-receptor (NT-A) (a construct lacking only the HBD) using biochemical, biophysical, and functional assays. Our data show that highly purified NT-A is capable of transactivation, specifically recognizes a PRE in a cooperatively dependent manner, and is highly structured. Our results are the first to map the structure within the N-terminal region of a nuclear receptor, and demonstrate that NT-A has the properties of an independent functional unit. Progesterone receptors (PR)1 are members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors (1.Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). In normal and malignant tissues, there are two naturally occurring PR isoforms: 82-kDa A-receptors and 99-kDa B-receptors (2.Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The proteins are identical except for a 164-amino acid extension (BUS) at the N terminus of B-receptors. Each isoform contains two well characterized autonomous units: a C-terminal hormone binding domain (HBD), and a centrally located DNA binding domain (DBD). The two domains are linked by a short nuclear localization signal and a 50-amino acid “hinge” sequence of unclear function. Although critically important to activity, the DBD and HBD together comprise only 52% and 44% of the mass of the A- and B-receptors, respectively. The remaining sequences N-terminal to the DBD are poorly characterized. The N-terminal regions of both isoforms contain a 91-amino acid transcriptional activation domain (AF1) adjacent to the DBD (3.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Additionally, B-receptors contain a context-dependent activation domain (AF3) within BUS (4.Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The 291 amino acid region between BUS and AF1 is transcriptionally inhibitory (5.Hovland A.R. Powell R.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite their close structural similarity, the two isoforms have very different functional properties. B-receptors are generally stronger transcriptional activators than A-receptors (3.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Certain antiprogestins are partial agonists on B-receptors but lack transcriptional activity on A-receptors (3.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Activated A-receptors are dominant inhibitors of B-receptors and other members of the steroid receptor family (6.Vegeto E. Shahbaz M.M. Wen D.X. Goldman M.E. O'Malley B.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). With the exception of estrogen receptors, PR and other steroid receptors including androgen, glucocorticoid (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptors, have highly homologous DBDs and HBDs, and bind to similar DNA response elements (7.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar). Their N-terminal regions differ extensively, however, ranging in size from 403 to 603 amino acids, with less than 15% amino acid identity. This suggests that structural differences within these regions explain the transcriptional specificity of these receptors. Moreover, in PR, N-terminal transcriptional activity is often dependent upon the homologous DBD (4.Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,5.Hovland A.R. Powell R.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); N-terminal functional domains fused to heterologous DBDs can be transcriptionally inactive. These observations suggest that the function of the N-terminal region is structurally dependent on surrounding domains, particularly the DBD. Indeed, the DBDs and the progesterone response elements (PREs) to which they bind may act as allosteric effectors, transducing information to N-terminal AFs (8.Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For example, DNA binding does not alter the structure of the Ets-1 DBD, but induces helical unfolding in regions distant from the DNA binding interface (9.Peterson J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Alternatively, N-terminal regions may acquire structure upon interaction with target proteins such as other transcription factors and/or coregulatory proteins (10.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H.

This strategy entails the delivery of conjugated membrane-permeable peptides that disrupt domain interaction at specific steps in the signaling cascade. As proof of concept, two peptides targeted against receptor-G protein interaction domains were examined. Only GqCT, which targets the receptor-Gq protein interacting domain, disrupted 5-HT2C receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositide hydrolysis. GsCT, targeting the receptor-Gs protein, disrupted β2 adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of cAMP but not 5-HT2C receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositide hydrolysis. The peptide MPS-PLCβ1M, mimicking the domain of phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) interacting with active Gαq, also blocked 5-HT2C receptor activation. In contrast, peptides PLCβ2M and Phos that bind to and sequester free Gβγ subunits were ineffective at blocking 5-HT2C receptor-mediated phosphoinositol turnover. However, both peptides disrupted Gβγ-mediated α2A adrenergic receptor activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results provide the first direct demonstration that active Gαq subunits mediate endogenous 5-HT2C receptor activation of PLCβ and that Gβγ subunits released from Gαq heterotrimeric proteins are not involved.

All three receptors belong to the G protein-coupled serpentine receptor superfamily. Their pharmacological profiles are very similar, leading to difficulty in defining their functional roles. 5-HT2receptors have been implicated in behaviors such as sleep, feeding, aggression, pain, and anxiety and are thought to play a role in a number of central nervous system disorders including affective disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy (1.Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, 5-HT2receptors may play a major role in mediating the actions of hallucinogenic drugs (2.Burris K.D. Breeding M. Sanders-Bush E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 258: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar) as well as antipsychotic drugs (3.Canton H. Verriele L. Colpaert F.C. Eur. J.

Nature. 1995; 374: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), suggesting that these receptors play a crucial role in moderating central nervous system function.

Initial studies of 5-HT2C receptor signaling showed that these receptors activate the downstream intracellular effector, phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)1 resulting in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (12.Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. Hoffman B.J. Hartig P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4086-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the 5-HT2C receptor has been observed to release arachidonic acid (13.Berg K.A. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1017-1023PubMed Google Scholar), increase cyclic GMP (14.Kaufman M.J. Hartig P.R. Hoffman B.J. J.

However, it is unclear how each individual intracellular signaling pathway contributes to modulation of the cell as a whole. In this paper, we employed a novel strategy to dissect intracellular signaling pathways, which combines a newly developed peptide synthesis technology with the application of targeted disruption of protein-protein interactions. This strategy is applied to examine PI hydrolysis signaling, a well defined pathway associated with 5-HT2Creceptor activation. The current model of 5-HT2C receptor signaling suggests that Gq/11 heterotrimers are the immediate G protein mediators of receptor signaling based on two indirect observations. First, activation of PLCβ predominantly occurs through the Gαq family. Second, 5-HT2C receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis is largely pertussis toxin (PTX) -insensitive, which suggests that Gi/o heterotrimers, which activate PLC via their βγ subunits, are not involved (19.Westphal R.S. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 474-480PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous studies that directly examined the identity of the G protein-mediating 5-HT2C receptor signaling were all conducted in artificial systems (20.Hartman J.L., IV Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21.Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol.

Lett. 1994; 179: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) where the receptors may have promiscuous interactions with various heterotrimeric G proteins. To address this question in a native environment, we examined the G protein mediator of 5-HT2C receptor signaling in primary cultures of choroid plexus epithelial cells and further assessed the role of Gα and Gβγ subunits. Most peptides used were synthesized in our laboratory; GsCT, GqCT, GoCT, and PLCβ2M were also synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, Texas). Antibodies against PLCβ isozymes and Gi/o/z were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Gαq antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. Tom Martin (University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI). The sequence of the various peptides and their proposed targets are presented in Table I. The membrane-permeable sequence (MPS) peptide was based on a hydrophobic membrane-permeable sequence described previously (23.Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

Lysine and serine residues, as a pseudo-dipeptide, were added at the carboxyl terminus to serve as a linker and a masked aldehyde to facilitate conjugation.

Open table in a new tab Phospholipase Cβ1-mimicking peptide (PLCβ1M) was derived from amino acids 1053–1084 of the PLCβ1 enzyme. This design stems from the observation that loss of the last 10 kDa from the carboxyl terminus of PLCβ1 results in the loss of interaction with active Gαq (26.Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional work, using a series of deletion mutants, defined region 1030–1142 as the domain required for interaction with Gα subunits (27.Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A specific segment within this region (amino acids 1053–1084) was observed to dose dependently inhibit GTPγS-dependent activation of PLC using either purified PLCβ1 or a crude membrane assay. Phospholipase Cβ2 mimicking peptide (PLCβ2M) is based on residues 564–583. The domain of PLCβ2 interacting with Gβγ subunits has been determined utilizing a peptide fragment strategy. Two twenty amino acid segments of PLCβ2 (564–583 and 574–593) were defined as the domains binding to Gβγ (28.Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The segment with the optimal interaction with Gβγ subunits was observed to span amino acids 564–583. Synthetic peptide of this region exhibited specific binding to Gβγ subunits as well as specific inhibition of Gβγ- effector interactions. Phosducin-like peptide (Phos) was derived from carboxyl-terminal residues 168–195 of phosducin-like protein (PhLP). PhLP isolated from rat brain (29.Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was determined to be an ubiquitous inhibitor of Gβγ-mediated signaling. The region of PhLP conferring interactions with Gβγ subunits was delineated to be in the carboxyl-terminal domain (30.Schroder S. Bluml K. Dees C. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins including residues 168–195 of PhLP had inhibitory effects on Go GTPase activity, demonstrating the ability to bind Gβγ. In addition, carboxyl-terminal peptides of PhLP (including amino acids 168–195) inhibited Gβγ-enhanced rhodopsin phosphorylation by βARK. Gα carboxyl-terminal peptides (GqCT and GsCT) were designed based on the last 10 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus, a region of Gα subunits that has been recognized as a site of interaction between G proteins and receptors (31.Hamm H.E. Rarick H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32.Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the last 11 residues of Gi/o/s proteins have been demonstrated to be effective in the specific inhibition of receptor-G protein interaction (33.Gilchrist A. Mazzoni M.R. Dineen B. Dice A. Linden J. Proctor W.R. Lupica C.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14912-14919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the purpose of this paper, the corresponding carboxyl-terminal peptides were derived from the following residues: Gs (amino acids 385–394) and Gq/11 (amino acids 350–359). Peptides were synthesized using solid-phase chemistry on a CS-Bio Peptide Synthesizer (fluroenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry (Fmoc)) or an ABI 430A Peptide Synthesizer (tert-butyoxycarbonyl chemistry). Peptides derived from Fmoc synthesis were cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/triisopropylsilane/1,2-ethanedithiol/water/phenol (81.5:5:1:2.5:5:5 v/v/v/v/v/v/weight) at 20 °C for 4 h. Peptides synthesized by tert-butyoxycarbonyl chemistry were cleaved from the resin using HF/anisole (9:1, v/v) at 4 °C for 1 h. Crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C-18 column (Vydac, Holland, MI) and a linear acetonitrile gradient. The gradient was established using two buffers (A: H2O, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; B: 80% acetonitrile in H2O, 0.039% trifluoroacetic acid) ranging from 10–100% buffer B over a 25 min period at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Purified peptides was verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (Voyager Elite, Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Sample purity was assessed using analytical HPLC with an analytical C-18 column (Vydac) under a 25-min linear gradient of 10–90% buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For chemical conjugation of the MPS and the cargo peptide, two requirements of these peptides were necessary. First, cargo peptide contained an amino-terminal cysteine residue (Fig. 1). Second, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the signal sequence (MPS) contained a masked aldehyde moiety. For this purpose, a pseudo-dipeptide Lys(Ser) was attached to the carboxyl-terminal of the MPS sequence (Fig.1). The peptide is synthesized with a lysine carboxyl terminus, and then a serine residue was chemically added to the ε-amine moeity of the lysine residue. To make the MPS peptide chemically reactive, NaIO4 treatment was used to oxidize the serine residue to an aldehyde moiety. The oxidized MPS was purified by preparative reverse phase-HPLC and the aldehyde product was again verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. Conjugation of the MPS with cargo peptide was accomplished by dissolving both peptides in 0.5 ml of dimethylformamide and by adding 0.5 ml of 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4, to the mixture. After agitation for 16–20 h, the conjugate, as a thiazolidine bond formed between the amino-terminal cysteine of the cargo peptide and the MPS aldehyde, was purified using preparative reverse phase-HPLC and the product characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (Fig.2). Several peptides had limited solubility (Table I), and these were used in our experiments at the maximum soluble concentration. Primary cultures of choroid plexus epithelial (CPE) cells were prepared as described previously (34.Barker E.L. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 725-730PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, choroid plexi, removed from 20-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, were treated with Pronase (333 μg/ml) containing DNase (7.5 μg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (−Ca2+/Mg2+) for 10 min at 37 °C to dissociate cells. Dissociated cells were resuspended in 10% dialyzed calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + D-Val (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated in 48-well plates for 3–5 days. Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared as described previously (35.Peavy R.D. Conn P.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Brains were removed from postnatal day 2–5 rats, the meninges were carefully removed, and the cerebral cortex was dissected using visual landmarks. Cells were dissociated in horse serum by mechanical trituration, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of fetal bovine serum. Dissociated cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 75-cm2 culture flasks coated with poly-d-lysine. After 7 days, cells were shaken in an orbital shaker at 37 °C overnight to remove nonastrocytic cells. The cells were then replated in 24- or 48-well plates for functional assays. Human embryonic kidney-293 cells stably expressing the rat adrenergic α2A receptor (HEK-α2A) were a generous gift from Dr. Lee Limbird (Vanderbilt University). Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (100 units penicillin/ml, 100 mg of streptomycin/ml) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. CPE cells plated in 48-well plates were incubated for 16–20 h with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (20–25 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in serum-free, inositol-free DMEM to label phospholipid pools. Labeling medium was aspirated, and the cells washed twice with HBSS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+. Cells were treated with peptides solubilized in HBSS (+Ca2+/Mg2+) at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 10 mm lithium chloride and 10 μm pargyline were added to the cells for 10 min prior to agonist activation for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the solution and fixing with 25 μl of methanol/well. [3H] Inositol monophosphates were isolated as described previously (36.Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11687-11690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-α2A cells were plated in 24-well plates for PI hydrolysis assay and assayed as described above for CPE cells, except pargyline was not added. Cells were incubated with thrombin receptor-activating peptide for 30 min. Primary cultured astrocytes were plated in 48-well plates and assayed for PI hydrolysis as described for HEK-α2A cells above. Metabotropic glutamate receptors were activated with 100 μm (R,S)-3,5-dihydrophenylglycine. ADP ribosylation was performed as described previously (37.Grotewiel M.S. Chu H. Sanders-Bush E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1122-1126PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CPE cells were plated in 100-mm plates and cultured for 3–4 days in DMEM. Cells were incubated with 500 ng/ml PTX for 16 h in the absence of serum. Membranes, suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA buffer, were subjected to ADP ribosylation at 30 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction containing 100 μg of membrane protein, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm arginine, 20 mm thymidine, 100 mm NaCl, 0.25% Lubrol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml PTX, and 2.5 μCi of [32P]nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The reaction was terminated by adding 1.2 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Membranes were pelleted and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ribosylated proteins were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Protein extraction from cells and separation on acrylamide gel was done as described previously (38.Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The molecular masses were determined using Sigma high molecular weight markers. For the MAP kinase assay, HEK-α2A cells in 24-well plates, containing serum-free medium, were treated with appropriate peptides for 30 min at 37 °C prior to activation with 100 μm epinephrine for 2 min. Supernatant was aspirated, and cells were solubilized with 1X sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, pH 6.8, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol). Proteins were separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Active MAP kinase was detected using the Promega anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody at 1:1000 dilution with an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Total MAP kinase was detected using NEB total MAP kinase antibodies at 1:500 dilution with an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Secondary peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution with incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by treatment of blots with NEB ECL reagent and subsequent exposure to Kodak Biomax film. For the detection of PLCβ isozymes and G protein isoforms, CPE were removed from Spargue-Dawley rats and solubilized in Tris buffer containing 10 mm CHAPS (39.Backstrom J.R. Westphal R.S. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CHAPS-soluble fraction was fractionated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Detection of PLCβ isozyme was performed using PLCβ isozyme-specific antibodies as per the manufacturer recommendations (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Gq/11 detection was achieved using affinity purified polyclonal antibodies provided by Dr. Tom Martin. Primary cultured astrocytes plated in 48-well plates were labeled for 16–20 h with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenosine in serum-free DMEM. Peptides solubilized in HBSS (+Ca2+/Mg2+) were added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to initiation of the assay. Agonist was added and the incubation continued for 30 min at 4 °C in presence of 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. The reaction was stopped with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mm ATP and 2 mm cAMP. Accumulated [3H]cAMP was separated on alumina columns as described previously (40.Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were utilized to evaluate signaling molecules including the PLCβ isozymes, which have differential specificity for activation either by Gαq or Gβγ subunits. Three isoforms of PLCβ were detected in the choroid plexus (Fig.3 A). Using anti-PLCβ1 antibodies two bands at approximately 140 and 100 kDa were detected; the latter is an expected degradation product of PLCβ1 (Santa Cruz antibody protocol). PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 were detected with apparent masses of approximately 100 and 140 kDa, respectively. However, PLCβ4 was not present at a detectable level. We also probed CPE extracts with anti-Gi/o as well as anti-Gαq antibodies to verify the potential for Gβγ- and Gαq-mediated signaling (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrated that Gi/o as well as Gαq are expressed in CPE. Given that both PLCβ2 and Gi/oexist in CPE cells, the possibility that activation of PLCβ in CPE cells is mediated by Gβγ subunits released from Gi/oheterotrimers was examined using an indirect method based on PTX sensitivity. The 5-HT2C receptor PI hydrolysis response in CPE cells is predominantly insensitive to PTX (Fig. 3 C), which ADP ribosylates Gi/o heterotrimers leading to their inactivation. As a control for PTX activity, CPE cells were pretreated overnight with PTX and then subjected to an in vitroADP-ribosylation assay. Cells treated overnight with PTX were not ADP-ribosylated by PTX added in vitro (Fig. 3 D), whereas non-PTX-treated cells were ADP-ribosylated. These results suggest that Gi/o heterotrimers are predominantly not involved in the endogenous 5-HT2C receptor PI signal. To determine directly the heterotrimeric G protein mediator of endogenous 5-HT2C receptor signaling, we introduced the membrane-permeable MPS-GqCT peptide to cultured CPE cells. This peptide is designed to disrupt receptor coupling to Gq/11 heterotrimeric protein (Fig.4 A). MPS-GqCT, at 5 μm, was able to block PI hydrolysis resulting from treatment of CPE cells with 100 nm serotonin (Fig.4 B). A peptide designed to disrupt receptor coupling to Gs heterotrimer (MPS-GsCT) was ineffective in perturbing endogenous 5-HT2C receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis. Signal sequence (MPS) peptide alone was also ineffective demonstrating that the domain conferring permeability does not attenuate the observed PI signal. Additionally, membrane-impermeable, nonconjugated GqCT peptide was unable to disrupt 5-HT2C receptor signaling, which is consistent with the idea that without membrane permeability the peptide is not functional. This is also an indication that the effect of the GqCT peptide is not due to general toxicity during the course of the experiment. The observation that neither MPS nor the GqCT peptide alone was an effective inhibitor of receptor-Gqcoupling validates the MPS-importing strategy. As an additional proof-of-concept for the use of membrane-permeable peptides designed from the carboxyl terminus of Gα subunits, we examined the functional effect of MPS-GsCT on endogenous β2 adrenergic receptor signaling in cultured astrocytes. As seen in Fig. 4 B, MPS-GsCT is effective in blocking, to almost basal levels, β2 adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, the peptide MPS-GqCT was not functionally disruptive in this system. Furthermore, at the same concentration, MPS-GsCT was ineffective in blocking 5-HT2C receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis in CPE (Fig.4 B). These results contribute collectively to demonstrate peptide specificity and their lack of toxicity. To assess directly whether the activation of PLCβ is mediated by active Gαq subunits or free Gβγ subunits, we designed the following peptides: MPS-PLCβ1M targeted against the disruption of Gαq-PLCβ interaction; and MPS-PLCβ2M and MPS-Phos, both designed to bind and sequester free Gβγ subunits thereby preventing subsequent activation of PLCβ. Because CPE cells lack the appropriate receptor-signaling pathways to determine peptide function, specificity and toxicity, we exploited HEK cells stably expressing α2A-adrenergic receptors (HEK-α2A) for this purpose. HEK-α2A cells endogenously express thrombin receptors as well as transfected α2A adrenergic receptors, which signal through the Gi heterotrimeric proteins leading to Gβγ-mediated activation of MAP kinase (41.Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Touhara K. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); this serves as a suitable model to evaluate the effects of MPS-PLCβ2M and MPS-Phos peptides on free Gβγ-mediated signaling (Fig.5 A). Thrombin receptors have been observed to activate a PTX-insensitive PI signal postulated to be through the Gαq heterotrimeric proteins (Fig.5 B). These two receptor systems provide divergent signaling pathways to test the aforementioned functional peptides. Using antibodies directed against the phosphorylated, active form of MAP kinase or against a region of MAP kinase away from the phosphorylation site, we could discern active versusinactive forms of MAP kinase and visualize total MAP kinase.

CBP is a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex and thus appears to facilitate communication between gene-specific transcriptional activator proteins and the core promoter of genes transcribed by polymerase II. Furthermore, CBP and CBP-associated proteins (p/CAF, p/CIP-ACTR, and SRC-1) contain an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and consequently have been implicated in chromatin remodeling of target (5.Bannister A.J.

For example, in fibroblast, elevation of intracellular cAMP levels is associated with an arrest of proliferation in G1 (10.Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L.

DNA tumor viruses encode proteins that inappropriately activate host cell DNA synthesis by interacting with and inhibiting the activity of cellular proteins that normally function to repress cell proliferation. Examples of such viral proteins include the adenovirus E1A protein and the SV40 large T antigen. Recently, it was reported that E1A and SV40 large T antigen can bind to CBP and affect its functions (11.Eckner R. Arany Z. Ewen M. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

CBP has been shown to be required for the activation of muscle-specific genes and for cell cycle arrest during differentiation of muscle cells. Thus, CBP can function as a negative regulator of cell growth, and E1A may carry out its mitogenic and oncogenic functions by binding to CBP and inhibiting cellular growth-restraining pathways (16.Eckner R.

A second cellular protein that interacts with E1A is p300. p300 was first discovered in anti-E1A immunoprecipitates (11.Eckner R. Arany Z. Ewen M. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). p300 displays a striking sequence similarity with CBP and can substitute for CBP in potentiating CREB-activated gene expression (19.Lundblad J.R.

The papillomavirus (PV) E2 open reading frame encodes several proteins that bind to the consensus E2-binding sequence (E2BS) ACCN6GGT and regulate viral transcription and DNA replication (20.McBride A.A.

Full-length E2 protein can support viral transcription and DNA replication, whereas alternatively spliced forms of the E2 protein that lack the amino-terminal domain act as repressors of transcription (22.Choe J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18411-18414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequences of various E2 proteins shows that the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions are relatively well conserved (20.McBride A.A. Schlegel R. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21.McBride A.A. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A transactivation domain is encoded by the conserved NH2-terminal region, and a DNA binding domain is encoded by the conserved COOH-terminal region. The activation domain of bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 contains two regions within the first 85 amino acids that are predicted to form acidic amphipathic helices (24.Giri I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2823-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the E2 amphipathic helices might be responsible for interaction with host transcriptional modulators (24.Giri I. Yaniv M.

The great majority of human cervical cancers contain integrated HPV DNA and express the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes, which exert their proliferative effects by binding to and inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, respectively (26.Dyson N. Guida P. Munger K. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6893-6902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E2 gene is usually disrupted in cervical cancers, suggesting that loss of the E2 protein is an important step in the development of cervical cancers (28.Baker C.C. Phelps W.C. Lindgren V. Braun M.J. Gonda M.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 962-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Matsukura T. Kanda T. Furuno A. Yoshikawa H. Kawana T. Yoshiike K. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 979-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that E2 increases the concentration of p53 protein and induces a G1 arrest in HeLa cells, a cervical carcinoma cell line (30.Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because there is functional cross-talk between CBP and a number of cellular transcription factors, we sought to determine whether HPV E2 and CBP physically interact. Herein, we show that HPV-18 E2 and CBP directly interact to form a specific protein complex and that E2-mediated transcription is CBP-dependent. Mutations in the amphipathic helix of HPV-18 E2 abolished the transcriptional activation properties of E2 and revealed that binding of CBP to E2 is necessary for E2-dependent transcription. Finally, we show that the HAT activity of CBP is involved in E2-dependent transcription. p6xE2BStkCAT and pCMV4/16E2 were gifts from Dr. P. M. Howley (Harvard University). pCG11E2 was a gift from Dr. M. R. Botchan (University of California, Berkeley, CA). pCGE2Nco (also known as pCG-18E2) was a gift from Dr. C.

GST-CBP1 and GST-CBP3 were gifts from Dr. R. G. Roeder (Rockefeller University). GST-CBP2 was constructed by subcloning amino acids 1680–1891 of the CBP gene into the NdeI andBamHI cleavage sites of pGEX-2TL. pM-CBP and pM-p300 were constructed by inserting the CBP and p300 genes, respectively, into a pM vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). pVP16-KIX was made by inserting the EcoRI-SalI fragment encoding amino acids 462–669 of CBP into the multicloning site of the pVP16 vector (CLONTECH). pCDNA3/12S E1A, pFlagCMV2/13SE1A, and pCDNA3/E1A(Δ2–36) were cloned by inserting corresponding polymerase chain reaction fragments into the multicloning site of each mammalian expression vector. C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 24 h before transfection, 3 × 105 cells were plated on a 6-cm plate. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (31.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The transfected plasmids were prepared by the Qiagen procedure (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted with the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA to be expressed. Equal amounts of cell lysates were employed for the detection of luciferase activity and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (Promega, Madison, WI). Each assay was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity. Wild type GST protein and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitrotranslation (using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system as described by the manufacturer (Promega)). Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells expressing GST or GST-18E2 with hemagglutinin (HA)-CBP were lysated in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 25 μl of a 1:1 suspension of glutathione-Sepharose or a 1:1 suspension of protein G-Sepharose (preincubated with anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody) in EBC buffer for 4 h at 4 °C with rocking. The glutathione-bound complexes were then washed three times with EBC buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Immunoblot was carried out using anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-GST antibody in hybridoma culture supernatant diluted 1:200, or anti-18E2 polyclonal antibody. HPV-18 E2 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. M. R. Botchan. A mammalian version of the yeast two-hybrid screen (CLONTECH) was used to detect in vivo interaction of E2 and CBP. To prepare fusion proteins containing either the VP16 activation domain or the GAL4 DNA binding domain, the coding sequences for full-length E2 and the full-length CBP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in-frame at the multicloning site of the pM and pVP16 expression vectors, respectively (Invitrogen). For the mammalian two-hybrid assay, C33A were transfected with pFR-Luc (1 μg) (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), pCDNA3.1(−)-LacZ (0.5 μg), the GAL4 fusion protein expression vector (pM-CBP or pM-p300, 1 μg), and the VP16 fusion protein expression vector (pVP16 or pVP16–18E2, 3 μg). Cells were harvested and lysed and luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity determined using the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Each assay was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity or protein concentration. The pCG-18E2 mutants and pCDNA3-HA-mCBP (F1541A) were constructed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 ng of the plasmid template and 125 ng of each primer were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl. Mutants were identified by DNA sequencing. Cells transfected with the pCDNA3-HA-mCBP and pCG-18E2 were pelleted, immunoprecipitated, boiled for 10 min, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked and hybridized with either anti-HA antibody or anit-E2 antibody. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transfection and IP as described above, 10 μg of histones (Sigma, catalog number H-9250) were added to each tube of IP complex with 1 μl of 1 mCi/ml [3H]acetyl-CoA (7.7 Ci/mmol; ICN). Mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and electrophoresed in an SDS/15% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then fixed in 30% methanol/10% acetic acid/60% water (v/v) for 30 min and immersed into Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film for 7 days at −70 °C. A previous report showed that the NH2 terminus of E2 activates a heterologous promoter in CV1 cells (25.Haugen T.H. Turek L.P. Mercurio F.M. Cripe T.P. Olson B.J. Anderson R.D. Seidl D. Karin M. Schiller J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4245-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because CBP is a known co-activator of various transcription factors, we speculated that the mechanism of action of HPV E2, a replication/transcription factor, might involve protein-protein interactions between common cellular transcription factors such as CBP. To provide evidence that E2 interacts physically with CBP and its homolog p300, we carried out a mammalian two-hybrid assay (CLONTECH) in C33A cells with GAL4-CBP or GAL4-p300 as the target (Fig. 1). Two chimeric proteins were created by fusing full-length CBP or p300 in-frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (GAL4-CBP and GAL4-p300, respectively) and by fusing full-length HPV-18 E2 to the transcriptional activation domain of VP16 (VP16–18E2). Fig.1 B shows that VP16–18E2 activates transcription via the GAL4-CBP chimeric protein. VP16–18E2 also activated transcription via GAL4-p300, indicating that HPV-18 E2 binds to CBP and p300 in a similar manner. In order to demonstrate the association of HPV-18 E2 protein with CBPin vivo, co-immunoprecipitation of two proteins was carried out as shown in Fig. 2. A plasmid expressing GST-18E2 protein was transiently co-transfected with a CBP expression plasmid into C33A cells. Negative controls included cells transfected with GST expression plasmid with or without HA-CBP expression plasmid. Selective precipitation of GST protein or HA-tagged protein from the cell lysate showed the co-precipitation of HA-CBP protein (Fig. 2 A) or E2 protein (Fig. 2 B), confirming that HPV-18 E2 protein and CBP indeed associate in mammalian cells. To decipher whether HAT activity is associated with a transcription factor E2, we carried out an IP-HAT assay in C33A cells. GST or GST-18E2 expression plasmids were co-transfected into C33A cells. Thirty-six hours after transfection, total cell extract was prepared and GST-tagged proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Elutes from GST or GST-E2 resin were tested for HAT activity with histones as a substrate (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel). Acetylated histones were observed only in the GST-E2 elutate, supporting that HPV-18 E2 associates with HAT activity of CBP. We observed two bands of 270 and 100 kDa in the IP-HAT assay (data not shown), suggesting that autoacetylated p300/CBP and perhaps p/CAF are co-precipitated with HPV-18 E2 protein. In vitro binding reactions using GST fusion proteins encoding various domains of CBP were performed to characterize further the interaction between CBP and E2. Three domains of CBP were individually fused to GST. E2 bound specifically to GST-CBP1 with a relatively high affinity, whereas little or no E2 was detected in the elutants from the GST-CBP2 or GST-CBP3 binding reactions (Fig.3 A). A domain of CBP between amino acid residues 450 and 700 has previously been identified as the principle region of CBP required for stable interaction with CREB (2.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar,19.Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This region of CBP is referred to as the kinase-induced domain interacting (KIX) domain. We next examined whether the KIX domain is also necessary for CBP binding to E2. Fig. 3 B shows that35S-labeled, in vitro translated E2 binds to GST-CBP1 and its derivatives but not to GST protein. The in vitro translated E2 bound to both GST-CBP1/129 (amino acids 461–589 of CBP) and GST-CBP1/80 (amino acids 590–669 of CBP). The region of CBP corresponding to amino acids 461–589 is highly conserved between CBP and p300. As expected, E2 interacted with specifically this region of CBP. It was, however, unexpected that E2 could bind to GST-CBP1/129. Dai et al. (3.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) reported that CREB and c-Myb do not bind to this 129-amino acid region (amino acids 461–589) of GST-CBP1. This region contains a glutamine-rich stretch. However, a previous report demonstrated that E2 interacts specifically with Sp1, which contains multiple glutamine-rich domains (32.Ushikai M. Lace M.J. Yamakawa Y. Kono M. Anson J. Ishiji T. Parkkinen S. Wicker N. Valentine M.E. Davidson I. Turek L.P. Haugen T.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that E2 has some affinity for glutamine-rich regions. This possibility is currently under investigation. To decipher the CBP binding domain within E2, we divided the E2 gene into various fragments and determined which domain of the E2 protein bound to CBP in vivo. This was accomplished using a mammalian two-hybrid assay and measuring the amount of luciferase activity in C33A cells. We hypothesized that the NH2 terminus of E2 (amino acids 1–226) might contain the CBP binding site, as this region contains a transcriptional activation domain. TableI shows that wild type E2 as well as deletion mutants lacking the E2 DNA binding domain interacted specifically with full-length CBP. Deletion mutants within the E2 amphipathic helix (amino acids 1–155) prevented the specific interaction of E2 with CBP. Interestingly, these deletion mutants showed no intrinsic transactivation properties, whereas full-length E2 or the amphipathic helix motif alone showed a strong activation of luciferase activity. We also observed that the amphipathic helix domain alone interacted very weakly with CBP in the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown).Table IThe E2 NH2 terminus interacts specifically with CBP in C33A cellsVP 16 fusionGAL4 fusionBindingaIn vivo binding was determined with a mammalian two-hybrid assay in C33A cells.

Open table in a new tab Having established that the KIX domain of CBP can interact directly with HPV E2 in vitro, we designed experiments to test whether this interaction is required and is sufficient for stimulation of transcription by E2 in vivo. The E2 proteins from various HPV strains were tested in this assay. HPV strains fall into two categories: a high risk group (HPV-16 and HPV-18) and a low risk group (HPV-6 and HPV-11) for the development of cervical cancer. As shown in Fig. 4, co-transfection of expression vectors encoding HPV E2 (transcription of HPV E2 was driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early (IE) promoter) and VP16-KIX had a stimulatory effect on 6xE2BStkCAT, which contains six E2BSs in the promoter region and a thymidine kinase (tk) core promoter fused to the CAT gene. E2 from the low risk group of HPV showed a weak stimulatory effect on E2-dependent transcription, as compared with that of E2 from the high risk group. Previous reports showed that the E2 proteins from the high risk HPVs are, in fact, much more active than E2 proteins from the low risk HPVs (33.Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed similar results; thus, the ability to form protein-protein interactions between HPV E2 and host cell CBP appears to be a universal property of human papillomaviruses. To assess the functional significance of the E2-CBP interaction, we cotransfected C33A cells with E2 and CBP vectors and the 6xE2BStkCAT reporter constructs. The 6xE2BStkCAT reporter was activated in a dose-dependent manner by co-transfection with E2 expression plasmids (pCG-18E2). In control experiments in which the E2 expression plasmid was omitted, the co-transfection of the CBP expression plasmid did not stimulate CAT activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig.5 A, E2-dependent transcription was activated by co-transfection with CBP. These results suggest that overexpression of CBP increases E2-dependent transcription. CBP binds to a number of cellular and viral regulatory factors, including the adenovirus oncoprotein E1A, which binds to CBP and inhibits CREB-dependent transcriptional activation (34.Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of E1A on E2-dependent transcription in order to confirm whether CBP is required for E2-dependent transcription. As shown in Fig. 5 B,co-transfection of 6xE2BStkCAT with increasing amounts of an E1A expression plasmid (pCDNA3-E1A) did not affect basal levels of CAT activity. However, in the presence of the E2 expression plasmid, E1A repressed CAT activity from the reporter plasmid. To ascertain whether this inhibitory effect on E2-dependent transcription was caused by sequestration of limiting amounts of endogenous CBP, we co-transfected C33A cells with the CBP expression plasmid, along with the E2 expression vector and the CAT reporter plasmid. Inhibition of E2-dependent transcriptional activation by E1A was derepressed by co-transfection of increasing amounts of the CBP expression plasmid. As a control, we also expressed a mutant form of E1A harboring an NH2-terminal deletion that renders it unable to interact with CBP. As shown in Fig. 5 C, this mutant showed much less E2-dependent transcription compared with wild type E1A. These results demonstrate that E1A can suppress E2-dependent transcriptional activation and may block the activities of E2 by preventing the association of CBP, a component of the polymerase II holoenzyme complex (35.Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 36.Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D.

The relationship between CBP interaction and HPV-18 E2 transcriptional activation was characterized further by comparing wild type E2 function with that of E2 proteins carrying mutations in the region we had defined as the CBP binding domain of E2. In an attempt to generate functional variants of E2, we constructed alanine substitution mutations in the amphipathic helix of E2 (Fig.6 A). Previous reports showed that mutations in this region allowed separation of the transcription and replication functions of E2 for papillomaviruses (37.Abroi A. Kurg R. Ustav M. J.

The HCV genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by both host and viral proteases to generate structural and nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is generated as a mature protein by the action of NS3 protease in conjunction with NS4A (3.Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exists as phosphoproteins (p56 and p58), with the degree of phosphorylation accounting for the difference in size (5.Ide Y. Tanimoto A.

Phosphorylation status of NS5A differs among HCV genotypes (8.Hirota M. Satoh S. Asabe S.-i. Kohara M. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kato N. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. Virology. 1999; 257: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NS5A is phosphorylated by a cellular serine/threonine kinase, and Ser2321 represents a major phosphorylation site (9.Reed K.E.

However, this phosphorylation site is dispensable for interactions with NS4A and PKR. Sequence comparison of the regions surrounding the phosphorylation sites indicates an extremely high level of conservation between different strains of the HCV, but the biological significance of phosphorylation is still undefined.Recent studies suggest that HCV NS5A protein transcriptionally modulates cellular genes, promotes cell growth (10.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11.Gale Jr., M. Kwieciszewski B. Dossett M. Nakao H. Katze M.G. J.

There is also evidence that two-thirds of the NS5A protein from the C-terminal fused with Gal4 DNA-binding domain functions as a potent transcriptional activator (12.Tanimoto A. Ide Y. Arima N. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13.Kato N. Lan K. Ono-Nita S.K. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J.

Inactivation of these genes may be a mechanism for the disruption of normal cell growth. Host factors are important components for the modulation of virus replication. Viruses also produce proteins that may interact with host factors for viral persistence by disrupting normal cell cycle. To further understand the functional role of HCV NS5A, we examined the interaction of NS5A with cellular protein(s) by yeast two-hybrid screening. Results from this study provided important information regarding the association of NS5A protein with SRCAP, a most recently identified cellular transcriptional coactivator (14.Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparapil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16370-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have previously demonstrated that the NS5A protein of HCV transcriptionally modulates cellular genes and promotes murine fibroblast cell growth into a tumorigenic phenotype (10.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because the predicted amino acid sequence of NS5A does not possess a known DNA binding motif, it appears that NS5A transcriptionally regulates these cellular genes either by direct interaction with general transcription factor(s) or through a cofactor. To explore the potential targets of NS5A protein, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. Yeast strain HF7c was transformed with pGBT9–5A and colonies were selected on dropout agar medium lacking tryptophan. A few randomly picked colonies were grown, and extracted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Results indicated pGBT9–5A fusion protein expression in all the yeast transformants (data not shown). The expression was also confirmed with a monoclonal antibody to NS5A. For the yeast two-hybrid screening, HF7c yeast cells expressing NS5A were transformed with library plasmid DNAs and selected the candidate colonies on the basis of their ability to grow in the appropriate selection medium and turning on the LacZ gene. Yeast transformants, positive for the activation of two reporter genes, were identified from 2 × 105 independent transformants. We initially identified 30 β-galactosidase positive clones grown in histidine-deficient selective medium. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 17 clones, amplified in bacteria, and retransformed into HF7c yeast cells expressing pGBT9–5A gene for confirmation of the positive interaction. Six clones indicated positive growth on selective medium and in β-galactosidase assay following retransformation. On further testing of these clones for interaction with a battery of heterologous baits in yeast, three clones were found to specifically interact with pGBT9–5A and not with other heterologous protein baits. All three clones were sequenced and analyzed by the BLAST program. Sequence analysis revealed that these isolates represent an independent overlapping cDNA with homology to a recently identified coactivator SRCAP (14.Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparapil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16370-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The mammalian version of the conventional two-hybrid assay was used to ascertain whether the candidate NS5A-interacting protein associates with NS5A in mammalian cells. For this purpose, we constructed mammalian expression plasmid vectors that encode a VP16–5A and Gal-SRCAP fusion proteins. The mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed by transfecting HepG2 or NIH3T3 cells with a Gal4-responsive reporter gene (G5E1b-CAT) and pairwise combinations of the appropriate expression vectors. Reporter gene activity was determined by measuring CAT activity in cell lysates from each transfected culture. A significant increase in CAT activity was observed following coexpression of VP16–5A and Gal-SRCAP hybrids (Fig.1). However, CAT activity was not enhanced by coexpression of the VP16–5A and Gal4 vector. CAT activity was detected in Gal-SRCAP and VP-16 vector transfected cells, although the level of CAT expression was much lower as compared with hybrid. We obtained overlapping cDNAs of SRCAP interacting with NS5A from yeast two-hybrid assay. Initial mapping data suggests that NS5A associates with the C-terminal 62 amino acids of SRCAP. To confirm that the C-terminal region of SRCAP indeed interacts with NS5A, we used a C-terminal deletion mutant of SRCAP (Gal-ΔSRCAP) in mammalian two-hybrid assay. Results demonstrated that the C-terminal deletion mutant can no longer interact with NS5A under a similar condition (Fig.1).An in vitro binding assay was used to verify the physical interaction between the viral protein NS5A and SRCAP. Histidine-tagged NS5A (His-NS5A) was expressed in bacteria, immobilized onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled SRCAP generated by in vitro translation. The proteins binding onto beads was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Results of thein vitro binding assay exhibited a specific band of SRCAP retained by the His-tagged NS5A nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Fig. 2 A). However, an unrelated cellular protein (His-MBP-1) when used as a negative control under similar experimental conditions, failed to pull down the SRCAP protein. Results from this in vitro experiment demonstrated that NS5A physically associates with SRCAP.Figure 2NS5A protein physically associates with SRCAP. Panel A, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled SRCAP was subjected to pull-down analysis with His-NS5A or His-MBP-1 (negative control) fusion protein. Ten percent of the input protein (in vitro translated SRCAP) was loaded in the gel for comparison. The image was edited from the same x-ray film. Panel B, in vivocoimmunoprecipitation of endogenous SRCAP with HCV NS5A. HepG2 cells were transfected with NS5A expression plasmid or empty vector plasmid. Cells were lysed after 48 h. Vector-transfected (lane 1) and NS5A-transfected (lane 2) cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to SRCAP. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and immunoblotted with a rabbit antibody to NS5A. A secondary antibody conjugate (anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection of the peroxidase signal by chemiluminescence (ECL). The molecular weight of the NS5A band was also ascertained from the migration of standard protein molecular weight markers. The same blot was reprobed with SRCAP-specific antibody for the detection of endogenous SRCAP (lanes 1 and 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the ability of NS5A for association with endogenous SRCAP in vivo, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment was performed with lysates of NS5A-transfected HepG2 cells. SRCAP-specific antibody was used to precipitate the protein complex, followed by Western blot analysis with a specific antibody to detect the NS5A protein (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, NS5A was coprecipitated with endogenous SRCAP as evident from the specificity of the antibody and the size of the NS5A protein in the immunoblot. Vector-transfected control HepG2 cell lysates when analyzed similarly did not exhibit a NS5A specific band. The blot was stripped and reprobed with a specific antibody to SRCAP, and an endogenous SRCAP band was detected in both the lanes. A similar experiment was performed using an unrelated monoclonal antibody of the same isotype as a negative control. This negative control antibody did not exhibit a detectable reactivity with either SRCAP or NS5A (data not shown). Results suggested that endogenous SRCAP forms a complex with HCV NS5A. Thus, specific association of SRCAP and NS5A in HepG2 cells was demonstrated using the mammalian two-hybrid system, in vitro pull-down assay, and the coimmunoprecipitation analysis.We further examined whether NS5A protein can colocalize with the endogenous SRCAP. We initially investigated the localization of endogenous SRCAP by indirect immunofluorescence in HepG2 cells using a monoclonal antibody to SRCAP. Immunofluorescent staining of the SRCAP protein showed a predominant perinuclear localization with occasional nuclear staining. Similarly, cells transfected with CMV-NS5A plasmid DNA when stained with polyclonal antiserum, exhibited perinuclear staining as shown earlier (4.Tanji Y. Kaneko T. Satoh S. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the subcellular localization of SRCAP with NS5A, HepG2 cells were transfected with CMV-NS5A, and immunofluorescent staining was performed with antibodies to NS5A and SRCAP. Confocal microscopy showed a significant colocalization of the endogenous SRCAP with NS5A (Fig. 3). There was no detectable staining when normal control sera were used.Figure 3Colocalization of transfected NS5A and endogenous SRCAP in HepG2 cells.

Viral genes can override cellular control mechanisms, which in untransformed cells regulate cell cycle progression in response to various antiproliferative signals. HCV often causes persistent infection and is a silent disease. In HCV persistently infected cells, the continued presence of viral gene products is likely to be detrimental for host cells. We have previously shown that HCV NS5A protein transcriptionally down-regulates p21 activity (10.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).

To further examine the effects of NS5A and SRCAP on a natural promoter, HepG2 or NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a reporter construct (p21 promoter linked with luciferase gene), CMV-NS5A and CMV-SRCAP as the effector plasmids. Results from the luciferase assay suggested that inhibition of p21 promoter activity by NS5A protein was higher in presence of SRCAP (Fig. 4 ). However, CMV-SRCAP alone at the same concentration did not show a significant effect on p21 promoter activity. A similar result was observed in NIH3T3 cells. To further examine the effect of NS5A on p21 promoter at the transcriptional level, a quantitative RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from stably or transiently transfected cells. This assay was designed to separately analyze the effect of NS5A and SRCAP directly on the p21 mRNA level or on the transcription of a tagged luciferase reporter gene. Results suggested down-regulation of p21 promoter activity at the transcriptional level by NS5A alone or together with SRCAP (Fig. 5).Figure 4Transcriptional regulation of p21 promoter by NS5A and SRCAP. Effector plasmid (CMV-SRCAP and/or CMV-NS5A) was cotransfected with 4 μg of WWP-luc as the reporter plasmid in HepG2 cells. The total amount of plasmid DNA (7 μg) was kept constant by the addition of empty vector in each transfection. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h posttransfection and luciferase activity was determined. In each set of experiments, triplicate transfections were performed, and relative luciferase activity is presented. p21 promoter activity was suppressed when NS5A and SRCAP was coexpressed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Panel A, quantitative RT-PCR analysis for endogenous p21 or GAPDH mRNA from NIH3T3neo (lane 1) and NIH3T3NS5A (lane 2) cells.

SRCAP was isolated in three independently derived cDNA clones in yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction of HCV NS5A protein with SRCAP was confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid assay, pull-down experiment, and from coimmunoprecipitation studies. HCV NS5A colocalizes with SRCAP at the perinuclear membrane of HepG2 cells. Preliminary mapping analysis suggests that the binding of NS5A occurs with SRCAP through the C terminus (62 amino acids), which contains highly charged residues. HCV NS5A also possesses several acidic domains (12.Tanimoto A. Ide Y. Arima N. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13.Kato N. Lan K. Ono-Nita S.K. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8856-8859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether SRCAP-binding domain of NS5A resides within one of these acidic domains remains to be elucidated. NS5A is suggested as a potent transcriptional activator. However, it exerts a negative regulatory activity on the p21 promoter in favor of promoting cell growth (10.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). SRCAP alone increases the E1b promoter activity when brought closer by Gal4 DNA-binding domain to the promoter sequences (14.Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparapil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16370-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although SRCAP is defined as a coactivator, it behaves like a corepressor when associated with NS5A to exert a negative effect on the p21 promoter. We propose NS5A may recruit endogenous SRCAP to repress the p21 promoter. Transcription factors that activate in one circumstance and repress in another have been documented, and the molecular basis for these transitions are quite diverse (for review, see Refs. 26.Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 27.McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NS5A has recently been demonstrated binding with a different cellular factor Grb2 at the SH3 domain, which perturbs the mitogenic signaling pathways (28.Tan S.-L. Nakao H. He Y. Vijaysree S. Neddermann P. Jacobs B.L. Mayer B.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Interaction between HCV NS5A and SNARE-like protein (hVAP33) has recently been reported (29.Tu H. Gao L. Shi S.T. Taylor D.R. Yang T. Mircheff A.K. Wen Y. Gorbalenya A.E. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1999; 263: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our observations add a novel cellular protein SRCAP to the list of NS5A-interacting cellular factors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dissecting the transregulatory activity of NS5A and implicate its relation with a cellular factor. We propose that the recruitment of SRCAP by NS5A is one of the mechanisms of its transcription-modulatory activity. This may also explain the growth-promoting activity of HCV NS5A. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)1is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing a spectrum of liver disease ranging from an asymptomatic carrier state to end-stage liver disease (1.DiBisceglie A.M. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 34S-38SCrossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2.Purcell R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2401-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The HCV genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by both host and viral proteases to generate structural and nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is generated as a mature protein by the action of NS3 protease in conjunction with NS4A (3.Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Tanji Y. Kaneko T. Satoh S. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS5A is localized in the nuclear periplasmic membrane (4.Tanji Y. Kaneko T. Satoh S. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exists as phosphoproteins (p56 and p58), with the degree of phosphorylation accounting for the difference in size (5.Ide Y. Tanimoto A. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Gene. 1997; 201: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.Kaneko T. Tanji Y. Satoh S. Hijikata M. Asabe S. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Phosphorylation status of NS5A differs among HCV genotypes (8.Hirota M. Satoh S. Asabe S.-i. Kohara M. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kato N. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. Virology. 1999; 257: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NS5A is phosphorylated by a cellular serine/threonine kinase, and Ser2321 represents a major phosphorylation site (9.Reed K.E. Rice C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28011-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, this phosphorylation site is dispensable for interactions with NS4A and PKR. Sequence comparison of the regions surrounding the phosphorylation sites indicates an extremely high level of conservation between different strains of the HCV, but the biological significance of phosphorylation is still undefined. Recent studies suggest that HCV NS5A protein transcriptionally modulates cellular genes, promotes cell growth (10.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11.Gale Jr., M. Kwieciszewski B. Dossett M. Nakao H. Katze M.G. J.

B. Ray, unpublished observation. There is also evidence that two-thirds of the NS5A protein from the C-terminal fused with Gal4 DNA-binding domain functions as a potent transcriptional activator (12.Tanimoto A. Ide Y. Arima N. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13.Kato N. Lan K. Ono-Nita S.K. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8856-8859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral proteins may influence cellular genes, which in turn may be involved in the regulation of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Inactivation of these genes may be a mechanism for the disruption of normal cell growth. Host factors are important components for the modulation of virus replication. Viruses also produce proteins that may interact with host factors for viral persistence by disrupting normal cell cycle. To further understand the functional role of HCV NS5A, we examined the interaction of NS5A with cellular protein(s) by yeast two-hybrid screening. Results from this study provided important information regarding the association of NS5A protein with SRCAP, a most recently identified cellular transcriptional coactivator (14.Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparapil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16370-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have previously demonstrated that the NS5A protein of HCV transcriptionally modulates cellular genes and promotes murine fibroblast cell growth into a tumorigenic phenotype (10.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because the predicted amino acid sequence of NS5A does not possess a known DNA binding motif, it appears that NS5A transcriptionally regulates these cellular genes either by direct interaction with general transcription factor(s) or through a cofactor. To explore the potential targets of NS5A protein, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. Yeast strain HF7c was transformed with pGBT9–5A and colonies were selected on dropout agar medium lacking tryptophan. A few randomly picked colonies were grown, and extracted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Results indicated pGBT9–5A fusion protein expression in all the yeast transformants (data not shown). The expression was also confirmed with a monoclonal antibody to NS5A. For the yeast two-hybrid screening, HF7c yeast cells expressing NS5A were transformed with library plasmid DNAs and selected the candidate colonies on the basis of their ability to grow in the appropriate selection medium and turning on the LacZ gene. Yeast transformants, positive for the activation of two reporter genes, were identified from 2 × 105 independent transformants. We initially identified 30 β-galactosidase positive clones grown in histidine-deficient selective medium. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 17 clones, amplified in bacteria, and retransformed into HF7c yeast cells expressing pGBT9–5A gene for confirmation of the positive interaction. Six clones indicated positive growth on selective medium and in β-galactosidase assay following retransformation. On further testing of these clones for interaction with a battery of heterologous baits in yeast, three clones were found to specifically interact with pGBT9–5A and not with other heterologous protein baits. All three clones were sequenced and analyzed by the BLAST program. Sequence analysis revealed that these isolates represent an independent overlapping cDNA with homology to a recently identified coactivator SRCAP (14.Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparapil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16370-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The mammalian version of the conventional two-hybrid assay was used to ascertain whether the candidate NS5A-interacting protein assoc"

Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, expressed Myc epitope-tagged PLD1 was found to associate with intracellular vesicular structures by a mechanism that requires its N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. Partial co-localization with expressed GLUT4 fused to green fluorescent protein in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells was evident. Furthermore, microinjection of purified PLD into cultured adipocytes markedly potentiated the effect of a submaximal concentration of insulin to stimulate GLUT4 translocation to cell surface membranes. Insulin stimulated PLD activity in cells expressing high levels of insulin receptors but no such insulin effect was detected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that PLD1 associated with GLUT4-containing membranes acts in a constitutive manner to promote the mechanism of GLUT4 translocation by insulin.

Insulin exerts this effect primarily through a process whereby sequestered, intracellular GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins are rapidly redistributed to cell surface membranes where they can catalyze glucose uptake into cells (1.Czech M.P.

In both the basal and insulin-stimulated states, GLUT4 proteins appear to cycle between intracellular membrane and plasma membrane locations, but exocytosis is relatively slow in the absence of insulin (4.Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The action of insulin to stimulate this process appears dependent on the activity of p85/p110-type phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase because it is blocked by inhibitors of this enzyme (5.Okada T.

Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity activates PI 3-kinase through recruitment of Src homology 2 domains of the p85 subunit to phosphotyrosine sites on insulin receptor substrate proteins (8.White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concept that the 3′-polyphosphoinositide products of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase are key mediators of insulin action on GLUT4 translocation is consistent with extensive data supporting a major role of these lipids in membrane trafficking (9.Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Much effort has been expended attempting to identify downstream targets of the PI 3-kinase products, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, that might connect insulin receptor signaling to GLUT4 glucose transporter trafficking (1.Czech M.P.

However, other data do not support this view but instead favor a role for protein kinase C isoforms ζ and λ (13.Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L., Yu, B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P.

Recent studies in our laboratory identified another type of downstream effector for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, GRP1, which catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF proteins through a Sec7 homology region also present on other ARF exchange proteins (15.Klarlund J.K.

GRP1 selectively binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

In turn, GTP-binding ARF proteins, the downstream targets of GRP1-like proteins, are known regulators of membrane budding and vesicular trafficking in Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomal membranes (21.Moss J.

Recent data suggest that ARF1 can act alone to mediate such events but that the products of PLD activity may facilitate these ARF effects (28.Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C.

The product of PLD, phosphatidic acid, appears to regulate the production of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which also directly drives recruitment of coat and adaptor proteins to membranes (33.Martin T.F. Annu. Rev.

Recent results indicate that insulin treatment of adipocytes activates PLD (32.Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

However, this result has not yet been confirmed in adipocytes. This is an important issue because the reported role for PLD in vesicle budding and secretion (23.Jones D. Morgan C. Cockcroft S.

On the positive side, we observed a striking enhancement of GLUT4 translocation upon microinjection of purified PLD into cultured adipocytes treated with a low concentration of insulin. We also observed partial co-localization of PLD1, but not PLD2, with GLUT4 in intracellular membranes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, whereas insulin did stimulate PLD activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells and HeLa cells expressing high levels of insulin receptor, the hormone failed to stimulate PLD activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes under conditions where phorbol ester was highly effective. Thus, PLD may act in a constitutive manner to promote membrane processes involved in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.RESULTSPreliminary experiments were conducted to test whether PLD activity might be required for insulin stimulation of glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Primary alcohols are known to drive the generation of alcoholic phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine during catalysis by PLD, thus inhibiting the formation of phosphatidic acid itself (39.Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Secondary or tertiary alcohols do not appreciably participate in this reaction. This divergence in activity between primary versus secondary or tertiary alcohols has prompted experiments demonstrating selective blockade of PLD-mediated processes from the former (40.Kusner D.J. Hall C.F. Jackson S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2266-2274PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J.

Thus, in the present studies, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 0.75 or 1.25% 1-butanol or 2-butanol in the presence or absence of insulin prior to assay of deoxyglucose transport (not shown). Both alcohols were inhibitory, but the primary alcohol was much more effective in attenuating deoxyglucose uptake at the higher concentration than was 2-butanol (almost complete inhibitionversus about 50% inhibition). Although not conclusive, these preliminary results were encouraging and consistent with the hypothesis that PLD activity may be involved in insulin-regulated glucose transport.A second approach taken to determine whether PLD activity may regulate GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation involved microinjection of single 3T3-L1 adipocytes with various preparations of purified enzyme followed by microscopic assessment of GLUT4 localization (45.Vollenweider P. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Microinjection of up to 10 units/ml purified PLD (S. chromofuscus) had little effect on the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 in unstimulated cells (Fig.1 A). However, microinjection of PLD caused a concentration-dependent increase in cell surface GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with 0.5 nminsulin. This low concentration of insulin had little or no effect alone but acted synergistically with injected PLD. The percentage of injected cells with GLUT4 at the cell surface was maximal at an injected concentration of 2 units/ml PLD. Since the injected volume is approximately 10% of the cell volume, we estimate the intracellular concentration of PLD in the injected adipocytes at 0.2 units/ml. To address the possibility that the increase in cell surface GLUT4 following injection of PLD might be due to a co-purifying bacterial contaminant, we also injected PLD purified from peanut or cabbage. Injection of cabbage or peanut PLD into 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly enhanced the percentage of cells with GLUT4 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B) relative to uninjected cells stimulated with 1 nm insulin. The effect of injected peanut or cabbage PLD on GLUT4 translocation in the presence of the low concentration of insulin was approximately half that of a maximally effective concentration of insulin (10 nm insulin) in these experiments. Injection of PLD at 2 units/ml did not enhance GLUT4 translocation in response to 10 nm insulin, consistent with the concept that insulin and PLD are stimulating GLUT4 translocation through a similar mechanism.Experiments were also conducted to examine the cellular localization of PLD isoforms with respect to GLUT4. Preliminary studies were conducted by transiently expressing Myc epitope-tagged PLD1 or HA epitope-tagged PLD2 in CHO-T cells followed by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies to localize these proteins. As previously reported (46.Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), PLD1 localized to intracellular vesicular structures that were often concentrated in the perinuclear region of these cells (Fig. 2). Insulin treatment did not disrupt the association of PLD1 with intracellular membranes but appeared to cause the dispersion of PLD1-associated membranes away from the perinuclear region. Interestingly, deletion of the region of the PLD1 cDNA encoding residues 224–323 yielded an expressed protein that failed to associate with intracellular membranes and instead localized in the cytoplasm of CHO-T cells (Fig. 2). Residues 224–323 within PLD1 have been noted to exhibit weak but significant similarity to pleckstrin homology domains, which are known to direct the membrane targeting of many proteins. Expressed HA-tagged PLD2 also displayed a cytoplasmic disposition but also localized to plasma membranes that could be visualized when the focal plane was adjusted to the top surface of cells (Fig. 2). Insulin had no detectable effect on the disposition of expressed HA-tagged PLD2 in these cells.Figure 2Analysis of the localization of PLD1 and PLD2 in CHO-T cells. CHO-T cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with pCMV5 encoding Myc-tagged PLD1, the ΔPH-PLD1 mutant, or HA-tagged construct of PLD2. The cells were stimulated with insulin (100 nm for 30 min) (+) or unstimulated (−). Cells were then fixed and incubated with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies.A, a vesicular accumulation of fluorescence in the perinuclear region can be seen in the PLD1-transfected cells. In insulin-stimulated cells, vesicles appear to be dispersed away from the perinuclear region. In cells expressing ΔPH-PLD1 or PLD2, a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence is seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to evaluate the relative subcellular localizations of PLD1 and GLUT4, a fusion construct was engineered containing GLUT4 and green fluorescent protein (GLUT4eGFP) as described previously (47.Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments confirmed the co-localization of GLUT4eGFP with endogenous GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (not shown). As observed in CHO-T cell (Figs. 2 and 3 A), expressed Myc-tagged PLD1 localized to intracellular membranes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as did GLUT4eGFP (Fig. 3). Analysis of the intracellular sites where these proteins localized by confocal microscopy revealed partial co-localization of PLD1 and GLUT4eGFP under the conditions of these experiments (Fig. 3, right panels). Taken together, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 reveal that PLD1 is a component of at least some of the intracellular membranes that sequester GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Figure 3Localization of PLD1 and GLUT4 in CHO-T cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CHO-T cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown on coverslips and transfected with Myc-tagged PLD1 and GLUT4eGFP. The cells were insulin-stimulated (100 nm for 30 min), fixed, and labeled with a murine anti-Myc antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. PLD1 and GLUT4eGFP were significantly co-localized in CHO-T cells (A) and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results described above indicating that PLD potentiates the action of insulin on GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 1) and is present at membrane sites that also contain GLUT4 (Fig. 3) raise the question whether PLD may be a target of insulin signaling. Extensive investigations have shown that PLD is potently stimulated by many hormones and other external stimuli (24.Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and some reports have claimed similar effects of insulin (37.Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 48.Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the effects of insulin receptor signaling and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on PLD activity in intact cells were assessed in three different model systems as follows: CHO-T and HeLa cells expressing high levels of insulin receptors and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In these experiments, PLD activity in intact cells incubated with primary alcohol is estimated based on the production of alcoholic phosphatidic acid. Fig. 4 shows that in the CHO-T cell model insulin elicited a rapid stimulation of PLD activity that appeared to be maximal after only 5 min of treatment (Fig. 4 A). Both insulin and PMA caused severalfold stimulations of PLD activity (Fig. 4 B). However, only the insulin-stimulated PLD activity could be inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that insulin but not PMA regulates PLD activity through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway in CHO-T cells expressing human insulin receptors.Figure 4Activation of PLD in CHO-T cells in response to insulin. A, time course of stimulation. CHO-T cells were incubated in the absence of serum overnight and labeled with [3H]myristic acid for 1 h. At time 0, cells were stimulated with 10−7m insulin, and 1-butanol was added at the indicated times for 15 min, and the amount of PtdBuOH produced was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, sensitivity of stimulation of PLD to wortmannin. CHO-T cells were serum-starved overnight, and wortmannin was added at a final concentration of 100 nm 10 min before stimulation with 100 nm insulin or 1 μm PMA. After 5 min, 1-butanol was added, and the reaction was terminated after 15 min. The upper panel shows the autoradiograph of the labeled PtdBuOH.

Similar results were obtained in three other experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One mechanism that might account for the results presented in Fig.4 B that has been raised in previous studies involves stimulation of PLD activity through activated ARF proteins (48.Shome K.

GTP loading of ARF1 in intact cells is sensitive to the toxin brefeldin A (50.Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), which has been reported to block insulin-activated PLD activity (49.Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C.

However, in our experiments in CHO-T cells, this does not appear to be the case. Fig. 5 A shows that incubation of CHO-T cells with brefeldin A is indeed able to disrupt ARF1 function, as evidenced by the disruption of Golgi morphology visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-ARF antibody. However, no effect of brefeldin A is observed on insulin-stimulated PLD activity in CHO-T cells (Fig. 5 B). Consistent with the data presented in Figs. 4 and 5, we were also able to detect a stimulation of PLD activity in HeLa cells transfected with human insulin receptors (Fig. 6). In these cells PMA was also an effective stimulator of the enzyme, whereas expression of tyrosine kinase-deficient insulin receptors was without effect, as expected.Figure 5Lack of effect of brefeldin A on activation of PLD in CHO-T cells by insulin. CHO-T cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid for 1 h. 100 μmbrefeldin A was added to half of the cultures, and 100 nminsulin was added 10 min later.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PMA was a strong activator of PLD (Fig.7), consistent with its effects in CHO-T and HeLa cells (Figs. 4 and 5). In contrast, insulin was without effect on PLD activity in intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as determined by PtdBuOH formation in total cell extracts (Fig. 7 A). In order to enhance the sensitivity of the assay in these cells, we took advantage of the fact that the product of PLD activity PtdBuOH is membrane-bound. Thus, one can analyze this reaction product in different membrane fractions derived from cells that had been incubated in the presence of the alcohol. We performed such analyses in plasma membranes (not shown), high density microsomes, and low density microsomes purified from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated without or with insulin or PMA, with results similar to those obtained with total cell extracts,i.e. no effect of insulin (Fig. 7). PMA treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated PLD activity in all of these membrane fractions. These data indicate that insulin has little or no effect on PLD activity in 3"

Because of the putative supportive role in photoreceptor maintenance, it is likely that constituent molecules play key roles in photoreceptor function and may be targets for inherited retinal disease. In this study we identify and characterize SPACRCAN, a novel chondroitin proteoglycan in this matrix. SPACRCAN was cloned from a human retinal cDNA library and the gene localized to chromosome 3q11.2. Analysis of SPACRCAN mRNA and protein revealed that SPACRCAN is expressed exclusively by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. SPACRCAN synthesized by photoreceptors is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix where it surrounds both rods and cones. The functional protein contains 1160 amino acids with a large central mucin domain, three consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a putative hyaluronan-binding motif, and a potential transmembrane domain near the C-terminal. Lectin and Western blotting indicate an M r around 400,000 before and 230,000 after chondroitinase ABC digestion. Removal ofN- and O-linked oligosaccharides reduces theM r to approximately 160,000, suggesting that approximately 60% of the mass of SPACRCAN is carbohydrate. Finally, we demonstrate that SPACRCAN binds hyaluronan and propose that associations between SPACRCAN and hyaluronan may be involved in organization of the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix, particularly as SPACRCAN is the major proteoglycan present in this matrix.

Because this matrix resides in such a key location and is putatively crucial in supporting photoreceptor function, additional information is required as to the identity, role, and involvement of specific IPM molecules in mediating these activities.Early attempts to remove IPM components for subsequent characterization used saline rinses of the outer retinal surface, which succeeded in isolating some soluble molecules. For example, the interphotoreceptor matrix retinoid-binding protein was first isolated from the IPM by rinsing, which also removed a variety of enzymes, some mucins, and immunoglobulins (13.Adler A.J. Klucznik K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14.Adler A.J. Severin K.M. Exp.

The retention of other less soluble molecules following aqueous rinses was not initially appreciated but was clearly documented in the studies of the IPM in Xenopus (18.Wood J.G. Besharse J.C. Napier-Marshall L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 228: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and rat (19.Porrello K. LaVail M.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Recently, an abundant sialoglycoprotein that is retained in the human IPM following rinsing was characterized and named SPACR (20.Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody prepared against SPACR intensely labels the rod-associated matrix with weaker labeling of the cone matrix (20.Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of peptides from purified SPACR revealed 100% identity to the deduced sequence of interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 (GenBankTM accession number AF047492) cDNA (also called IPM150) (21.Acharya S.

The gene product of interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 is listed in GenBankTM as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein, but our analysis indicates that it is a glycoprotein and not a proteoglycan (21.Acharya S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Earlier reports document the presence of another prominent protein in the insoluble IPM. This molecule, initially referred to as IPM200 (8.Hageman G.S. Johnson L.V. Prog. Ret. Res. 1991; 10: 207-249Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), is clearly a proteoglycan core protein because it will only enter a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel after digestion with chondroitinase ABC (23.Hollyfield J. Rayborn M. Midura R. Shadrach K. Acharya S. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it shows intense immunoreactivity in Western blots to a chondroitin ΔDi6S monoclonal antibody (23.Hollyfield J. Rayborn M. Midura R. Shadrach K. Acharya S. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Until now the identity of this proteoglycan has remained unknown. In this study we describe the cloning and characterization of the human cDNA encoding this novel proteoglycan in addition to the chromosomal localization of the gene counterpart. The identification of the proteoglycan came about during cloning attempts of the human homolog of PG10.2, a gene that is expressed specifically in rat pineal gland and retina (24.Wang X. Brownstein M.J. Young III, W.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the proteoglycan core protein isolated from the human IPM matched the deduced amino acid sequence of the human PG10.2 homolog. We named this gene and its product “SPACRCAN,” because it is a novel proteoglycan located in the subretinal space, the term used by ophthalmologists for the IPM. We document the expression of the SPACRCAN gene in photoreceptors and pinealocytes and localize SPACRCAN in the IPM where it surrounds both rods and cones. SPACRCAN is retained in the insoluble IPM through its binding to hyaluronan, suggesting that one function of SPACRCAN is to participate with the glycoprotein SPACR in binding and organizing hyaluronan into the primary scaffold of the insoluble IPM (25.Hollyfield J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2765-2767PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there are homologous regions between the deduced amino acid sequences of human SPACRCAN and the glycoprotein SPACR, which suggests a novel family of IPM-specific molecules.

Because this matrix resides in such a key location and is putatively crucial in supporting photoreceptor function, additional information is required as to the identity, role, and involvement of specific IPM molecules in mediating these activities. Early attempts to remove IPM components for subsequent characterization used saline rinses of the outer retinal surface, which succeeded in isolating some soluble molecules. For example, the interphotoreceptor matrix retinoid-binding protein was first isolated from the IPM by rinsing, which also removed a variety of enzymes, some mucins, and immunoglobulins (13.Adler A.J. Klucznik K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14.Adler A.J. Severin K.M. Exp.

The retention of other less soluble molecules following aqueous rinses was not initially appreciated but was clearly documented in the studies of the IPM in Xenopus (18.Wood J.G. Besharse J.C. Napier-Marshall L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 228: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and rat (19.Porrello K. LaVail M.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, an abundant sialoglycoprotein that is retained in the human IPM following rinsing was characterized and named SPACR (20.Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody prepared against SPACR intensely labels the rod-associated matrix with weaker labeling of the cone matrix (20.Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of peptides from purified SPACR revealed 100% identity to the deduced sequence of interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 (GenBankTM accession number AF047492) cDNA (also called IPM150) (21.Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The gene product of interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 is listed in GenBankTM as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein, but our analysis indicates that it is a glycoprotein and not a proteoglycan (21.Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Earlier reports document the presence of another prominent protein in the insoluble IPM. This molecule, initially referred to as IPM200 (8.Hageman G.S. Johnson L.V. Prog. Ret. Res. 1991; 10: 207-249Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), is clearly a proteoglycan core protein because it will only enter a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel after digestion with chondroitinase ABC (23.Hollyfield J. Rayborn M. Midura R. Shadrach K. Acharya S. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it shows intense immunoreactivity in Western blots to a chondroitin ΔDi6S monoclonal antibody (23.Hollyfield J. Rayborn M. Midura R. Shadrach K. Acharya S. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Until now the identity of this proteoglycan has remained unknown. In this study we describe the cloning and characterization of the human cDNA encoding this novel proteoglycan in addition to the chromosomal localization of the gene counterpart. The identification of the proteoglycan came about during cloning attempts of the human homolog of PG10.2, a gene that is expressed specifically in rat pineal gland and retina (24.Wang X. Brownstein M.J. Young III, W.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the proteoglycan core protein isolated from the human IPM matched the deduced amino acid sequence of the human PG10.2 homolog. We named this gene and its product “SPACRCAN,” because it is a novel proteoglycan located in the subretinal space, the term used by ophthalmologists for the IPM. We document the expression of the SPACRCAN gene in photoreceptors and pinealocytes and localize SPACRCAN in the IPM where it surrounds both rods and cones. SPACRCAN is retained in the insoluble IPM through its binding to hyaluronan, suggesting that one function of SPACRCAN is to participate with the glycoprotein SPACR in binding and organizing hyaluronan into the primary scaffold of the insoluble IPM (25.Hollyfield J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2765-2767PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there are homologous regions between the deduced amino acid sequences of human SPACRCAN and the glycoprotein SPACR, which suggests a novel family of IPM-specific molecules.

We thank Dr. Jeremy Nathans for providing the human retina cDNA library, Dr. Ivan Still for his help in identifying the expressed sequence tags used in chromosomal localization of SPACRCAN, Dr. John Hassell for his comments on potential GAG attachment sites in SPACRCAN, Dr. Eva A.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of oxLDL-induced cytotoxicity and determine its tissue specificity, we have used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells expressing human CD36 (CHO/CD36). Expression of CD36 rendered these cells susceptible to killing by oxLDL. This cytotoxicity was due to the induction of apoptosis. Therefore, CD36 expression is the only requirement for oxLDL-induced apoptosis. Oxysterols apparently mediate the cytotoxicity of oxLDL in macrophage foam cells and endothelial cells. 25-Hydroxycholesterol, at concentrations higher than 1 μg/ml, killed CHO-K1 cells, by apoptosis, in medium supplemented with serum as a source of cholesterol. These effects were not seen in a 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant CHO/CD36 mutant (OXR), which was otherwise capable of undergoing apoptosis in response to staurosporine. This mutant was also resistant to killing by oxLDL, suggesting that oxysterols are at least partially responsible for the toxic effects of oxLDL. Oxysterol-induced apoptosis did not involve regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein proteolysis or the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. 25-Hydroxycholesterol stimulated calcium uptake by CHO-K1 cells within 2 min after addition. Treatment of CHO or THP-1 (macrophage) cells with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine prevented 25-hydroxycholesterol induction of apoptosis.

Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These changes eventually result in the formation of atheromatous lesions. Local oxidative degradation of trapped LDL may generate lipid-derived inflammatory mediators, such as oxysterols, lysophospholipids, and fatty acid peroxides. oxLDL and its lipid components have also been shown to be cytotoxic for cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and central nervous system cells (5.Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Sugawa M. Ikeda S. Kushima Y. Takashima Y. Cynshi O.

It has been shown that the apoptosis-inducing activity was recovered in the neutral lipid fraction of oxLDL, and various oxysterols in this fraction induce apoptosis in endothelial cells (26.Harada-Shiba M.

Nilsson J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2049-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how oxLDL or its active components induce apoptosis in these and other vascular cells. Different agents, such as tumor necrosis factor, γ radiation, UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide (33.de Bono D.P. Yang W.D. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and growth factor removal (34.Araki S. Shimada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), induce apoptosis in many cell types by both unique and common mechanisms. For example, Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor family members transduce the signal of apoptosis through death domain-containing molecules, such as FADD (35.Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), whereas many other agents induce apoptosis by pathways that do not involve protein molecules with a death domain. On the other hand, almost all known agents that induce apoptosis share the activation of caspases and the execution phase of the death program (36.Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). CHO cells are well suited for mutational analysis of complex cellular pathways (37.Leonard S. Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because of this, it is possible to use transfected or mutant CHO cell lines for genetic analysis of the gene products and functions involved in the programmed cell death induced by oxLDL or its components. In this study, we have used CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with CD36 to study the cytotoxic effects of oxLDL and 25-hydroxycholesterol. We have also generated a CHO/CD36 mutant cell line resistant to killing by these two agents. CHO-K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 25-Hydroxycholesterol was from Steraloids Inc. (Wilton, NH). 45Ca2+ was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DiI and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody was from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and IgG and the micro-BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce. The plasmid pcDNA3 carrying human CD36FLAG cDNA was generously provided by Dr. D. M. Lublin (Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). SREBP constructs were kindly provided by Dr. T. F. Osborne (Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA). pTK(K×3)CAT was provided by Dr. David Russell (University of Texas, Southwestern, Dallas, TX). THP-1 cells (TIB-202) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (RPMI medium) under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments, cells were plated on coverslips at 1 × 106 cells/cm2 in RPMI medium containing 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (Alexis, San Diego, CA). The cells were allowed to attach and differentiate into macrophages for 72 h. For isolation of permanent transfectants expressing CD36, CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (F12FC5) at 37 °C and 5% CO2and transfected with pcDNA3, carrying human CD36FLAG cDNA and neomycin resistance, by the lipofectam method using a mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The neomycin-resistant cells were selected using 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in F12FC5. Resistant colonies were isolated and assayed for the presence of CD36 and DiI-oxLDL binding, and internalization activity as described below. Colonies expressing CD36 activity were expanded and maintained in F12FC5 containing 500 μg/ml G418. For 25-hydroxycholesterol cytotoxicity assays, CHO-K1 cells were seeded at a density of 500 or 1000 cells/35- or 60-mm dish in F12FC5 on day 0. On day 1, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and then fed either Nutridoma-SP (1% in Ham's F-12) or F12FC5 containing oxysterols or oxLDL as described in the figure legends. Following incubation, cells were fed fresh F12FC5 and allowed to grow for 5 days. The surviving colonies were then fixed and stained with crystal violet as described (38.Sinensky M. Armagast S. Mueller G. Torget R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6621-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of pTK(K×3)CAT (3 μg) were performed on 5 × 104 cells/60-mm plate using the Stratagene Transfection MBS Mammalian Transfection Kit according to the instruction manual with an internal standard expressing β-galactosidase (2 μg), pCMVβ-gal (Promega), to correct for transfection efficiency. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were as described previously (57.Thewke D.P. Panini S.R. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21402-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells (50,000) were plated on glass coverslips and incubated for different periods of time in F12FC5 with or without 10–50 μg/ml oxLDL. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed, and cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dUTP to label the fragmented DNA. After completion, coverslips were mounted in anti-fade mounting solution and observed under a Nikon Diaphot-200 microscope. LDL (1.019 <d < 1.063) was prepared from normal human serum by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (39.Havel R. Eder H. Braigon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 39: 1345-1363Crossref Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). Extensively oxidized LDL was prepared by incubation with CuCl2 as described previously (40.Brown A.J. Leong S.L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1730-1745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation of LDL was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The oxLDL had 3–5-fold higher R F values on agarose gel electrophoresis compared with native LDL. DiI-labeled oxLDL was prepared as described elsewhere (41.Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, oxLDL was incubated with the DiI probe in human lipoprotein-deficient serum for 12 h at 37 °C, using the following relative amounts: 300 μl (300 μg) of DiI, 3 mg of lipoprotein lipid, 2 ml of lipoprotein-deficient serum. Subsequently, the labeled lipoproteins are reisolated by ultracentrifugation for 2.5 h at 99,000 rpm in a TL-100 centrifuge. Labeled lipoproteins were stored at 4 °C in the dark and used within 2 weeks after their preparation. Transfected cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips and then incubated with 10 μg/ml DiI-oxLDL for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in PBS and mounted. Cell association of DiI-labeled oxLDL was observed by fluorescence microscopy using a Texas Red filter cube. Alternatively, after fixation, standard immunofluorescence was performed with anti-CD36- or anti-FLAG-specific monoclonal antibodies. Detection of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments was done as described previously (42.Meßmer U.K. Reed J.C. Brüne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20192-20197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Basically, cells at an initial density of 5 × 105/100-mm dish were cultured for 24 h in F12FC5 plus oxLDL or oxysterols and then harvested, lysed, and centrifuged to separate DNA fragments from intact chromatin. Supernatants were precipitated overnight at −20 °C with 2 volumes of ethanol and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Then pellets were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once again with chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1). DNA was precipitated, and pellets were recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min), air-dried, resuspended in 10 μl of TE buffer, supplemented with 2 μl of sample buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol), and electrophoretically separated on a 1.3% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, they were stained in ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml). Pictures were taken by UV transillumination. CHO-K1 cells were plated and treated as described above. After treatment, both treated and nontreated cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation (800 ×g for 10 min). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPi, and 10 mmNaPPi). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, passed through a 21-gauge syringe 15 times, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant (total cell lysate) was measured by the micro-BCA kit. Triplicates of 250 μg of total cell lysate protein were incubated with Ac-DEVD-AMC (20 μm) caspase-3 substrate or substrate plus the specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (100 nm) for 1.5 h at 37 °C in protease assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol). Liberated AMC from Ac-DEVD-AMC was measured on a spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Cells (1.5 × 105/35-mm plate) were incubated with 3 μg/ml 25-[26,27-3H]hydroxycholesterol (20,000 dpm/μg) for 18 h. The dishes were extracted twice with 3 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (60:40). The fixed cells were digested for 3 h in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and 0.1-ml aliquots were assayed for protein (BCA, Pierce). The lipid extract was concentrated to 0.1 ml by evaporation under nitrogen and spotted onto silicic acid TLC plates, and the components were separated with the solvent system hexane/diethyl ether/HAc (80:20:1). The 25-hydroxycholesterol ester was visualized by fluorography, and the bands were scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Kinetic measurements of calcium were performed by a dipping technique as described previously (58.Yarom M. Zurgil N. Zisapel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16286-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 105 cells/35 mm dish. After an overnight incubation in F12FC5, coverslips were sequentially washed in a reference buffer. At time 0, the coverslips were dipped in a beaker containing Ca2+ and 45Ca2+ in reference buffer with or without 25-hydroxycholesterol. After the indicated period of time, cells were washed and solubilized in 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Chemical modifications of LDL, such as oxidation, convert LDL into a high affinity ligand of scavenger receptors. oxLDL is cytotoxic for many cell types in the vessel wall, and its interaction with the macrophage scavenger receptors and subsequent toxic effects play a crucial role in the initiation of the atherosclerotic lesion. To test if uptake of oxLDL is sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effects in a fibroblastic cell line, we have transfected CHO-K1 with CD36, a scavenger receptor structurally related to SR-BI and its human counterpart CLA-I. This receptor has been reported to bind oxLDL and acetylated LDL. (43.Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Suarez Y. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. J. Lipid. Res. 1998; 39: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell association of oxLDL to CHO-K1 expressing CD36 was examined by fluorescence microscopy after incubating DiI-labeled oxLDL with CHO-K1 stably transfected with a vector carrying CD36FLAG (CHO/CD36). Untransfected CHO cells displayed a diffuse light staining, possibly due to traces of free DiI or uptake through other scavenger receptors (Fig.1 A). However, when CHO/CD36 cells were incubated with DiI-oxLDL, a subset of cells, corresponding to the number of cells expressing CD36, as determined by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific against CD36 or FLAG (results not shown), showed both an internal punctuated staining pattern (probably endosomes and lysosomes) and an intense plasma membrane staining (Fig. 1 B). Specificity of the interaction was proven by the ability of unlabeled oxLDL (50-fold excess) to inhibit the DiI-oxLDL staining (Fig. 1 C). These findings confirm previous reports (44.Nicholson A.C. Frieda S. Pearce A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that CD36 when expressed on CHO cells binds and allows internalization of oxLDL. Using a single-cell plating assay to determine cytotoxicity, we found that expression of CD36 in CHO cells renders the cells susceptible to killing by oxLDL (Fig.2). In this assay, 500 cells are plated on 35-mm dishes, subjected to different treatments, and allowed to form colonies, which can be stained and counted. Fig. 2 shows that treatment of CHO/CD36 with 10 μg/ml of oxLDL for 5 days eliminates formation of colonies, indicating cytotoxicity, whereas untransfected CHO-K1 cells were not affected by this treatment. oxLDL induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). Approximately 10 or 20% of the CHO/CD36 cells became TUNEL-positive after a 48-h incubation with 10 or 50 μg of protein/ml of oxLDL, respectively (Fig. 3, A andB). Commensurate with the results derived from the TUNEL assay, DNA ladders were present in genomic DNA extracted from CHO/CD36 cells incubated with similar oxLDL concentrations (Fig. 3 C). The fragmented DNA showed the distinct pattern of oligonucleosomes found in apoptotic cells. oxLDL (10 μg/ml) induced significant apoptosis in CHO/CD36 cells as early as at 16 h of incubation (data not shown), and the number of apoptotic cells increased up until 48 h of incubation. Incubation of CHO/CD36 with native LDL or incubation of CHO-K1 with oxLDL did not induce apoptosis beyond the control level (less than 1% of total cells) (data not shown). These findings indicate that oxLDL is able to induce apoptosis in cultured fibroblasts when the cells are able to bind and/or internalize oxLDL. Several recent studies have shown that much of the cytotoxicity of oxLDL is associated with the neutral lipid components, in particular the oxysterols (45.Chisolm G.M. Ma G. Irwin K.C. Martin L.L. Gunderson K.G. Linberg L.F. Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11452-11456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 46.Sevanian A. Hodis H.N. Hwang J. McLeod L.L. Peterson H. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 1971-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of oxysterols may be evidenced by a number of mechanisms, from effects on cholesterol synthesis to effects on cell membranes to induction of apoptosis. (30.Aupeix K. Weltin D.

Cell. Res. 1997; 235: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the next set of experiments, we addressed the following two main questions. 1) Are oxysterol-resistant mutants cross-resistant to oxLDL? 2) Does transcriptional down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis by oxysterols play a role in their induction of apoptosis? Fig. 4 shows the results of a representative single-cell plating experiment as a function of time of exposure to 3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol in the presence of serum as the exogenous source of cholesterol. A significant reduction (∼50%) in the number of viable cells was seen after a 6-h incubation. Furthermore, after a 12-h incubation, virtually all treated cells were dead. The mode of cell death was confirmed to be through apoptosis by TUNEL assay (Fig. 5, A andB), oligonucleosomal DNA laddering assay (Fig.5 C), and caspase 3 activation assay (TableI).Figure 525-Hydroxycholesterol induces apoptosis in CHO/CD36 cells. A, apoptosis assay. Cells (30,000) were plated on glass coverslips and incubated for 24 h in F12FC5 containing 0, 1, 3, or 5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol. Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL as described in the legend to Fig. 3. B, gel electrophoresis of DNA. Cells at an initial density 5 × 105 were cultured for 24 h in F12FC5, with or without 3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, and incubated for 24 h and then harvested and lysed, and DNA fragments were detected as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISpectrofluorometric analysis of caspase-3 activity for CHO cells treated with and without 25-hydroxycholesterolCHO-K1 Cell lysateAc-DEVD-AMCAc-DEVD-CHORelative AMC fluorescenceNet Relative AMC fluorescenceUntreated+−0.267 ± 0.0150.063 ± 0.021++0.203 ± 0.01225-OHC (48 h)+−0.560 ± 0.0200.457 ± 0.025++0.103 ± 0.005CHO-K1 cells were treated with 0 or 3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol for 48 h, and 250 μg of total cell lysate protein were assayed for caspase-3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the average of triplicates ± S.D.

If oxysterols are the mediators of the cytotoxic effects of oxLDL, an oxysterol-resistant mutant should be resistant to killing by oxLDL. We mutagenized CHO/CD36 with methanesulfonic acid ethyl ester and selected colonies that grew in medium containing 3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC). As shown in Fig. 6 A, OXRcells are resistant to killing by 3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol. These cells were also resistant to killing by 35 μg/ml oxLDL (Fig.6 B). Fig. 6 C shows that the staining pattern of OXR cells with DiI-oxLDL is similar to that in CHO/CD36, suggesting that binding and internalization of oxLDL in the OXR cell line is unaltered from its parental cell line. A general defect in one or more steps in the apoptosis pathway per se (e.g. defective caspase 3, overexpression of Bcl-2, etc.) would produce a similar resistance phenotype. Therefore, we also confirmed that OXR cells were capable of undergoing apoptosis in response to another known apoptosis inducer. Fig.6 A shows that OXR cells are susceptible to staurosporine, a reagent that induces apoptosis through inhibition of protein kinase C, and therefore seemed to have a functioning apoptosis pathway at least in the execution phase of the death program. The best known biological activity of oxysterols is transcriptional repression of cholesterol biosynthesis, through inhibition of processing of the SREBPs, although other activities for these molecules have recently come to be appreciated (62.Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Oxysterols have been reported to initiate apoptosis in CEM leukemic cells by interfering with the synthesis of cholesterol in the absence of an exogenous cholesterol source (47.Ayala-Torres S. Moller P.C. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 235: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since we carried out our incubations in the presence of serum, as an exogenous cholesterol source, we would expect that the apoptotic pathway would not be mediated by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. However, we dir"

Because the mixed lineage kinase dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK) is a large modular protein, structure-function analysis was undertaken to examine the role of DLK domains in macromolecular complex formation. DLK mutants were used to demonstrate that a DLK leucine zipper-leucine zipper interaction is necessary for DLK dimerization and to show that DLK dimerization mediated by the leucine zipper domain is prerequisite for DLK activity and subsequent activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). Heterologous mixed lineage kinase family members can be co-immunoprecipitated. However, the DLK leucine zipper domain interacted specifically only with the DLK leucine zipper domain; in contrast, DLK NH2-terminal region was sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate leucine zipper kinase and DLK. DLK has been shown to associate with the putative scaffold protein JIP1. This association occurred through the DLK NH2-terminal region and occurred independently of DLK catalytic activity. Although the DLK NH2-terminal region associated directly with JIP-1, this region did not interact directly with either DLK or leucine zipper kinase. Therefore, DLK may interact with heterologous mixed lineage kinase proteins via intermediary proteins. The NH2-terminal region of overexpressed DLK was required for activation of SAPK.

Among the MAPKs, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs or JNKs) are predominantly activated by cell stress-inducing signals, such as heat shock, ultraviolet irradiation, proinflammatory cytokines, hyperosmolarity, ischemia/reperfusion, and axonal injury. Activation of a prototypical MAPK occurs through sequential activation of a series of upstream kinases: a serine/threonine MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates a dual specificity protein kinase (MAPK kinase (also known as MKK or MEK)) that in turn phosphorylates and activates a MAPK. Like the prototypical MAPK pathway, the mammalian SAPK pathways were initially thought to lead in a linear fashion from activation of a Rho-like small GTPase through a series of intermediate protein kinases to SAPK activation. However, with the identification of two MAPK kinases (MKK4/SEK1 and MKK7/JNKK2) many MAPKKKs (four mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase kinases 1, five mixed lineage kinases (MLKs), ASK1, Tpl-2, and TAK1) and multiple additional MAPKKK kinases that appear to lie in pathways proximal to the SAPKs, it is clear that the organization, regulation, and function of these protein kinase pathways remain incompletely understood. Distinct MAPK pathways that respond to specific stimuli and effect unique cellular responses may employ subsets of identical protein kinases within the same cell. For these reasons, cells have evolved mechanisms that afford pathway specificity (5.Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have provided evidence that MAP kinase pathways are assembled from a unique combination of protein kinases into distinct protein complexes or modules (6.Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 7.Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The components of these modules interact via direct protein-protein interactions and/or are tethered to scaffolding proteins (8.Kranz J.E. Satterberg B. Elion E.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9.Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A.

Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Importantly, assembly of MAPK modules appears to allow segregation of MAPK signaling components into units that are responsive to independent stimuli and that can regulate functionally distinct substrates. Identification of JIP-1 as a scaffold protein that interacts in a specific fashion with members of the MLK family of MAPKKKs, with MKK7 but not MKK4, and with JNKs first established that mammalian cells organize SAPK pathways into modules in a fashion similar to yeast (13.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Yet little is known about mechanisms that regulate the assembly or activity of these modules. The five MLKs function as MAPK kinase kinases and share two structural features (14.Dorow D.S.

Each has a kinase catalytic domain, the primary structure of which most closely resemble MAPK kinase kinases. Second, closely juxtaposed COOH-terminal to the catalytic domain, each MLK protein has two leucine/isoleucine zippers separated by a short spacer region. Despite these common features, MLK family members are likely to have diverse biological behavior. This is predicted by comparison of structure that shows that MLKs 1, 2, and 3 form one closely related MLK subfamily, whereas DLK and LZK form a second distinct subfamily (15.Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19.Sakuma H. Ikeda A. Oka S. Kozutsumi Y. Zanetta J.P. Kawasaki T. J. Biol.

MLKs 2 and 3 share more than 70% sequence identity within their kinase catalytic and leucine zipper domains. Both possess an Src homology 3 domain in their NH2-terminal region and both have a functional CRIB domain that mediates GTP-dependent association with Rac1 and Cdc42Hs (20.Nagata K.I. Puls A.

Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). DLK and LZK share kinase catalytic and leucine zipper domains that are more than 90% identical, whereas these domains have only 36% identity to those of MLKs 2 and 3. Moreover, DLK and LZK lack both CRIB motifs and Src homology 3 domains and possess COOH-terminal regions that are structurally distinct from each other and from those of MLKs 2 and 3. These observations suggest that protein-protein interactions unique to each protein kinase may participate in specifying SAPK module assembly and may play a role in regulating the activity and subcellular localization of these modules. Structure-function analysis of DLK was undertaken to begin to understand the mechanisms that regulate the assembly and activity of DLK-dependent SAPK modules. Polyclonal antibodies to the COOH-terminal 223 amino acids and to NH2-terminal 250 amino acids of DLK were described previously (22.Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G., Yu, G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol.

All constructs were validated by restriction digestion and sequencing to ensure the fidelity ofTaq polymerase. All the transfections in mammalian cells were carried out in either 293T cells or COS-7 cells wherever indicated. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Inc.) and 200 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfection was performed using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturers protocols using 2 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Fugene-6 for one 6-mm well of tissue culture plate containing subconfluent cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed using the indicated antibodies as described elsewhere. 50 μl of cell lysates or immunoprecipitates was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described previously. The cells were transfected with the DNA constructs as indicated in the figure legends. Cell lysates were prepared after 48 h of transfection using 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalogue no. 1836170). Kinase assays for P46 SAPK immune-complex were performed as described previously. Briefly, the immunoprecipitated mixtures from the lysates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) containing 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 2 μg of GST-c-Jun (1–79). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2× loading buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose and autoradiography. Expression of p46SAPK in each sample was assessed by immunoblotting. The indicated constructs (see the legends to Figs. 3 and 8) were separately expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine in a single reaction reticulocyte lysate based in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the directions of the manufacturer. Each reaction was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (buffer containing phosphate buffered 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors).

To determine whether the leucine zipper domain present in DLK is necessary for oligomerization of the DLK peptide, expression constructs encoding a series of DLK truncation and point mutants were created (Fig. 1). A plasmid encoding a Myc epitope-tagged DLK leucine zipper domain (m-LZ) was co-expressed by transient transfection with F-DLK, F-DLK(1–520), F-DLK(1–418), DLK(521–888), and F-DLK (405–520) in 293T cells. As shown in Fig.2, m-LZ co-immunoprecipitated F-DLK, F-DLK (1–520), and F-DLK (405–520). However, m-LZ did not co-immunoprecipitate DLK mutants lacking the leucine zipper domain (DLK (521–888) or F-DLK (1–418); Fig. 2, A and B). That m-LZ did not co-immunoprecipitate DLK mutants lacking the leucine zipper domain suggested that the LZ was necessary for DLK oligomer formation. This possibility was examined further by creating a FLAG-tagged DLK point mutant in which the α-helical structure of the two DLK leucine zipper motifs was disrupted. Leucine residues at positions 437 and 463 were replaced by proline residues to create F-DLK-PP. m-LZ was co-expressed with wild type F-DLK or F-DLK-PP in 293T cells. m-LZ co-immunoprecipitated wild type F-DLK but not F-DLK-PP (Fig. 2 A). To confirm a direct interaction between the DLK leucine zipper domain and itself, DLK leucine zipper domain (m-LZ) was co-expressed with F-DLK, F-DLK-PP or F-LZ in a reticulocyte lysate system. As shown, the Myc-tagged leucine zipper domain of DLK co-immunoprecipitated F-LZ, wild type F-DLK, but not F-DLK-PP (Fig.3). Collectively, these results provide evidence that the DLK leucine zipper-leucine zipper interaction is necessary for DLK dimerization. Overexpression of wild type DLK by transient transfection results in DLK autophosphorylation and SAPK/JNK activation (17.Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22.Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G., Yu, G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We sought to examine the hypothesis that DLK homodimerization is necessary for these activities. Myc-p46SAPK was co-expressed by transient transfection with F-DLK, F-K185A, F-DLK (1–520), F-DLK (1–418), DLK (521–888), or F-DLK-PP in 293T cells. Following immunoprecipitation of DLK or its mutants, autophosphorylation was assessed in vitro after incubation in a kinase buffer containing [32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.4, only F-DLK and F-DLK (1–520) became phosphorylated under these conditions. DLK mutants that lacked the leucine zipper domain or that possessed disrupted α-helices failed to become phosphorylated. To examine the capacity of the various overexpressed DLK mutants to activate SAPK/JNK in this system, Myc-p46SAPK was immunoprecipitated from the same cell lysates and was evaluated in a kinase assay using recombinant GST-c-Jun (1–79) as substrate (Fig. 4). F-DLK (1–520), which was deleted of the entire DLK region COOH-terminal to the leucine zipper domain, activated SAPK to the same degree as the wild type protein. F-DLK (1–418), which was additionally deleted of the leucine zipper domain, did not activate SAPK/JNK above control. Similarly, F-DLK-PP expression resulted in markedly attenuated activation of SAPK/JNK relative to wild type DLK. (Failure of DLK (135–888) to activate SAPK is discussed below.) Correlated with the data above, these results support the hypothesis that DLK dimerization mediated by the leucine zipper domain is prerequisite for DLK activity and subsequent activation of SAPK/JNK. Mixed lineage kinase family members may have the capacity to form leucine zipper-dependent hetero-oligomers (15.Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis had been suggested by the observations that DLK can co-immunoprecipitate co-expressed MLK3 (data not shown and Ref. 24.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that MLK3 can co-immunoprecipitate co-expressed MLK2 (26.Leung I.W.-L. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In a similar experiment, F-DLK was co-expressed with HA-tagged LZK by transient transfection in 293T cells. F-DLK co-immunoprecipitated HA-LZK (see Fig. 7 B). Therefore, overexpressed DLK can form complexes with either MLK3 or LZK despite their structurally distinct leucine zipper domains. To examine whether heterogeneous MLK complex formation is mediated via a leucine zipper-leucine zipper interaction, Myc-tagged DLK leucine zipper domain (m-LZ) was co-expressed with F-MLK3, HA-LZK, or F-JIP1 in 293T cells (Fig. 5). m-LZ was immunoprecipitated from each set of cell lysates, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed for co-immunoprecipitation of MLK3, LZK, or JIP1. Although m-LZ co-immunoprecipitated F-DLK, the DLK leucine zipper domain did not co-immunoprecipitate MLK3, LZK, or JIP-1. This result indicates that the DLK leucine zipper domain interacts specifically only with the DLK leucine zipper and not with leucine zipper domains of other structurally similar MLK proteins. Moreover, these results suggest that the interactions of DLK with heterologous MLK protein kinases may be mediated via other DLK domains. The observations that the leucine zipper domain of DLK interacted specifically with DLK and was necessary for SAPK activation suggested that co-expression of the DLK leucine zipper domain with various MLK proteins would result in selective attenuation of SAPK activation induced by overexpression of the various MLK proteins. To test this prediction, plasmids encoding SAPK, MLK proteins (including DLK, MLK3, and LZK), and variable amounts of DLK leucine zipper domain were co-expressed in 293T cells. SAPK was immunoprecipitated from each cell lysate and assayed for catalytic activity. DLK-induced SAPK activation was attenuated in a fashion directly proportionate to the quantity of DLK leucine zipper domain expressed (Fig.6, top panel). However, MLK3-mediated SAPK activation was unaffected by co-expression of even a relatively large quantity of DLK leucine zipper domain (Fig. 6,middle panel). Co-expression of DLK leucine zipper domain did attenuate LZK-mediated SAPK activation, but attenuation was observed only when competed with a relatively large quantity of DLK leucine zipper domain (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Together with the results of experiments described above, these observations suggest the DLK leucine zipper domain has a high affinity for itself, a significantly lower affinity for the LZK leucine zipper domain, and no significant affinity for the MLK3 leucine zipper domain. A series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments with DLK deletion mutants was undertaken to identify DLK domains capable of forming complexes with LZK and JIP1. Wild type HA-tagged LZK was co-expressed by transient transfection with F-DLK, F-DLK (1–520), F-DLK (1–418), or F-DLK (250–418) (Fig. 7 B). Overexpressed LZK co-immunoprecipitated with F-DLK, F-DLK (1–520), and F-DLK (1–418), but not F-DLK (250–418). This observation confirmed that the DLK leucine zipper domain was not necessary for LZK-DLK association in this system and suggested that the NH2-terminal region of DLK mediated LZK-DLK co-immunoprecipitation. To corroborate this result, HA-LZK was co-expressed with F-DLK or a mutant lacking the entire DLK region NH2-terminal to its catalytic domain (F-DLK (135–888)) (Fig. 7 B). As expected, overexpressed LZK co-immunoprecipitated wild type DLK but not F-DLK (135–888). Given the previous results, we also considered the possibility that DLK might associate with additional DLK peptides via its NH2-terminal region. In similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Myc-tagged DLK was co-expressed in 293T cells with F-DLK (1–520), and F-DLK (1–418), F-DLK (250–418), or DLK (135–888) (Fig.7 C). Wild type DLK was co-immunoprecipitated with F-DLK (1–520) and F-DLK (1–418) but not F-DLK (250–418) or DLK (135–888). Therefore, in a fashion similar to LZK, overexpressed DLK can be co-immunoprecipitated with DLK via its NH2-terminal region. Of note, this co-immunoprecipitation occurred independently of the DLK leucine zipper domain. DLK and MLK3 have been shown to directly associate with JIP1 (13.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using DLK deletion mutants to locate the JIP1 binding region within DLK. Following overexpression in 293T cells, Myc-tagged JIP1 could be co-immunoprecipitated with F-DLK, F-DLK (1–520), F-DLK (1–418), and catalytically inactive DLK, F-K185A (Fig. 7 A). However, JIP1 could not be co-immunoprecipitated with DLK (521–888) or F-DLK (135–888). These results imply that the DLK NH2-terminal domain is necessary for the association of DLK and JIP1. Importantly, the association of JIP1 and DLK occurs independently of DLK catalytic activity. We next examined whether the association of the NH2-terminal region of DLK with LZK, DLK, and JIP1 occurs via a direct interaction. Metabolically labeled LZK, DLK, and JIP1 expressed in a reticulocyte lysate system were incubated individually with bacterially expressed and purified GST-NH2-terminal DLK or control. As shown, JIP1 but not LZK or DLK co-purified in the presence of GST-NH2-terminal DLK when isolated by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig.8). Taken with the results above, these observations indicate that DLK NH2-terminal region can directly associate with JIP-1 independently of DLK kinase catalytic activity. However, the DLK NH2-terminal domain does not interact directly with either DLK or LZK despite the observation that the NH2-terminal domain of DLK can be co-immunoprecipitated with LZK and DLK when over-expressed in mammalian cells. To test the functional necessity of the DLK NH2-terminal domain in SAPK/JNK activation, FLAG-tagged DLK deleted of the NH2-terminal region (F-DLK (135–888)) was co-expressed with Myc-tagged p46SAPK in 293T cells (Fig.4). Activation of immunoprecipitated Myc-p46SAPK was evaluated in a kinase assay using recombinant GST-c-Jun (1–79) as substrate. Unlike overexpressed wild type DLK, which activated SAPK, F-DLK (135–888) did not activate SAPK above control. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal region of overexpressed DLK is required for activation of SAPK. As a means of testing whether the catalytic activity of F-DLK (135–888) was preserved, this mutant was overexpressed, immunoprecipitated, and assayed for its ability to phosphorylate a nonspecific substrate in vitro (Fig.9). Although one cannot exclude the possibility that the immunoprecipitate containing F-DLK (135–888) also possesses kinase catalytic activity not associated with F-DLK (135–888), immunoprecipitate containing F-DLK (135–888) appeared to retain catalytic activity above that containing the catalytically inactive DLK(K185A). The results presented herein provide preliminary insight into the mechanism governing DLK activation. Our previously published work demonstrated that overexpressed DLK forms covalently linked homodimers (22.Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G., Yu, G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As reported herein, homodimerization of DLK is mediated by a direct interaction requiring its leucine zipper domain. Leucine zipper domain dimerization is prerequisite for DLK phosphorylation and subsequent activation of SAPK. These observations support the hypothesis that—in a fashion similar to the MAPKKK Raf (27.Farrar M.A. Alberol-Ila Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28.Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or generic receptor tyrosine kinases (29.Ballotti R. Lammers R. Scimeca J.C. Dull T. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Van Obberghen E. EMBO. 1989; 8: 3303-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)—mixed lineage kinase dimerization results in subsequent transphosphorylation and MLK activation (15.Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Leung I.W.-L. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In support of this model, co-expression of the isolated DLK leucine zipper domain effectively attenuates the ability of DLK to activate SAPK activity, presumably by competitively inhibiting DLK dimerization and subsequent DLK transphosphorylation and activation. However, the mechanism governing DLK dimerization remains undetermined. DLK dimerization does not require DLK phosphorylation or catalytic activity because a catalytically inactive and unphosphorylated form of DLK (K185A) forms homodimers (22.Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G., Yu, G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further, the isolated DLK leucine zipper domain readily associates with itself and appears to associate with any truncated form of DLK as long as these mutants (functional or not) contain the leucine zipper domain. Collectively, these observations suggest that the DLK leucine zipper domain-leucine zipper domain interaction is of high affinity and that unchecked, DLK seeks its most favorable configuration by forming stable homodimers. Presuming that DLK homodimerization precedes DLK activation, these observations suggest that a mechanism must exist that regulates the assembly of DLK homodimers. The nature of this mechanism requires further investigation. It has been speculated that mixed lineage kinase leucine zipper motifs also mediate formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes between members of the mixed lineage kinase family (15.Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Leung I.W.-L. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Formation of these hetero-oligomers was predicted based principally on the observation of strong structural similarity among the leucine zipper domains of the MLK family members, particularly between members of the subfamily comprising MLKs 1, 2, and 3 and between members of the DLK/LZK subfamily. Indeed, as noted herein, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that overexpressed DLK can be co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed LZK and with the structurally more distant MLK3. Others have noted that overexpressed MLK3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed MLK2 (26.Leung I.W.-L. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Contrary to expectation, our experiments indicate that the leucine zipper domain of DLK interacts exclusively with that of DLK and not with the leucine zipper domain of the structurally similar LZK or the more distant MLK3. Therefore, the unique DLK-DLK leucine zipper domain interaction—and more generally, unique MLK-MLK leucine zipper domain interactions—may provide an important determinant of signaling specificity by limiting functional interactions between proximally localized heterologous MLK peptides. That DLK leucine zipper domains interact to form only homo-oligomers suggested that the interactions detected by co-immunoprecipitation of DLK with heterologous MLK protein kinases must be mediated by another DLK domain. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation of DLK with both DLK and heterologous MLK proteins occurred independently of the leucine zipper domain of DLK and was mediated by the NH2-terminal region of DLK. These interactions appeared to occur via an undefined intermediary protein because a direct interaction between the NH2-terminal domain of DLK and DLK or LZK could not be demonstrated. As discussed below, because the scaffold protein JIP-1 does associate directly with the NH2-terminal region of DLK, it is possible that JIP-1 serves as this intermediary. However, it is also possible that a yet unidentified protein serves in this capacity. If JIP-1 serves as the intermediary protein involved in these interactions, then JIP-1 should possess at least two MLK binding domains or should homodimerize. In preliminary data supporting the later possibility, overexpressed Myc- and FLAG-tagged JIP-1 do co-immunoprecipitate. 4D. Nihalani and L. B. Holzman, unpublished data. The functional significance of indirect interaction between the NH2-terminal region of DLK and other MLK proteins has been suggested by experiments in which overexpressed catalytically inactive DLK (K185A) attenuated overexpressed MLK3-induced SAPK activation (24.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The true physiological relevance of these observations remains unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that mammalian SAPK pathway components may be organized into signaling complexes or modules. As suggested by our understanding of MAPK signaling in yeast, these complexes may be specified by direct protein-protein interactions between pathway components and/or by assembly of signaling molecules on scaffold proteins (6.Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 7.Madhani H.D. Fink G.R.

Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The recent identification of JIP-1—a scaffold protein that interacts in a specific fashion with members of the MLK family of MAPKKKs, with MKK7 but not MKK4, and with JNKs—has focused attention on complex formation mediated by a scaffold protein as one determinant of SAPK pathway signaling specificity (13.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The results reported herein confirm the direct association of DLK with JIP-1 and map the JIP-1 binding domain in DLK to the region NH2-terminal to its catalytic domain. Importantly, the DLK NH2-terminal region is required for SAPK activation induced by DLK overexpression. This result suggests that protein-protein interactions mediated through the NH2-terminal domain of DLK (and independent of DLK dimerization via its leucine zipper domain) are required for DLK-mediated SAPK activation. It remains to be determined whether disrupting DLK-JIP-1 interaction specifically is sufficient to interrupt signaling to SAPK because, as discussed above, the DLK-NH2-terminal region may participate in relevant protein-protein interactions independent of JIP-1. However, these results are consistent with the demonstration by Whitmarsh et al. (13.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) that co-expression of JIP-1 with MLK3 resulted in augmentation of overexpressed MLK3-induced SAPK activation and support the hypothesis that JIP-1-mediated SAPK module formation is necessary for DLK-dependent activation of SAPK.

Benjamin Margolis and Debra Meyers (University of Michigan) for gifts of JIP-1 antibody and JIP-1 expression plasmid, for helpful discussions, and for sharing their data before publication."

Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Following its association with DNA at a primer-template junction coated with a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RFC catalyzes the assembly of the ring-shaped PCNA (also referred to as a DNA sliding clamp (4.Huang C.C. Hearst J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4087-4094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) around the primer DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. For this reason, RFC is referred to as a clamp loader. Polδ and -ε are recruited to this protein-DNA complex and tethered to the DNA primer-template junction through their interaction with PCNA. The resulting complex (polδ or polε holoenzyme) is then capable of catalyzing highly processive DNA synthesis. The subunit structure of RFC is highly conserved in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans (5.Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It contains five subunits that range in size between 36 and 140 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.1 A). Genes encoding each of these subunits have been cloned from both mammals and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and each gene encoding each subunit has been shown to be essential in yeast by deletion analysis (5.Cullmann G.

The predicted amino acid sequence of each subunit of the yeast and human RFC reveals significant homology in seven regions commonly referred to as RFC boxes (box II–VIII) (Fig. 1,A and B) (1.Jonsson Z.O.

These two putative archaeal RFC subunits are similar to the eukaryotic RFC3 and the C-terminal region of RFC1 (Fig.1, A and B). The archaea RFC1 homologue, however, lacks box I, the DNA ligase domain, at its N-terminal region (Fig.1 A). One of the archaea for which the complete sequence has been reported isMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH (9.Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T.

M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH is an obligatory anaerobic thermophilic microorganism with an optimal growth temperature of 65–70 °C and a generation time of about 5 h (11.Zeikus J.G. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities to known RFCs, two putative RFC homologues have been identified within its genome: a RFC1 homologue with a calculated molecular mass of 54.4 kDa and 35% identity to the corresponding region in human RFC1 and a homologue of human RFC3 with a calculated molecular mass of 36.8 kDa and 22% identity to the human protein (data not shown). A homologue of PCNA has also been identified in the genome of M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH with a calculated molecular mass of 28.8 kDa and 29% identity to the human protein. In contrast to RFC homologues from other archaea (7.Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa H. Haikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. Sekine M. Baba S. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Nagai Y. Sakai M. Ogura K. Otsuka R.

In this report, we describe the isolation and the biochemical characterization of the RFC complex from the archaeon, M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cells, and the properties of the isolated RFC were studied in vitro. mthRFC contains two subunits that appear to form a heterohexamer consisting of two copies of the RFC1 subunit and four copies of the RFC3 subunit. As with RFC isolated from eukaryotic cells, mthRFC possesses a DNA-dependent ATPase activity that is stimulated by PCNA. As expected of a clamp loader, mthRFC can load the M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH homologue of PCNA around DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. It is also demonstrated that mthRFC and mthPCNA can jointly stimulate the activity of a B-type DNA polymerase of M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH. Labeled deoxy- and ribonucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Single-stranded circular (ssc) M13mp19 was from Life Technologies, Inc., φx174 sscDNA was from New England Biolabs, poly(dA)300 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, oligonucleotides were synthesized by Gene Link (Hawthorne, NY), and polynucleotides were from Supertechs (Bethesda, MD). The various pET vectors used were from Novagene. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA).Schizosaccharomyces pombe PCNA and singly primed M13 ssDNA were prepared as described previously (12.Kelman Z. Zuo S. Arroyo M.P. Wang T.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9515-9520Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as was singly nicked pBS DNA (13.Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Gulbis J.M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Burgers P.M.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2373-2381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, singly nicked pBluescript DNA was prepared by DNase I treatment in the presence of ethidium bromide. Analysis of the product by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of an equal mixture of linear and circular DNA molecules; neutral agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide indicated that the DNA had been quantitatively converted to an RF II structure. mthPolB and mthRPA were purified as described (14.Kelman Z. Pietrokovski S. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28751-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The buffers used and their composition were: buffer A, which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol; buffer B, which contained 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 500 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol; buffer C, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol; and buffer D, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. RFC1, RFC3, and PCNA genes (MTH240, MTH241, andMTH1312, respectively) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH DNA (kindly provided by John Reeve, Ohio State University) and were cloned, after sequencing, between the NdeI and XhoI (RFC1) or the NdeI and BamHI (RFC3 and PCNA) sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-16b (Novagene; called pET16-RFC1, pET16-RFC3, and pET16-PCNA). The oligonucleotide primers used in the polymerase chain reaction reactions were as follow: for the cloning of RFC1, the oligonucleotides Z102 (5′-GGGTCGACCATATGTCATGGACAGAGAAATACCGGCC-3′) and Z103 (5′-GGAAGCTTCTCGAGTTATGAGAACTGGAAGAGTGACGTC-3′), which contained NdeI and XhoI sites (underlined), respectively; for the cloning of RFC3, the oligonucleotides Z104 (5′-GGGGATCCCATATGATCATTATGAACGGACCTTGGG-3′) and Z105 (5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACTTAGGCGTGTTCAAGGAACCTTGCAAGG-3′), which contained NdeI and BamHI sites (underlined), respectively; for the cloning of PCNA, the oligonucleotides Z100 (5′-GGGGATCCCATATGTTCAAGGCAGAATTGAATGACCC-3′) and Z101 (5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACTTATTCCTCTGCCTCTATTCTTGGAGC-3′), which contained NdeI and BamHI sites (underlined), respectively. The NdeI site contains the initiation codon ATG and XhoI orBamHI sites are immediately after the stop codon. These constructs contained a His10 tag at the N terminus of their respective proteins. RFC3 was also cloned into pET-21a (Novagene; called pET21-RFC3) using the same restriction sites. A vector that expressed both subunits of RFC, RFC1, and RFC3 was generated as follows. A BglII-XhoI fragment of pET16-RFC1 that contained the entire coding region and the upstream regulatory sequences (the T7 promoter and the ribosome binding sites) was cloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET21-RFC3. Thus, though the new vector (called pET21-RFC) expressed both subunits of RFC, only the large subunit, RFC1, contained a His10tag. The PCNA gene was also cloned between the NdeI andBamHI sites of pHKEp vector (15.Kelman Z. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This construct contained a His10 tag, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase recognition motif, and a hemagglutinin epitope at the N terminus. M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH RFC1, RFC3, and PCNA proteins were overexpressed as follows: 2 liters of E. coli cells BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagene), harboring the different plasmids, were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. When the culture reached anA 600 of 0.6, protein expression was induced by incubation in the presence of 2 mm IPTG for 3 h after which time the cells were harvested. All subsequent steps used for the isolation of proteins were carried out at 4 °C. The isolation of the RFC3 subunit was carried out with 2 liters of cells (7.2 g wet weight) expressing the RFC3 subunit. Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication (five 1-min pulses using the Sonic Dismembrator 500 (Fisher Scientific)) of cells in 25 ml of buffer C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 36,000 × g, the extract (350 mg of protein) was mixed with 1 ml of nickel chelate (ProBound resin, Invitrogen) for 2 h with gentle shaking. The mixture was then poured onto a column and washed with 25 ml of buffer C containing 20 mmimidazole, and bound protein was eluted with 3 ml of buffer C containing 500 mm imidazole. The latter fraction (20 mg of protein) was dialyzed for 3–4 h against 2 liters of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. Longer periods of dialysis (12 h) resulted in marked precipitation of the protein. When the salt concentration of the dialyzing fluid was reduced to 0.3 mNaCl, the RFC3 subunit precipitated from solution after 2 h of dialysis. The isolation of the RFC1 subunit was carried out with 2 liters of cells (6.8 g wet weight) expressing the RFC1 subunit. In contrast to the expression of RFC3, RFC1 was not soluble under the conditions that were used for the extraction of RFC3 from cells. For this reason, the isolation of RFC1 was carried out in the presence of urea as follows: bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in 25 ml of buffer C containing 6m urea as described for the isolation of RFC3. After centrifugation for 20 min at 36,000 × g, the extract (300 mg of protein) was mixed with 1 ml of nickel chelate (ProBound resin, Invitrogen) for 2 h with gentle shaking. The mixture was then loaded onto a column, washed with 2.5 ml of buffer C containing 6m urea and 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with 3 ml of buffer C containing 6 m urea plus 500 mmimidazole. The protein eluted in this step (3 mg) was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer A containing 6 murea. The two-subunit RFC complex was isolated from 12 liters of E. coli cells (14.4 g wet weight) containing the plasmid pET21-RFC. The simultaneous expression of both RFC1 and RFC3 resulted in the detection of soluble RFC1 as well as soluble RFC3. Cells were suspended in 50 ml of buffer C and sonicated as described above. After centrifugation for 20 min at 36,000 × g, the soluble extract (1.02 g of protein) was mixed with 2 ml of nickel chelate for 2 h with gentle shaking. The mixture was poured onto a column, washed with 25 ml of buffer C containing 20 mm imidazole and then washed with 10 ml of buffer C containing 500 mmimidazole. The protein eluted after the latter step (25 mg) was dialyzed 12 h against 2 liters of buffer A containing 500 mm KCl. No visible precipitation occurred during the dialysis step. The dialyzed material was loaded onto a 5-ml Econo-Pac CHT-II column (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer B and developed with a 50-ml linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) from 25 to 300 mm in buffer B. The protein peak, which eluted at 200 mm potassium phosphate, was pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl (see Fig. 2 C) yielding 3 mg of protein (which hydrolyzed a total of 8850 nmol of ATP/30 min at 50 °C in the presence of φX174 sscDNA in the ATPase assay described below). Dialysis against buffers containing lower salt concentrations resulted in substantial protein precipitation and loss of enzymatic activity. This fraction, which was used in all experiments described below, was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The activity associated with this fraction (measured either in the DNA-dependent ATPase or in the elongation of a singly primed M13 ssDNA template assays as described below) was stable to repeated freezing and thawing and retained its full activity after 1 year of storage at −80 °C. PCNA was purified as described above using the procedure described for the isolation of RFC3 using (7.4 g wet weight) of E. coli cells. The eluted protein fraction from the nickel chelate column (30 mg of protein) was diluted 3-fold with buffer A and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl and then developed with a 50-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 100 to 600 mm in buffer A. The pooled protein peak, which eluted at 480 mm NaCl (15.5 mg), was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl (see Fig. 4 A). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. mthPCNA containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase recognition site at its N terminus was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (16.Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mthRFC-catalyzed loading of mthPCNA onto DNA was carried out in reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 80 μg/ml BSA, 4% glycerol, 1.5 μg (0.8 pmol as molecules) of singly nicked pBluescript DNA, 4 mm ATP, 0.3 μg of mthRFC, and 3.3 pmol of32P-labeled PCNA. After 10 min of incubation at the temperature indicated in the figure legend, reaction mixtures were filtered at 4 °C through a 5-ml Bio-Gel A15 m (Bio-Rad) column preequilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 5% glycerol. The column resolved PCNA bound to DNA (eluted in the excluded volume) from PCNA in solution (eluted in the included volume). Fractions (210 μl) were collected, and the presence of PCNA was quantitated by Cerenkov counting. Under the conditions used, the loading of PCNA onto DNA was proportional to the amount of protein up to 1.0 μg of mthRFC. Above this amount of protein, PCNA loading decreased probably because of the unloading of PCNA by RFC (17.Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). mthPolB catalyzed elongation of singly primed M13 single-stranded DNA was carried out in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% BSA, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 20 μm[α-32P]dATP (0.5–2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 12 fmol of singly primed M13 DNA (primed with M13–1 primer, map position 5999–6033), either 0.25 or 0.3 m NaCl (as indicated) and other proteins as indicated in the figure legend. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 55 °C, stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and separated by electrophoresis through an alkaline agarose gel (1.5%) followed by autoradiography. For quantitation, an aliquot (2 μl) of the reaction mixture was removed, and the amount of DNA synthesis was measured by adsorption to DE81 paper. ATPase assays were carried out in reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3–5 × 103 cpm/pmol) and DNAs and proteins as indicated in the figure legends. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 50 °C and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine (PEI) Cellulose F plates (EM Sciences, Gibbstown, NJ) using the solvent 0.5 m LiCl plus 1 m HCOOH, which readily separated Pi from ATP. The hydrolysis of different nucleoside triphosphates by mthRFC was carried out under similar assay conditions in the presence or absence of 110 ng of φx174 sscDNA and 50 μm [α-32P]ribo- or deoxynucleoside triphosphates. To demonstrate that the enzymatic activities observed with preparations of mthRFC were not because of contamination with E. coli proteins, a portion of the purified protein fraction (HiTrap-Q column fraction, 90 μg in 100 μl buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl) was applied to a Superdex-200 gel-filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and analyzed for the presence of RFC protein and activity. The distribution of RFC was detected following 12% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). Two assays were used to followed the elution of RFC. One assay measured the RFC and PCNA-dependent replication of singly primed M13 ssDNA by mthPolB (using 0.5 μl of each fraction diluted 10 and 100-fold in buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl). Reaction mixtures were as described for the elongation of singly primed M13 DNA template by mthPolB and contained 250 mm NaCl, 250 ng PCNA, 0.65 μg mthRPA, 12 fmol of singly primed M13 ssDNA, and 0.576 pmol of mthPolB. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and analyzed as described above. The second enzymatic assay used measured the RFC-catalyzed hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP (RFC-catalyzed hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates). An aliquot (1 μl) of each fraction from the Superdex-200 column was incubated in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 110 ng of φx174 sscDNA for 30 min at 50 °C. Gel-filtration analysis was also used to determine the oligomeric structure of mthPCNA. Ninety μg of mthPCNA or S. pombePCNA in 100 μl of buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl (10 μm PCNA as trimer) was applied to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Fractions (250 μl) were collected, and the elution profile of PCNA was determined following 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of each fraction (20 μl) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). To determine whether the dimeric mthRFC isolated was an enzymatically active complex and whether its biochemical properties are similar to those of RFC isolated from eukaryotic cells, its subunits (RFC1 and RFC3) as well as the complex were purified and characterized. The PCNA homologue from M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH was also purified. The genes encoding RFC1 and RFC3 (open reading frames MTH240 and MTH241, respectively (9.Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y. Wierzbowski J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar)) were inserted individually and together into E. coli expression vectors and expressed as fusion proteins containing N-terminal His10 tags (see “Experimental Procedures”). The RFC complex, containing both subunits, was soluble and was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography onto Ni-chelate and hydroxyapatite columns (see Fig.2 C). RFC3 alone was marginally soluble in the presence of 500 mm NaCl, though it precipitated following prolonged dialysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nevertheless, RFC3 was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel chelate beads, which resulted in the isolation of a single protein band of 39 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). This purified protein fraction was used to generate polyclonal antibodies against RFC3. E. coli-expressed RFC1, on the other hand, was completely insoluble and could be extracted from cells only in the presence of 6 m urea. RFC1 was purified to near homogeneity following chromatography on nickel chelate beads in the presence of 6 m urea and yielded a protein of 57 kDa (Fig.2 B, lane 6). Attempts to solubilize RFC1 by dialysis against decreasing levels of urea (2 h periods each against 4 and 2 m urea) were unsuccessful. Whereas soluble material was observed after dialysis against 4 m urea, marked precipitation occurred during dialysis against 2 m urea. Attempts to form a soluble complex by mixing RFC1 and RFC3 in 6m urea, followed by dialysis against decreasing levels of urea were unsuccessful. The observations that the two individual subunits were either not soluble or marginally soluble when each was expressed alone, but were soluble as a complex, support the idea that they work together. The coexpression of both mthRFC subunits resulted in a two-subunit complex that could be purified to homogeneity. Gel filtration analysis of the pooled hydroxyapatite fraction of the RFC complex yielded a single protein peak that contained both ATPase activity and DNA synthetic activity, which depended upon mthPCNA and mthPolB (both activities peaked at fraction 45 (Fig. 3 A)). These two activities coeluted from the sizing column at a position corresponding to a complex of molecular mass of 260 kDa (Fig. 3 B) and a Stokes radius of 60Å based on comparison to globular standards. SDS-PAGE analysis of the gel filtration fractions revealed that the peak of RFC activity described above eluted at a position coincidental with both RFC subunits (Fig. 3 C). Antibodies prepared against the RFC3 subunit were used to verify that the observed 37-kDa protein band was RFC3 and not a breakdown product derived from the 57-kDa RFC1 protein (data not presented). Glycerol gradient centrifugation of the pooled hydroxyapatite fraction of the mthRFC complex also indicated that both subunits sedimented coincidentally with the enzymatic activities described above. The peak of mthRFC protein and its associated enzymatic activities sedimented at 11.4 S (data not presented). Based on comparisons to globular standards, this S value corresponded to a molecular mass of about 250 kDa. Using the Stokes radius, the S value, and assuming that the mthRFC complex possesses a partial specific volume of 0.725 ml/g, the molecular mass was estimated to be 290 kDa with a frictional ratio of 1.4 (18.Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The latter calculation suggests a roughly globular conformation for the mthRFC complex. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel shown in Fig. 2 C, was scanned, and the relative concentration of each subunit present in the purified mt"

A C-terminal fragment of mouse FKHR (residues 208–652) that contains the transcription activation domain fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain potently stimulated Gal4 promoter activity.

Neither site is required for insulin inhibition of promoter activity stimulated by the FKHR fragment, and overexpression of Akt does not inhibit FKHR fragment-stimulated Gal4 promoter activity. These results suggest that insulin- and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent phosphorylation of another site in the fragment by a kinase different from PKB/Akt inhibits transcription activation by the fragment.

Phosphorylation of this site also may be involved in insulin inhibition of transcription activation by full-length FKHR, but only after phosphorylation of Ser-253 by PKB/Akt. insulin-like growth factor-binding protein insulin-like growth factor insulin-response element phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase protein kinase B forkhead rhabdomyosarcoma transcription factor mouse FKHR cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction myristylated The insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs)1 are a family of six proteins that bind IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity and modulate their growth-promoting and other biological activities (1.Rechler M.M.

IGFBP-1 is distinctive among the IGFBPs in that its plasma levels are dynamically regulated in response to hormonal or metabolic changes, being increased in diabetes and fasting, and normalized by insulin treatment or refeeding, respectively (5.Lee P.D.

IGFBP-1 is thought to play a role in glucose homeostasis by inhibiting the insulin-like effects of IGF-I and IGF-II (5.Lee P.D. Giudice L.C. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

It acts primarily at the level of transcription, rapidly inhibiting IGFBP-1 transcription in diabetic rat liver (8.Ooi G.T. Tseng L.Y. Tran M.Q. Rechler M.M. Mol.

Similar IREs have been identified in other genes whose expression is negatively regulated by insulin. Single copies of the IRE are present in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, tyrosine aminotransferase, and apolipoprotein CIII genes (reviewed in Refs. 16.O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol.

When the present studies were begun, the transcription factor that binds to the IRE and mediates insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 promoter activity had not been identified. One candidate, the forkhead transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β, bound to the IRE and stimulated IGFBP-1 promoter activity in NIH-3T3 cells (19.Unterman T.G. Fareeduddin A.

An important clue to its identity came from recent studies in Caenorhabditis elegans. The inhibition of IGFBP-1 gene expression by insulin in rat hepatocytes and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells appears to be mediated by a signal transduction pathway that involves the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) (21.Band C.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the serine-threonine protein kinase, protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt (22.Cichy S.B.

In C. elegans, the transcription factor DAF-16 is negatively regulated by a signaling pathway that includes an insulin-like receptor (DAF-2), the p110 catalytic subunit of PI-3 kinase (AGE-1), and PKB/Akt (AKT1/AKT2) (23.Ogg S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Mutations in DAF-2, AGE-1, or AKT-1/AKT-2 interrupt the normal developmental program, causing growth arrest, a metabolic shift to fat storage, increased longevity, and suppressed reproduction. Mutations in DAF-16, which by themselves have no effect, can reverse the effects of mutations in these genes, restoring normal growth, metabolism, reproduction, and lifespan. Daf-16 is a member of the forkhead rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR) subfamily of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (“winged helix”) family of transcription factors (27.Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10421-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28.Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It is homologous to three human transcription factors: FKHR (29.Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), FKHR-L1/AF6q21 (30.Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K.

Regulation of DAF-16 by a PI-3 kinase-PKB/Akt signaling pathway inC. elegans raised the possibility that an FKHR-like protein also might mediate insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 promoter activity in mammalian liver. Using a mouse FKHR cDNA clone that is orthologous to human FKHR (34.Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), we show that mFKHR stimulates IGFBP-1 promoter activity in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells and that insulin inhibits this stimulation. A C-terminal mFKHR fragment (amino acids 208–652), which contains the transactivation domain fused to a Gal4-DNA binding domain, stimulates Gal4 promoter activity; insulin also inhibits this stimulation. Insulin inhibition of Gal4 promoter activity stimulated by the mFKHR fragment is dependent on PI-3 kinase but does not require the two consensus PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites in the fragment and is not mimicked by constitutively active PKB/Akt. LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI-3 kinase (35.Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell.

All restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Taqpolymerase was obtained from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Bovine pancreatic insulin was purchased from Sigma; human recombinant insulin (Humulin U-100 regular) was obtained from Eli Lilly & Co. (Indianapolis, IN). H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (10.Ooi G.T.

Cultures were passaged twice weekly (when they reached confluence) at a ratio of 1:10 using trypsin-EDTA. Fresh stocks were thawed after 8–10 passages. The rat IGFBP-1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (p925GL3) was constructed by excising the promoter fragment (nucleotides -925 to +79 with respect to the transcription start site) from pA3LUC (13.Suh D.S. Ooi G.T. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and inserting it into the HindIII site of pGL3basic (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). pCMV5/c-myc-mFKHR (henceforth referred to as pCMV5-FKHR) contains the entire 652 amino acid coding region of mouse FKHR ((34); GenBankTM accession number AF126056), which is 92% identical to human FKHR and identical in the forkhead DNA binding domain (residues 155–255) (29.Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged wild-type Akt (pCEFL-HA-Akt) or the membrane-targeted myristylated mutant (pCEFL-myr-HA-Akt) was inserted into the pCEFL expression vector (37.Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by J.S. Gutkind (NIDCR, NIH). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting pRSV-β-galactosidase (kindly provided by P. Yen, NIDDK). For Gal4 promoter assays (38.Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene) was used. It contains a CMV promoter, five copies of the Gal4 binding element, and a luciferase reporter. The activation domains to be tested were inserted into pFA-CMV-EcoRV, modified from pFA-CMV (Stratagene) by insertion of an EcoRV linker between the BamHI and XbaI sites. C-terminal fragments (208–652) of mouse FKHR (wild-type or containing S253A or S316A mutations) were obtained by PCR amplification of the corresponding pCMV5-FKHR plasmids (34.Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) using the sense primer, 5′-CGTAGATATCAATTCAATTCGCCACAATCTG-3′; and the antisense primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGCCTGACACCCAGCTGTG-3′. Shorter C-terminal FKHR fragments (256–652 and 317–652) were generated using the sense primers 5′-CGTAGATATCAACAACAGTAAATTTGCTAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CGTAGATATCAATGCTAGTACCATCAGTGGG-3′, respectively, and the same antisense primer. The PCR fragments were digested with EcoRV and XbaI and sequentially ligated into the EcoRV and XbaI sites of pFA-CMV-EcoRV to generate pFA-FKHR 208–652, pFA-FKHR 256–652, and pFA-FKHR 317–652 constructs. In some experiments, plasmids pM3 and pM3VP16 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone or fused to amino acids 411–455 of the herpes simplex viral protein, were transfected as controls. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed using a Rhodamine fluorescent terminator sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence analysis was kindly performed by George Poy (NIDDK). H4IIE cells were transfected as described previously (39.Suh D.S. Zhou Y. Ooi G.T. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1227-1237PubMed Google Scholar). The day before transfection, cells (1.75–8 million/dish) were plated onto 6-cm tissue culture dishes in 3 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% serum and were typically 70–100% confluent at the time of transfection. DEAE dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) stock solution (2 mg/ml in 0.15m NaCl) was diluted with an equal volume of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4). Plasmid DNA (100 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of DEAE dextran-Tris-buffered saline and incubated at room temperature. After 15 min, 190 μl of the mixture was added to each dish and, 15 min later, 3 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% serum was added and the incubation continued overnight. After medium change and a second overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with or without insulin (bovine insulin (1 μg/ml) or recombinant human insulin (0.25 or 1 μg/ml) as indicated). The cells were harvested for luciferase assay after a 24-h incubation. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After the addition of 360 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100), cells were scraped and centrifuged (4 °C, 14,000 rpm, 15 min). The supernatant (100 μl) was added to assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP) and assayed immediately after the addition of d-Luciferine (Biosynth, Naperville, IL) using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Germany). β-Galactosidase in cell lysates was assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Bedford, MA). In later experiments, luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured in the same tube using the Dual Light chemiluminescent reporter gene assay kit (Tropix, PE Applied Biosystems) as specified by the manufacturer, allowing 1 h at room temperature for luciferin fluorescence to decay before measuring β-galactosidase activity. Assays were performed in duplicate. Total RNA was prepared from H4IIE cells using the acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (40.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (10.Ooi G.T. Brown D.R. Suh D.S. Tseng L.Y. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16664-16672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized at 42 °C (41.Brown A.L. Graham D.E. Nissley S.P. Hill D.J. Strain A.J. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13144-13150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a full-length rat IGFBP-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number M89791) probe prepared by PCR amplification (10.Ooi G.T. Brown D.R. Suh D.S. Tseng L.Y. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16664-16672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was labeled by random priming using a Prim-It kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Autoradiographs and photographs of gels stained with ethidium bromide were scanned, and the images were analyzed using the software program NIH Image 1.61/ppc (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The effect of overexpressing FKHR on IGFBP-1 promoter activity was determined in transient transfection experiments. H4IIE cells were cotransfected with the mouse FKHR expression plasmid (pCMV5-FKHR) and an IGFBP-1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (p925GL3) (Fig. 1). FKHR increased IGFBP-1 promoter activity to 336 ± 52% (S.D., n= 5) of the activity in cells cotransfected with control plasmid. Insulin inhibited FKHR-stimulated IGFBP-1 promoter activity by 70 ± 5% (S.D., n = 5), similar to the 76 ± 4% inhibition observed in the absence of FKHR overexpression. To determine the mechanism by which insulin inhibits FKHR-stimulated IGFBP-1 promoter activity, we used a yeast Gal4 promoter system (38.Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 42.Sadowski I. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in which DNA binding is determined by recognition of a Gal4 binding element so that differences in Gal4 promoter activity are determined by the transcription activation domain that is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. H4IIE cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing a luciferase gene coupled to five copies of the Gal4 binding element and activation plasmids in which the Gal4 DNA binding domain was fused to a C-terminal fragment of mouse FKHR (amino acids 208–652) that contains the activation domain. This fragment corresponds to the fragment of the human FKHR gene (residues 211–655) that was identified in a human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma fused to the DNA binding domain of Pax3 following chromosomal translocation (29.Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Expression of proteins containing the human FKHR fragment fused to the Pax3 (or Gal4) DNA binding domain stimulated promoter activity in different cell lines (43.Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Bennicelli J.L. Fredericks W.J. Wilson R.B. Rauscher III, F.J. Barr F.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Sublett J.E. Jeon I.S. Shapiro D.N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 545-552PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, proteins in which the mouse FKHR C-terminal fragment was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain potently activated the Gal4 promoter in H4IIE cells (Fig.2). Insulin inhibited promoter activity by 69 ± 4% (S.D., n = 4) in cells that were transfected with pFA-FKHR 208–652, indicating that this fragment contains the necessary sites for insulin inhibition of FKHR-stimulated promoter activity. The effect of specific inhibitors of PI-3 kinase (LY294002) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (PD98059) on insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance in H4IIE cells was determined by Northern blotting (Fig. 3, A and B). In the absence of inhibitors, incubation with insulin (5 h, 1 μg/ml) decreased IGFBP-1 mRNA levels by 96 ± 1% (S.E.,n = 4). Insulin inhibition was not affected by incubation with PD98059 (91 ± 4% inhibition, S.E.,n = 4). By contrast, inhibition by insulin was greatly decreased (to 28 ± 8%, S.E., n = 4) in cells incubated with LY294002. 2Similar results were obtained in preliminary experiments by Matthew Poy and Guck Ooi. These results indicate that PI-3 kinase mediates insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 mRNA in H4IIE cells and that mitogen-activated protein kinase is not involved in the inhibition. LY294002 also abolished insulin inhibition of Gal4 promoter activity stimulated by the C-terminal FKHR fragment (Fig. 3 C). In the absence of inhibitor, luciferase activity in H4IIE cells transfected with pFA-FKHR 208–652 was 36 ± 11% (S.D., n = 6) of the activity in the absence of insulin. By contrast, no significant decrease in luciferase activity was observed following insulin treatment in cells that had been preincubated with LY294002 (103 ± 16%; S.D., n = 6). These results indicate that PI-3 kinase also is involved in insulin inhibition of Gal4 promoter activity stimulated by the C-terminal FKHR fragment. As PKB/Akt acts downstream of PI-3 kinase to mediate insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 promoter activity (22.Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we examined whether cotransfection of constitutively active myr Akt would mimic insulin and inhibit the stimulation of Gal4 promoter activity by the C-terminal FKHR fragment (Fig.4). Cotransfection of pCEFL-HA-myr-Akt with pFA-FKHR 208–652 and the Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmid did not significantly decrease Gal4 promoter activity in the absence of insulin, compared with cotransfection with pCEFL empty vector or pCEFL-HA-Akt (wild-type), and promoter activity was inhibited to the same extent by insulin. By contrast, in parallel experiments, cotransfection of pCEFL-HA-myr-Akt markedly inhibited the stimulation of IGFBP-1 promoter activity by full-length FKHR. 3pCEFL-myr-Akt inhibited IGFBP-1 promoter activity to a greater extent than maximally effective concentrations of insulin. This suggests that overexpression of Akt may act more efficiently or by additional mechanisms than insulin. Despite the marked inhibition of promoter activity by pCEFL-myr-Akt, insulin treatment resulted in further inhibition. This may reflect the fact that although myristylation localizes Akt to the plasma membrane where it can be phosphorylated by PDK-1, activation of PI-3 kinase by insulin enhances the activation of PDK-1, resulting in increased phosphorylation and activation of Akt (56.Leevers S.J.

Thus, overexpression of Akt inhibits transcription activation by full-length FKHR but not by the C-terminal FKHR fragment. Two of the three potential PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites (46.Alessi D.R.

Phosphorylation of both sites by a PI-3 kinase/PKB-Akt pathway has been demonstrated in vitro andin vivo (34.Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol.

To determine whether these sites are required for insulin inhibition of Gal4 promoter activity, we mutated Ser-253 or Ser-316 to Ala in the FKHR 208–652 fragment. Neither mutation significantly reduced insulin inhibition compared with wild-type FKHR 208–652. Insulin inhibition also was not affected when Ser-253 was deleted in the shorter C-terminal FKHR fragment (256–652). These results indicate that Ser-253 and Ser-316 are not required for insulin inhibition of Gal4 promoter activity stimulated by C-terminal FKHR fragments. To exclude the possibility that one of the two sites might be sufficient for insulin inhibition with the second site compensating for the mutated or deleted site, we also examined two constructs in which both sites were deleted or mutated, FKHR 256–652/S316A and FKHR 317–652 (Fig. 5). Insulin inhibition still was observed. We conclude that neither PKB/Akt site is required for insulin inhibition of promoter activity in the C-terminal FKHR fragment. FKHR or a closely related protein is a promising candidate to be the transcription factor in H4IIE cells that binds to the IRE and is responsible for the inhibition of IGFBP-1 promoter activity by insulin. Mouse FKHR stimulates IGFBP-1 promoter activity in H4IIE cells 2–3-fold. FKHR binds to the IGFBP-1 IRE, and an intact IRE is required for FKHR stimulation of IGFBP-1 promoter activity (48.Durham S.K.

FKHR-like mRNA was detected in H4IIE cells by reverse transcription PCR. 4Reverse transcription PCR of H4IIE mRNA using primers from the 3′-end of mouse FKHR amplified a fragment of the predicted size (M. Tomizawa, unpublished results). This region is more highly conserved in human FKHR (29.Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) than in the other two human members of the FKHR subfamily, FKHR-L1 (30.Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C.

During review and revision of this manuscript, several other groups reported similar stimulation of IGFBP-1 promoter activity by full-length FKHR or the related protein, AFX, and inhibition of FKHR-stimulated promoter activity by insulin or constitutively active PKB/Akt (48.Durham S.K.

To analyze the mechanism for insulin inhibition of FKHR-stimulated IGFBP-1 promoter activity, we have studied the activation of a Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmid by a C-terminal fragment of mFKHR (amino acids 208–652) fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain. DNA binding is based on recognition of the Gal4 binding element. The C-terminal mFKHR fragment contains the transcription activation domain and part of the forkhead domain (residues 155–255). 5The complete forkhead domain must be present, however, to form the winged-helix conformation that is necessary for DNA binding (61.Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 62.Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). As previously reported for the corresponding fragment of human FKHR (residues 211–655) (43.Fredericks W.J. Galili N.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 545-552PubMed Google Scholar), mFKHR 208–652 potently stimulated Gal4 promoter activity. Insulin inhibited the stimulation of Gal4 promoter activity by the mFKHR 208–652 fragment by ∼70%. This demonstrates that the C-terminal FKHR fragment contains the information necessary for insulin inhibition of FKHR-stimulated transcription. By contrast, insulin did not inhibit the stimulation of Gal4 promoter activity by a C-terminal fragment (comparable to mFKHR 256–652) of another member of the FKHR subfamily, AFX, in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress insulin receptors (49.Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. De Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). This difference may reflect the low conservation of nucleotide sequences in the transactivation domains of FKHR and AFX or the different cell contexts. Inhibition of FKHR-stimulated gene transcription in H4IIE cells by insulin is initiated by binding to the insulin receptor; H4IIE cells lack IGF-I receptors with which insulin might cross-react (9.Orlowski C.C.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13958-13963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 transcription does not require new protein synthesis (10.Ooi G.T. Brown D.R. Suh D.S. Tseng L.Y. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16664-16672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that inhibition results from post-translational events such as altering the phosphorylation state of FKHR. PI-3 kinase appears to be involved in transmission of the signal from the insulin receptor to IGFBP-1. The PI-3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, greatly reduced insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance, as previously seen in rat hepatocytes (21.Band C.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and HepG2 cells (22.Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). LY294002 also abolished insulin inhibition of mFKHR fragment-stimulated Gal4 promoter activity, indicating that insulin regulation of promoter activity also was PI-3 kinase-dependent. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was not involved. PKB/Akt is the best characterized downstream effector of PI-3 kinase (54.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 55.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKB/Akt inhibited IGFBP-1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells, and a kinase-dead mutant of PKB/Akt blocked insulin inhibition (22.Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 expression was mediated by PI-3 kinase activation of PKB/Akt. PKB/Akt is translocated to the nucleus of cells that had been incubated with IGF-I (57.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the kinase might directly phosphorylate FKHR. The FKHR-related proteins have three conserved PKB/Akt consensus phosphorylation sites (RXRXXS/T) (46.Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) located at sites equivalent to Thr-24, Ser-253, and Ser-316 of mFKHR. These sites become phosphorylated after incubation with insulin or IGF-I, or overexpression of PKB/Akt (34.Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 47.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol.

Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). Mutation of all three PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites in FKHR abolished the inhibition of FKHR-stimulated activity of promoters containing one or more copies of the IRE by insulin or myr Akt (50.Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 51.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). These results suggest that phosphorylation of one or more of the PKB/Akt sites in full-length FKHR, most likely by PKB/Akt, decreases the stimulation of promoter activity by FKHR. Our results with the C-terminal mFKHR 208–652 fragment are quite different. Neither of the two consensus PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites in the fragment, Ser-253 or Ser-316, is required for insulin inhibition of promoter activity. Mutation or deletion of one or both of these sites did not affect insulin inhibition, indicating that insulin inhibits the stimulation of Gal4 promoter activity by C-terminal mFKHR fragments by modifying sites other than the two PKB/Akt sites in the fragment. Moreover, overexpression of PKB/Akt by transfection of myr Akt did not significantly decrease Gal4 promoter activity by mFKHR 208–652 in the absence of insulin compared with transfection with wild-type Akt or empty vector. By contrast, in the same experiments, cotransfection with myr Akt profoundly decreased the stimulation of IGFBP-1 promoter activity by full-length mFKHR. These results suggest that, in contrast to full-length mFKHR, insulin inhibition of transactivation by the C-terminal FKHR fragment does not involve the two PKB/Akt consensus phosphorylation sites or phosphorylation by PKB/Akt. It is tempting to speculate that the mechanism responsible for insulin inhibition of transcription by the C-terminal FKHR fragment also may be involved in the inhibition of transcription by full-length FKHR. We propose that the presumed phosphorylation site (not Ser-253 or Ser-316) that is responsible for insulin inhibition of transcription activation by FKHR 208–652 is accessible to an insulin-responsive kinase, whereas this site only becomes accessible to the kinase in full-length FKHR after a cascade of phosphorylations (probably initiated by phosphorylation of Ser-253 by PKB/Akt (34.Nakae J.

The insulin-responsive kinase is PI-3 kinase-dependent but distinct from PKB/Akt. Consistent with this proposal, Nakae et al. 6J. Nakae, V. Barr, and D. Accili, submitted for publication. have shown that Ser-253 is the gatekeeper for phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-316 in full-length mFKHR and that Thr-24 is phosphorylated by a different kinase than Ser-253. Insulin inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression also requires a downstream effector of PI-3 kinase that is distinct from PKB/Akt, the atypical protein kinase Cλ, and the small GTPase Rac (59.Kotani K.

Studies are in progress to identify the site in the mFKHR 208–652 fragment whose phosphorylation in response to insulin decreases transcriptional activity and the kinase that is responsible for this phosphorylation. The molecular mechanism for insulin inhibition of FKHR-stimulated promoter activity remains unclear. FKHR-L1 (58.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C.

Insulin causes a similar redistribution of mFKHR in hepatocytes.6 Export of FKHR to the cytoplasm could account for the decrease in FKHR-stimulated promoter activity after treatment with insulin or IGF-I. We do not know whether the C-terminal mFKHR fragments used in the present study undergo a similar redistribution after incubation with insulin. Even if FKHR fragments are exported to the cytoplasm following insulin treatment as is full-length FKHR, insulin still may induce a parallel direct inhibition of FKHR-stimulated transcription. Transcriptional activity of Pho4, a transcription factor in budding yeast that activates the expression of genes in response to phosphate starvation, is determined by four distinct phosphorylation sites that regulate nuclear import, nuclear export, and transcription activation (60.Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To completely shut off Pho4-mediated transcription, phosphorylation of both the sites that regulate nuclear localization and the site that regulates transactivation is required, indicating that several independent mechanisms play essential roles in regulating the transcriptional activity of Pho4.

This cell wall has a unique structure, consisting of three covalently linked polymers: peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan (AG),1 and mycolic acid (4.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan is attached to AG via a phosphodiester bridge (5.McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About two-thirds of the nonreducing termini of the AG polysaccharide are esterified with mycolic acids (6.McNeil M.

This covalently linked skeleton of cell wall is often described as the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex. One of the most remarkable features of the mycobacterial cell wall is that up to 60% of its weight is composed of lipids, including mycolic acids. In addition to lipids in the covalently linked skeleton, several types of “extractable lipids” are present in various mycobacterial species, including trehalose-containing glycolipids, phenolic glycolipids, glycopeptidolipids (GPLs), lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and triacylglycerols (TAGs) (4.Brennan P.J.

Mycolic acids are long, complex α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids that are unique to mycobacteria and the closely related genera (3.Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Nikaido H. Ratledge C. Dale J.W.

They constitute the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer of cell wall and have extremely low fluidity (3.Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Nikaido H. Ratledge C. Dale J.W.

It is this nature of mycolic acids that accounts for the exceptionally low permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall and explains, in large part, the natural resistance of mycobacteria to many antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents (1.Jarlier V. Nikaido H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2.Jarlier V. Nikaido H. J.

Blackwell Science, Oxford1999: 220-239Crossref Google Scholar). This mycolic acid-based permeability barrier also shields mycobacteria from environmental stress and contributes to disease persistence during infection (12.Barry III, C.E. Mdluli K. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 275-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, mycolic acid-containing glycolipids such as trehalose dimycolate (cord factor) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (9.Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 13.Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbial Physiol. 1998; 39: 132-203Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of mycolic acids has been the focus of intense research for a number of years, primarily because of the presumption that enzymes involved in the synthesis of this unusual lipid are attractive targets for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents. Identifying new drug targets is now particularly important in view of the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (14.World Health Organization Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1997Google Scholar) and the increasing association of atypical mycobacteria such as theMycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex with AIDS patients (15.Shafran S.D. Singer J. Zarowny D.P. Phillips P. Salit I. Walmsley S.L. Fong I.W. Gill M.J. Rachlis A.R. Lalonde R.G. Fanning M.M. Tsoukas C.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acids, we recently isolated a mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis that had a defect in the synthesis of mycolic acids (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This mutant, 155NS1, was generated by chemical-induced random mutagenesis of the wild type (WT) strain mc2-155. The 155NS1 mutant was unable to synthesize full-length mycolic acids and accumulated a series of β-hydroxymeromycolates with sizes ranging from 36 to 48 carbons (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This mutant was more permeable than the WT strain to hydrophobic agents and exhibited hypersensitivity to various hydrophobic compounds such as novobiocin, rifampicin, erythromycin, and crystal violet. Also, this mutant was temperature-sensitive;i.e. although it grew at a normal rate at 30 °C, it did not show any visible growth at 37 °C. In this work, the structure and composition of the cell wall of this mutant were studied in detail. We show that the β-hydroxymeromycolates that accumulate in the mutant strain are covalently attached to AG of the cell wall, but they do not form highly organized structural domains, and that mutant cells have an abnormal colony morphology and cell wall ultrastructure. The strain 155NS1 is a mycolic acid-defective mutant of M. smegmatismc2-155 isolated previously (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since this mutant cannot grow at 37 °C, strains 155NS1 and mc2-155 both were grown at 30 °C in all experiments described in this study. Mycobacteria were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 10% Middlebrook OADC enrichment (Difco). Cells were harvested at midexponential phase. The isolation and purification of cell wall were as described previously (10.Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17.Nikaido H. Kim S.-H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, mycobacterial cells were disrupted by sonication, and the cell wall fraction was separated from the cytoplasmic membrane by centrifugation in a sucrose step gradient. It was previously shown that this method minimized contamination from the cytoplasmic membrane (17.Nikaido H. Kim S.-H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Purified cell wall (0.75 g, wet weight) was extracted twice with 10 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) for 1 h at 50 °C, which released the extractable lipids including GPLs, LOSs, and PIMs. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by TLC (see below). Delipidated cell wall was treated twice with 2% SDS in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 90 °C for 1 h and each time pelleted at 10,000 × g for 30 min, which removed most proteins and lipoarabinomannan. The cell wall pellet was then washed successively with water, 80% acetone, and acetone to remove SDS. The resulting insoluble cell wall matrix is known as the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in WT cells, in which all soluble proteins, extractable lipids, and carbohydrates were removed (6.McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we did not know whether the β-hydroxymeromycolates in the mutant strain were attached to the cell wall, we referred to this fraction of cell wall as the insoluble cell wall matrix. A previously described reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was applied for quantitative analysis of mycolates and meromycolates. Saponification and derivatization of fatty acids withp-bromophenacyl bromide were performed as described previously (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All TLC analysis was performed on Whatman silica gel 60 plates. For analysis of mycolic acids and meromycolates, samples were saponified and methylated, and the fatty acid methyl esters were separated using hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1, v/v) as the developing solvent (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lipids extracted by chloroform/methanol were analyzed by two-dimensional TLC using the following developing systems (19.Marques M.A.M. Chitale S. Brennan P.J. Pessolani M.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2625-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett J.H. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E.

For analysis of GPLs and LOSs, TLC was developed with chloroform/methanol/water (100:14:0.8) and chloroform/methanol/water (60:12:1), respectively (8.Ortalo-Magné A. Lemassu A.

For staining of all lipids, TLC plates were either sprayed with 5% phosphomolybdic acid (24.Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or dipped briefly in 10% sulfuric acid in ethanol followed by heating. Sugar-containing lipids were detected by α-naphthol spray (25.Jacin H. Mishkin A.R. J. Chromatogr. 1965; 18: 170-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids containing free amino groups were detected by spraying with 0.25% ninhydrin in 1-butanol/acetic acid (96:4) and then heating at 110 °C for 5 min. The insoluble cell wall matrix, defined above as the product remaining after extraction with chloroform/methanol and SDS, was subjected to Smith degradation by a method previously described (6.McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell wall was sonicated to a fine suspension in 10 ml of 0.1 m NaIO4 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and kept in the dark for 5 days. After extensive washing in water, the insoluble residue was reduced by stirring with 130 mg of NaBH4 in 10 ml of water for 5 h. The reaction mixture was titrated to pH 5 with acetic acid, pelleted, and treated with 1 n HCl at room temperature overnight. The insoluble residue was washed with water and extracted with CHCl3. The CHCl3-soluble products were subjected to analysis by electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy. MALDI mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm. Linear DE mode was used for acquiring MS spectra. The accelerating voltage was 20 kV. MALDI-MS spectra were acquired in a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix. For the sample preparation, 1 μl of sample in CHCl3 was mixed with 1 μl of 10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in CHCl3 and methanol (1:1), and 1 μl of mixture was applied on the sample plate and allowed to evaporate to dryness in air. ESI-MS spectra were acquired on an API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Thornhill, Canada) fitted with an articulated pneumatically assisted nebulization probe. Samples were introduced into the electrospray ionization source at a flow rate of 30 μl/min using a liquid chromatography pump. The electrospray needle was operated at −3.8 kV, orifice voltage was set at −50 V, and nitrogen was used as the nebulization gas. All mass spectra were obtained at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Molecular Medicine Research Center, University of Toronto. The AG polysaccharide was released from the peptidoglycan as described (18.Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insoluble cell wall matrix was treated with 2 n NaOH for 16 h at 80 °C. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation (27,000 ×g, 30 min) was neutralized with acetic acid and dialyzed to remove salt. The supernatant was brought to 80% with ethanol and kept at −20 °C to precipitate AG. The AG was solubilized in 0.5 ml of D2O, and the nondissolved materials were removed.1H NMR was performed on a Varian UNITYplus NMR (500 MHz) (NMR Laboratory, Molecular Medicine Research Center, University of Toronto). The D2O signal at 4.773 ppm at 25 °C was used as the internal standard for assignment. Preparation of specimens was as described previously (26.Mdluli K. Swanson J. Fischer E. Lee R.E. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde and postfixed in Karnovsky's 0.5% OsO4, 0.8% K3Fe(CN)6 followed by 1% tannic acid. Cells were stained with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut with an RMC MT-7000 ultramicrotome, poststained first in 1% uranyl acetate and then in Reynold's lead citrate. Electron microscopy was performed with a Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV (Microscopy Branch, Rocky Mountain Laboratories of NIAID, National Institutes of Health). DSC measurement was performed as described previously (10.Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11.Liu J.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the β-hydroxymeromycolates were accumulated in the 155NS1 mutant (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine any potential involvement of the meromycolates in the cell wall function, the localization of meromycolates in mutant cells was determined, which was achieved by fractionating the cell wall into several components and analyzing for the presence of meromycolates in these different materials. We first examined whether the meromycolates present in the cell wall of the mutant could be extracted with chloroform/methanol. Equal amounts of the extractable lipid fractions and the delipidated cell wall suspensions were saponified, derivatized quantitatively withp-bromophenacyl bromide, and analyzed by a reversed phase HPLC (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of meromycolates in various fractions was obtained directly from the integrated peak areas compared with that of an internal standard (e.g. oleic acid). Results showed that 48% of the meromycolate residues in the original cell wall of the mutant were found in the organic phase, compared with 32% of mycolic acids in the cell wall of the WT strain in parallel experiments. We further examined whether the meromycolates are present in the insoluble cell wall matrix of the mutant. TLC showed that upon saponification and extraction with CHCl3, β-hydroxymeromycolates were released from the insoluble cell wall matrix of the mutant, in amounts comparable with that of mycolic acids released from the WT cell wall (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the β-hydroxymeromycolates accumulated in the mutant were attached to the cell wall, presumably by a linkage to AG. No meromycolates were detected in the growth medium (data not shown). To obtain direct evidence for the attachment of meromycolates at the cell wall skeleton, the insoluble cell wall matrix of the mutant was subjected to the Smith degradation reaction (6.McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Smith degradation products were extracted with CHCl3, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The positive ion MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrum of the Smith degradation products of the mutant cell wall is shown in Fig. 2 A. The most abundant ions, (M + H)+, are atm/z 666 and 680. The peaks at 688 and 702 correspond to adduct of sodium (M + 23) to the molecular ions, respectively. The signal at m/z 680 corresponds to a β-hydroxymeromycolylglycerol, and the molecular weight of this β-hydroxymeromycolate is 605, which was the most abundant meromycolate species detected in the mutant (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The peak atm/z 666 may correspond to another β-hydroxymeromycolate (M r 591) substituted with glycerol. The Smith degradation products of the mutant cell wall can be explained if we assume that the β-hydroxymeromycolates in the mutant are attached to the C-5 positions of the terminal- and 2-linked arabinofuranosyl residues of AG (Fig. 2 B). Accordingly, terminal- and 2- linked arabinofuranosyl units of AG substituted at C-5 with the meromycolate residues should produce CHCl3-soluble meromycolylglycerols. The expected molecular weights of meromycolylglycerols are in agreement with the result from MALDI-MS analysis; i.e. esterification of much of meromycolates with glycerol results in an increase in molecular weights by 75. When the same sample was analyzed by ESI-MS with a negative ionization mode, more signals were evident (Fig. 2 C). Two series of ions, (M − H)−, one at m/z 623, 651, 679, 707, 735, and 763, and the other at m/z 609, 637, 665, 693, 721, 749, and 777 were detected. Based on the above analysis, we believe that the series of peaks at m/z 623, 651, 679, 707, 735, and 763 correspond to β-hydroxymeromycolates with molecular weights of 549, 577, 605, 633, 661, and 689 (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) substituted with glycerol, respectively. We previously showed that these β-hydroxymeromycolates are likely to represent intermediates in the chain elongation cycles of the biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acids, and that each cycle adds a two-carbon unit to the meromycolates (16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The other series of ions at m/z 609, 637, 665, 693, 721, 749, and 777 in the ESI-MS spectrum may correspond to meromycolate homologs containing odd-numbered carbons substituted with glycerol. These meromycolate species were observed in our previous study, although they were present in a lower abundance (see Fig. 5 of Ref. 16.Liu J. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In mycolic acids, the odd-numbered carbon-containing homologs represent mycolic acids that contain a distal cis-double bond and a proximal trans-double bond with an adjacent methyl branch in the meromycolate chain (9.Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 13.Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbial Physiol. 1998; 39: 132-203Google Scholar). In the WT cell wall, it was previously shown that mycolic acids were attached to C-5 positions of the terminal and 2-linked arabinofuranosyl residues of AG (6.McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Besra G.S. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4257-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and that Smith degradation produced a CHCl3-soluble mycolylglycerol (Ref.6.McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; also see Fig. 2 B). Consistent with this result, MALDI-TOF showed major peaks at m/z 1211, 1225, 1239, 1253, 1267, 1281, and 1295 (data not shown), which correspond to the free mycolic acids at m/z 1136, 1150, 1164, 1178, 1192, 1206, and 1220 substituted with glycerol, respectively. Based on these results, we concluded that the meromycolates were attached at the same position (C-5 of the arabinofuranosyl residues of AG) in the mutant cell wall as mycolic acids in the WT cell wall (Fig.2 B). To examine whether the structure of AG in the cell wall of the mutant was altered, AG released from the cell wall skeleton by treatment with NaOH was analyzed by1H NMR. For comparison, AG from the cell wall of the WT strain was solubilized and analyzed in the same way. The proton NMR spectrum of the AG in the cell wall of the mutant was identical to that of the WT strain (data not shown), suggesting that the bulk structure of AG in the cell wall of the mutant is the same as that in the WT strain. An interesting question arising from these results is which enzymes are responsible for the transfer of meromycolates to AG of the cell wall. The antigen 85 complex (Ag85A, -B, and -C) is known to possess mycolyltransferase activity and has been shown to catalyze the transfer of mycolic acids to trehalose (29.Belisle J.T. Vissa V.D. Sievert T. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Science. 1997; 276: 1420-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the Ag85 complex was also responsible for deposition of mycolic acids on AG, although direct evidence has yet to be shown. Inactivation of the Ag85C gene was shown to transfer 40% fewer mycolates to the cell wall (30.Jackson M. Raynaud C. Lanéele M.A. Guilhot C. Winter C.L. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It is not clear at present whether the same enzyme is responsible for the transesterification of the meromycolates to AG in the mutant cell wall. The organic solvent-extractable lipids of the cell wall were analyzed by TLC. It was shown that the cell wall of M. smegmatiscontains GPLs, LOSs, PIMs, PE, DPG, and TAGs (4.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 7.Minnikin D.E. Goodfellow M Goodfellow M. Board R.G. Microbiological Classification and Identification.

To determine whether these lipids are present in the mutant, we applied TLC developing systems that were previously established to examine each group of lipids (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two-dimensional TLC system A was used for analysis of apolar lipids (e.g.TAGs). For analysis of polar lipids such as PIMs, PE, and DPG, two-dimensional TLC developed with solvent system B was used. In all experiments, lipids extracted from the cell wall of the WT strain under the same conditions were compared. The results are summarized in Table I. The cell wall of"

This occurs through the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins.

However, currently it is unclear whether the association of the PI 3-kinase with an IRS protein is a required event and/or the nature of the signaling pathways functioning downstream of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3) formation. For example, several studies expressing dominant-interfering IRS PH/phosphotyrosine-binding domains have demonstrated a complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis, yet there was no effect on GLUT4 translocation (15.Sharma P.M.

Thus, although PI 3-kinase function may be required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, it is not clear whether alternative pathway(s) to IRS can couple to PI 3-kinase activation. Similarly, the activation of both protein kinase B and the atypical protein kinase Cζ/λ isoforms are both dependent on PI 3-kinase activity (17.Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Cong L.

In contrast to insulin, various other stimuli display insulinomimetic properties and can induce the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. For example, hyperosmolarity has potent insulin-like properties on glucose metabolism and induces the translocation of GLUT4 in a PI 3-kinase independent but tyrosine kinase-dependent manner (32.Chen D.

Similarly, introduction of guanosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, into adipocytes rapidly stimulates GLUT4 translocation (34.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S.

As with osmotic shock, the GTPγS stimulation of GLUT4 translocation also requires tyrosine kinase activation and is independent of the PI 3-kinase. Furthermore, skeletal muscle appears to have two distinct pathways mediating GLUT4 translocation. For example, as observed in adipocytes, insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity (39.Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J.

Commun. 1995; 208: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, muscle contraction/exercise or hypoxia stimulates glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation through a distinct pathway independent of the PI 3-kinase (41.Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L.

Even though these alternative signaling pathways leading to GLUT4 translocation apparently bypass the initial insulin signal transduction steps, they are likely to induce GLUT4 translocation through activation of a common convergent signal transduction step downstream and/or in parallel to the PI 3-kinase. Currently, there are several lines of evidence suggesting the involvement of regulated GTP-binding protein(s). Introduction of GDPβS into adipocytes inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas the stimulatory effect of GTPγS was mimicked by treatment with NaF plus AlCl3, which is characteristic of the involvement of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (35.Baldini G.

Consistent with this interpretation, adrenergic stimulation can induce GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in cardiac and skeletal muscle as well as white and brown adipocytes (46.Rattigan S.

Furthermore, in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and 3T3L1 adipocytes, expression and activation of several receptors that couple to Gq/G11 resulted in GLUT4 translocation (50.Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 55.Kishi K. Hayashi H. Wang L. Kamohara S. Tamaoka K. Shimizu T.

More recently, endothelin-1 (Gq/G11-coupled receptor agonist) has been observed to stimulate glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes (56.Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although these data provide circumstantial evidence that the trimeric GTP-binding protein Gq and/or G11 can couple to GLUT4 translocation, the relationship between insulin signaling and adrenergic activation on GLUT4 translocation remains unclear. Furthermore, whether receptor agonists that induce GLUT4 translocation directly function through Gq/G11 activation has not yet been determined. To address these issues, we have observed that expression of a constitutively active α subunit mutant of Gq, but not Gs or Gi, is sufficient to induce GLUT4 translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In addition, this Gq signaling pathway displays the same characteristics as osmotic shock and GTPγS stimulation, in that it is PI 3-kinase-independent but requires tyrosine kinase activation. Furthermore, inhibition of Gq/G11 function prevented the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. Together, these data strongly suggest that insulin must utilize at least two independent pathways (PI 3-kinase-dependent and Gq/G11-dependent) that functionally integrate to induce GLUT4 translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes.

Similarly, a CI/MPR-EGFP fusion protein was generated by cloning EGFP at the carboxyl-terminal domain of CI/MPR. The Gq/WT and constitutively active Gq/Q209L α subunits were obtained from Dr. John Exton (Vanderbilt University) in the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV. The Gs/WT α subunit in the mammalian expression plasmid pCR3.1 was provided by Dr. Mario Ascoli (Department of Pharmacology, The University of Iowa). Gi2/WT and constitutively active mutants Gi2/Q205L and Gs/Q227L in the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA1 were purchased from the American Type Tissue Culture (Manassas, VA). The cDNAs for RGS4, RGS16, and the inactive RGS16 mutant RGS16/N131A were subcloned into pcDNA3 using theBamHI/XhoI sites (for RGS4) and theEcoRI/XhoI sites (for RGS16 and RGS16/N131A). The wild type and dominant-interfering mutants of the p85 regulatory subunit of the type I PI 3-kinase p85/WT and Δp85 were kindly provided by Dr. Wataru Ogawa (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan) and were subcloned into pcDNA3 using the BamHI/EcoRI sites. The GRP cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Michael Czech (University of Massachusetts). The PH domain was then subcloned carboxyl-terminal to EGFP generating the EGFP-GRP/PH fusion construct. 3T3L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a 8% CO2 atmosphere and induced to differentiate into an adipocyte phenotype as described previously (58.Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate by incubation of the cells with DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 4 days, the medium was changed to DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1 μg/ml insulin for an additional 4 days. The medium was then changed to DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. Under these conditions, greater than 95% of the cell population morphologically differentiated into adipocytes. The adipocytes were maintained for an additional 4–8 days prior to use. The differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation as described previously (59.Min J. Okada S. Coker K. Ceresa B.P. Elmendorf J.S. Syu L.-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, the adipocytes were put into suspension by mild trypsinization and electroporated with plasmids under low voltage conditions (160 V, 950 microfarad). The cells were then allowed to adhere to tissue culture dishes for 36 h, and the adipocytes were then serum-starved for 2 h prior to experiments. In some experiments, the electroporated adipocytes were seeded on cover slips. 3T3L1 adipocytes were grown on 35-mm tissue culture dishes, and prior to microinjection, the medium was changed to Lebovitz's L-15 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were impaled using an Eppendorf model 5171 micromanipulator and injected with 2–4 mg/ml antibodies plus 4 mg/ml MBP-Ras in 100 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.2, directly into the cell cytoplasm with an Eppendorf model 5246 transjector. Preparation of plasma membrane sheets from the microinjected 3T3L1 adipocytes was performed as described previously (59.Min J. Okada S. Coker K. Ceresa B.P. Elmendorf J.S. Syu L.-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were rinsed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) for 1 min. Cells were then swollen in a hypotonic buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) by three successive rinses. The swollen cells were sonicated for 3 s at power setting 5 with a Fisher Sonic Dismembrator model 550 fitted with a 5-mm microtip set 0.7 cm above the surface of the cell monolayer in 10 ml of sonication buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mmHEPES, 6 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). The bound plasma membranes sheets were washed twice in sonication buffer and subjected to immunofluorescence confocal microscopy as described below. The isolated plasma membrane sheets were fixed with sonication buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and the reaction was quenched by incubation with PBS containing 100 mm glycine for 20 min. After three rinses in PBS, the sheets were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% donkey serum in PBS. The blocked sheets were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a 1:100 dilution of the monoclonal GLUT4 antibody in combination with a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal sheep MBP antiserum. The plasma membrane sheets were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescien isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG in combination with a 1:100 dilution of Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. Following incubation with the secondary antibodies, the membrane sheets were rinsed three times in PBS and mounted for microscopic analysis using Vectashield mounting medium. Confocal images were obtained on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser confocal microscope (The University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility). Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were electroporated and allowed to recover as described above. The cells were then placed in serum-free DMEM for 2 h and incubated with 10 μg/ml of Texas Red-conjugated transferrin at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then extensively washed in serum-free DMEM to remove all the unbound Texas Red-cojugated transferrin, and the cells were warmed to 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy. The in vivo production of PIP3 was determined by a modification of the ARNO/PH domain GFP fusion protein assay (60.Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3L1 adipocytes were transfected with a cDNA encoding for the GRP/PH domain fused to EGFP (EGFP-GRP/PH). The GRP/PH domain has high affinity for PIP3 with substantially lower affinity for other phosphatidylinositol phosphates (60.Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 61.Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Because the insulin stimulation of PIP3 formation occurs at the plasma membrane, the plasma membrane localization of the EGFP-GRP/PH fusion protein directly reflects the accumulation of PIP3. Recently several studies have shown that receptor agonists coupled to Gi and Gq/G11 can result in GLUT4 translocation in both transfected fibroblasts and 3T3L1 adipocytes (50.Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 55.Kishi K. Hayashi H. Wang L. Kamohara S. Tamaoka K. Shimizu T. Ushikubi F.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine the potential involvement of the Gq/G11 α subunit as an intermediate in a potential signal transduction cascade leading to GLUT4 translocation, we examined the effect of Gq/WT and constitutively active Gq/Q209L α subunit expression (Fig.1). In these experiments we also co-transfected the cells with the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein to easily assess only the transfected cell population. As typically observed for the endogenous GLUT4 protein, in the basal state GLUT4-EGFP was localized to the perinuclear region and small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). This distribution was identical to cells co-expressing GLUT4-EGFP and the Gq/WT α subunit (Fig. 1 A, panel a). As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in the translocation of the GLUT4-EGFP protein to the plasma membrane detected as a continuous rim of cell surface fluorescence in both GLUT4-EGFP transfected and Gq/WT co-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, panel b). In contrast, cells expressing Gq/Q209L resulted in the constitutive association of the GLUT4-EGFP protein with the plasma membrane in the absence of insulin (Fig. 1 A, panel c). The subsequent insulin stimulation had no further effect on the extent but did slightly increase the number of cells displaying GLUT4-EGFP cell surface rim fluorescence (Fig. 1 A,panel d). In control experiments, expression of wild type Gs and Gi2 (Gs/WT, Gi2/WT) or constitutively active Gs and Gi2 (Gs/Q227L, Gi/Q205L) had no effect on either the basal or insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4-EGFP (Fig. 1 A, panels e–l). Quantitation of these data by scoring the transfected cells for GLUT4-EGFP plasma membrane rim fluorescence is presented in Fig. 1 B. Together, these data suggest that expression of constitutively active of Gαq is sufficient to induce GLUT4 translocation, which is not mimicked by the expression of constitutively active Gsor Gi2. Although the stimulation of GLUT4-EGFP translocation by Gq/Q209L appeared to be specific for this family of trimeric GTP-binding proteins, the overexpressed proteins can potentially impinge upon signaling pathways not necessarily utilized by the endogenous protein. Thus, to examine the role of the endogenous Gq/G11 α subunit, we microinjected 3T3L1 adipocytes with several specific antibodies and examined the translocation of the endogenous GLUT4 proteins by single cell immunofluorescence in isolated plasma membrane sheets (Fig.2). In these experiments, all the antibodies were prepared against the carboxyl-terminal region of the individual α subunits, which inhibits the coupling between the trimeric GTP-binding protein with their respective receptors (62.Williams C.J.

https://openalex.org/W2106628568,"Inhibition of urokinase has been shown to slow tumor growth and metastasis. To utilize structure-based drug design, human urokinase was re-engineered to provide a more optimal crystal form. The redesigned protein consists of residues Ile16-Lys243 (in the chymotrypsin numbering system; for the urokinase numbering system it is Ile159-Lys404) and two point mutations, C122A and N145Q (C279A and N302Q). The protein yields crystals that diffract to ultra-high resolution at a synchrotron source. The native structure has been refined to 1.5 Å resolution. This new crystal form contains an accessible active site that facilitates compound soaking, which was used to determine the co-crystal structures of urokinase in complex with the small molecule inhibitors amiloride, 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine and phenylguanidine at 2.0–2.2 Å resolution. All three inhibitors bind at the primary binding pocket of urokinase. The structures of amiloride and 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine also reveal that each of their halogen atoms are bound at a novel structural subsite adjacent to the primary binding pocket. This site consists of residues Gly218, Ser146, and Cys191–Cys220 and the side chain of Lys143. This pocket could be utilized in future drug design efforts. Crystal structures of these three inhibitors in complex with urokinase reveal strategies for the design of more potent nonpeptidic urokinase inhibitors.

This new crystal form contains an accessible active site that facilitates compound soaking, which was used to determine the co-crystal structures of urokinase in complex with the small molecule inhibitors amiloride, 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine and phenylguanidine at 2.0–2.2 Å resolution. All three inhibitors bind at the primary binding pocket of urokinase. The structures of amiloride and 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine also reveal that each of their halogen atoms are bound at a novel structural subsite adjacent to the primary binding pocket. This site consists of residues Gly218, Ser146, and Cys191–Cys220 and the side chain of Lys143. This pocket could be utilized in future drug design efforts. Crystal structures of these three inhibitors in complex with urokinase reveal strategies for the design of more potent nonpeptidic urokinase inhibitors. 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine 4-benzodioxolanyletheyl benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine low molecular weight H-d-pyroglutamyl- Gly-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide Cancer cell invasion, the spread and growth of tumor metastases, is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity of malignancy (2.Kohn E.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and this invasion requires the degradation of basement membranes and other extracellular protein structures. Urokinase has been shown to be strongly associated with tumor cells (3.Quax P.H. van, L. R.T. Verspaget H.W. Verheijen J.H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1488-1494PubMed Google Scholar) and to play a role in basement membrane degradation via a cascade mechanism involving activation of plasminogen and the metalloproteases (4.Behrendt N.

These compounds are competitive inhibitors of urokinase and have been proposed to bind at the primary binding pocket common to all trypsin-like serine proteases (15.Jankun J. Keck R. Skrzypczak-Jankun E. Swiercz R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 559-563PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these compounds posses all of the characteristics of a good therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. Structure-based drug design has become an important tool for improving the potency and pharmacological characteristics of compounds toward providing therapeutic agents. This method has contributed to the development of potent and specific inhibitors for many targets such as HIV protease, cyclooxygenase-2, influenza neuraminidase, and the metalloproteinases (16.Browner M.F. Smith W.W. Castelhano A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6602-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 17.Chand P. Babu Y.S. Bantia S. Chu N. Cole L.B. Kotian P.L. J. Med.

To most efficiently apply crystallography-driven structure-based drug design, it is preferable that the crystals have certain properties. One property is that active site of the target is open in the crystal lattice. This molecular packing permits the diffusion and binding of compounds into the active site and eliminates the need to optimize crystal growth in the presence of each inhibitor. Another important property is that the crystals reproducibly diffract to high resolution (2.5–2.0 Å). It is preferable that this data quality is achievable on a conventional rotating anode source, thereby eliminating the need for travel to synchrotron facilities. The higher resolution data facilitate unambiguous map interpretation and minimize the average atomic positional error (23.Luzatti P.V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, an appropriate crystal form can greatly facilitate the process of structure-based drug design. A crystal system exists for urokinase, although it does not fully encompass the preferred properties outlined above. Human low molecular weight (LMW) urokinase has been crystallized in complex with the peptidic inhibitor Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (1.Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This structure reveals the geometry of the urokinase active site as well as the orientation of a peptide inhibitor in the substrate-binding groove. However, the LMW urokinase crystals diffract to lower resolution (2.5 Å resolution, synchrotron radiation; 3.0 Å resolution, rotating anode source) and utilize co-crystallization to achieve the target-ligand complex. In addition, the active site is in close contact with another molecule because of a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis near the active site. This interaction could limit minor ligand induced conformational shifts and perhaps distort the active site conformation. Furthermore, the noncrystallographic and crystallographic packing effectively blocks the active site such that it would be difficult to diffuse small molecules into the active site in this crystal form (if they were not blocked by the irreversible covalent inhibitor). Hence, although this system may be used for modeling of small molecule urokinase inhibitors, it may not provide an ideal system for structure-based drug design. Therefore, to design an anti-cancer therapeutic, a new crystal form of human urokinase was sought to facilitate the application of structure-based drug design. The strategy utilized protein engineering and information from the reported LMW urokinase structure to design an altered protein sequence to yield a new crystal form. The new form of urokinase, micro-urokinase, crystallizes under conditions very similar to the low molecular weight form (1.Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), although crystal packing and data quality are very different. This new crystal form contains a monomer in the asymmetric unit and diffracts to ultra-high resolution (d min = 1.03 Å). In addition, this crystal form has an open active site permitting direct diffusion of compounds into the apo-crystals and is therefore ideal for providing precise structure determinations for urokinase ligand complexes by the soaking technique. The re-engineered crystal system and soaking technique were utilized to determine the co-crystal structure of urokinase in complex with a series of small molecule inhibitors at 2.0 or 2.2 Å resolution. Two of these inhibitors, amiloride (24.Vassalli J.D. Belin D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and B428 (25.Bridges A.J. Lee A. Schwartz C.E. Towle M.J. Littlefield B.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26.Towle M.J. Lee A. Maduakor E.C. Schwartz C.E. Bridges A.J. Littlefield B.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2553-2559PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to reduce tumor size and metastasis (8.Evans D. Sloan-Stakleff K. Arvan M. Guyton D. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12.Rabbani S. Harakidas P. Davidson D. Henkin J. Mazar A. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 559-563PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the effect of the third, phenylguanidine (27.Yang H. Henkin J. Kim K.H. Greer J. J. Med. Chem. 1990; 33: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has not been reported to date. These complex structures were completed to determine the binding orientation of each compound to urokinase. This information in turn may be utilized to design molecules of increased potency toward discovery of an anti-cancer therapeutic compound. Micro-urokinase was engineered by polymerase chain reaction manipulations using a human urokinase cDNA as a template (28.Lo K.-M. GIllies S.D. Biochi. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C279A and N302Q mutations were made by the method of polymerase chain reaction based site-directed mutagenesis. Urokinase native leader sequence was fused directly to Ile159 by polymerase chain reaction. This product was ligated to a baculovirus transfer vector pJVP10z (29.Wang J. Brdar B. Reich E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1758-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The final expression vector sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pJVP10z-micro-urokinase vector was transfected into Sf9 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using the BaculoGold kit from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Single recombinant virus expressing micro-urokinase was plaque purified by standard methods, and a large stock of the virus was prepared. Large scale expression of micro-urokinase was performed in suspension in High-Five cells, (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) growing in Excel 405 serum free medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) at 27 °C. Urokinase activity in the supernatant was measured by amidolysis of the chromogenic urokinase substrate H-d-pyroglutamyl-Gly-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S2444; Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). The culture supernatant was harvested as the starting material for purification. Protease inhibitors, iodoacetamide (10 mm), benzamidine (5 mm), and EDTA (1 mm) were added to the pooled culture medium. The medium was diluted 5-fold with 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and filtered through 1.2 and 0.2-μm membranes. The micro-urokinase protein was captured onto Sartorius membrane adsorber S100 (Sartorius, Edgewood, NY) by passing the medium through the membrane at a flow rate of 50 ∼100 ml/min. After extensive washing with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmiodoacetamide, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm EDTA, micro-urokinase was eluted from S100 membrane with a NaCl gradient (20–500 mm, 200 ml) in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA. The eluate was diluted 10-fold with the above 10 mm HEPES buffer containing inhibitors, and loaded onto a S20 column (Bio-Rad). Micro-urokinase was eluted with a 20× column volume NaCl gradient (20–500 mm). No inhibitors were used in the elution buffers. The eluate was then diluted 5-fold with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column. Micro-urokinase was eluted with a NaCl gradient from 10–250 mm. The heparin column eluate of micro-urokinase was applied to a benzamidine-agarose (Sigma) column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and the urokinase was eluted with 50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, 500 mm NaCl. The micro-urokinase eluate was concentrated to 4 ml by ultrafiltration and applied to a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated with 20 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, 100 mm NaCl. The single peak containing micro-urokinase was collected and lyophilized as the final product. The effects of synthetic inhibitors on the steady state amidolytic activity of LMW urokinase or micro-urokinase toward the chromogenic substrate, S2444 (Helena Laboratories), was characterized by the formation of p-nitroanaline (30.Barlow G.H. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0–50 μm concentration of inhibitors were tested against 25 IU/ml (0.14 ng/ml) LMW urokinase or micro-urokinase and 0.4–4.0 mm concentrations of S2444 in 200 μl volumes in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Incubations were performed at 37 °C with absorbance at 405 nm recorded every 11 s for 20 min. Data were plotted as 1/S versus 1/v for Lineweaver-Burk analysis and the calculation of inhibition constants.K i values were obtained from replots of the resultant slopes versus I (26.Towle M.J. Lee A. Maduakor E.C. Schwartz C.E. Bridges A.J. Littlefield B.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2553-2559PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. A typical well solution of 0.15m Li2SO4, 20% polyethylene glycol MW 4000 in succinate buffer, pH 4.8–6.0, was used. On the coverslip, 2 μl of well solution is mixed with 2 μl of protein solution, and the slip is sealed over the well. Crystallization occurred at 18–24 °C within 24 h. The protein solution was composed of 6 mg/ml (0.21 mm) micro-urokinase in 10 mm citrate, pH 4.0, 3 mm ε-amino caproic acid p-carbethoxyphenyl ester chloride with 1% Me2SO co-solvent. The resultant micro-urokinase crystals are composed of enzyme with an empty active site. The compound ε-amino caproic acid p-carbethoxyphenyl ester chloride is reported to inhibit urokinase with an apparentK i of 0.3 μm at neutral pH and was co-crystallized with urokinase in an attempt to obtain a complex structure (32.Menegatti E. Guarneri M. Bolognesi M. Ascenzi P. G. A. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1989; 2: 249-259Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Repeated tests with this compound resulted in a structure with an active site occupied only by ordered solvent molecules even at 1.5 Å resolution. Hence, we have hypothesized that this inhibitor is degraded during the crystallization experiment albeit critical for obtaining urokinase crystals. Studies are underway to try to understand the mechanism of this phenomenon. The micro-urokinase crystals belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 55.16 Å, b = 53.00 Å,c = 82.30 Å and α = β = γ = 90° and diffract beyond 1.5 Å on a Rigaku RTP 300 RC rotating anode source equipped with an RAXISII detector. In addition, a 1.03 Å resolution native data set was collected on a CCD detector at beam line F1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source in Ithaca, NY. All data were collected at 100–160 K and processed by the program package DENZO (33.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Before crystals were frozen, they were passed through a solution of 0.15 m Li2SO4, 20% polyethylene glycol MW 4000, succinate buffer, pH 4.8–6.0, and 20% glycerol for cryogenic protection. Data were collected at low temperature to preserve the diffraction of the crystal throughout data acquisition. The crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program AMORE (34.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The LMW urokinase structure was used as the search probe (1.Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1LMW) against the RAXISII data. The structure was refined to 1.5 Å resolution using the synchrotron data and the program package XPLOR (35.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) by a combination of rigid body, simulated annealing maximum likelihood refinement, and maximum likelihood positional refinement. Electron density maps to 1.5 Å resolution were inspected on a Silicon Graphics INDIGO2 workstation using the program package QUANTA 97 (Molecular Simulations, Inc). At 1.5 Å resolution constrained individual temperature factor refinement was also included in the refinement cycle. Electron density maps to 1.5 Å resolution were examined, and water molecules and bound ions were identified as positive peaks in the F o −F c map at least 4 ς above noise. Refinement continued with automatic water addition using the XWAT feature of SHELXL (36.Sheldrick G.M. SHELX-97. Gottingen University, Gottingen, Germany1990Google Scholar). Final refinement steps included cycles of model building where disorder and additional solvent molecules were added. The final R-factor is 19.2% with a R free of 21.8%. To obtain the amiloride, B428, or phenylguanidine micro-urokinase complex structures, crystals of urokinase were placed in 50 μl of crystallization mother liquor to which 0.5 μl of a 1 mg/10 μl compound solution was added. The solid compound was obtained from the Abbott chemical repository and was initially dissolved in Me2SO. Crystals were allowed to incubate for 12–15 h at 24 °C and prepared for data collection in a manner identical to that of the native crystals. Data were collected on a Rigaku RTP 300 RC rotating anode source equipped with an RAXISII detector at 160 K by the method of flash freezing. Data were processed using the HKL program suite (33.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Initial electron density maps were calculated using the program package XPLOR (35.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and the 1.5 Å native model. All electron density maps were inspected on a Silicon Graphics INDIGO2 workstation using QUANTA 97, and the orientation of all compounds were clearly visualized in the initial 2F o −F c map. The complexes were refined to 2.0 Å resolution using the program package XPLOR. Refinement consisted of alternating steps of positional and B-factor refinement. Ordered solvent molecules were identified as positive peaks in theF o − F c map that were 4 ς above noise. Table I summarizes statistics for all micro-urokinase models. All data are between 89 and 90% complete with a merging R sym between 7 and 11% and anI/ς between 12 and 15. The native model is refined to aR factor of 19.2% andR free of 21.8% at 1.5 Å resolution. The overall B-factor for the protein is 12 Å2, and the overall B-factor for the 337 ordered solvent molecules is 26 Å2. The current native model also contains three ordered sulfate ions, and two alternate side chain conformations located at the active site. All backbone atoms are well defined in the final 2F o− F c map with atomic B-factors at or below 30 Å2. The B428 model is refined to 2.0 Å resolution with aR factor of 20.9% and aR free of 27.7%, while the amiloride model is refined to 2.2 Å resolution with a R factor of 21.5% and a R free of 29.1%. The phenylguanidine model is refined to 2.0 Å resolution with aR factor of 18.9% and aR free of 22.1%. Data for the complex structures were of quality comparable with that of native structures collected under the same conditions on a rotating anode source.Table IData quality statisticsCompleteI/ςR sym(square)aR sym = Σ ((I − <I>) ** 2)/Σ (I ** 2)R factorbR factor = Σ ∣F o −F c∣/ΣF oR freecValue of the R factor where 10% of the data were randomly removed from the refinement.%Native Overall96.6150.07519.121.8 1.53–1.50Å95.390.11321.2 (1.57–1.50)25.8 (1.57–1.50)B428 Overall89.916.80.08320.927.7 2.05–2.0Å88.450.20320.029.4Amiloride Overall99.812.40.10821.529.1 2.3–2.299.84.30.35819.126.9Phenyl guanidine Overall90.313.50.08618.922.1 2.06–2.0094.24.50.25424.324.8a R sym = Σ ((I − <I>) ** 2)/Σ (I ** 2)b R factor = Σ ∣F o −F c∣/ΣF oc Value of the R factor where 10% of the data were randomly removed from the refinement. Open table in a new tab To redesign the LMW urokinase sequence for the purpose of improving the crystal characteristics, the LMW urokinase coordinate file (Protein Data Bank entry 1LMW) was examined for sequences of excessively high B-factor, suggesting areas of disorder. The hypothesis is that areas of high disorder in the structure may contribute to the overall disorder of the crystals and/or may interfere with optimal crystal packing. The LMW urokinase structure consists of residues 136–158 of the A-chain and 159–411 of the B-chain connected by a disulfide bridge between Cys148 and Cys279 (urokinase numbering). 2The urokinase numbering system is used for discussion of the sequence re-engineering work, whereas the chymotrypsin numbering system as aligned by Ref. 1.Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar is used for discussion of the serine protease domain structure for micro-urokinase. The B-chain corresponds to the serine protease domain, whereas the 21 residue A-chain lacks the kringle and epidermal growth factor domains present in full-length urokinase. The A-chain is reported to be an area of high disorder (1.Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and examination of the protein data bank coordinate file (Protein Data Bank entry 1LMW) reveals that residues 148–155 of the A-chain have an average B-factor of 64 Å2 ranging from 26 Å2 for the disulfide-linked sulfur of residue Cys148 to 110 Å2 for Pro155. The very high B-factors for the LMW urokinase A-chain confirm this observation. Consequently, the A-chain was removed as a first step in the redesign. Furthermore, to remove the resultant free thiol on the B-chain, Cys148 was mutated to an alanine. Further examination of the LMW urokinase coordinate file indicates a second area of disorder consisting of residues 405–411 of the C terminus where the average B-factor is 147 Å2. Residues 407–411 represent a five residue extension in urokinase relative to other trypsin-like serine proteases. However, because residues 405–406 also have high atomic B-factors, the entire 405–411 segment was removed. The final potential site for disorder is the glycosylation site at residue 302. This glycosylation site was removed by an N302Q mutation to facilitate expression of the glycosylation-free protein in baculovirus. Hence, the re-engineered urokinase (micro-urokinase) consists of residues Ile159–Lys404(Ile16-Lys243 chymotrypsin numbering system) with the two point mutations C279A (C122A) and N302Q (N145Q). Micro-urokinase crystallizes with a monomer in the asymmetric unit (P212121), whereas the LMW urokinase crystal form has a dimer in the asymmetric unit (R3) with intimate contacts at the substrate-binding site.

However, because of the close crystal contact at this site in the LMW urokinase crystals, the possibility existed that the structure of the substrate-binding site may be distorted or conformationally restricted. The new crystal form of micro-urokinase lacks the close crystal contact present in LMW urokinase, and an overlay of the two structures indicates that the conformation of this loop is essentially identical in the two crystal forms. Consequently, it is unlikely that packing in either crystal system affects the conformation of this loop and the resultant shape of the S4pocket, although the more open micro-urokinase packing may allow for inhibitor-induced conformational shifts. Examination of crystal packing at the A-chain-binding cleft gives insight into why micro-urokinase yields different lattice packing and better diffracting crystals (a sample of the final 2F o − F c electron density map at 1.5 Å resolution is shown in Fig.1 A). In LMW urokinase, the A-chain binds in a cleft composed of residues 25–29, 116–122, and 201–208. In the crystal structure of micro-urokinase,"

Truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1) is a pituitary-specific, estrogen-induced, isoform of rat ERα that is transcribed from a unique start site and contains only the C-terminal region of the full-length receptor. TERP-1 does not affect transcription directly but suppresses ligand-activated ERα and ERβ activity. Because TERP-1 contains a dimerization domain and part of the coactivator binding pocket, we hypothesized that it modulates ER function by direct interactions with full-length ER or the steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1. Localization studies demonstrate that TERP-1 is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected cells and colocalizes with nuclear ER. Protein binding studies show that TERP-1 forms heterodimers with both ERα and ERβ and inhibits ERα binding to its cognate DNA response element. TERP-1 also binds SRC-1, and increasing levels of SRC-1 decrease the TERP-1-ERα interactions, in agreement with the rescue of TERP-1-suppressed ERα transcriptional activity by SRC-1. Mutational analysis of TERP-1 and ERα in the activation helix and the AF-2 dimerization helix indicates that TERP-1 acts predominantly through dimerization with ERα. Therefore, TERP-1 suppression of ER transcription occurs primarily by formation of inactive heterodimers and secondarily by competition for coactivators.

The N terminus contains an activation function (AF-1), which is ligand-independent. A DNA-binding domain (DBD) consisting of two zinc fingers is located in the central region of the receptor, and a second activating function (AF-2) is located within the ligand-binding domain (LBD) at the C terminus of the protein. The AF-2 function requires ligand binding for transcriptional activity, and the contribution of AF-1 and AF-2 to receptor activity is both cell type- and promoter-dependent. Nuclear localization signals are located in both the DBD and LBD, and dimerization domains exist in the DBD and in helices 10/11 of the LBD (1.Mangelsdorf F.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

For example, short heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan receptor isolated from human and rat liver cDNA libraries, can suppress transcriptional activation by RAR and ER (25.Seol W. Choi H.-S.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Our laboratory cloned and characterized a novel isoform of ERα from female rat pituitary, truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1; 31). TERP-1 is transcribed from a unique start site and contains exons 5–8 of ERα. The resultant protein contains the majority of the LBD but lacks the DBD and AF-1 regions and cannot bind estradiol (E) effectively. TERP-1 mRNA and protein expression is tissue-selective and is stimulated dramatically by estrogen and throughout the estrous cycle (32.Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This regulation is distinct from that of full-length ERα and during proestrus and diestrus TERP-1 is expressed at mRNA and protein levels equal to or in excess to that of full-length ERα (31.Friend K.E. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4367-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32.Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell.

Previous work demonstrated that TERP-1 modulates the activity of full-length ER isoforms in a tissue- and promoter-specific manner at ratios that are observed physiologically. Specifically, low TERP-1:ER ratios stimulate ER activity, whereas TERP-1:ER ratios equal to or greater than 1:1 suppress ER stimulation of gene transcription (7.Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In these investigations we have addressed the suppressive actions of TERP-1 and show that TERP-1 can bind directly to both ERα and ERβ and can compete with ER for binding to the coactivator SRC-1. Our data demonstrate that TERP-1 suppresses ER activity through both direct and indirect mechanisms and that direct binding to ER is the predominant pathway.DISCUSSIONThe stimulation of transcription by activated estrogen receptor has both general and cell-specific aspects that contribute to biological responses (8.Kuiper G.G.J.M.

This has particular importance therapeutically with the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators that have both tissue- and cell-specific effects to treat osteoporosis, memory loss, and heart disease and as treatments or possible preventives for steroid-dependent cancers of the breast and uterus (39.MacGregor J.L. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar). Among the major factors contributing to tissue-selective responses are the complement of receptor isoforms present in a given cell type and the number and types of proteins capable of binding to the receptors and modulating their function. Several groups have isolated activating proteins termed coactivators and inhibitory proteins called corepressors that bind directly to specific sites on nuclear receptors and alter their transcriptional capability (13.Horwitz K.B.

Others have defined molecules termed orphan receptors that have some structural similarity to the nuclear receptors and modify their activity by direct interactions with the nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain (25.Seol W.

We have identified a novel form of ERα, TERP-1, which acts as a tissue-specific, highly regulated suppressor of ER action (7.Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31.Friend K.E. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we show that it exerts its activity primarily by binding to both full-length receptor isoforms, ERα and ERβ, and secondarily by acting as an intracellular buffer to prevent binding of coactivators to the full-length ER forms.TERP-1 Suppresses ER Activity Primarily by Direct Protein-Protein InteractionsTransient transfection studies with constructs representing either the N-terminal AF-1 or ligand-binding region AF-2 domains of ERα indicate that TERP-1 suppression of ERα transactivation is equal to suppression of the C-terminal AF-2 function, although suppression of AF-1 also is observed. Direct physical and functional interactions between the N- and C-terminal regions of the estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors and interactions between the N-terminal regions of the steroid receptors and SRC-1 have been reported (42.El Tanani M.K.

TERP-1 does not inhibit ERα action by sequestering the full-length receptor in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2) or by inhibiting E binding by ERα, as we previously demonstrated (7.Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Instead, TERP-1 acts primarily by binding to ERs through the dimerization helix and suppressing the transcriptional activity of ligand-activated receptor.Although a direct interaction between TERP-1 and ERα was not observed in stringent immunoprecipitation studies, this approach may not always detect important physiological interactions. It is now clear that the dimerization function is critical for TERP-1 suppression of ER activity because the L509R mutation, which has previously been shown to inhibit ERα homodimerization and compromise its function (Fig. 6 and Ref.34.Schodin D.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), eliminates the suppressive effects of TERP-1 on ER transactivation. This mutation also dramatically decreases the interactions between TERP-1 and ERα (Fig. 6). The TERP-1-ERα heterodimer complex must therefore be less effective at stimulating transcription from an ERE, potentially by decreasing binding to DNA as demonstrated by gel shift analysis. Alternatively, a heterodimeric complex bound to DNA could be less effective at associating with coactivator and integrator proteins and the transcription initiation complex. However, there is no evidence for smaller complexes in DNA binding assays representing heterodimer binding to DNA, making this possibility less likely. ERα and ERβ can also form heterodimers through this region in helix 10/11, and the heterodimers bind to DNA and influence gene transcription (5.Pettersson K. Grandien K. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Gustafsson J- Å Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 6.Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The dimerization mechanism is also likely important for TERP-1 effects on ERβ, as demonstrated by the transfection studies in Fig. 6. Because TERP-1-ER interactions, particularly with ERβ, occur in the absence of ligand, TERP-1 could suppress activity of ER-regulated genes modulated through ligand-independent pathways. However, levels of TERP-1 are tightly regulated by E, and significant mRNA levels are observed only after E treatment and at times in the reproductive cycle when E is high (32.Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, TERP-1 will serve as an E-induced regulator of ER functionin vivo.A secondary mechanism for TERP-1 suppression of ER activity is competition for binding to coactivator proteins. Nuclear receptors associate with several different activator proteins, including SRC-1 and GRIP-1, through the C-terminal portion of the receptor, although the precise areas of interaction within ERα vary slightly with each coactivator (29.Eng F.C.S. Barsalou A Akutsu N. Mercier I. Zechel C. Mader S. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28371-28377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of SRC-1 partially overcomes the inhibitory effects of TERP-1 on ERα transactivation (Fig.5 A and Ref. 7.Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TERP-1 contains a portion of the coactivator binding interface, helix 12 of the LBD, but lacks the most N-terminal helices of the LBD that are important for coactivator binding, helices 3 and 5. Mutations in each of these helices inhibit binding of SRC-1 and GRIP-1 to TRβ and GRIP-1 to human ERα (22.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that TERP-1 interacts with SRC-1, as well as with ER, and could thus compete with ER for SRC-1 binding. In agreement with this possibility, Jeyakumar et al. (47.Jeyakumar M. Tanen M.R. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a small peptide consisting of amino acids 437–456 of TRβ, equivalent to helix 12, inhibited SRC-1 binding to the entire receptor. Other investigators have also found that RIP140, a coregulatory protein binding at a somewhat different region on PPAR than SRC-1, antagonizes receptor activation by SRC-1 by effectively competing for binding to the receptor (30.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The ERα-LBD binds SRC-1 more effectively than does TERP-1 in GST-pull-down experiments. This suggests that competition of TERP-1 and ER for SRC-1 is likely to occur only when SRC-1 levels are low or when TERP-1 levels are high, as has been noted during proestrus (32.Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).A related mechanism by which the TERP-1 helix 12 region could inhibit ER action is by direct occupation of the coactivator pocket, as has been observed for the homologous helix 12 of the ERα when bound to the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen or raloxifene (21.Brzozwski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstr 246 m O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar,48.Shiau A.K.

The helix 12 mutant, TERP-1-E547K, is as effective at suppressing ERα transactivation as the wild type TERP-1 in these studies but only partially inhibits ERβ transactivation, demonstrating that suppression through helix 12 of TERP-1 is more important for ERβ than ERα. This mechanism could be important in some cellular contexts, when ERβ is high (9.Shupnik M.A. Pitt L.K. Soh A.Y. Anderson A. Lopes M.B. Laws E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3965-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10.Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. Gustafsson J.Å. Endocrinology. 1998; 10: 4252-4263Crossref Scopus (3814) Google Scholar), or when coactivator proteins themselves are modulated. For example, SRC-1 levels are altered in clonal pituitary cells after treatment with E or thyroid hormone, and this could alter responsiveness of nuclear receptors in those cells (49.Misiti S. Schomburg L. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of SRC-1 to rescue TERP-1 actions demonstrates a functional role for this pathway.TERP-1 Is Functionally Similar to Nuclear Receptor Coregulatory Proteins SHP and DAX-1Nuclear receptor function can also be modulated by the formation of specific heterodimers with orphan receptors that have structural similarities with the nuclear receptors but do not bind known ligands. Association of RARs, TRs, and vitamin D receptors with the previously characterized RXRs results in heterodimers with increased binding affinity to DNA cognate response elements and enhanced transcriptional responses to retinoic acid, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D (50.Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). RXRs themselves bind to DNA and associate with nuclear receptors via dimerization domains similar to those found in the nuclear receptor LBDs. The ER isoforms do not interact with RXR family members, and ER function is not affected by RXRs.More recently, a new class of suppressive orphan receptor molecules has been defined. These p"

One of these, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) cascade, is inhibited by low concentrations of the immunosuppressant drug, dexamethasone, probably at a step prior to the activation of Raf-1 (Rider, L. G., Hirasawa, N., Santini, F., and Beaven, M. A. (1996) J. Immunol. 157, 2374–2380). We now show that treatment of cultured RBL-2H3 mast cells with nanomolar concentrations of dexamethasone causes dissociation of the Raf-1·heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) complex. Raf-1 bereft of this protein fails to associate with the membrane or Ras in antigen-stimulated cells. Upstream events such as the Syk-dependent phosphorylation of Shc, the engagement of Shc with the adapter protein, Grb2, and the activation of Ras itself are unaffected. Interestingly, the counterpart of Raf-1 in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, MEKK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase), is similarly associated with Hsp90, and this association as well as the activation of MEKK-1 are disrupted by dexamethasone treatment. Disruption of the ERK and JNK cascades at the level of Raf-1 and MEKK-1 could account for the inhibitory action of dexamethasone on the generation of inflammatory mediators in stimulated mast cells. Antigen stimulation of mast cells via the IgE receptor, FcεRI, results in the recruitment of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase, Syk, and the activation of various signaling cascades.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar and2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase C and MAP1kinase-related signaling events are also inhibited (2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Fujita Y. Mue S. Ohuchi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4939-4943PubMed Google Scholar). These responses, however, are not equally affected by glucocorticoids. Nanomolar concentrations of dexamethasone, for example, suppress activation of the ERK2 MAP kinase as well as the production of arachidonic acid and the cytokine, TNFα, but only partially inhibit phospholipase C-mediated events and degranulation (2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Baumgartner R.A. Hirasawa N. Ozawa K. Gusovsky F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1625-1629PubMed Google Scholar). In investigating the mechanisms of actions of dexamethasone, we have focused on the ERK2 activation cascade (i.e. Ras → Raf-1 → MEK → ERK2) because production of both arachidonic acid via phospholipase A2 and TNFα in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line is dependent on the activation of this cascade (5.Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The phosphorylations of Raf-1, MEK, ERK2, and cytosolic phospholipase A2 are blocked in dexamethasone-treated cells whereas early antigen-induced events, such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IgE receptor (FcεRI) and its associated tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Syk, are unaffected (2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, dexamethasone appears to act at the level of, or at a step proximal to, the activation of Raf-1. The events that link the antigen-induced activation of Syk to activation of Raf-1 include Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor docking protein, Shc, and the association of phosphorylated Shc with the adaptor protein Grb2, which is constitutively associated with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos (6.Cuenod B.

These associations lead to conversion of Ras to its active GTP-bound state (7.Macara I.G. Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. McKiernan C. Bar-Sagi D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as well as the activation of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK2 (8.Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 9.Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As reported here, the phosphorylation of Shc, its association with Grb2, and the activation of Ras are not impaired in dexamethasone-treated cells even though activation of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK2 is blocked. Furthermore, Raf-1 fails to translocate from cytosol to membrane and associate with Ras possibly because dexamethasone disrupts binding of Hsp90 to the Raf-1 multimeric complex without affecting other proteins in this complex, namely 14-3-3, p50 cdc37, and FKBP65 (9.Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 10.Coss M.C. Stephens R.M. Morrison D.K. Winterstein D. Smith L.M. Simek S.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar). Similar preliminary findings are reported for MEKK-1, the counterpart of Raf-1 in the JNK cascade. The findings identify a new site of action of dexamethasone and highlight the critical role of Hsp90 in MAP kinase signaling. Materials were obtained from the following sources: dexamethasone from Sigma; 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP) from Pierce; polyclonal antibodies against Raf-1, Src, MEKK-1, and SHIP and monoclonal antibodies against 14-3-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; monoclonal antibodies against Raf-1, Grb2, and Hsp90 were from Transduction Laboratories; other antibodies, kinase substrates, and Ras activation kit were from Upstate Biotechnology; enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; radiolabeled products were from NEN Life Science Products. The antigen, DNP-BSA,125I-IgE, and DNP-specific monoclonal IgE were gifts from Drs. Henry Metzger and Juan Rivera (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIH). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p50 cdc37 and FKBP65 were gifts of Dr. Gary Perdew (Department of Veterinary Science, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA) and Dr. Stephanie Simek (National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center), respectively. Experiments were performed with RBL-2H3(m1) cells, a genetically engineered subline of RBL-2H3 cells made to express muscarinic m1 receptors (11.Jones S.V.P. Choi O.H. Beaven M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 60-mm2 (5 × 106 cells/10 ml) or 145-mm2 (1 × 107 cells/30 ml) dishes in modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. For examination of Shc phosphorylation and Ras activation, fetal bovine serum was omitted. Cultures were incubated (37 °C) for 18 h with 0.5 μg/ml DNP-IgE to achieve 100% occupancy of FcεR1 by IgE in the presence of dexamethasone or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide ≤ 0.1%), which did not impair cell viability (>95% viable by trypan blue exclusion). The cultures were then washed with a glucose saline/PIPES buffer (5.Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and stimulated in the same buffer for 5 min or as indicated. Cultures were placed on ice, and all subsequent manipulations were performed with ice-cold reagents. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed (10 min) in 1.0 ml of the following buffers: A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 12.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin), B (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 12.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate), C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mmEDTA, and the protease/phosphatase inhibitors listed for buffer B), or D (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm KCl, 119.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and the protease/phosphatase inhibitors listed for buffer A). For Western blot analysis, in vitro kinase assays, and cell fractionation, cells were lysed in buffers A, B, and C, respectively. For chemical cross-linking experiments, cells were lysed in buffer D before addition of 2 mm DTSSP and, 20 min later, 40 mm glycine to terminate the reaction. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from this mixture as described below. Cell lysates in buffer C were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (∼20 strokes) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Samples of equal protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to separate the soluble (cytosolic fraction) and insoluble fractions. The latter fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer C, supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, rehomogenized (∼5 strokes), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to obtain the solubilized membrane fraction. Whole cell lysates in buffer A were clarified by centrifugation at 500 × g (5 min) for immunoprecipitation. Samples of equivalent protein content of the clarified lysates as well as the cytosolic and membrane fractions described above were incubated briefly with agarose beads before overnight incubation with the appropriate polyclonal antibody. Samples were then incubated for a further 2 h with Protein A-agarose beads. The beads were washed 4 times with buffer A and dissolved in 35 μl of Laemmli buffer (12.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with the indicated primary antibodies and peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence. Raf-1, MEK, and ERK were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates (5 × 106cells) or cytosolic/membrane fractions (from 15 × 106cells) as described above except that immunoprecipitates were collected after 2 h of incubation with the required antibody. They were washed four times in buffer B (diluted with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline) and once in a MOPS buffer (20 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The assay mixture consisted of immunoprecipitate, [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi in 150 μm cold ATP), 25 mm MgCl2, substrate, and the MOPS buffer (final volume 35 μl). The substrates used were 15 nm inactive mouse MAP kinase kinase-1-GST (MEK-GST; for Raf-1 activity), 45 nm inactive mouse p42 MAP kinase-GST (ERK-2-GST; for MEK activity), or 70 μm myelin basic protein peptide (for ERK activity). The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (for Raf-1 and MEK activities) or 12 min (for ERK activity) and then solubilized in 35 μl of Laemmli buffer. The32P-labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for autoradiographic detection. Exposure of RBL-2H3(m1) cells to 100 nm dexamethasone for 18 h resulted in almost complete suppression of the antigen-induced activation of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK as determined by in vitro assay of the immunoprecipitated kinases from cell extracts (Fig.1 A). Initial experiments had indicated that suppression of Raf activation was time-dependent (data not shown but see later figure) and was prevented by co-treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU-486 (1 μm) to indicate the probable involvement of this receptor (13.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The activation of Raf-1 was blocked whether cells were stimulated with antigen, the calcium-mobilizing agent, thapsigargin, the protein kinase C stimulant, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or the muscarinic m1 agonist, carbachol (14.Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,15.Zhang C. Hirasawa N. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4968-4975PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). These results indicated a common point of convergence for these various stimulants, inhibitable by dexamethasone, for activation of Raf-1. Upstream events of Raf-1 activation were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment. In addition to the previously noted lack of effect on antigen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcεRI, Lyn, Syk, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav (2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar), the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc isoforms (p46 shc and p52 shc) and the increased association of Shc with Grb2 (6.Cuenod B. Zhang C. Scharenberg A.M. Paolini R. Numerof R. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16268-16272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were still apparent in dexamethasone-treated cells (Fig. 1 C). Also, the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP that coimmunoprecipitates with Shc (16.Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13991-13996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was also unaffected (Fig. 1 C). Thus, dexamethasone appeared to target a step proximal to Raf-1 activation. Chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the Raf-1·14-3-3·p50 cdc37·FKBP65·Hsp90 complex remained intact in the dexamethasone-treated cells except for a loss of Hsp90. As shown in Fig.2 A, antigen stimulation by itself caused a consistent increase (∼50%, mean of five experiments) in the amount of Hsp90 and a decrease (∼45%, mean of three experiments) in the amount of 14-3-3 associated with the Raf-1 complex. In dexamethasone-treated cells, Raf-1 was partially bereft of Hsp90 and failed to show an increased association with Hsp90 following antigen stimulation. Dexamethasone, however, appeared not to affect the association of 14-3-3 with Raf-1 and its decrease upon antigen stimulation. The immunophilin, FKBP65, and p50 cdc37 (blots for p50 cdc37 are shown in Fig. 2 A) were unaffected by either antigen stimulation or dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone acts through the glucocorticoid receptor in a time-dependent fashion (see Fig. 2 D). However, no detectable change in expression of Raf-1 (see also Ref. 2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar), Hsp90, or any other Raf-1-associated proteins was evident by immunoblotting of extracts of dexamethasone-treated cells in three series of experiments (data not shown). Other Hsp90 complexes, namely complexes of Hsp90 with MEKK-1, Lyn, Src, and MEK were also examined (Fig. 2 B). Hsp90 association with MEKK-1 has not been previously reported, but this enzyme is the hierarchical counterpart of Raf-1 in the JNK activation cascade, and its activation is suppressed in dexamethasone-treated RBL-2H3 cells (3.Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Fujita Y. Mue S. Ohuchi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4939-4943PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. S. Cissel and M. A. Beaven, unpublished data. MEKK-1 was also associated with Hsp90, and this association was markedly inhibited by 100 nm dexamethasone. The other kinase complexes remained intact with the possible exception of the Src·Hsp90 complex, which showed a small (∼25%) loss of Hsp90. Although such experiments provided no simple explanation for the loss of Hsp90 from Raf-1 and MEKK-1, dexamethasone acts presumably through induction or suppression of synthesis of a protein that regulates association of Hsp90 with Raf-1 and possibly MEKK-1. The effects of dexamethasone were apparent at therapeutically relevant levels. Furthermore, the loss of Hsp90 from the Raf-1 complex correlated with the inhibition of antigen-stimulated Raf-1 activity whether dose (Fig. 2 C) or time of exposure to dexamethasone (Fig. 2 D) was varied. A 50% reduction of Hsp90 binding and Raf-1 activation was observed at, respectively, 6 and 7 nmdexamethasone (average IC50 values from three experiments). These values fall within the range of plasma levels (i.e.10–20 nm) following therapeutic doses of dexamethasone in man (17.O'Sullivan B.T. Cutler D.J. Hunt G.E. Walters C. Johnson G.F. Caterson I.A. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 41: 574-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Maximal effects of dexamethasone occurred at about 15 h. These data suggested a possible link between loss of Hsp90 and impairment of Raf-1 activation. Although the role of Hsp90 and other Raf-1-interacting proteins in Raf-1 signaling require clarification (18.Sternberg P.W. Alberola-Ila J. Cell. 1998; 95: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Hsp90 (19.Prodromou C. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) is known to promote structural stability of a variety of proteins and to facilitate signal transduction (20.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In its best studied role, Hsp90 binding to steroid hormone receptors permits ligand activation of the receptors, and its subsequent dissociation from the receptors permits them to become transcriptionally active (13.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase is also dependent on recruitment of Hsp90 to the enzyme complex in response to receptor stimulation (21.Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). With respect to Raf-1, genetic studies in yeast (22.Louvion J-F. Abbas-Terki T. Picard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3071-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (23.van der Straten A. Rommel C. Dickson B. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) as well as studies in mammalian cells with the Hsp90-binding agent, geldanamycin (24.Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.P. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), suggest that Hsp90 is essential for Raf-1 stability and signaling. Geldanamycin blockade of Hsp90 binding to Raf-1 leads to degradation of Raf-1 and, as a consequence, disruption of Raf-1 signaling (24.Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.P. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 25.Stancato L.F. Silverstein A.M. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chow Y.-H. Joves R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4013-4020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The actions of dexamethasone reported here differ in that Raf-1 signaling is still disrupted even though the levels of Raf-1 remain unchanged. With respect to other Raf-1-associated proteins, 14-3-3 is thought to facilitate the unfolding and the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras with retention of 14-3-3 by Raf-1 in one model (26.Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and loss of 14-3-3 in another (27.Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the latter model being consistent with the present data. The effects of antigen and dexamethasone noted above raise the possibility that Hsp90, possibly in concert with 14-3-3, is also essential for successful transduction of signals by Raf-1. The role of the antigen/dexamethasone-insensitive proteins, p50 cdc37 and FKBP65, in Raf-1 signaling are poorly understood. Studies with geldanamycin have suggested that Hsp90 is also essential for translocation of Raf-1 to the cell membrane (28.Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Assays of the cytosolic and membrane fractions of whole cell extracts (Fig.3 A) showed that Raf-1 activity was located largely in the cytosolic fraction in unstimulated cells. In antigen-stimulated cells, Raf-1 activity was increased substantially in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions although the major portion of the activity still remained in the cytosolic fraction. These increases were not apparent in dexamethasone-treated cells. Raf-1 immunoblots (Fig. 3 A) showed that, like Raf-1 activity, Raf-1 protein was predominantly cytosolic, but following antigen stimulation, the amount of membrane-associated Raf-1 increased substantially, and this increase was blocked in dexamethasone-treated cells. Calculation of data from five experiments (values are noted in Fig. 3 A) indicated a 2–3-fold increase in the specific activity of cytosolic Raf-1 following antigen stimulation even after correction for the contamination (∼15%) of cytosolic fractions by the plasma membrane marker, 125I-IgE-tagged FcεRI (29.Dreskin S.C. Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4407-4415PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast to cytosolic Raf-1, the specific activity of membrane Raf-1 remained virtually unchanged and similar to that of cytosolic Raf-1 in stimulated cells, regardless of the state of stimulation or treatment with dexamethasone. The antigen-induced association of Raf-1 with Ras (Fig. 3 B) was also impaired in dexamethasone-treated cells although Ras function, as indicated by its association with phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (data not shown) and a Raf-1 peptide that binds to activated Ras (Upstate Biotechnology, see legend to Fig.3) appeared intact in both unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig.3 C). In three experiments, the binding of Ras to Raf-1 peptide increased upon antigen stimulation and showed similar maximal increases at 1–2 min in both control (2.0 ± 0.5-fold, mean ± S.E.) and dexamethasone-treated (1.9 ± 0.3-fold) cells. Dexamethasone itself caused no significant increase in Ras binding activity in unstimulated cells (1.4 ± 0.3-fold) although an increase was observed in one of the three experiments. These results suggested that neither the constitutive activity of Ras in unstimulated cells nor the further stimulation of Ras in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells is impaired by treatment with dexamethasone. The simplest interpretation of the above results is that Raf-1 is activated largely in the cytosol and then translocated to the membrane in its active form through recruitment by Ras. Current models suggest, however, that Raf-1 is translocated in its inactive form (9.Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and that both cytosolic and membrane-associated forms of Raf-1 may be activated in a Ras-independent and a Ras-dependent manner, respectively (30.Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our data do not distinguish between these two possibilities, but the data suggest that treatment with dexamethasone blocks both activation and association of Raf-1 with Ras, that both processes are dependent on an intact Raf-1·Hsp90 complex, and that dissociation of this complex by treatment with dexamethasone accounts for the suppression of the ERK-2/phospholipase A2activation pathway and ultimately the generation of arachidonic acid and TNFα by dexamethasone in RBL-2H3 cells (Ref. 2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar and this paper). It is apparent from the present and published studies that glucocorticoids can act via the glucocorticoid receptor to suppress transduction of signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus at several steps. Dexamethasone at 0.1 or 1.0 μmconcentrations may negatively regulate various cytokine genes either directly, by blocking activity of the transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-κB (see Ref. 31.Cato A.C.B. Wade E. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), or indirectly by inducing production of the inhibitory NF-κB protein, IκB (32.Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 33.Wissink S. van Heerde E.C. van der Burg B. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 355-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, dexamethasone is a potent suppressant of the ERK-2 (2.Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar) and JNK (3.Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Fujita Y. Mue S. Ohuchi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4939-4943PubMed Google Scholar) MAP kinase pathways apparently because it impedes the proper assembly of Hsp90 with key kinases such as Raf-1 and the less well studied MEKK-1 (this paper). These pathways have been linked to activation of AP-1 (34.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar), NF-AT (35.Prieschl E.E. Pendl G.G. Harrer N.E. Baumruker T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4963-4970PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-κB (36.Kanno T. Siebenlist U. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5277-5283PubMed Google Scholar) in various types of cells, and inhibition of these pathways would likely influence production of a variety of cytokines. Production of TNFα (37.Pelletier C. Varine-Blank N. Rivera J. Iannascoli B. Marchand F. David B. Weyer A. Blank U. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4768-4776PubMed Google Scholar) and interleukin-5 (38.Prieschl E.E. Gouilleux V. Walker C. Harrer N.E. Baumruker T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6112-6119PubMed Google Scholar) in mast cells is reported to be dependent on NF-κB and NF-AT, respectively. In conclusion, the present results reveal an unsuspected action of dexamethasone and point to its possible use in elucidating the role of Hsp90 in Raf-1 and MEKK-1 signaling."

The ligand binding function of αIIbβ3 is “activated” on the platelet surface by physiologic stimuli. Two forms of αIIbβ3 can be purified from platelet lysates. These forms are facsimiles of the resting (Activation State-1 or AS-1) and the active (Activation State-2 or AS-2) conformations of the integrin found on the platelet surface. Here, the differences between purified AS-1 and AS-2 were examined to gain insight into the mechanism of activation. Four major findings are put forth. 1) The association rate (k 1) between fibrinogen and the integrin is a key difference between AS-1 and AS-2. 2) Although the divalent ion Mn2+ enhances the ligand binding function of AS-1, this ion is unable to convert AS-1 to AS-2. Therefore, its effect on integrin is unrelated to activation. 3) Peptide mass fingerprints indicate that the chemical structure of AS-1 and AS-2 are virtually identical, calling into question the idea that post-translational modifications are necessary for activation. 4) The two forms of αIIbβ3 have significant conformational differences at three positions. These include the junction of the heavy and light chain of αIIb, the divalent ion binding sites on αIIb, and at a disulfide-bonded knot linking the amino terminus of β3 to the cysteine-rich domain.

Most integrins are displayed in at least two distinct conformations on the cell. These conformations have varying affinities for ligand. The transition between one affinity state and another is typically referred to as “activation,” and such transitions are brought about by “inside-out” signaling (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 2.Hughes P.E. Pfaff M.

The activation of integrins is crucial to events like morphogenesis, cell migration and invasion, and platelet aggregation (6.Martin-Bermudo M.D. Dunin-Borkowski O.M. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7.Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

Platelet integrin αIIbβ3 has served as a paradigm of many aspects of integrin structure and function. This receptor is a particularly good model of an integrin whose activation is of immense physiologic significance (9.Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Integrin αIIbβ3 is pivotal to the control of bleeding because it mediates platelet aggregation. Integrin αIIbβ3 is activated when platelets are stimulated by agonists like ADP or thrombin. Activation endows αIIbβ3 with the ability to bind soluble fibrinogen (Fg)1 present in the plasma. Because Fg is a dimer, its binding leads to platelet aggregation and ultimately halts the loss of blood. Because the concentrations of both Fg and platelets are so high in the blood, αIIbβ3 must be maintained in a resting, or inactive state, to ensure proper blood flow. Therefore, an understanding of how αIIbβ3 is activated is of great importance. The precise mechanism by which the ligand binding affinity of αIIbβ3, and other integrins, is modulated by cellular stimulation is still not completely understood. Several pathways to activation have been put forth. Many of these have focused on the role of the integrin cytoplasmic domains in activation (10.Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). One hypothesis suggests that changes in the conformation of the cytoplasmic tails can release a conformational constraint or open an “integrin hinge” (11.Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This hinge could potentially be opened by proteolysis of the integrin cytoplasmic domains (12.Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13.Inomata M. Hayashi M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Tsubuki S. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Arch. Biochem.

Alternatively, the hinge could be released by phosphorylation of the integrin. The cytoplasmic tail of β3 contains several potential phosphorylation sites (15.Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16.Jenkins A.L. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Silver D. Sellers J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13878-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One of these phosphorylation sites, an NPXY motif within the tail of β3, is essential for integrin activation (17.O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18.Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation must also be considered as a potential route to activation. Another pathway to activation may involve proteolysis within the ectodomain of the integrin. In fact, there is evidence that αIIbβ3 can be activated in this manner (19.Si-Tahar M. Pidard D. Balloy V. Moniatte M. Kieffer N. Van Dorsselaer A. Chignard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11636-11647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Still other work indicates that divalent ions, which bind to the integrin and control ligand affinity, may activate the integrin (20.Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Lee J.O. Bankston L.A.

The physical association of integrins with regulatory proteins (23.Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J.

J. 1997; 327: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) could also enact conformational changes that lead to activation. Intracellular signaling pathways like those controlled by Ha- and R-Ras (26.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 27.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) have also been implicated in the activation of integrins. Despite this progress, there is still no unifying hypothesis on exactly what biochemical changes occur within an integrin during activation. We reasoned that one way to gain insight into this issue was to compare the differences in the structure and function of the resting and active integrin. We have used Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) to compare the kinetic behavior of the active and resting form of αIIbβ3 and mass spectrometry to probe the structural differences between the two conformers. The study reveals that the active and resting integrin are virtually identical in chemical structure but reveals important conformational distinctions. These observations lay the fundamental groundwork required to properly interpret other studies aimed at deciphering how inside-out signaling alters the ligand binding function of integrins. The two forms of integrin αIIbβ3, AS-1 and AS-2, were purified according to previously published procedures (28.Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18844-18851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Fitzgerald L.A. Leung B. Phillips D.R. Anal.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, washed, outdated platelets were lysed in a 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm CaCl, and 10−5 leupeptin. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g and stored at −80 °C until further use. The lysate was rapidly thawed at 37 °C, centrifuged at 50,000 ×g, and passed over Con-A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with Buffer A (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% NaN3) containing 200 mmmethyl α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma) and 10−5m leupeptin (Sigma). Fractions containing αIIbβ3 were pooled and then depleted of the active form of the integrin (AS-2) by circulating over a column of KYGRGDS-Sepharose. To ensure that the flow through was depleted of AS-1, the lysate was passed over two RGD affinity columns in series. The AS-2 form of the integrin was eluted from these columns using soluble RGD peptide. AS-2 was concentrated, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −80 °C. The flow through from the KYGR6DS-Sepharose column, containing the resting form of the integrin (AS-1) was circulated over heparin-agarose column to remove the thrombospondin. The effluent was concentrated and AS-1 further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. The integrin was concentrated, dialyzed against Buffer A, and stored at −80 °C. The purity and integrity of each form of the integrin was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Human fibrinogen was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Fab-9, a recombinant antibody containing the RGD motif (31.Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32.Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeney S. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol.

Synthetic peptides were purchased from Coast Scientific and from Anaspec. Antibodies against the C-terminal domain of αIIb, including PM1–1, anti-V41 (33.Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Jennings L.K. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11025-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which are specific for C terminus of the heavy chain of αIIb and the N terminus of the light chain of αIIb, respectively, were generous gifts from Dr. Mark Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute). Cells expressing recombinant variants of Fg lacking the RGD motifs were generously provided by Dr. David Farell (Milton Hershey Medical Center, Penn State University). For affinity purification of αIIbβ3, the peptide KYGRGDS was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications. To analyze the depth of the integrins ligand binding pocket, affinity resins were constructed in which the RGD peptide was coupled to the resin with an extended spacer. This was accomplished using a procedure reported by Yan et al. (34.Yan B. Lin M. Han Tian Z. Qing Fan M. Gang Lin Y. Zhong Li H. Jing Y. YuHua C. Chin. Biochem. J. 1992; 8: 755-758Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, Sepharose was activated with epichlorohydrin at pH 12. Then 1,6-hexanediamine was added and incubated with the resin at 45 °C for 2 h with stirring. After washing with water, the resin was incubated with epichlorohydrin again for an additional hour. The activated resin was washed extensively with distilled water, and the peptide with sequence KYGRGDS was added at a concentration of 1 mm. The peptide was allowed to couple to the resin for 18 h, and free peptide was removed by extensive washing with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The kinetic parameters (association and dissociation rate constants, k 1and k −1, respectively) and the affinity constant (K d) between Fg and αIIbβ3, or Fab-9 and αIIbβ3, were measured by SPR using methods we have described previously (35.Hu D.D.

To eliminate conformational changes, the ligands, either Fg or Fab-,9 were coupled to the sensor chip. Then, a solution containing integrin was applied to the surface and binding was measured as a function of time. Briefly, a CM5 sensor chip was activated by 15 μl 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide and 40 μl of Fg at 50 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.87, was coupled to the chip. The surface was then treated with 10 μl of ethanolamine to block uncoupled carboxylate groups on the chip. Fab-9 was linked to the sensor chip in the same manner except that the pH of the immobilization buffer was set at 4.5. Following binding, chips were regenerated with a vast excess of RGD peptide, or with 10 mm CaCl2. For all the reactions the working buffer was Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.005% surfactant P20 and included divalent cations. Integrin was diluted from concentrated purified stocks into this working buffer just prior to use. Kinetic constants were fitted to a model that assumes a one-to-one binding relationship using the Langmuir equations in the BIAcore 3000 software package. Limited digestion of αIIbβ3 was accomplished with Asp-N protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sequencing grade). Asp-N was added to purified αIIbβ3 (1 mg/ml) of 100 μg in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. Protease was added in a ratio of 1:300 (weight to weight) and incubated with integrin at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by chilling to 4 °C and immediately analyzing the sample on 12% SDS-PAGE. Peptide mass fingerprinting (37.Cottrell J.S. Peptide Res. 1994; 7: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Pappin D.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 64: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar) was used to define the composition of αIIb and β3 and the composition of their proteolytic fragments. Proteins or peptides were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Gel slices containing protein were excised and then reduced and alkylated by performing the following procedure three times. Gel slices were dehydrated with acetonitrile and subjected to reduction with 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56 °C for 1 h. Proteins embedded in the gel were then alkylated with 60 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min. Gel slices were washed with 100 mm NH4HCO3, again dehydrated with acetonitrile. Gel slices containing reduced and alkylated integrin were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and then re-hydrated in 20 mm NH4HCO3containing 20 μg/ml of trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, modified sequencing grade). Each gel slice was incubated with enzyme in an ice-bath for 1 h, and then at 37 °C for 18 h. Gel slices were washed with 20 mmNH4HCO3 and then tryptic peptides were extracted with three changes of a solution of 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile, and 25% isopropanol. The solution containing peptides was evaporated to dryness. Dry peptide mixtures were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To detect some domains within αIIband β3 by mass spectrometry, it was necessary to deglycosylate the protein. Deglycosylation was carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 withO-glycanase, N-glycanase, and sialidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 40 h. In some cases proteins were digested in solution rather than in acrylamide gel slices. Because Triton X-100 suppresses peptide detection in MALDI mass spectrometry, it was necessary to remove this detergent. This was accomplished with the following procedure. Methanol (140 μl) was added to 35 μg of integrin in a volume of 35 μl. The sample was vortexed and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 s. Then, chloroform (35 μl) was added to the solution and vortexed, and the sample was centrifuged again. Finally, water (90 μl) was added and the sample vigorously vortexed. Phase separation was enacted by centrifugation for 1 min. The upper phase was discarded. The lower phase, containing chloroform, and the interface, comprised of precipitated αIIbβ3, were retained. Methanol (90 μl) was added to the remainder of the sample to precipitate the αIIbβ3. Precipitated integrin was recovered by centrifugation for 2 min at 9,000 ×g. The supernatant was discarded and the protein pellet was air dried. Then the protein was resuspended in 20 mmNH4HCO3 containing 0.2% octylglucoside. Lys-C protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, modified sequencing grade) was added to a final ratio of 1:10 (weight to weight), and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. MALDI-MS spectra were obtained with a Voyager DE-RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse). Spectra were collected in reflector mode. The accelerating voltage in the ion source was 20 kV. Data were acquired with a transient recorder with 2-ns resolution. The matrix used in this work was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in water/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) to give a saturated solution at room temperature. To prepare the sample for analysis, 1 μl of the peptide solution (containing 1–10 pmol of protein in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added to 1 μl of the matrix solution and applied to a stainless steel sample plate. The mixture was then allowed to air dry on the sample plate before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. Each spectrum was produced by accumulating data using 128 laser pulses. Mass assignments were assigned with an accuracy of approximately ± 0.1% (± 1 Da/1000 Da). The computer program called Peptide Mass on the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server was used to calculate the masses of all possible peptides. The ability to purify two forms of αIIbβ3 from platelet lysates is well documented in the literature (28.Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18844-18851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Fitzgerald L.A. Leung B. Phillips D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our procedure for obtaining the resting (AS-1) and active (AS-2) conformations of αIIbβ3 essentially paralleled the procedures established by others. With these methods, approximately 2.5 mg of AS-2 and 20 mg of AS-1 could be obtained from 50 units of outdated platelets. The purity of each form of the integrin was judged to be at least 90% by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A.) We found no evidence of the reproducible co-purification of any low M rproteins that could be associated with αIIbβ3 in a stoichiometric manner. One of the hallmark differences between the resting and active forms of αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface is the depth of the RGD binding pocket. This depth has been gauged by measuring the ability of resting and activated platelets to adhere to beads coupled to RGD peptides via spacers of varying length (39.Beer J.H. Springer K.T. Coller B.S. Blood. 1992; 79: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that the purified forms of αIIbβ3 are similar to the conformers observed on the platelet surface, we assessed the depth of the RGD binding pocket on AS-1 and AS-2. We measured the binding of each conformer to affinity columns in which the RGD motif was linked to the resin in different ways. In one approach, the RGD peptide was linked directly to the resin, providing a short spacer. In another approach, the RGD peptide was bridged to the resin with a hexanediamine spacer of about 18 Å. Only AS-2 bound the RGD peptide linked directly to Sepharose (Fig. 1 B), but both AS-1 and AS-2 bound the beads in which the RGD was displayed on an extended linker. These observations indicate that the differences in the exposure of the RGD binding pocket on purified AS-1 and AS-2 are similar to those observed on the platelet surface. In equilibrium binding studies, Kouns et al. (28.Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18844-18851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that only AS-2 could bind to Fg. No binding between AS-1 and Fg could be detected. We sought to determine whether the failure to detect binding between AS-1 and Fg is a consequence of a slow association rate or a rapid dissociation rate between the two proteins. This distinction has important implications for understanding how cellular signaling events regulate integrin activation. SPR was used to measure k 1 for the binding of AS-1 and AS-2 to Fg (Fig. 2). The association between AS-1 and fibrinogen could not be detected, even at high concentrations of integrin. Under the conditions of this experiment, the lowest association rate that can be observed with the BIACore was 1 × 103m−1s−1. Therefore, the rate at which AS-1 associates with Fg is below this value. In contrast, AS-2 bound to Fg with an association rate constant of 1.3 × 105m−1 s−1. In related experiments, we found that the association rate between AS-2 and the model RGD-ligand Fab-9 was also about 7-fold faster than the rate of association between AS-1 and Fab-9 (2.3 × 105m−1 s−1 versus3.2 × 104m−1s−1). Therefore, a primary difference between AS-1 and AS-2 is the rate at which ligands associate with their respective binding pockets. The divalent ion Mn2+ has been linked to the activation of integrins because it increases ligand binding affinity and promotes cell adhesion (20.Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is widely thought that Mn2+mimics physiologic activation of integrin. To test this idea, we measured the ability of Mn2+ to convert AS-1 to AS-2. AS-2 binds to Fg when Ca2+ is the only available divalent ion, and this binding function is stable to prolonged dialysis. Therefore, these characteristics were set as criteria for the conversion of AS-1 to AS-2. To perform the conversion test, AS-1, purified in Ca2+-containing buffer, was dialyzed into buffer containing 200 μm Mn2+. Then, the ability of the integrin to bind to fibrinogen was measured by SPR. As shown in Fig.3, Mn2+ increased the association between AS-1 and Fg to the point where it could be detected by SPR. However, when the Mn2+-loaded AS-1 was returned to buffer containing only Ca2+, its ability to bind Fg was lost. This cation-exchange procedure could be repeated through several cycles, each resulting in an increase in k 1 for Fg when Mn2+ was present, and a subsequent ablation of binding to Fg when only Ca2+ was present. Thus, whereas Mn2+ increases the association rate of AS-1 for ligand, it does not convert AS-1 to AS-2. There is no detailed information on how the structures of AS-1 and AS-2 differ. This leaves open the possibility that they are alternatively spliced forms of the integrin or differ in some key posttranslational modification. A comprehensive mass fingerprinting study was undertaken to probe for differences between AS-1 and AS-2. Because of the accuracy of mass spectrometry, this type of analysis is capable of revealing differences in amino acid sequence and in post-translational modification. Mass fingerprinting was performed by separating the αIIb and β3subunits (derived from AS-1 and AS-2) by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Bands corresponding to each subunit were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin as described under “Materials and Methods.” Then, the resulting mixtures of peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. From this analysis we were able to detect peptides comprising 86% of the entire sequence of αIIb (Table I, sections A and B), and 85% of the sequence of β3 (Table I, section C). Perhaps surprisingly, no differences were observed in the peptides that were detected from AS-1 and AS-2. The majority of the undetected tryptic fragments were of very low mass (<300 daltons) and are not amenable to detection by MALDI-TOF. The only larger fragments that remained undetected by MALDI included tryptic fragments corresponding to residues 166–276 from αIIb and a fragment corresponding to residues 151–181 of β3. These fragments were not observed in either AS-1 or AS-2. We also failed to detect a peptide encompassing the amino-terminal 12 residues of the αIIb light chain, which is not unexpected because alternative processing of this terminus of the light chain of αIIb has been reported before. Amino acid sequencing of this chain of αIIb showed Val-13 to be the amino-terminal residue (42.Calvete J.J. Alvarez M.V. Rivas G. Hew C.L. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem.

Transcription of the genes involved in mannitol uptake in this bacterium is regulated by the transcriptional regulator MtlR, a DNA-binding protein whose affinity for DNA is controlled by phosphorylation by the PTS proteins HPr and IICBmtl. The mutational and biochemical studies presented in this report reveal that two domains of MtlR, PTS regulation domain (PRD)-I and PRD-II, are phosphorylated by HPr, whereas a third IIA-like domain is phosphorylated by IICBmtl. An involvement of PRD-I and the IIA-like domain in a decrease in affinity of MtlR for DNA and of PRD-II in an increase in affinity is demonstrated by DNA footprint experiments using MtlR mutants. Since both PRD-I and PRD-II are phosphorylated by HPr, PRD-I needs to be dephosphorylated by IICBmtl and mannitol to obtain maximal affinity for DNA. This implies that a phosphoryl group can be transferred from HPr to IICBmtl via MtlR. Indeed, this transfer could be demonstrated by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent formation of [3H]mannitol phosphate in the absence of IIAmtl. Phosphoryl transfer experiments using MtlR mutants revealed that PRD-I and PRD-II are dephosphorylated via the IIA-like domain. Complementation experiments using two mutants with no or low phosphoryl transfer activity showed that phosphoryl transfer between MtlR molecules is possible, indicating that MtlR-MtlR interactions take place.

Recently, the mannitol operon of Bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned (4.Henstra S.A. Tolner B. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Konings W.N. Robillard G.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5586-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to consist of four genes, mtlA,mtlR, mtlF, and mtlD, coding for the mannitol transporter IICBmtl, the transcriptional regulator MtlR, the phosphotransferase IIAmtl, and mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. Analysis of the mannitol promoter revealed a catabolite response element overlapping the mannitol promoter, indicating that this operon is sensitive to catabolite repression. When favorable catabolites like glucose are utilized, HPr is phosphorylated by a kinase on a specific serine (5.Reizer J. Hoischen C. Titgemeyer F. Rivolta C. Rabus R. Stulke J. Karamata D. Saier M.H. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1157-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that forms a complex with the CcpA repressor. Binding of this complex to catabolite response element sites located in or near the promoter regions of catabolic operons will prevent expression of these operons (6.Hueck C.J. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition to catabolite repression, the expression of the mannitol operon is probably also regulated by the mannitol regulator MtlR (7.Henstra S.A. Tuinhof M. Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4754-4770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Domains in this protein show similarity to domains of two types of transcriptional regulators: DNA-binding proteins and anti-terminators. A helix-turn-helix motif is situated at the N terminus that is similar to those of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators of the DeoR family. The center of the protein sequence contains two domains resembling the PTS regulation domains (PRD-I and PRD-II) of the anti-terminators LicT, SacY, and BglG (7.Henstra S.A. Tuinhof M. Duurkens R.H.

Microbiol. 1998; 28 (abstr.): 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Anti-terminators are RNA-binding proteins that prevent premature termination of transcription at a terminator located between the promoter and the functional genes. Combinations of DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motifs and PRDs have been found in other proteins such as LevR and LicR. The activity of most of these proteins can be regulated by phosphorylation of PRD-I and/or PRD-II by the PTS components HPr and/or IIB. Based on these similarities, it was assumed that MtlR is a DNA-binding protein whose activity is regulated by the PTS (8.Stulke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28 (abstr.): 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this paper, we link phosphorylation of the individual domains of MtlR by HPr and IICBmtl to the regulation of this protein. The residues involved in HPr- and IICBmtl-dependent phosphorylation are mapped and correlated with either an increase or decrease in the affinity of MtlR for DNA. In addition to PRD-I and PRD-II, a third phosphorylation domain is presented that is involved in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of MtlR by IICBmtl.

The labeled primer was purified by chloroform/phenol and chloroform extractions followed by ethanol precipitation. 19 pmol of the labeled forward primer was built into a 473-base pair probe by PCR in a mixture containing 10 mm Tris, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase, 57 pmol of universal reverse primer (5′-ACAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′), and 1 ng of template DNA. The pSK-derived subclone pSKCH550, containing the area of the mannitol promoter fromClaI (position −354) to HindIII (position +212), was used as template DNA. After 30 cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 55 °C, and 1-min elongation at 72 °C, the 473-base pair PCR product was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel and isolated from the gel with the QIAGEN gel extraction kit. Before use, MtlR and its mutants were dephosphorylated by incubation at 30 °C for 2 h at pH 6.5. The protein was diluted to 1 μm in phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.25% decylpolyethylene glycol, end concentration) containing different combinations of PTS components. The concentrations of these components, when added, were 5 mmP-enolpyruvate, 0.04 mg/ml EI, 9 μm HPr, 0.2 μm IIA, 0.02 μm IICBmtl, and 5 mm mannitol. After 2 h of phosphorylation at 30 °C, the incubated protein was diluted to various concentrations in the same phosphorylation mixture without MtlR. A 30-μl volume of diluted MtlR was mixed with 20 μl of the DNA binding mixture (25 mmTris (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, and 30 kcpm labeled DNA) and was incubated for 16 min at 30 °C. The DNA was digested by adding 50 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.03 units/μl RQ1 DNase I and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The digestion was stopped with 90 μl of 0.6 m NaAc, 30 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 30 μg/μl yeast tRNA. The digest was then purified by chloroform/phenol extraction and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of EtOH at −20 °C. Samples were separated on a 5% sequencing gel. [32P]P-enolpyruvate was synthesized following the method of Roossien et al.(17.Roossien F.F. Brink J. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MtlR and the PTS enzymes were diluted in phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Following separation of the proteins on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis, phosphorylation of proteins was visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 425. The autoradiogram was analyzed using the ImageQuant program. MtlR was phosphorylated by PTS enzymes as described above for 40 min at 30 °C. 1.7 murea, 2.2 mm CaCl2, and 30 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin were added to a 30 μg/ml concentration of the phosphorylated protein. After 2 min at 37 °C, sample buffer (4% SDS, 12% (w/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% Serva blue G) was added and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein fragments were separated by Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Schagger and von Jagow (18.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated peptides were analyzed with the PhosphorImager; N-terminal His-tagged peptides were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His tag antibodies. Two domains, PRD-I and PRD-II, are expected to contain the phosphorylation sites based on the homology of MtlR to anti-terminators such as SacY and BglG and the DNA-binding regulators LicR and LevR. Alignment of these domains reveals two conserved histidines in each PRD (Fig. 1, B and C) that could be the phosphorylation sites involved in the regulation of MtlR. To demonstrate their involvement, mutants were made in which one or two of the conserved histidines were replaced by alanine. Wild-type MtlR and mutant MtlR were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography. The expression levels, yield, and purity of all the mutants are comparable to those of the wild-type protein (data not shown). The purified proteins were used in [32P]P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation and footprint experiments to examine the effects of the mutation on HPr- and IICBmtl-dependent phosphorylation and the binding properties of the protein for the mannitol operator. The removal of phosphorylation sites by mutating one or two of the conserved histidines was tested using [32P]P-enolpyruvate as a substrate. MtlR and MtlR mutants were incubated in two different phosphorylation mixtures: one containing [32P]P-enolpyruvate, EI, and HPr and the other containing [32P]P-enolpyruvate, EI, HPr, IIAmtl, and IICBmtl. By using a relatively low HPr concentration in the second mixture, the observed phosphorylation could be attributed primarily to IICBmtl-dependent phosphorylation; a control was performed with a mixture without IICBmtl to obtain HPr-dependent background phosphorylation levels under these conditions. The data in Fig.2 A show clearly that the replacement of each of the two conserved histidines of PRD-II prevented or strongly reduced the phosphorylation by HPr, whereas mutations in PRD-I did not noticeably affect HPr-dependent phosphorylation. This indicates that both histidines of PRD-II are essential for MtlR phosphorylation by HPr. It is possible that PRD-I is the phosphorylation target of IICBmtl. However, all of the mutants with replacements in PRD-I or PRD-II could still be phosphorylated by IICBmtl, including the H236A/H348A and H295A/H405A double mutants, in which a histidine is replaced in both PRD-I and PRD-II. This indicates that there is another or an additional phosphorylation target for IICBmtl on the protein. A careful analysis of the MtlR sequence was performed to identify additional putative phosphorylation sites. A sequence with low sequence identity to IIA proteins of the fructose family, including IIAmtl of B. stearothermophilus, was found at the C terminus of MtlR (Fig. 1 D). IIA proteins or domains are responsible for the transfer of the phosphoryl group from HPr to the B domain of the transporter. The new putative phosphorylation site is His-598 since it aligns with the active-site phosphohistidines of the IIA proteins. To test whether His-598 is involved in PTS-dependent phosphorylation, H598A mutants were made, and32P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation was performed as described for the PRD mutants. Based on these experiments (Fig. 2 B), HPr-dependent phosphorylation was not affected by the H598A, H236A/H598A, or H295A/H598A mutation. On the other hand, the IICBmtl-dependent phosphorylation levels of all H598A mutants were affected; they did not exceed the HPr background phosphorylation. These data indicate that the H598A mutation strongly reduces or completely inhibits IICBmtl-dependent phosphorylation. The phosphorylation experiments described above do not exclude HPr-dependent phosphorylation of PRD-I. We must consider whether mutations in PRD-II have reduced the efficiency of phosphorylation of PRD-I by HPr. Initial protease digestion experiments showed that MtlR can be primarily cut at sites in between PRD-I and PRD-II (data not shown). This implied that the phosphorylation of PRD-I by HPr or IICBmtl could be resolved using limited proteolysis of MtlR. This was done by phosphorylation of wild-type MtlR by HPr or IICBmtl using [32P]P-enolpyruvate, followed by partial digestion of the phosphorylated protein by α-chymotrypsin. Phosphorylated fragments were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The phosphorylated fragments were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 3 A). Fragments containing the N-terminal His tag were colored using His tag-specific antibodies (Fig. 3 B). The mass of each fragment was determined using a partial CNBr digest of MtlR as a reference. Digestion of the intact protein, phosphorylated by HPr (Band I in Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and digested by α-chymotrypsin, resulted in two new labeled fragments with masses of 44 and 36 kDa (Bands II and III, respectively, in Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The 36-kDa band was identified as an N-terminal fragment by the anti-His tag antibodies (Fig.3 B, lane 2). Both bands are probably the result of a single cut of MtlR at tyrosine 329 (tyrosine 307 in the non-His-tagged protein) since the masses of both bands add up to that of the intact protein. This implies that HPr can phosphorylate Band III containing PRD-I and Band II containing PRD-II and the IIA-like domain. Both fragments were phosphorylated to approximately the same extent. When the protein was phosphorylated by IICBmtl, only Band II, containing PRD-II and the IIA-like domain, was phosphorylated. This excludes a possible phosphorylation of PRD-I by IICBmtl. The weak bands, visible in lanes containing the uncut protein (Fig. 3), are probably phosphorylated degradation products of MtlR that could not be removed during purification (7.Henstra S.A. Tuinhof M. Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4754-4770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additional cleavage products containing the IICBmtl phosphorylation site His-598 could explain the additional labeled polypeptides such as fragment IV present only in digests of MtlR phosphorylated by IICBmtl (Fig.3 A, lane 4). The affinity of MtlR for DNA is dependent on its phosphorylation state (7.Henstra S.A. Tuinhof M. Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4754-4770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since mutations affecting PTS-dependent phosphorylation would also affect the response of the protein to different phosphorylation conditions, we performed quantitative DNA footprint experiments using several mutants. Four different phosphorylation conditions per mutant were examined: 1) dephosphorylation of MtlR in the presence of EI, HPr, IIAmtl, IICBmtl, and mannitol (Fig.4, ■); 2) phosphorylation of MtlR by HPr in the presence of P-enolpyruvate, EI, and HPr (○); 3) phosphorylation of MtlR by HPr and IICBmtl in the presence of P-enolpyruvate, EI, HPr, IIAmtl, and IICBmtl(▵); and 4) phosphorylation of MtlR by HPr in the presence of P-enolpyruvate, EI, and HPr and simultaneous dephosphorylation by IICBmtl and mannitol (▿). Since MtlR was purified in a phosphorylated form, MtlR and its mutants were first dephosphorylated by incubation at pH 6.5 for 2 h at 30 °C. After incubation of MtlR and the mutant proteins under the different phosphorylation conditions, the proteins were diluted to various concentrations using the same phosphorylation mixtures to maintain identical phosphorylation conditions during the DNA binding experiments for all dilutions. Binding of MtlR to DNA was followed by measuring the intensity of the footprint located at positions −46 to −41 (7.Henstra S.A. Tuinhof M. Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4754-4770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The level of protection of this region at each protein concentration was calculated from the decrease in intensity of this area compared with that of the unprotected DNA. These values are plotted against the logarithm of the protein concentration for each phosphorylation condition and each mutant in Fig. 4. The midpoint of the sigmoidal curves represents the concentration of MtlR that gives a protection level of 50% and is a measure of the affinity of the protein for DNA. Wild-type MtlR (Fig.4 A) behaved under the four phosphorylation conditions as observed previously (7.Henstra S.A. Tuinhof M. Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4754-4770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by HPr resulted in a small increase, whereas phosphorylation by HPr and IICBmtlresulted in a decrease in binding affinity compared with the non-phosphorylated protein. Maximal stimulation was observed with the combination of phosphorylation of MtlR by HPr and dephosphorylation via IICBmtl and mannitol. When one of the conserved histidines in PRD-I was replaced (Fig. 4,B and C), the affinity of these mutants, when phosphorylated by HPr (○) alone or by HPr and IICBmtl(▵), increased 4–5-fold compared with the affinity of wild-type MtlR under these conditions (Fig. 4 A). This indicates that PRD-I is probably involved in the negative control of MtlR by HPr and IICBmtl. An additional site involved in negative control is likely since the affinity of these mutants phosphorylated by HPr alone could be reduced by the addition of IIAmtl and IICBmtl. Also, the affinity of PRD-I mutants phosphorylated by HPr could still be increased when they were simultaneously dephosphorylated by IICBmtl and mannitol (▿), but to a lesser extent than wild-type MtlR. The affinity of the PRD-I double mutant H236A/H295A (Fig. 4 D) was reduced compared with those of the single mutants. The trends observed for the single mutants were still present in the double mutant, except when the protein was phosphorylated by HPr and IICBmtl (▵). Under these phosphorylation conditions, stimulation of affinity was observed compared with the non-phosphorylated mutant (■), which was not seen in the H236A or H295A single mutant (compare ■ and ▵ in Fig. 4,B–D). If one or both conserved histidines of PRD-II was replaced by alanine (Fig. 4, E–G), the positive effects of phosphorylation by HPr disappeared (▿ and ○). Phosphorylation by HPr alone (○) resulted even in a decrease in affinity for the DNA compared with the non-phosphorylated protein (■). The negative effects of phosphorylation by IICBmtl appeared to be unaffected in these mutants (▵). The observed negative effect of phosphorylation by HPr (○) on these mutants disappeared if the protein was simultaneously dephosphorylated by IICBmtl and mannitol (▿). However, under these conditions, the affinity of the protein did not exceed that of the non-phosphorylated protein (compare ▿ and ■). Replacement of His-598 by alanine had a dramatic effect on the regulation of MtlR by the PTS. The H598A mutant had a low affinity under all phosphorylation conditions, comparable to that of wild-type MtlR phosphorylated by HPr and IICBmtl. It was suggested that HPr could play a dual role in the regulation of MtlR since maximal stimulation of DNA binding was observed when MtlR was both phosphorylated by HPr and dephosphorylated by IICBmtl. Dephosphorylation of one of the PRDs by IICBmtl could be a possible explanation. When a site can be phosphorylated by HPr and subsequently dephosphorylated by IICBmtl, P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphoryl transfer from HPr to IICBmtl via this site on MtlR must be possible. The transfer of a phosphate group from P-enolpyruvate via EI, HPr, MtlR, and IICBmtl to mannitol can be followed by measuring the formation of [3H]mannitol phosphate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The formation of mannitol phosphate was followed against time in the presence (Fig.5, ○) and absence (■) of P-enolpyruvate. In the absence of P-enolpyruvate, formation of mannitol phosphate to a certain level was observed, indicating that one or several of the added proteins were already phosphorylated. The P-enolpyruvate-independent phosphorylation of mannitol was not observed if MtlR was replaced by IIAmtl, indicating that MtlR is the phosphoryl donor in the P-enolpyruvate-independent phosphorylation event (Table III). The end level of the P-enolpyruvate-independent reaction is a measure for the number of phosphoryl groups present on MtlR. A linear increase in the level of mannitol phosphate was observed (▵) when the difference between the reaction with (○) and without (■) P-enolpyruvate was plotted against the reaction time. The P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphoryl transfer rate can be calculated from the slope of this line and is dependent on the MtlR concentration used (data not shown). The phosphoryl transfer via MtlR is not efficient compared with the phosphoryl transfer by IIAmtl. The turnover via IIAmtl is ∼45 times higher than that via MtlR.Table IIIP-enolpyruvate-dependent and -independent phosphoryl transfer activities of MtlR and its mutantsMutantPEPaPEP, P-enolpyruvate.-dependent activityPEP-independent phosphorylation levelnmol min −1 g −1mol P/mol MtlRWild-type290.9"
https://openalex.org/W2061199004,"Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis in combination with chemical modification of mutated residues, we have studied the roles of cysteine and arginine residues in the mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our strategy consisted of the sequential replacement of each of the four endogenous cysteine residues with Ser or in the case of Cys73 with Val. Wild-type and mutated forms of the CTP were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. During the sequential replacement of each Cys, the effects of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sulfhydryl reagents were examined. The data indicate that Cys73 and Cys256 are primarily responsible for inhibition of the wild-type CTP by hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents. Experiments conducted with triple Cys replacement mutants (i.e. Cys192 being the only remaining Cys) indicated that sulfhydryl reagents no longer inhibit but in fact stimulate CTP function 2–3-fold. Following the simultaneous replacement of all four endogenous Cys, the functional properties of the resulting Cys-less CTP were shown to be quite similar to those of the wild-type protein. Finally, utilizing the Cys-less CTP as a template, the roles of Arg181 and Arg189, two positively charged residues located within transmembrane domain IV, in CTP function were examined. Replacement of either residue with a Cys abolishes function, whereas replacement with a Lys or a Cys that is subsequently covalently modified with (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide, a reagent that restores positive charge at this site, supports CTP function. The results clearly show that positive charge at these two positions is essential for CTP function, although the chemistry of the guanidinium residue is not. Finally, these studies: (i) definitely demonstrate that Cys residues do not play an important role in the mechanism of the CTP; (ii) prove the utility of the Cys-less CTP for studying structure/function relationships within this metabolically important protein; and (iii) have led to the hypothesis that the polar face of α-helical transmembrane domain IV, within which Arg181, Arg189, and Cys192 are located, constitutes an essential portion of the citrate translocation pathway through the membrane.

Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The CTP plays an essential role in intermediary metabolism in that it supplies the cytoplasm with citrate, which can then function as a carbon source for fatty acid and sterol biosyntheses and can also generate NAD+ for use in glycolysis (2.Watson J.A.

Thus, it has been purified and reconstituted (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bisaccia F.

Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, the mitochondrial CTP from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been identified via overexpression followed by functional reconstitution of the purified protein product (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).In the present paper we report the construction and optimization of a cysteine-less (i.e. Cys-less) yeast mitochondrial CTP, which upon overexpression and functional reconstitution displays properties that are quite similar to the wild-type transporter. We also report novel effects of sulfhydryl reagents on the functioning of single, double, and triple Cys replacement mutants that were sequentially constructed during the development of the final Cys-less CTP. Finally, we report the use of the Cys-less CTP to probe the roles of Arg181 and Arg189 in the transport mechanism. This work not only demonstrates that cysteines are not essential to the CTP translocation mechanism but importantly: (i) provides insight as to which cysteines are responsible for sulfhydryl reagent-mediated inhibition; (ii) demonstrates the suitability of the Cys-less CTP for a variety of structure/function analyses; and (iii) provides important new information regarding the role of positive charge and Cys192 within transmembrane domain IV of the CTP.DISCUSSIONThe main goals of the present investigation were 3-fold, namely: (i) a determination of whether any of the four endogenous cysteine residues are critical to the CTP transport mechanism, as well as which residues are responsible for the well documented sulfhydryl reagent-mediated inhibition of CTP function; (ii) the construction of a cysteine-less CTP that displays wild-type functional properties; and (iii) the subsequent use of the Cys-less construct to probe the roles of Arg181 and Arg189 in CTP function. In the process of attaining these goals significant new information concerning molecular aspects of CTP function has been obtained as detailed below.Our data concerning the effects of hydrophobic and hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents on the function of the various Cys replacement mutants permit several interesting conclusions. First, based on our observation that the double C28S/C73S mutant is considerably less sensitive to inhibition by hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents (e.g. MTSET, MTSES, and a low concentration of pCMBS) compared with the single C28S mutant (Table I), we conclude that Cys73 is likely located in a water-accessible domain within transmembrane domain II and that its modification is partly responsible for the observed inhibition of the wild-type transporter with hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents. Although it is tempting to speculate that Cys73 may actually reside on a face of α-helical transmembrane domain II that constitutes a portion of the citrate translocation pathway, an unambiguous determination of this will clearly require further study. It should also be noted that our observation that the C28S/C73S double mutant can still be completely inhibited by other sulfhydryl reagents (i.e. mersalyl, pCMB, MTSEA, and a high concentration of pCMBS) clearly implicates involvement of one or both of the remaining two cysteines (i.e. Cys192 and/or Cys256) in the sulfhydryl reagent-mediated inhibition observed with the wild-type transporter. The data presented in Table I support involvement of the latter residue. Thus, with the C256S single replacement mutant, we also observe a considerable diminution of the inhibition observed with the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents. As depicted in Fig. 1, Cys256 is predicted to reside within an interhelical loop that is likely to reside in a hydrophilic milieu. It is noteworthy that the presence of a Cys in the loop connecting helices V and VI appears to be characteristic of other members of the mitochondrial anion carrier family (e.g. the ADP/ATP translocase (25.Muller V. Basset G. Nelson D.R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16132-16143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the uncoupling protein (26.Winkler E. Wachter E. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), suggesting that it may play an important structural role. Taken together, our data suggest that residues Cys73 and Cys256 are primarily responsible for inhibition observed with the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents.The observation that the triple Cys replacement mutants C28S/C73S/C256S and C28S/C73S/C256A were no longer inhibited but in fact could be stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents was quite unexpected. This increase was observed with both hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic reagents and was independent of the charge of the reagent. Thus, although sulfhydryl reagents typically inhibit transporter function via a steric blockage of either substrate binding and/or the translocation pathway, it appears that with these mutants the modification of Cys192has actually enhanced the V max of the transporter. Further investigation indicated that both theK m and V max are proportionally increased and that the substrate specificity is relaxed slightly. As depicted in Fig. 1, Cys192 is thought to reside near the entrance of transmembrane domain IV into the lipid bilayer. We postulate that this residue may reside near the entrance of the translocation pathway such that a small conformational change in this region can substantially alter transporter function. Two related points merit comment. First, modification of the triple Cys replacement mutant renders its function more similar to the wild-type transporter than prior to its modification. Thus, it appears that the addition of charge and/or mass to Cys192 partially compensates for the deleterious effects of multiple Cys replacements by Ser. Second, there is an example of a similar type of effect in the literature; namely, with the mitochondrial phosphate carrier, it has been shown that modification of a single Cys causes the transporter to convert from an antiport to a uniport mode (19.Schroers A. Kramer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The data presented in Tables Table IV, Table V, Table VI clearly demonstrate that upon simultaneous replacement of all four endogenous cysteines with either Ser or Val, the final Cys-less CTP displays functional properties (i.e. K m, V max, substrate specificity, requirement for intraliposomal substrate) that are very similar to those observed for the wild-type transporter. Thus, for all intents and purposes the Cys-less CTP function mimics wild-type transporter function, and we therefore conclude that structure/function relationships determined for the Cys-less transporter are likely to be directly applicable to the wild-type carrier. This conclusion provides the foundation for the studies presented in the next portion of this paper, as well as for much of our future mutagenesis program. Our results also clearly demonstrate that none of the four endogenous cysteines are required for CTP function. Thus, the well documented observation that cysteine-specific reagents abolish wild-type CTP activity (Table I) likely arises as a consequence of a steric effect but certainly is not due to the functional importance of the cysteinyl residue in either the secondary structure or the transport mechanism of the CTP. In this regard, the CTP is similar to several other carriers (e.g. the lac permease (16.Van Iwaarden P.R. Pastore J.C. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9595-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the UhpT anion exchange protein (17.Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial phosphate transporter (19.Schroers A. Kramer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the uncoupling protein (20.Arechaga I. Raimbault S. Prieto S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Zaragoza P. Miroux B. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) that have been studied in this manner.It is interesting that Cys73 is quite sensitive to the nature of the replacement residue such that Val or Ala are much less disruptive of CTP function compared with Ser (Table IV). Thus placement of a residue with increased H bonding capacity and hydrophilicity compared with the starting Cys in transmembrane α-helix II is not well tolerated. Although the exact cause for this deleterious effect is not clear at this time, there is precedence for this type of effect with other transport proteins (e.g. the lacpermease (16.Van Iwaarden P.R. Pastore J.C. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9595-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and the UhpT anion exchange protein (17.Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)).With the Cys-less CTP in hand, our first mutagenesis experiments have focused on two positively charged residues, namely Arg181and Arg189. These were of particular interest because of their intramembranous location, plus the fact that at position 181 an Arg or Lys is found in many different mitochondrial anion transporters. In contrast, at position 189 an Arg is conserved among mitochondrial CTPs from several species but not among other mitochondrial anion carriers. Thus, both residues might be of mechanistic importance, 181 being involved in a function characteristic of most of the anion carriers and 189 being involved in a function specific for the CTP. Utilizing a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and sulfhydryl group modification, our studies clearly indicate that although the chemistry of the guanidinium group is not required at either site, positive charge is absolutely required at both sites. Thus at either position, arginine, lysine, and MTSEA-modified Cys, all support CTP function to varying extents. As depicted in Fig.2, within each of these side chains the positive charge is primarily distributed among several hydrogen atoms that reside approximately 5–10 angstroms from the peptide backbone. In contrast the MTSET-modified Cys, which does not support CTP function, displays a considerably more delocalized positive charge as well as a bulkier side chain. For example the molecular volumes of Arg, Lys, and Cys-MTSEA range from 106 to 125 Å3, as compared with the much larger Cys-MTSET (173 Å3). Thus it appears that a combination of charge distribution and/or steric size and shape may be important. Furthermore, the lack of CTP activity with the negatively charged, intermediately sized Cys-MTSES derivative suggests that the nature of the charge at this site is important, although a steric explanation is also plausible.It is of interest to note that preincubation of proteoliposomes containing the R189C transporter with a high concentration of alkylamines (of varying size) did not rescue CTP function. The rationale for these studies originated from investigations with thelac permease (23.Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10027-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which showed that following the mutation of an intramembranous positively charged residue to a neutral residue and the resulting inactivation of transport because of the generation of an uncompensated charge, alkylamines could subsequently rescue transporter function by mimicking the missing charged side chain and providing the required charge neutralization. However, rescue occurred only when the initial residue (prior to mutation) was not essential or important to the transport mechanism. This observation, in combination with our findings that: (i) alkylamines did not rescue the function of the R189C CTP mutant and (ii) there is an absolute requirement for positive charge at position 189 in the CTP suggests an important mechanistic role for Arg189 in CTP function.A related point concerns the fact that the yeast mitochondrial phosphate transporter also contains two positively charged residues (i.e. Lys179 and Lys187) that reside within its fourth α-helical transmembrane domain (27.Briggs C. Mincone L. Wohlrab H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5096-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These residues are predicted to reside on the same face of an α-helix and similar to our findings with the CTP, amino acid replacements are tolerated as long as positive charge is maintained at each site.Finally, we believe it important to point out that Arg181, Arg189, and Cys192 are located on the same face of the α-helix comprising CTP transmembrane domain IV, and our data clearly indicate that mutation and/or covalent modification of any one of these residues causes important functional consequences. Taken together, our results support the importance of this helical domain in CTP function and have led to the formulation of a hypothesis, which states that: (i) the polar face of α-helical transmembrane domain IV constitutes a portion of the citrate translocation pathway through the membrane and (ii) Arg181 and Arg189 may be involved in binding other negatively charged intramembranous residues and/or citrate in a competitive manner, and such interactions constitute an essential step in the antiport reaction and possibly in CTP substrate discrimination. A determination of which negatively charged residues are involved and the potential effect of citrate on such interactions will be the subject of future investigations. The mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP)1 from higher eukaryotes catalyzes an obligatory exchange of citrate plus a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane for either another tricarboxylate + H+, a dicarboxylate, or phosphoenolpyruvate (1.Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The CTP plays an essential role in intermediary metabolism in that it supplies the cytoplasm with citrate, which can then function as a carbon source for fatty acid and sterol biosyntheses and can also generate NAD+ for use in glycolysis (2.Watson J.A. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5993-6002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Endemann G. Goetz P.G. Edmond J. Brunengraber H. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 88-89Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because of its importance, the CTP has been extensively characterized. Thus, it has been purified and reconstituted (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bisaccia F. De Palma A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), kinetically characterized (8.Bisaccia F. De Palma A. Prezioso G. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), cloned (9.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13682-13690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpressed (10.Xu Y. Mayor J.A. Gremse D. Wood D.O. Kaplan R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, the mitochondrial CTP from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been identified via overexpression followed by functional reconstitution of the purified protein product (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present paper we report the construction and optimization of a cysteine-less (i.e. Cys-less) yeast mitochondrial CTP, which upon overexpression and functional reconstitution displays properties that are quite similar to the wild-type transporter. We also report novel effects of sulfhydryl reagents on the functioning of single, double, and triple Cys replacement mutants that were sequentially constructed during the development of the final Cys-less CTP. Finally, we report the use of the Cys-less CTP to probe the roles of Arg181 and Arg189 in the transport mechanism. This work not only demonstrates that cysteines are not essential to the CTP translocation mechanism but importantly: (i) provides insight as to which cysteines are responsible for sulfhydryl reagent-mediated inhibition; (ii) demonstrates the suitability of the Cys-less CTP for a variety of structure/function analyses; and (iii) provides important new information regarding the role of positive charge and Cys192 within transmembrane domain IV of the CTP. DISCUSSIONThe main goals of the present investigation were 3-fold, namely: (i) a determination of whether any of the four endogenous cysteine residues are critical to the CTP transport mechanism, as well as which residues are responsible for the well documented sulfhydryl reagent-mediated inhibition of CTP function; (ii) the construction of a cysteine-less CTP that displays wild-type functional properties; and (iii) the subsequent use of the Cys-less construct to probe the roles of Arg181 and Arg189 in CTP function. In the process of attaining these goals significant new information concerning molecular aspects of CTP function has been obtained as detailed below.Our data concerning the effects of hydrophobic and hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents on the function of the various Cys replacement mutants permit several interesting conclusions. First, based on our observation that the double C28S/C73S mutant is considerably less sensitive to inhibition by hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents (e.g. MTSET, MTSES, and a low concentration of pCMBS) compared with the single C28S mutant (Table I), we conclude that Cys73 is likely located in a water-accessible domain within transmembrane domain II and that its modification is partly responsible for the observed inhibition of the wild-type transporter with hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents. Although it is tempting to speculate that Cys73 may actually reside on a face of α-helical transmembrane domain II that constitutes a portion of the citrate translocation pathway, an unambiguous determination of this will clearly require further study. It should also be noted that our observation that the C28S/C73S double mutant can still be completely inhibited by other sulfhydryl reagents (i.e. mersalyl, pCMB, MTSEA, and a high concentration of pCMBS) clearly implicates involvement of one or both of the remaining two cysteines (i.e. Cys192 and/or Cys256) in the sulfhydryl reagent-mediated inhibition observed with the wild-type transporter. The data presented in Table I support involvement of the latter residue. Thus, with the C256S single replacement mutant, we also observe a considerable diminution of the inhibition observed with the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents. As depicted in Fig. 1, Cys256 is predicted to reside within an interhelical loop that is likely to reside in a hydrophilic milieu. It is noteworthy that the presence of a Cys in the loop connecting helices V and VI appears to be characteristic of other members of the mitochondrial anion carrier family (e.g. the ADP/ATP translocase (25.Muller V. Basset G. Nelson D.R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16132-16143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the uncoupling protein (26.Winkler E. Wachter E. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), suggesting that it may play an important structural role. Taken together, our data suggest that residues Cys73 and Cys256 are primarily responsible for inhibition observed with the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents.The observation that the triple Cys replacement mutants C28S/C73S/C256S and C28S/C73S/C256A were no longer inhibited but in fact could be stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents was quite unexpected. This increase was observed with both hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic reagents and was independent of the charge of the reagent. Thus, although sulfhydryl reagents typically inhibit transporter function via a steric blockage of either substrate binding and/or the translocation pathway, it appears that with these mutants the modification of Cys192has actually enhanced the V max of the transporter. Further investigation indicated that both theK m and V max are proportionally increased and that the substrate specificity is relaxed slightly. As depicted in Fig. 1, Cys192 is thought to reside near the entrance of transmembrane domain IV into the lipid bilayer. We postulate that this residue may reside near the entrance of the translocation pathway such that a small conformational change in this region can substantially alter transporter function. Two related points merit comment. First, modification of the triple Cys replacement mutant renders its function more similar to the wild-type transporter than prior to its modification. Thus, it appears that the addition of charge and/or mass to Cys192 partially compensates for the deleterious effects of multiple Cys replacements by Ser. Second, there is an example of a similar type of effect in the literature; namely, with the mitochondrial phosphate carrier, it has been shown that modification of a single Cys causes the transporter to convert from an antiport to a uniport mode (19.Schroers A. Kramer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The data presented in Tables Table IV, Table V, Table VI clearly demonstrate that upon simultaneous replacement of all four endogenous cysteines with either Ser or Val, the final Cys-less CTP displays functional properties (i.e. K m, V max, substrate specificity, requirement for intraliposomal substrate) that are very similar to those observed for the wild-type transporter. Thus, for all intents and purposes the Cys-less CTP function mimics wild-type transporter function, and we therefore conclude that structure/function relationships determined for the Cys-less transporter are likely to be directly applicable to the wild-type carrier. This conclusion provides the foundation for the studies presented in the next portion of this paper, as well as for much of our future mutagenesis program. Our results also clearly demonstrate that none of the four endogenous cysteines are required for CTP function. Thus, the well documented observation that cysteine-specific reagents abolish wild-type CTP activity (Table I) likely arises as a consequence of a steric effect but certainly is not due to the functional importance of the cysteinyl residue in either the secondary structure or the transport mechanism of the CTP. In this regard, the CTP is similar to several other carriers (e.g. the lac permease (16.Van Iwaarden P.R. Pastore J.C. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R.

Finally, we believe it important to point out that Arg181, Arg189, and Cys192 are located on the same face of the α-helix comprising CTP transmembrane domain IV, and our data clearly indicate that mutation and/or covalent modification of any one of these residues causes important functional consequences. Taken together, our results support the importance of this helical domain in CTP function and have led to the formulation of a hypothesis, which states that: (i) the polar face of α-helical transmembrane domain IV constitutes a portion of the citrate translocation pathway through the membrane and (ii) Arg181 and Arg189 may be involved in binding other negatively charged intramembranous residues and/or citrate in a competitive manner, and such interactions constitute an essential step in the antiport reaction and possibly in CTP substrate discrimination. A determination of which negatively charged residues are involved and the potential effect of citrate on such interactions will be the subject of future investigations.

The central role of arginine 39 of this 8-kDa peripheral polypeptide has been established by a series of mutations. The neutral substitution R39Q leads to a 250-fold increase of the dissociation constant K d of the photosystem I-ferredoxin complex, as large as the increase induced by PsaE deletion. At pH 8.0, this K d value strongly depends on the charge of the residue substituting Arg-39: 0.22 μmfor wild type, 1.5 μm for R39K, 56 μm for R39Q, and more than 100 μm for R39D. The consequences of arginine 39 substitution for the titratable histidine were analyzed as a function of pH. The K d value of R39H is increased 140 times at pH 8.0 but only 5 times at pH 5.8, which is assigned to the protonation of histidine at low pH. In the mutant R39Q, the association rate of ferredoxin was decreased 3-fold compared with wild type, whereas an 80-fold increase is calculated for the dissociation rate. We propose that a major contribution of PsaE is to provide a prominent positive charge at position 39 for controlling the electrostatic interaction and lifetime of the complex with ferredoxin.

It is found in oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, including cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae, and higher plants. In cyanobacteria, the PSI complex can be isolated as monomers or trimers (1.Boekema E.J. Dekker J.P. van Heel M.G. Rögner M. Saenger W. Witt I. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 283-286Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is partly embedded in the membrane bilayer and constituted of 11 subunits, whose nomenclature (PsaA to PsaF and PsaI to PsaM) is derived from the gene names. The large subunits PsaA and PsaB are organized as a central heterodimeric core that houses most of the chlorophylls involved in light trapping and the redox cofactors required in electron transfer. Numerous structural details on the organization of this core have been gained from the successive improvements in the x-ray structure of PSI trimers from Synechococcus elongatus. The last map was calculated at 4-Å resolution yielding a more precise structural model of the reaction center domain and of the core antenna system (2.Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Fromme P. Krauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE are easily removed from the core complex by chaotropic agents and are considered as extrinsic subunits (3.Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1994: 319-360Crossref Google Scholar). The good accessibility of PsaD and PsaE on the stromal side of PSI has been clearly demonstrated in the past by electron microscopy, proteolysis studies, and epitope mapping (4.Lagoutte B. Vallon O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5.Zilber A.L. Malkin R. Plant Physiol.

These two subunits have been proposed as candidates for the binding and orientation of soluble ferredoxin to PSI. Based on cross-linking experiments, PsaD was the first subunit to be reported as being directly involved in the ferredoxin binding, and associated residues in the functional cross-linked complex were identified (7.Zanetti G. Merati G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8.Zilber A.L. Malkin R. Plant Physiol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2160-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). First mutagenesis studies established a role of this subunit in the overall reduction process of ferredoxin (11.Xu Q.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PsaC, -D, and -E have now been clearly localized by electron microscopy in a ridge of 30 Å height protruding from the membrane bilayer on the stromal side of PSI (13.Böttcher B. Graber P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14.Kruip J. Chitnis P.R. Lagoutte B. Rögner M. Boekema E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17061-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This ridge is in contact with the electron acceptor proteins, ferredoxin or flavodoxin (10.Lelong C. Boekema E.J. Kruip J. Bottin H. Rögner M. Sétif P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2160-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15.Mühlenhoff U. Kruip J. Bryant D. Rögner M. Sétif P. Boekema E.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PsaC occupies a central position in this ridge. This subunit carries the terminal electron acceptors of PSI, FA and FB([4Fe-4S] clusters), the latter being the direct electron donor to the [2Fe-2S] center of soluble Fd. In electron density maps, PsaC is flanked by two compact regions ascribed to PsaD and PsaE, PsaD facing toward the trimer axis C3 and PsaE being the more distant and located outside (Refs. 2.Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Fromme P. Krauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar and 16.Klukas O. Schubert W.-D. Jordan P. Krauß N. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7351-7360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Fig. 5). Cyanobacterial PsaE is a slightly basic, water-soluble protein that contains 69–75 residues. Although the cyanobacterial proteins are significantly smaller than their mature homologues from higher plants (91–101 amino acids), the common sequence of PsaE proteins is highly conserved (17.Rousseau F. Lagoutte B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 260: 241-244Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18.Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 83-177Crossref Google Scholar). No significant homology to other proteins has been found in sequence data bases. NMR studies in solution of the overexpressed PsaE from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 have shown that the isolated polypeptide is composed of a rigid, five-stranded β-barrel, with an extended flexible loop between the third and fourth β-strands (19.Falzone C.J. Kao Y.-H. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Lecomte J.T.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6052-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, the representative NMR model of PsaE was fit into the electron density map of PSI. The superimposition of the NMR and x-ray model structures of PsaE reveals both to be almost identical in the core region (16.Klukas O. Schubert W.-D. Jordan P. Krauß N. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7351-7360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PsaE-deleted strains of synechocystis and Synechococcus were originally reported to have no obvious phenotypic alterations (20.Chitnis P.R. Reilly P.A. Miedel M.C. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18374-18380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was later shown that the PsaE subunit was necessary for an efficient reduction of Fd (21.Rousseau F. Setif P. Lagoutte B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequently, more careful physiological investigations revealed that the growth rate of the deletion mutant from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was considerably reduced at low light intensity or low carbon dioxide level (22.Zhao J. Snyder W.B. Mühlenhoff U. Rhiel E. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This phenotype suggested that the PsaE subunit might play a role in cyclic electron transport. Apart from these functional implications, different biochemical studies pointed to a stabilizing role of this subunit on the stromal side of PSI (23.Chitnis P.R. Nelson N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 99: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24.Weber N. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Some cross-linking experiments on higher plants PSI indicated a proximity of PsaE and ferredoxin:NADP+oxidoreductase (25.Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Möller L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but a high yield cross-linked product between PsaE and Fd was never reported. It becomes clear now that all the three subunits PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE participate to some extent in the formation of the ferredoxin site. A specific role of PsaD and PsaE on the association and dissociation rates of Fd has been proposed from studies on deleted mutants, with a 100-fold decreased affinity for Fd when PsaE is absent (26.Barth P. Lagoutte B. Sétif P. Biochemistry. 1998; 46: 16233-16241Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More detailed information on some specific residues of PsaD and PsaC (12.Hanley J. Sétif P. Bottin H. Lagoutte B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,27.Fischer N. Hippler M. Sétif P. Jacquot J.-P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) involved in this process are also available, but no precise amino acid of PsaE has yet been described as essential for this interaction. In the present work, we clearly show by a series of single site-directed mutations that a unique arginine at position 39 plays a central role in the PsaE-mediated Fd interaction with PSI. Recombinant ferredoxin was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The fed1 gene ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cloned into a pRSet expression vector. Transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A 48-h growing time is required to get a sufficient yield of Fd. The inducer isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside has been found dispensable when using the LB medium (28.Jacquot J.-P. Stein M. Suzuki A. Liottet S. Sandoz G. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, resuspended in a Tris-HCl buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5), and broken in a French press. Cellular debris were sedimented at 9000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the whole cell extract was stepwise precipitated with ammonium sulfate (40, 55, and 70% saturation). Ferredoxin is purified from the last supernatant as already described (29.Bottin H. Lagoutte B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30.Lelong C. Sétif P. Bottin H. André F. Neumann J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14462-14473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ferredoxin from the last purification step was concentrated by ultrafiltration and usually frozen at a concentration of 200 μm in a low ionic strength buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0). Approximately 2–5 mg of purified ferredoxin was obtained from 1 liter of induced cells. Variant PsaE-PSI were isolated from recombinantSynechocystis. Thylakoid membranes were obtained from French press broken cells after extensive washing with ice-cold 20 mm Tricine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8. PSI was obtained after solubilization with 1% (w/v) β-DM and purified on a sucrose density gradient (31.Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upper green band consisting of highly enriched monomeric PSI particles was dialyzed against 20 mmTricine/NaOH, pH 7.8, and 0.03% β-DM and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The chlorophyll concentration was determined in 80% acetone. The last step of the purification procedure was anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column essentially as described (31.Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only modification was the substitution of ammonium sulfate instead of magnesium sulfate as eluting salt to avoid any contamination by Mg2+, whose concentration is a critical parameter for the reduction of Fd. The psaE gene was previously cloned into the Bluescript SK+ plasmid to produce pFBsCE (21.Rousseau F. Setif P. Lagoutte B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Codon exchanges, leading to amino acid substitutions, were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis by the method of Kunkel (32.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4892) Google Scholar). For this technique, 20-base oligonucleotide primers were constructed such that a codon change resulted in an amino acid substitution. The desired nucleotide substitution in the genes encoding the mutant proteins was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the complete gene. The strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 deleted for thepsaE gene (6803 ΔE) was used to raise site-directed mutants of PsaE. Mutants were generated by direct transformation of the 6803 ΔE with the pFBsCE constructs and grown for a 24-h period in liquid BG11. Selection of transformants was carried out by serial dilution in the presence of increasing chloramphenicol concentrations (from 1 to 30 μg/ml). Once resistance to 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol was established, the selection procedure was continued through further 8–10 rounds of liquid subculture. Genomic DNA from liquid cultures of Synechocystisvariants was isolated as described previously (33.Tandeau de Marsac N. Borrias W.E. Kuhlemeier C.J. Castets A.M. van Arkel G.A. van den Hondel C.A.M.J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 20: 11-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and used for control sequencing. A 360-base pair fragment encompassing the fullpsaE sequence was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction procedure (12.Hanley J. Sétif P. Bottin H. Lagoutte B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and sequencing reactions were carried out by the dideoxy termination method using the cycle sequencing kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Electrophoreses were made on mini-slab gels (Bio-Rad apparatus) using the Tris/Tricine buffer system (34.Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10452) Google Scholar). The concentration of P700 was measured in all mutated PSI samples, by flash-absorption spectroscopy at 820 nm, and a constant amount of 125 pmol of P700 was loaded for each sample after 1 h dissociation in the loading buffer at 45 °C. Electroblotting of the proteins was made overnight at 4 °C using two layers of Immobilon P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a constant current of 10 mA. PsaE was probed with a polyclonal antibody (21.Rousseau F. Setif P. Lagoutte B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed by an alkaline phosphatase anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Sigma) and a luminescent substrate (Immun-star, Bio-Rad). Under these conditions, variable amounts of the PsaE polypeptide were recovered on the two successive membrane layers. This could reflect different behaviors as a result of the different mutations and a possible heterogeneity of the local electric field. It underlines the necessity of a careful survey of the blotting conditions before getting confident quantitations. Quantitation was made by adding the integrated optical densities on the two x-ray films. The yields of recovery for all six mutated PsaE polypeptides were found between 89 and 104% of the WT, which is in the range of cumulated errors of the technique (Table I).Table ICharacteristics of Fd reduction by WT and PsaE site-directed mutants of PSIAmount of PsaE subunit detected by immunoblotSecond-order rate constantk onDissociation constantK dt 1/2 of first-order Fd reduction%10 8 m −1 s −1μmμsWT1002.7a±1.0; this relatively large uncertainty is due to the measuring conditions (1 experiment with [PSI] = [Fd] = 0.24 μm).0.22<1/20/125R42Q92bNot measured.0.41idem wtR39K1013.0a±1.0; this relatively large uncertainty is due to the measuring conditions (1 experiment with [PSI] = [Fd] = 0.24 μm).1.5idem wtR39H970.87cMeasured from a linear fit of k obs of slow phase versus [Fd] (Fig. 2, bottom).31<1/20R39Q910.84cMeasured from a linear fit of k obs of slow phase versus [Fd] (Fig. 2, bottom).56<1/25R39D890.27cMeasured from a linear fit of k obs of slow phase versus [Fd] (Fig. 2, bottom).>100dNot measured, amplitude too small.R39E1040.18cMeasured from a linear fit of k obs of slow phase versus [Fd] (Fig. 2, bottom).>100dNot measured, amplitude too small.PsaE minus01.5cMeasured from a linear fit of k obs of slow phase versus [Fd] (Fig. 2, bottom).52<1/16All spectroscopic measurements were performed at pH 8.0.a ±1.0; this relatively large uncertainty is due to the measuring conditions (1 experiment with [PSI] = [Fd] = 0.24 μm).b Not measured.c Measured from a linear fit of k obs of slow phase versus [Fd] (Fig. 2, bottom).d Not measured, amplitude too small. Open table in a new tab All spectroscopic measurements were performed at pH 8.0. Measurements were made as described previously, in cuvettes of either 1-cm or 2-mm optical path length (26.Barth P. Lagoutte B. Sétif P. Biochemistry. 1998; 46: 16233-16241Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 2-mm cuvettes were used for mutants of low affinity, using high Fd concentrations. Kinetic curves were corrected according to Sétif and Bottin (35.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), so that they correspond solely to electron transfer from the terminal acceptor of PSI (FA, FB)−, to Fd. For PSIs having a relatively high affinity for Fd (K d ≤ 1.5 μm), it is not possible to obtain second-order rate constants from experiments made under pseudo-first order conditions (with [Fd] ≫ [PSI]). In that case, determination of second-order rate constants was performed with equal concentrations of PSI and Fd (≈0.24 μm), allowing use of an analytical function to fit the data (36.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All kinetic measurements were performed at a constant ionic strength of 56 mm, taking into account all contributions from the buffer, sodium ascorbate (1–3 mm) and added salts. Constant buffer and MgCl2 concentrations were used throughout the experiments (20 and 5 mm, respectively). The NaCl concentration (30 mm) was adjusted in order to provide an ionic strength of 56 mm. Dissociation constants were determined from the dependence of the sum of first-order amplitudes upon Fd concentration. For mutants R39D and R39E of PsaE, this was not attempted for two different reasons as follows: first, the first-order amplitude was rather small and became only observable at Fd concentrations above 30 μm. Under these conditions, the second-order process is sufficiently fast and predominant to impede a precise determination of the first-order decay. Second, the first-order amplitude increases only slightly between 32 and 64 μm Fd, which is the maximal Fd concentration that was tested (R39D, from 30 to 32% of total amplitude of Fd reduction; R39E, from 19 to 23%). This suggests that a PSI·Fd complex cannot be formed in 100% of PSI, even at very high Fd concentrations. Although a precise analysis is beyond the precision of our data, it seems that the maximum (asymptotic) proportion of PSI·Fd complexes is less than 50% in both R39D and R39E. Fd reduction by WT PSI has been studied inSynechocystis 6803 by flash-absorption spectroscopy at room temperature in the 460–600-nm region (see under “Experimental Procedures”) (35.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The wavelength of 580 nm has been selected in this work to minimize signals not related to Fd reduction on the microsecond time scale. All measurements were made by subtracting a reference signal without Fd, so that the kinetics directly represent Fd reduction (35.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Three different first-order phases of Fd reduction have been reported with half-times (t 12) of ≈500 ns and 15 and 110 μs (36.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These phases correspond to electron transfer within PSI·Fd complexes preformed before the flash excitation; it may reflect the presence of three, closely related, subclasses of complexes. A second-order rate of Fd reduction has been also previously measured, which is thought to correspond to a diffusion-limited process (k on = 2–5 × 108m−1 s−1) (35.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants K d for the PSI·Fd complex were calculated from the dependence of first-order amplitudes upon Fd concentration (35.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36.Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A recent modification in the final purification step of PSI led to a somewhat decreasedK d of the PSI·Fd complex (0.22 μminstead of ≈0.5 μm at pH 8.0). An equivalent decrease was not observed for the PsaE-deleted mutant (52 μm for both types of preparations). A number of site-directed mutations on positively charged residues were previously made on PsaE. They were more or less drastic, sometimes resulting in the non-integration of PsaE, but none of them led to interesting phenotypes in terms of ferredoxin reduction (21.Rousseau F. Setif P. Lagoutte B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two highly conserved arginines, Arg-39 and Arg-42, escaped this first series of mutations and were first replaced in the present work by the neutral glutamine. Fd reduction by PSI prepared from the R39Q and R42Q mutants is illustrated in Fig. 1. At a Fd concentration of about 1 μm, Fd reduction is very similar in R42Q and WT PSI with a dominating first-order process (traces b and c, respectively). The three first-order phases previously found for WT PSI are recovered in the R42Q mutant (t 12 <1, 20, and 125 μs). TheK d values for the PSI·Fd complex were in the same range for WT and R42Q (0.22 and 0.41 μm, respectively). In contrast with R42Q, Fd reduction is dramatically affected in R39Q. In the presence of ≈1 μm Fd, no first-order phase is present, and only a second-order process of Fd reduction is observed on a slower time scale (not shown). However, at much larger Fd concentrations, a first-order phase becomes visible (trace eof Fig. 1, [Fd] = 16 μm). The first-order components are nevertheless small at this Fd concentration (left partof trace e), and a second-order process is still predominant (right part of trace e). This process is very similar to that previously observed with PsaE-minus PSI (trace f; Ref. 26.Barth P. Lagoutte B. Sétif P. Biochemistry. 1998; 46: 16233-16241Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This close behavior is further confirmed at higher Fd concentrations up to 64 μm. The K d for R39Q was calculated from the fit of the total first-order amplitude dependence versus Fd concentration (Fig.2, upper part). A value of 56 μm was found, which is very close to theK d value of 52 μm for PsaE-minus PSI. Second-order rate constants k on were also calculated from linear fits of the observed rate of the slowest phase (Fig. 2, lower part): a 3-fold decrease ink on is observed for R39Q (0.84 × 108m−1 s−1) compared with WT (2.7 × 108m−1s−1) (Table I). A decrease of about 2-fold is also found compared with PsaE-minus (1.5 × 108m−1 s−1). The different characteristics of Fd reduction at pH 8.0 are given for WT, PsaE-minus, R39Q, and R42Q in Table I, together with characteristics of the other mutants studied in the present work. The amounts of the PsaE polypeptides, as found by immunoblotting (see under “Experimental Procedures”), are also reported for all mutants in Table I, showing a WT level of integration of the PsaE subunit in all site-directed mutants.Figure 2Characteristics of Fd reduction by PsaE mutants obtained from flash-induced absorbance changes at 580 nm. Upper part, sum of amplitudes of the fast first-order components of Fd reduction as a function of Fd concentration for R39Q (closed circles) and R39H (open triangles) at pH 8.0 (experimental conditions as in Fig. 1; 2-mm cuvette, [PSI] = 1.06 μm). These data were fitted (R39Q, continuous line; R39H, dotted line) assuming a simple binding equilibrium between PSI and Fd and by taking the maximal asymptotic value of Fd reduction as a fixed parameter. These values were obtained from the total amplitudes of first- and second-order components (1.51 × 10−4 and 1.25 × 10−4 for R39Q and R39H, respectively). From these fits, dissociation constants of 56 and 31 μm were calculated for R39Q and R39H, respectively. Lower part, rate of the slower phase of Fd reduction as a function of Fd concentration for PsaE-minus (crosses), R39H (open triangles), R39Q (closed circles), R39D (closed squares), and R39E (closed triangles) PSI (experimental conditions as in Fig.1; 2-mm cuvette, [PSI] ≈1.1 μm; 1-cm cuvette, [PSI] ≈0.2 μm). Linear fits were performed to get the second-order rate constants of Fd reduction (PsaE-minus, 1.5 × 108m−1 s−1; R39H, 0.87 × 108m−1s−1; R39Q, 0.84 × 108m−1 s−1; R39D, 0.27 × 108m−1 s−1; R39E, 0.18 × 108m−1s−1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Arginine 39 was then changed for residues of the same or reverse charge, and also for histidine, a titratable residue at physiological pH. A kinetic trace of the fast reduction process is shown for mutant R39K in Fig. 1(trace a; [Fd] = 2 μm). In this trace, fast first-order components are observed on a 400-μs time scale, but the signal amplitude is smaller than for WT or R42Q (traces cand b, respectively) and represents only about 50% of ferredoxin reduction (≈50% being due to a slower second-order process, which contributes only marginally on this time scale). A quantitative analysis of R39K kinetics shows a 7-fold decrease in affinity compared with WT (K d = 1.5 μm; Table I) but no modification of the second-order rate constant k on (3.0 × 108m−1 s−1). R39H mutated PSI is much more affected and behaves like R39Q PSI (traces b anda, respectively, upper part of Fig.3) with a 140-fold decrease in Fd affinity (Table I) and a similarly 3-fold decreased second-order rate constant (0.87 × 108m−1s−1). This suggests that His-39 is in a neutral deprotonated form at pH 8.0. A more detailed study of the R39H mutant is described below. When Arg-39 is replaced by an acidic residue (Asp or Glu), Fd reduction becomes even less efficient than in R39Q or R39H mutants (R39D,trace d of Fig. 1, Table I). At all Fd concentrations that were studied (up to 64 μm), the second-order rate constant is largely dominant, suggesting that K dvalue is larger than 100 μm (more than 500-fold decrease in affinity). With both R39D and R39E mutants, a quantitative determination of K d was not attempted (see under “Experimental Procedures”). A semi-quantitative analysis of our data indicates that the maximum (asymptotic) proportion of PSI·Fd complexes is less than 50% in both R39D and R39E. Compared with R39Q and R39H, the second-order rate constants k on of R39D and R39E are also significantly smaller, with values of 0.27 and 0.18 × 108m−1s−1, respectively (lower part of Fig. 2).

To identify potential targets of these kinases, we examined Pyk2 (a member of the focal adhesion kinase family) using an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte line, D1. We demonstrate that stimulation of D1 (or normal pro-T) cells by IL-7 rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of Pyk2, with kinetics slightly lagging that of Jak1 and Jak3 phosphorylation. Conversely, IL-7 withdrawal resulted in a marked decrease of Pyk2 phosphorylation. Pyk2 was found to be physically associated with Jak1 prior to IL-7 stimulation and to increase its association with IL-7Rα chain following IL-7 stimulation. Pyk2 appeared to be involved in cell survival, because antisense Pyk2 accelerated the cell death process. Activation of Pyk2 via the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors using carbachol or via intracellular Ca2+ rise using ionomycin/phorbol myristate acetate promoted survival in the absence of IL-7. These data support a role for Pyk2 in coupling Jak signaling to the trophic response.

This leads to a variety of important cellular responses including proliferation to IL-2 (34.Miyazaki T. Takaoka A. Nogueira L. Dikic I. Fujii H. Tsujino S. Mitani Y. Maeda M. Schlessinger J.

Because Pyk2 was implicated in other types of signals in hematopoietic cells and neurons we analyzed its role in IL-7 signaling in an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte line. Pyk2 was shown to be rapidly activated by IL-7 signaling and to mediate survival signals. D1 is an IL-7-dependent thymocyte cell line that was generated from p53 knockout mice. The growth medium for D1 cells was RPMI 1640 supplemented withl-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μm, Life Technologies, Inc.), fetal bovine serum (10%, Hyclone), and murine recombinant IL-7 (50 nm, Peprotech). Normal thymus was obtained by performing timed breeding of C57BL/6 mice maintained at the NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center facility (Frederick, MD). Embryonic thymocytes were obtained from embryos at day 14 of gestation. To block Pyk2 synthesis, antisense oligonucleotides were used. The sequence of antisense was as follows: 5′-GGCTCGGACACCCCAGACAT-3′. We used as controls the sense sequence 5′-ATGTCTGGGGTGTCCGAGCC-3′ and an irrelevant sequence of the same nucleotide composition as the sense oligonucleotide 5′- TTCGGTCGAGGTCCGGAGCT-3′. Cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides (20 μm) in the absence of IL-7 and then received 50 nm IL-7 12 h later. Cell viability was assessed at different times thereafter. After washing twice in RPMI 1640, D1 cells were cultured in IL-7-free medium for 12 h and stimulated with recombinant murine IL-7 (50 ng/ml) for various times. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 100 μmNa3VO4, and cells were immediately pelleted and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 150 mm Nacl, 50 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 (or 1% digitonin for coimmunoprecipitation assays), 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated for 2 h in the presence of rabbit anti-Pyk2 antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Jak3 (Upstate Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-Jak1 (Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were captured using protein G/protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h, then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and denatured in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Cell lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Tyrosine phosphorylation or the presence of immunoprecipitated proteins was detected by protein immunoblotting. Phosphotyrosine was detected using the specific antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by incubation with a peroxydase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 as a secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were stripped and reprobed using monoclonal antibodies to Pyk2, Jak1 (Transduction Laboratories), Jak3 (Upstate Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-IL-7Rα. Bound antibodies were visualized using the chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Pyk2, anti-Jak1, or anti-Jak3 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of the biotinylated exogenous substrate, poly(Glu-Tyr) (Pierce), previously fixed for 30 min in avidin-coated plates. The kinase reaction was conducted for 15 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm ATP. The plates were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation of peptide was detected by using 1/500 diluted peroxydase-labeled anti-PY20 and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as the peroxydase substrate. The OD was measured at 450 nm. A standard phosphopeptide was run in the same plate. To evaluate the role of Pyk2 in the IL-7 signaling pathway, we first analyzed whether Pyk2 was phosphorylated on tyrosine following stimulation of the D1 cell line by IL-7. D1 cells were cultured without IL-7 for 12 h and then stimulated with IL-7 for various times. Immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that phosphorylation of Pyk2 underwent a marked, and transient, enhancement. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the Pyk2 phosphorylation level increased within 2 min and declined 5 min after IL-7 stimulation. In the absence of IL-7, a basal level of Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was also always evident upon longer exposure of the membrane. Equal amounts of Pyk2 protein were immunoprecipitated at all time points as indicated by the loading control (Fig.1 A). In parallel, using the same cell extracts, phosphorylation of Jak3 (Fig. 1 B) and Jak1 (Fig.1 C) was examined and showed a somewhat different pattern compared with Pyk2. Jak1 and -3 showed less basal phosphorylation in the absence of IL-7 than Pyk2. Phosphorylation of Jak1 and -3 was slightly faster than Pyk2 and did not show the decline after 2 min observed with Pyk2. We analyzed whether the PYK2 signaling pathway that we observed in the D1 cell line also occurred in normal pro-T cells. Data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrates that PYK2 protein is highly expressed in day 14 embryonic thymus, which contains a mixture of IL-7-responsive pro-T1 and T2 cells (4.Kim K. Lee C.K. Sayers T.J. Muegge K. Durum S.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5735-5741PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-7 induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 in vitro after depriving the cells of IL-7 for 6 h (Fig. 2). These data verify that PYK2 is involved in IL-7 signaling during T cell development. We examined the state of Pyk2 phosphorylation during IL-7 withdrawal and observed (Fig. 3) that by 2 h after IL-7 withdrawal, phosphorylation had declined to a basal level that persisted until 18 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 also decreased very rapidly, disappearing by 4 h, whereas phosphorylation of Jak3 declined much more slowly (Fig. 3). Thus the initial decline in Pyk2 phosphorylation would be compatible with its being a direct substrate of Jak1, which showed a parallel decline in phosphorylation following IL-7 withdrawal. The data also suggest that a kinase other than Jak1 maintained Pyk2 phosphorylation between 2 and 18 h following IL-7 withdrawal. The enzymatic activity of Pyk2 was measured using in vitrokinase assays with poly(Glu-Tyr) as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 A, stimulation by IL-7 induced a marked increase of the kinase activity of Pyk2. The onset of this increase correlated with the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig. 1 A). Both Jak1 and Jak3 showed similar increases in kinase activity following IL-7 stimulation as shown (Fig. 4), which correlated with their tyrosine phosphorylation status (Fig. 1,B and C). Early events in IL-7 signaling involve cross-linking IL-7Rα with γc whose intracellular domains are associated with Jak1 and Jak3, respectively. To determine whether there was a physical association of Pyk2 with these other signaling components, we examined whether Pyk2 coimmunoprecipitated with IL-7Rα, Jak3, or Jak1. We found that Pyk2 was constitutively associated with Jak1 before and after IL-7 stimulation (Fig.5). In contrast, no association of Pyk2 with Jak3 was detected. We also observed that IL-7Rα coimmunoprecipitated with Pyk2 (Fig. 5); a basal association was observed, and then an increase occurred upon IL-7 stimulation. This would be consistent with Pyk2 directly binding Jak1, the latter increasing its association with IL-7Rα following IL-7 stimulation. Whether PYK2 is a direct enzymatic substrate of Jak1 remains to be investigated. Our present data suggest that Pyk2 could be a possible target of Jak1 because the two are physically associated and because phosphorylation of Pyk2 slightly lags that of Jak1 (Fig. 1). The D1 cell line is dependent on IL-7 for survival, IL-7 withdrawal resulting in complete cell death by 30 h. Up to 18 h after IL-7 withdrawal, D1 cells can be rescued by the readdition of IL-7. To determine whether Pyk2 played a role in cell survival, the effect of antisense oligonucleotide against Pyk2 was compared with control oligonucleotides (sense sequence and a control irrelevant sequence). D1 cells were treated with oligonucleotides in the absence of IL-7; then after 12 h, IL-7 was added. Although IL-7 readdition could rescue sense- and control-treated cells from death, Pyk2 antisense markedly inhibited cell survival for at least 48 h (Fig.6 A). Following antisense Pyk2, we observed about 50% dead cells after 18 h and over 70% after 30 h (compared with 9 and 6% for the sense control oligonucleotide). As shown in Fig. 6 B the level of Pyk2 is inhibited in the presence of antisense Pyk2, whereas the sense sequence does not have an effect. These data indicate that Pyk2 is critical for the survival of D1 cells. Because Pyk2 is also activated by G protein-coupled receptors, we examined whether the IL-7 survival signal could be mimicked by other stimuli that also activate Pyk2. Carbachol, a pharmacological agonist of the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, improved cell survival in the absence of IL-7 (Fig. 7 A) and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig. 7 B). Ca2+ influx has also been shown to activate Pyk2 in many cell types. Therefore calcium ionophore (together with phorbol myristate acetate) at suboptimal concentrations was tested and found to improve cell survival in the absence of IL-7 (Fig. 7 C) as well as inducing Pyk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7 D). The kinetics of activation using ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were similar to that observed in the presence of IL-7 with a peak of phosphorylation observed by 2–3 min, which decreased afterward. In addition, the use of either carbachol or suboptimal concentrations of ionomycin/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not show any significant increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown). These data suggest that PYK2 is involved in cell survival rather than in proliferation, but it remains possible that it also has replication activities that cooperate with other IL-7-induced activities. Thus, two alternative methods of activating Pyk2 partially mimic the IL-7 survival stimulus in D1 cells, suggesting that one survival pathway from the IL-7 receptor incorporates Pyk2, but that other pathways are also required for long term survival. Protein-tyrosine kinases have been shown to mediate a variety of cytokine signals. The present study implicates the protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 in the pathway leading from the IL-7 receptor to cell survival. Following IL-7 stimulation, Pyk2 became tyrosine-phosphorylated and increased its enzymatic activity. Blocking Pyk2 synthesis inhibited cell survival, and activating Pyk2 (by alternative stimuli) promoted survival. Pyk2 was physically associated with Jak1 and IL-7Rα. The initial events in IL-7 receptor signaling are presumed to resemble that of other cytokine receptors sharing γc (44.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), IL-2 (45.Gomez J. Gonzalez A. Martinez A.C. Rebollo A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 185-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-4 (46.Nelms K. Huang H. Ryan J. Keegan A. Paul W.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 452: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) receptors being the best studied. Thus, IL-7 would first bind to the IL-7Rα chain and then that complex would attract γc, which carries Jak3 on its intracellular domain. Jak3 would then phosphorylate IL-7Rα, and Jak1, which is associated with it, activating the latter. The phosphorylated IL-7Rα chain would then bind other proteins, such as Stat5, via their SH2 domains, and they would in turn become phosphorylated by Jak1 and Jak3. Phosphorylated Stats would then translocate to the nucleus and serve as transcription factors. The preceeding model of IL-7 receptor signaling is partly based on presumed parallels in the IL-2 and -4 pathway, as well as on several other lines of evidence. IL-7 has been shown to activate Jak1, Jak3, and Stat5 (11.Foxwell B.M. Beadling C. Guschin D. Kerr I. Cantrell D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Jak3 indeed appears to be essential for IL-7 signaling, because its knockout (16.Park S.Y. Saijo K. Takahashi T. Osawa M. Arase H. Hirayama N. Miyake K. Nakauchi H. Shirasawa T. Saito T.

Immunopathol. 1998; 19: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) resembles an IL-7 deficiency in mice. A Jak1 requirement is also verified by its knockout, which shows a defect in IL-7 signaling (19.Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D. King K.L. Sheehan K.C. Yin L.

On the other hand, Stat5 deficiency (26.Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van-Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) does not show a defect in the IL-7 receptor signaling pathway. What then are the substrates of the Jaks in the IL-7 receptor system? Whereas other Stats may be substrates, our current findings suggest another type of potential Jak substrate, the protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2, which we show undergoes a rapid rise in tyrosine phosphorylation following IL-7 stimulation. We suggest that Pyk2 could be a Jak1 (rather than Jak3) substrate because Jak1 and Pyk2 were shown to be physically associated (Fig. 3), although the basal phosphorylation of Pyk2 (in the absence of IL-7) could be because of a different kinase. Pyk2 is related to p125-Fak and is expressed primarily in cells of the neuronal and hematopoietic lineages (28.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The knockout of Fak is embryonic lethal (50.Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Nature. 1975; 377: 539-544Google Scholar); its role being thought to include signaling from integrins, turnover of focal adhesion, and anti-apoptotic effects of cell contact with the extracellular matrix in the adult nervous system. Pyk2 displays a high degree of sequence similarity with Fak over most of its sequence, and perhaps its anti-apoptotic action in the IL7 receptor pathway is similar to that of Fak. Pyk2 was shown to be phosphorylated on tyrosine after ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors or treatment with agents that elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration (28.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 37.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Slessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) stimuli that partly mimicked the trophic action of IL-7 in the current studies. Whereas we observed a physical association of Pyk2 with Jak1, others have previously observed that Pyk2 can also associate with other kinases and other types of proteins, possibly via parts of its noncatalytic domains including its phosphotyrosine residues being recognized by the SH2 domains of other proteins. Pyk2 does not itself contain SH2 or SH3 binding domains, but it contains the cannonical binding site (Tyr-881) for the SH2 domains of Src and Grb2. Associations of Pyk2 with SH2-containing Src kinases and Grb2 were reported (31.Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Slessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 51.Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Ganju R.K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent studies concluded that, in interferon γ or IL-2 signaling, Pyk2 was preassociated with Jak2 (35.Takaoka A. Tanaba N. Mitani Y. Miyazaki T. Fujii H. Sato M. Kovarik P. Decker T. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or with Jak3 (34.Miyazaki T. Takaoka A. Nogueira L. Dikic I. Fujii H. Tsujino S. Mitani Y. Maeda M. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), respectively. Those studies did not detect significant complexing of Jak1 with Pyk2, as we observe here, nor did we detect significant Pyk2·Jak2 or Pyk2·Jak3 complexes. Perhaps cell types differ in this regard, or introducing proteins by overexpression (in those studies) influences these protein interactions. We also noted an increasing association of Pyk2 with IL-7Rα following IL-7 stimulation. This association could be explained by a preassembled Jak1·Pyk2 complex becoming associated with IL-7Rα via Jak1, even a third party could be involved, or could also represent a direct association of Pyk2 with IL-7Rα. There is a region in Pyk2 (54.Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that is homologous to the region in Janus kinases (4.1/JEF) (55.Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 751-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that directs their association with cytokine receptors. If there is a direct Pyk2·IL-7Rα complex, perhaps it positions Pyk2 so that it can become phosphorylated. The trophic action of IL-7 is partly based on the induction of Bcl-2 (4.Kim K. Lee C.K. Sayers T.J. Muegge K. Durum S.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5735-5741PubMed Google Scholar) and partly on effects on Bax; 2Khaled, A. R., Kim, K., Hofmeister, R., Muegge, K., and Durum, S. K. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 14476–14481. how Pyk2 relates to these or other survival functions has not yet been determined. A number of pathways could be involved downstream of Pyk2. The association of Pyk2 with the Grb2·Sos1 complex may link Pyk2 to the small GTPase Ras signaling pathway as well as the signaling pathways of the Rho family GTPases CDC42 and Rac1 (33.Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Slessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These GTPases are regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as Vav and by GTPases such as Ras (56.Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 57.Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 58.Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Pyk2 can function as an upstream mediator of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and/or JNK signaling pathways. Pyk2-induced activation of Src kinase is necessary for phosphorylation of Shc and p130Cas, and their association with the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Crk, respectively, and for the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and JNK cascades (59.Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The Grb2·Sos complex connects Pyk2 to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, whereas adaptor proteins p130Cas and Crk link Pyk2 with the JNK pathway (59.Blaukat A.

A recent report also indicated the activation of p38 MAPK by overexpression of Pyk2, and the use of a dominant negative mutant of MKK3, an upstream component of p38, inhibits Pyk2-induced p38 MAPK activity (60.Pandey P. Avraham S. Kumar S. Nakazawa A. Place A. Ghanem L. Rana A. Kumar V. Majumder P.K. Avraham H. Davis R.J. Kharbanda S. J. Biol.

Additionally, several recently defined cellular proteins, such as the GTPase-activating protein for RhoA and Cdc42, amino-terminal domain-interacting receptors, and Pap proteins, were also shown to constitutively associate with Pyk2 and to be potential target substrates for Pyk2 (61.Ohba T. Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 62.Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Ca2+ stimulation of adenylyl cyclase type I (ACI) and adenylyl cyclase type VIII (ACVIII) is mediated by calmodulin and the site on these adenylyl cyclases that interacts with calmodulin has been defined. By contrast, the mechanism whereby Ca2+ inhibits adenylyl cyclase type V (ACV) and adenylyl cyclase type VI (ACVI) is unknown. In this study, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ were compared to probe the involvement of E-F hand-like domains in both Ca2+ stimulation and inhibition of ACVIII and ACVI, respectively. HEK 293 cells transfected with ACVIII cDNA and C6–2B glioma cells (where the endogenous adenylyl cyclases is predominantly ACVI) were used to compare the effects of these three cations in in vitro and in vivomeasurements. The in vitro data identified two Ca2+ regulatory sites for both ACVIII and ACVI. Strikingly different potency series for these cations at mediating high affinity stimulation and inhibition of ACVIII and ACVI, respectively, effectively rule out the possibility that calmodulin or proteins utilizing similar Ca2+-binding motifs mediate inhibition of ACVI. On the other hand, the low affinity inhibition that is common to both ACVIII and ACVI showed virtually identical potency profiles for the IIa cation series, indicating a common site of action. Remarkably, whereas Sr2+ was rather ineffective at regulating these cyclases (particularly ACVI) in vitro, adequate concentrations accumulated in the vicinity of these enzymes as a consequence of capacitative cation entry to partially regulate both of these activities in vivo.

More than half of these adenylyl cyclases can be regulated by Ca2+, resulting in either inhibition or stimulation of activity. ACI1 and ACVIII are stimulated by Ca2+, acting through loosely bound calmodulin via identified domains on the enzymes (3.Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By contrast, the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ inhibition of ACV and ACVI is unknown (2.Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ inhibits ACV and ACVI over the same (submicromolar) concentration range as it stimulates ACI and ACVIII, it is not known whether the inhibition is mediated directly on the enzymes or via calmodulin or another Ca2+-binding protein. Examples are available in the literature: for instance phosphorylase kinase, where non-dissociable calmodulin mediates the effect of Ca2+ on enzyme activity (8.Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Richman P.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 489-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In addition, an array of Ca2+-binding proteins have been described that could potentially play roles in the inhibitory regulation of adenylyl cyclase (2.Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of course, it is also possible that Ca2+ binds directly to adenylyl cyclase to regulate its activity, as it does to synaptotagmins and phospholipase A2 (9.Li C. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10.Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this regard, it had been proposed that the inhibition of ACV activity by Ca2+ is through direct Ca2+ binding to the C1b region of ACV (11.Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although recent studies have questioned this conclusion (12.Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35539-35545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of Ca2+-stimulable and -inhibitable adenylyl cyclases to the IIa series of divalent cations, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, could provide a first step in determining whether they are regulated by similar or different mechanisms, since, for instance, E-F hand Ca2+-binding motifs display characteristic preferences for these cations (13.Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the ability of adenylyl cyclases to be regulated by Ca2+ transitions provides a key point for the integration of Ca2+ and cAMP signaling (14.Cooper D.M.F. Mons N.E. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In intact cells, Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases, either endogenously or heterologously expressed, require capacitative Ca2+ entry for their regulation, rather than Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or nonspecific, ionophore-mediated Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane (15.Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16.Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Consequently, the regulation of adenylyl cyclases by divalent cation entry in the intact cell may also provide some insight into selective features displayed by particular adenylyl cyclases in their in vivo setting. The present studies compared the effects of the IIa series of divalent cations, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, inin vitro and in vivo assays on the activities of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (type VI and VIII). Inin vitro assays, quite different potency series were observed by low concentrations of calcium and related cations for the stimulation and inhibition, respectively, of ACVIII and ACVI, which strongly suggested that the inhibition of ACVI is not mediated by calmodulin. By contrast, the inhibition of ACVIII and ACVI that is elicited by high concentrations of Ca2+ and related cations displayed similar potency series, which intimated that it is mediated at a conserved site in all adenylyl cyclases. The in vivoexperiments provided a different perspective on the cellular aspects of the regulation of these adenylyl cyclases. Whereas Sr2+ had been relatively weak in in vitro assays, in the intact cell, adequate concentrations of Sr2+ could accumulate via capacitative entry mechanisms to permit regulation of high affinity sites. This latter observation reinforces earlier observations that adenylyl cyclases are far more sensitive monitors of capacitative cation entry than are cytosolic indicators (15.Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17.Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

[2-3H]Adenine, [3H]cAMP, and [α-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fura-2/AM and Pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were from Sigma. C6–2B rat glioma cells were maintained in F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Gemini) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were plated at approximately 70% confluence in 24-well plates for cAMP accumulation experiments. HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and neomycin (100 μg/ml) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Wild type ACVIII and an N-terminal deletion form of ACVIII, termed NΔ1–106, in pcDNA3 (7.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were expressed in HEK 293 cells. Transfections were performed on HEK 293 cells at about 50% confluence, using the calcium phosphate method described by Chen and Okayama (18.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Seventeen hours after transfection, the cells from 75-cm2 flasks were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.06% EDTA, plated onto 24-well culture plates, and incubated for 2 days before cAMP measurements were made. C6–2B rat glioma cells and HEK 293 cells transfected with ACVIII cDNA plasmids, were lysed using a method described previously (19.Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K.A. Gonzales E. Guillou J.L. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18093-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Crude membranes were prepared following mechanical shearing of the cells by passage through a 22-gauge needle, 10 times, in homogenization buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mg of DNase/50 ml, and protease inhibitors as described (20.Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of 52.3 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 52.4 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. The supernatant from a low speed centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 1 min, SS-34 Sorvall) was pelleted (12,000 rpm, 10 min, SS-34 Sorvall), resuspended in assay buffer (40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 800 μm EGTA and 0.25% bovine serum albumin), and used immediately. A plasma membrane preparation from NΔ1–106-transfected HEK 293 cells was made using sucrose gradients (7.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The adenylyl cyclase activity of the C6–2B glioma cell membranes and transfected HEK 293 cell membranes was measured in the presence of the following components: 12 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm cAMP, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 70 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.04 mm GTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm), and 20 μm forskolin. Calmodulin (1 μm) was added in the assays of ACVIII-transfected HEK 293 cell membranes, but not in the assays of NΔ1–106-transfected HEK 293 cell membranes or C6–2B glioma cell membranes. Free Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ concentrations were established from a series of CaCl2, SrCl2, and BaCl2 solutions buffered with 200 μm EGTA in the assay, using the computer program BAD4 (21.Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated with sodium lauryl sulfate (0.5%), [3H]cAMP was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantified as described previously (22.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Data points are presented as mean activities ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. The data from HEK 293 cells expressing ACVIII and from C6–2B glioma cells were fitted to two-component competitive binding curves, using the program Inplot 4.04 (GraphPad Software Inc.). The equation fitted was:Y = A + (B −A)(C/(1 + 10 X /10 D) + (100 −C)/(1 + 10 X /10 E))/100, whereY is adenylyl cyclase activity and X is the free cation concentration. A is the lowest and B is the highest point of the curve, and C is the percentage of high affinity site. D and E are the log(EC50) values for the high and low affinity sites, respectively. The Sr2+ and Ba2+ data from C6–2B glioma cells and NΔ1–106-transfected cells fit better to single-site competition curves. The equation is:Y = A + (B −A)/(1 + 10 X /10 C). The parameters have similar meanings as in the equation above, except thatC is the log(EC50). In intact cells cAMP accumulation was measured according to the method of Evans et al. (23.Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (15.Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cells on 24-well plates were incubated (60 min at 37 °C) with [2-3H]adenine (1.5 μCi/well) to label the ATP pool. The cells were then washed once and incubated with a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer (900 μl/well) containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mmMgCl2, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2m Tris base. The use of Ca2+-free Krebs buffer in experiments denotes the addition of 0.1 mm EGTA to the nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer. All experiments were carried out at 30 °C in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) and Ro 20–1724 (100 μm), which were preincubated with the cells for 10 min prior to a 1-min assay. Cells were preincubated for 4 min with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, at a final concentration of 100 nm. This has the effect of passively emptying intracellular Ca2+ stores, establishing a low basal [Ca2+]i, and priming the cells for capacitative Ca2+ entry (24.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Assays were terminated by addition of 5% (w/v final) trichloroacetic acid and the percentage of conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP was measured as described previously (22.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Means ± S.D. of triplicate determination are indicated. The data were fitted to four-parameter sigmoid curves with the program SigmaPlot 4.0, as with the in vitro adenylyl cyclase curves described above. [Ca2+]i was measured in populations of HEK 293 cells and C6–2B glioma cells, using fura-2 as the Ca2+ indicator, exactly as described previously (15.Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The same experimental protocol was employed for the determination of cytosolic Sr2+ and Ba2+ concentrations. The maximum fluorescence ratio (R max) and minimum fluorescence ratio (R min) of each experiment were measured after the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and EGTA to the cell suspension. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the equation, [Ca2+]i =K d((R −R min)/(R max −R))(F 380E/F 380T), where F 380T and F 380E are the emission fluorescence values at 380 nm excitation in the presence of Triton X-100 and EGTA. The excitation wavelength pair used for the measurement of [Sr2+]i and [Ba2+]i was 350 and 390 instead of 340 and 380 for [Ca2+]i (25.Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheK d values, 224 nm for Ca2+, 2.62 μm for Sr2+, and 780 nm for Ba2+ were used in the calculation (25.Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII is mediated through loosely bound calmodulin. Therefore, the effects of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ at stimulating the activity of ACVIII in vitro would be expected to mimic the binding of these cations by calmodulin. The effects of these cations at stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity in plasma membranes from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with ACVIII cDNA is examined in the experiment shown in Fig.1 A. The activity of ACVIII was progressively stimulated by increasing (submicromolar) concentrations of free Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A). Stimulation reached a plateau at 1 μm free Ca2+ (Fig.1 A). Sr2+ also stimulated ACVIII activity to a similar extent as Ca2+, although a free Sr2+concentration of 30 μm was required (Fig. 1 A). Stimulation was also elicited by Ba2+, although the effects were not evident until the free cation concentration exceeded 100 μm (Fig. 1 A). The concentration response curves for all three cations were similar in shape, but were separated by around 40-fold concentration differences (Fig. 1 A). The selectivity of ACVIII for these cations (Ca2+ > Sr2+ > Ba2+) agrees with the binding affinities of these cations to calmodulin and some other (E-F hand-containing) Ca2+-binding proteins (TableI).Table IComparison of cation binding affinities of adenylyl cyclase types VI and VIII, and other Ca 2+ -binding proteinsCa2+Sr2+Ba2+Effective ionic radius (Å)1.061.211.38Adenylyl cyclase type VI High affinity0.232 ± 0.015N/AN/A Low affinity221.2 ± 27.91070 ± 5620,000 ± 882Adenylyl cyclase type VIII Wild typeHigh affinity0.380 ± 0.04411.96 ± 1.45478.9 ± 34.2Low affinity132 ± 101573 ± 12718,000 ± 1700 NΔ1–106Low affinity131 ± 202380 ± 440N/AEF hands Phosphodiesterase via calmodulin∼2.5∼25>1000PL scramblase28.7 ± 4.1308 ± 28.62783 ± 439E. coli galactose-binding protein (K d)1.4 ± 0.1190 ± 1012,000 ± 4000C2 domain Synaptotagmin I5.4177254 Phospholipase A2∼1∼100>1000EC50 values (μm) of the low and high affinity Ca2+-regulatory sites of ACVI and ACVIII are listed and compared with those from EF hand proteins (calmodulin and PL scramblase; (30,40) and C2 domain-containing proteins (synaptotagmin I and phospholipase A2; Refs. 9.Li C.

The stimulation of ACVIII activity was followed by an inhibitory phase upon further increasing the free cation concentration (Fig.1 A). The EC50 values for Ca2+ and Sr2+ are around 100 μm and 1.8 mm, respectively. Ba2+ is ineffective. This inhibitory phase is referred to as low affinity inhibition, which is a feature of all of the mammalian adenylyl cyclases, whether they be Ca2+-stimulable, Ca2+-inhibitable, or Ca2+-insensitive in vivo (2.Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In order to circumvent the possibility that the high affinity stimulation by Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+was obscuring or distorting the values for these cations at mediating low affinity inhibition of ACVIII, we exploited a mutation in ACVIII (NΔ1–106) that we described earlier (7.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of added calmodulin, ACVIII binds calmodulin tightly via its N terminus, with the result that upon the addition of Ca2+, a stimulation of activity is observed. Deletion of amino acids 1–106 eliminates the calmodulin binding and the associated stimulation of activity by Ca2+ (7.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We examined the sensitivity of NΔ1–106 expressed in HEK 293 cells to increasing concentrations of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ in the absence of added calmodulin. Ca2+inhibited the activity of this mutant with an affinity similar to its inhibition of the wild type; Sr2+ inhibited activity with a somewhat reduced affinity, whereas Ba2+ was without effect at the concentrations tested (Fig. 1 B and Table I). These results largely reflect the second (inhibitory) phase observed with the intact construct (Fig. 1 A and Table I). The Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclases (ACV and ACVI) are regulated by capacitative Ca2+ entry in intact cells (15.Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,17.Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26.Cooper D.M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the Ca2+regulation of ACVI is through direct Ca2+ binding to the adenylyl cyclase or mediated via tightly associated Ca2+-binding proteins, such as calmodulin. If the effect were mediated via calmodulin, a potency series for the IIa cations similar to that seen for the stimulation of ACVIII would be expected. Consequently, the effects of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ at inhibiting the adenylyl cyclase activity of C6–2B glioma cells, where ACVI is the major endogenous adenylyl cyclase (27.Debernardi M.A. Munshi R. Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Brooker G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were compared (Fig. 2). Ca2+began to inhibit the adenylyl cyclase activity at 0.1 μm(Fig. 2). The inhibition reached an initial plateau around 1 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Activity was inhibited further when the free Ca2+ concentration exceeded 10 μm (Fig. 2). The Ca2+ inhibition curve is fitted best by a two-site competition model with two EC50values, around 0.2 and 200 μm, whereas the Sr2+ curve is better fitted by a single site competition model (EC50 around 1 mm; Fig. 2). It is not possible to exclude absolutely the possibility that Sr2+displays a minor component (e.g. 5%) of high affinity inhibition, but a number of experiments with numerous data points failed to discern such effects. Ba2+ exerted no effect until its free concentration exceeded 1 mm (Fig. 2). The biphasic Ca2+ concentration-response curves indicate that both ACVIII and ACVI have two Ca2+ regulatory sites, with high and low affinity. For the low affinity site, EC50values of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ are similar between ACVIII and ACVI (Table I), which strengthens the previous speculation that the low affinity Ca2+ inhibition results from Ca2+ competing with Mg2+ for an allosteric regulatory site (28.Steer M.L. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2080-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Cech S.Y. Broaddus W.C. Maguire M.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 33: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sr2+ and Ba2+ did not elicit discernible high affinity inhibition of ACVI, while they stimulated ACVIII activity to a similar extent as Ca2+ (Fig. 1 and 2). This difference suggests that distinct mechanisms are employed by ACVIII and ACVI for high affinity regulation by Ca2+. Specifically, it seems highly unlikely that calmodulin mediates high affinity inhibition. (The EC50 orKD values of several other Ca2+-binding proteins, either through E-F hands or through C2 domains, are compared with those of the cyclases in Table I). The effects of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ on ACVIII via capacitative entry were compared (Fig.3). HEK 293 cells transfected with ACVIII cDNA were pretreated with 100 nm thapsigargin to deplete the intracellular Ca2+ stores and prime the cells for capacitative Ca2+ entry, which selectively regulates the activities of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (16.Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,17.Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Following thapsigargin pretreatment, adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in response to the inclusion of increasing concentrations of CaCl2, SrCl2, or BaCl2, as indicated. The activity of ACVIII was stimulated by submillimolar external Ca2+ and full stimulation (more than 3-fold) was achieved by 4 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 3). Sr2+ also stimulated HEK 293 cells expressing ACVIII, like Ca2+, except that the plateau for Sr2+ was only approximately one-half of that achieved by Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Ba2+ exerted a modest effect on ACVIII activity with 8 mm external Ba2+ stimulating adenylyl cyclases activity by about 20% (Fig. 3). The inability to exceed the plateau in activity in response to increasing extracellular SrCl2suggests a ceiling on entry, since the in vitro data indicate that both Ca2+ and Sr2+ can elicit the same maximal stimulation of ACVIII activity. The effects of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+on ACVI activity through capacitative entry were next compared in C6–2B glioma cells. The experiments were performed on intact C6–2B glioma cells under conditions comparable to those used for HEK 293 cells transfected with ACVIII. Significant inhibition (approximately 20%) of ACVI activity was observed in the presence of 0.5 mm external Ca2+ (Fig.4). The maximal inhibition of ACVI activity by Ca2+ was approximately 45% when the Ca2+ concentration reached 4 mm (Fig. 4). Submillimolar Sr2+ also inhibited ACVI activity (approximately 10% inhibition; Fig. 4). The maximal effect evoked by Sr2+ was approximately 25% inhibition, which was achieved in a similar external concentration range as that of Ca2+(Fig. 4). Again the fact that Sr2+ could not elicit the same degree of inhibition of ACVI as did Ca2+, suggests a ceiling on Sr2+ entry. No significant effect of Ba2+ on ACVI activity was detected (Fig. 4). Given that the potency of Sr2+ to regulate ACVIII and ACVI is much less than that of Ca2+ (cf. Fig. 1 and2), it was quite unexpected to observe effects of Sr2+ on the adenylyl cyclase activities of intact cells, especially for the C6–2B glioma cells. Extrapolating from the in vitro data, capacitative Ca2+ entry would need to generate a free Ca2+ concentration near the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells of ∼1 μm to maximally stimulate ACVIII activity (Fig. 1). In contrast, to obtain half- and full maximal stimulation"

TheRB gene was initially discovered by positional cloning strategies and shown to be mutated in patients with hereditary retinoblastoma; hence, RB was the first bona fidetumor suppressor gene (reviewed in Refs. 1.Skapek S.X.

The ability of RB to prevent cell growth depends on its functional domains, termed the A and B motifs, and on its carboxyl terminus (5.Qin X.-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The A and B motifs are bound and presumably inactivated by several viral oncoproteins such as simian virus 40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1a oncoprotein (8.DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J.

These motifs are also the sites of many native cancer-causing mutations in the RB gene (11.Huang S. Wang N.-P. Tseng B.Y. Lee W.-H. Lee E.Y.-H.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12.Hu Q. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Together, the carboxyl terminus and the A and B motifs of RB have been shown to bind to a number of cellular proteins as well as to the viral oncoproteins noted above (1.Skapek S.X. Qian Y.-W. Lee E.Y.H.P. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1997; 16: 591-626Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). RB is thought to accomplish its diverse cellular functions, including its tumor suppressor activity, by interacting with these cellular proteins. Perhaps chief among the growing list of proteins known to interact with RB is E2F-1 (13.Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A.

E2F-1 was the first identified member of a family of transcriptional activators (collectively known as E2Fs) that includes at least six E2Fs and two heterodimeric DNA-binding partners, DP-1 and -2 (reviewed in Refs. 18.Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 19.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 20.Lam E.W.-F. Thangue N.B.L. Curr.

E2F-1 binds to elements of DNA that mediate cell cycle-dependent induction of a number of gene products as cells initiate DNA synthesis such as dihydrofolate reductase (21.Slansky J.E. Li Y.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The importance of RB binding to E2F-1 was suggested by the following findings: 1) naturally occurring mutations in the A and B motifs of RB prevent RB-E2F interaction (27.Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 28.Qian Y. Luckey C. Horton L. Esser M. Templeton D.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) the physical interaction of RB with E2F-1 correlates with the transcriptional repression of genes thought to be activated by “free” E2F-1 (24.Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30.Hiebert S.W. Chellappan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); and 3) the ectopic expression of E2F-1 can drive cells into S phase (32.Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 34.Qin X.-Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) and overcome RB-induced growth arrest (29.Qin X.-Q. Livingston D.M. Ewen M. Sellers W.R. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Together, these findings all support a model in which RB functions as a tumor suppressor by physically interacting with E2Fs to repress the expression of E2F-dependent genes. Two general issues can be raised regarding possible mechanisms by which RB may repress transcription. First, it is not clear whether RB has an intrinsic capacity to repress gene expression or whether RB accomplishes this repression by associating with additional proteins such as a transcriptional repressor. Second, it is not known whether RB directly affects the function of the transcriptional apparatus or secondarily regulates the transcriptional machinery by regulating chromatin structure. With respect to the former issue, intrinsic RB repressor activity seems paradoxical to the documented ability of RB to enhance the activity of other transcription factors. For example, the transactivation function of MyoD (27.Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 36.Novitch B.G. Mulligan G.J. Jacks T. Lassar A.B. J.

Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), C/EBP (38.Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), NF-IL6 (39.Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), GAL4-Myc (40.Adnane J. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 381-387PubMed Google Scholar), and ATF-2 (41.Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) may be enhanced by direct interaction with RB. With respect to the latter issue, although recent findings suggest that RB may affect chromatin structure by regulating histone deacetylase activity, this may not quantitatively account for all RB-mediated repression and may apply only to a specific subset of genes that can be repressed by RB (42.Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 43.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. LeVillain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Hence, although there may be multiple mechanisms for RB-mediated transcriptional repression, we favor a model in which RB can repress E2F-dependent genes by forming a multimeric complex with E2F-1 and a putative transcriptional repressor. Such a model has been previously proposed (44.Sellers W.R. Rodgers J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11544-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and one transcriptional repressor, HBP1, has been shown to interact with RB and the RB-like protein p130 (45.Tevosian S.G. Shih H.H. Mendelson K.G. Sheppard K.-A. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance of HBP1 with respect to RB function to arrest cell proliferation has not been established. Because RB is essential for the development of the murine nervous system (reviewed in Ref. 46.Lin S.-C. Skapek S.X. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we sought to identify RB-interacting proteins that are expressed in the mouse embryonic brain. As part of this effort, we have identified a novel member of a known family of transcriptional repressors. This family of genes contains zinc fingers of the Kruppel-type (47.Thiesen H.-J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Rosenberg U.B. Schroder C. Preiss A. Kienlin A. Cote S. Riede I. Jackle H. Nature. 1986; 319: 336-339Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and a portable transcriptional repressor motif known as the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) (49.Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that this RB-associatedKRAB (RBaK) protein can physically interact with RB and may contribute to RB-dependent suppression of E2F-mediated transcriptional activation and RB-mediated cell cycle arrest. Plasmids used in the yeast two-hybrid screen included pAS1-RB (p56) (amino acids 295–928 of mouse RB), pAS1-RBΔA (deletion of amino acids 434–476), and pAS1-RBΔB (deletion of amino acids 697–763). All of these were created by subcloning the described sequences into the pAS1 plasmid (50.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). We cloned pACT-mM17.1, which contained a 1.4-kb cDNA insert, from a λACT cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid screen as described (50.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) (see below). We created pBS-hM17.6 by subcloning a 5.1-kb cDNA insert from a HeLa cell λZAP cDNA library (CLONTECH) into the pBluescript II plasmid (Stratagene). The expression plasmids for RB included pCMV-RB (wt) (B/X-HA) which contained cDNA encoding wild-type mouse RB (provided by P. Hamel, B. Sellers, and B. Kaelin) (51.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and pCMV-RB(LP) which encoded amino acids 379–928 of human RB (5.Qin X.-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (provided by E. Knudsen), both of which had respective cDNAs subcloned into the pCMVneobam plasmid. Reporter plasmids for transient transfections included the β-galactosidase gene driven by the CMV promoter (pCMV-nβGal) (52.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and the choramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene driven by either the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (pCMV-CAT) (51.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or by two reiterated wild-type or mutated E2F-binding sites adjacent to the thymidine kinase promoter (pE2F[wt]CAT and pE2F[mut]CAT, respectively) (32.Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (provided by W. H. Lee). Expression plasmids encoding human RBaK were generated as follows: pCMV-hRBaK was generated by three-piece ligation of theNruI-HindIII fragment from pBShM17.6 (bp 395–1714; Fig. 1 A); theHindIII-XbaI fragment from pCMV-MT6hRBaK (see below), which includes the sequence starting at bp 1714 and continuing through approximately 80 bp 3′ to the stop codon (Fig. 1 A); and theStuI-XbaI fragment of pCS2+ plasmid, which contains the CMV promoter (provided by D. Spicer) (53.Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We generated pCMV-MT6hRBaK in several steps. First, pCMV-MT6hRBaK-LZ was made by using PCR primers with flanking XbaI sites to amplify cDNA corresponding to the linker and zinc fingers of hRBaK (bp 756–2744, Fig. 1 A). This insert was subcloned into theXbaI site of pCS2+MT6 (provided by D. Spicer), which contains the CMV promoter and six Myc epitope tags (53.Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Next, PCR was used to amplify cDNA corresponding to the hRBaK coding sequence beginning with the second amino acid (bp 523) by using 5′ and 3′ primers beginning at bp 523 and 1749, respectively (Fig.1 A). EcoRI and HindIII sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. Finally, pCMV-MT6hRBaK was generated by three-piece ligation of theEcoRI-HindIII digest of this PCR fragment, theHindIII-BglII digest fragment of pCMV-MT6hRBaK-LZ (which corresponds to the remaining hRBaK coding sequence), and theEcoRI-BglII digest fragment of pCMV-MT6hRBaK-LZ (which corresponds to the vehicle plasmid and Myc epitope tags). Thus, the resulting plasmid contained the hRBaK reading frame fused in-frame with six Myc epitope tags at the amino terminus. We generated pCMV-MT6hRBaK-KΔL by using PCR to amplify the coding sequence of hRBaK from bp 523 to 1032, which corresponds to the protein sequence from the second amino acid through the first half of the linker motif (Fig. 1 A). The 5′ primer encoded an artificial nuclear localization signal (MAPKKKRKV) adjacent to the RBaK-specific sequence.EcoRI and XbaI sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. This amplified PCR product was subcloned, in frame, to the EcoRI-XbaI sites in pCS2-MT6.Figure 1Human and mouse RBaK cDNA encode related proteins containing the KRAB motif and Kruppel-type zinc fingers.

Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). We used pAS1-RB(p56), which encompasses amino acids 295–928 of mouse RB, as the “bait” to screen a 1.5 × 106 λ phage cDNA library. This λACT cDNA library, like one previously described (50.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), was generated from RNA isolated from the heads of mouse E13.5 embryos and the brains of newborn mice (provided by E. Olson). The resulting cDNAs were fused with the GAL4-activation domain and driven by the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) promoter (50.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Plasmids from β-galactosidase-positive colonies that formed in the presence of pAS1-RB(p56) but not in the presence of mutated forms of RB were analyzed further. Longer forms of mouse and human RBaK cDNA were sought by screening other cDNA libraries as follows. A cDNA probe was made by using PCR to amplify a 388-bp fragment from pACT-mM17.1 that corresponds to amino acids 126–255 of mouse RBaK (Fig. 1 B) (5′ primer, 5′-tcatttcccccagctcaggt; 3′ primer, 5′-cagttccatttgtgatctcggat). This PCR product was gel-purified, labeled with [32P]dCTP by using the Primit II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene), and used as a probe to screen cDNA libraries containing 1 × 106 phage from mouse E11.5 embryo and HeLa cells (CLONTECH). TheEcoRI inserts of the selected clones were subcloned into the pBSII KS plasmid. Two plasmids isolated from the mouse embryo library had DNA sequences overlapping that of the insert (mM17.1) in pACT-mM17.1 (mM17.3, mM17.16) and were used to generate a consensus sequence encoding mRBaK. One plasmid isolated from the HeLa cell library contained a 5.1-kb insert that encoded hRBaK. The cDNAs representing mouse and human RBaK were sequenced completely in both directions by using Sequenase according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Overlapping contig maps and predicted amino acid translations were generated by using DNAstar software (DNAstar, Inc.). Mouse and human RBaK sequences will be deposited into the GenBankTM data base. The human MTN multiple human tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a cDNA probe generated by digestion of pBShRBaK with AccI andAvrII. The 418-bp product, which extended from bp 58 to 476 (Fig. 1 A), was gel-purified, labeled with [32P]dCTP as described above, and hybridized to the RNA blot using established protocols (54.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.3-7.52Google Scholar). The interactions of GST-RB and RBaK were characterized in vitro. To generate full-length human RBaK, pBS-hM17.6 was transcribed and translated by using T7 RNA polymerase, [35S]methionine, and the TnT-coupled reticulocyte transcription-translation protocol (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To generate partial-length mouse and human RBaK proteins, we used PCR to amplify the regions of pACT-mM17.1 or pBS-hM17.6 that encode the KRAB motif and linker (KL), the KRAB motif and part of the linker (KΔL), and the linker motif and several zinc fingers (LZ). The 5′ primer for mouse RBaK-KL and -KΔL was 5′-tcattcaaggatgtggctgtgg. The 3′ primers were 5′-ttcgaagggcttcagttccattt and 5′-gctttcccacactcaaaacacat for mouse RBaK-KL and -KΔL, respectively. The 5′ primer for human RBaK-KL and -KΔL was 5′-tcattcaaagatgtggctgtgga. The 3′ primers were 5′-caaagggcttcatttccatttgtg and 5′-gttttcccacattcattacactca for human RBaK-KL and -KΔL, respectively. The proteins encoded by these PCR products include amino acids 9–259 and 9–169 for mouse RBaK-KL and -KΔL, respectively, and amino acids 9–261 and 9–170 for human RBaK-KL and -KΔL, respectively. To generate hRBaK-LZ, which encoded a protein from amino acids 80 to 364, we used the 5′ and 3′ primers 5′-gaagcctggagagttgatgacc and 5′-tggtgcagggtgagatgtgtc, respectively. The 5′ primers for all of these PCR reactions contained the T7 RNA polymerase and translation initiation signals 5′-gctaaatacgactcactataggaacagaccaccATG-3′ joined to the RBaK-specific sequences. For the GST pull-down assay, equivalent amounts of in vitrotranslated proteins were incubated with GST or GST-RB(p56) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads equilibrated in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with 4% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 90 min at 4 °C. The glutathione beads were then washed 4 times with EBC buffer, and the bound proteins were solubilized in SDS-gel loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by fluorography. To analyze whether hRBaK contained transcriptional repressor activity, 10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected by using 2.75 μg of plasmid with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). We co-transfected pCMV-MT6hRBaK or pCMV-RB(LP) with CMV-βGal reporter plasmid and with pE2F(wt)-CAT, pE2F(mut)-CAT, or pCMV-CAT. On the following day, cells were fed with 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Whole-cell extracts were obtained 24 h later and used to determine CAT activity as described previously (51.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell.

CAT activity from several representative experiments, each with duplicate samples, was normalized to the β-galactosidase level and expressed as the fold increase over the activity from cells transfected with no reporter plasmid. To analyze the size and subcellular localization of ectopically expressed hRBaK, we transfected pCMV-RBaK, pCMV-MT6hRBaK, or pCMV-MT6hRBaK-KΔL into 10T1/2 fibroblasts by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained in growth medium for 48 h after transfection and then were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described previously (52.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B.

To date, a mechanism has been established for only one type II endonuclease with a discontinuous site, SfiI at GGCCNNNNNGGCC (where N is any base). In contrast to orthodox enzymes such as EcoRV, dimeric proteins that act at a single site, SfiI is a tetramer that interacts with two sites before cleaving DNA.BglI has a similar recognition sequence (GCCNNNNNGGC) to SfiI but a crystal structure like EcoRV.BglI and several other endonucleases with discontinuous sites were examined to see if they need two sites for their DNA cleavage reactions. The enzymes included some with sites containing lengthy segments of nonspecific DNA, such as XcmI (CCANNNNNNNNNTGG). In all cases, they acted at individual sites. Elongated recognition sites do not necessitate unusual reaction mechanisms. Other experiments on BglI showed that it bound to and cleaved DNA in the same manner as EcoRV, thus further delineating a distinct group of restriction enzymes with similar structures and a common reaction mechanism.

Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). The value of these enzymes as tools for the analysis and manipulation of DNA has prompted extensive searches for new enzymes of this type, and over 3000 have been identified (2.Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 26: 312-313Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recognition sites for most restriction enzymes are palindromic sequences of 4, 6, or 8 consecutive bp.1 Almost all of the relatively small number of type II enzymes that have been analyzed to date, with respect to their reaction mechanisms and/or structures, recognize continuous sequences of this sort: viz. BamHI, EcoRI, EcoRV, MunI,PvuII, and TaqI (3.Dorner L.F. Bitinaite J. Whitaker R.D. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4.Lesser D.R.

All of these examples are homodimeric proteins that interact symmetrically with their respective recognition sites so that the two active sites are located on the two target phosphodiester bonds, one in each strand. The enzyme can then cut both strands at one site in a single DNA-binding event (9.Erskine S.G. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7567-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Wright D.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31896-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On a DNA with two or more sites, they usually act in a distributive manner (11.Bilcock D.T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), catalyzing separate reactions at each site, but they sometimes act processively, translocating to a second site and cutting it before leaving the DNA (10.Wright D.J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a few exceptions, the type II restriction enzymes have dissimilar amino acid sequences (13.Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) but their three-dimensional structures can be similar to one another (14.Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For instance, the tertiary fold ofEcoRI is very similar to BamHI (15.Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1994; 368: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); likewiseEcoRV is similar to PvuII (16.Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), though the overall structures of EcoRI and EcoRV differ considerably. The mechanisms of these enzymes also show similarities in some instances and differences in other instances. For example,EcoRI and BamHI bind to DNA in the absence of Mg2+ preferentially at their recognition sites (3.Dorner L.F. Bitinaite J. Whitaker R.D. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4.Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Waters T. Connolly B.A. Jen-Jacobson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, under their optimal reaction conditions but for the absence of Mg2+, EcoRV, TaqI, and several others bind equally well to all DNA sequences (17.Taylor J.D. Badcoe I.G. Clarke A.R. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8743-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18.Zebala J.F. Choi J. Barany F. J. Biol.

In the presence of Mg2+, the latter enzymes still cleave DNA specifically at their recognition sites (21.Taylor J.D. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22.Zebala J.F. Choi J. Trainor J. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8106-8116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but they also need a divalent metal ion for specific binding; Ca2+ can function in this respect (7.Nastri H.G. Evans P.D.

The similarities and the differences among the type II restriction enzymes have led to the proposal that many, including BamHI, can be classified asEcoRI-like enzymes, whereas many others, includingPvuII and TaqI, can be classified asEcoRV-like enzymes (10.Wright D.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31896-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Trainor J. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8106-8116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, an alternative view maintains that there is no clear-cut distinction between theEcoRI- and the EcoRV-like enzymes and that these enzymes are essentially similar to each other in terms of both mechanism and core structure (6.Deibert M. Grazulis S. Janulaitis A. Siksnys V. Huber R. EMBO J. 1999; 21: 5805-5816Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19.Lagunavicius A. Grazulis S. Balciunaite E. Vainius D. Siksnys V.

The recognition sites for some type II restriction enzymes are not the continuous sequences of 4–8 consecutive bp noted above, but are instead discontinuous sequences in which the palindromic elements recognized by the enzyme are separated by a fixed length of nonspecific DNA (2.Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 26: 312-313Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The intervening DNA can be as long as 9 bp, viz. XcmI (Table I), or as short as 1 bp, viz. HhaII (GANTC). Apart from some early studies on HhaII (27.Kaddurah-Daouk R. Cho P. Smith H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15345-15351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),SfiI is the only type II enzyme with a discontinuous recognition site whose reaction mechanism has been analyzed (28.Wentzell L.M. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29.Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 289: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).SfiI differs from the orthodox enzymes such asEcoRV in several ways. First, its recognition site contains 8 specified bp interrupted by 5 bp of nonspecific DNA and thus covers 13 bp (Table I), which is longer than usual for a restriction site (34.Qiang B-Q. Schildkraut I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4507-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Second, SfiI is a tetramer of identical subunits instead of the normal dimer. Third, no DNA cleavage arises from the binding of the tetramer to one recognition site. Instead,SfiI is only active when bound to two copies of its site. It displays its optimal activity with two sites on the same DNA, where it loops out the DNA between the sites; but it can also, albeit less readily, cleave DNA with one SfiI site by bridging two such molecules. Fourth, once bound to the two sites, SfiI usually cuts both strands at both sites before leaving the DNA. Another subset of the type II enzymes, known as type IIe and typified byEcoRII and NaeI, also needs two sites for the DNA cleavage reactions but these differ from SfiI in that they seem to use one site to activate the reaction at the other site; the activator DNA is not cleaved (35.Yang C.C. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9657-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36.Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, concerted cleavage of two recognition sites in the manner of SfiI has been noted with both Cfr10I and SgrAI (11.Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38.Siksnys V. Skirgaila R. Sasnauskas G. Urbanke C. Cherny D. Grazulis S. Huber R. J. Mol.

The 8-bp site for SgrAI is identical to the 6-bp site forCfr10I except for one extra bp at each end.Table IRecognition sequencesEnzymeSpecies of originRecognition sequencea↓ marks the point of cleavage and N denotes any base.SfiIStreptomyces fimbriatusGGCCNNNN↓NGGCCBglIBacillus globigiiGCCNNNN↓NGGCTth111IThermus thermophilus 111GACN↓NNGTCPshAIPlesiomonas shigelloidesGACNN↓NNGTCAhdIAeromonas hydophiliaGACNNNN↓NNGTCDrdIDeinococcus radioduransGACNNNNN↓NNGTCPflMIPseudomonas fluorescencesCCANNNN↓NTGGBstXIBacillus stearothermophilusXCCANNNNN↓NTGGXcmIXanthamonas campestrisCCANNNNN↓NNNNTGGThe name, the species of origin, and the recognition sequence (2.Roberts R.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 26: 312-313Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for all of the restriction enzymes examined here are listed. The enzymes are grouped on the basis of similarities in their recognition sequences. In this study, the reactions of BglI (39.Lee Y.H. Chirikjian J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6838-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and several other restriction enzymes with discontinuous recognition sites (Table I) were analyzed on plasmids with either one or two target sites, to determine whether enzymes with elongated sites behave like the orthodox enzymes or whether they interact with two sites, like SfiI. The recognition sequence for BglI (40.Bickle T.A. Ineichen K. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) is identical to that forSfiI except that it is one bp shorter at each end (Table I),i.e. the same relationship as that between theCfr10I and SgrAI sites. This raises the possibility that BglI might act concertedly at two sites in the same way as SfiI. However, the structure ofBglI bound to its recognition sequence was recently determined by x-ray crystallography, and this shows a dimeric protein bound symmetrically to one DNA duplex (41.Newman M. Lunnen K. Wilson G. Greci J. Schildkraut I. Phillips S.E.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, the DNA recognition and catalytic functions in each subunit of BglI are similar to those in EcoRV, though the subunit interface in BglI differs from EcoRV. The amino acid sequences of BglI and EcoRV are not homologous (13.Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In EcoRV, which cleaves GAT↓ATC as marked, the recognition/catalytic functions of the two subunits are located almost opposite each other across the axis of the DNA (42.Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-17945Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In contrast, the recognition/catalytic functions of the two subunits in BglI are displaced relative to each other along the axis of the DNA, thus allowing it to recognize two specific segments of DNA separated by 5 bp of nonspecific DNA (41.Newman M. Lunnen K. Wilson G. Greci J. Schildkraut I. Phillips S.E.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The main question posed here is whetherBglI acts like SfiI, as might be expected from its recognition sequence, or like EcoRV, as might be expected from its crystal structure. BglI endonuclease, purified to homogeneity (41.Newman M. Lunnen K. Wilson G. Greci J. Schildkraut I. Phillips S.E.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) by I. Schildkraut and colleagues (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), was a gift from M. Newman (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). Its concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (43.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) and is given in terms of molarity of the dimeric protein ofM r 70,000. All other enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs; concentrations of the latter are given in terms of units of enzyme activity, as defined by the supplier. Plasmids pUC19 (44.Yanisch-Perron C. Viera C. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar), pBR322 (45.Bolivar F. Rodriguez R.L. Greene P.J. Betlach M.C. Heyneker H.L. Boyer H.W. Crosa J.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1977; 2: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar), pAT153 (46.Twigg A.J. Sherratt D.J. Nature. 1980; 283: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and pNEB193 (New England Biolabs) were manipulated by standard procedures (47.Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To make pBGL1 (Fig. 1 a), pUC19 was cleaved withEcoRI and KasI, and the large fragment was purified by electrophoresis prior to the removal of its single strand extensions with mung bean nuclease and re-circularization with T4 DNA ligase. To make pML1 (Fig. 1 b), pBR322 was cleaved withEcoRI and HindIII and ligated to a 43-bp duplex that had single strand extensions that matched an EcoRI terminus at one end and a HindIII terminus at the other end; the duplex was made from two self-complementary oligodeoxynucleotides, both 47 bases long, with recognition sites for Tth111I,PshAI, and AhdI that each had the same flanking and intervening sequences as the native site in pBR322. To make pAB2 (Fig. 1 c), pNEB193 was cleaved with PstI andHindIII and ligated to a 25-bp duplex with 4-base single strand extensions that matched a PstI terminus at one end and a HindIII terminus at the other end; the duplex was made from two self-complementary oligonucleotides, of 25 and 33 bases, with recognition sequences for PflMI, BstXI, andXcmI. To make pAB3 (Fig. 1 c), the small DNA fragment obtained by cleaving pAB2 with PvuII was cloned at the SspI site on pAB2; the two copies of thePvuII fragment present in pAB3 are in inverted orientation. The plasmids were used to transform recA strains ofEscherichia coli, either XL-blue or HB101 (47.Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The transformants were cultured in M9 minimal medium with 1 mCi/l [methyl-3H]thymidine and the covalently closed form of the plasmid purified by density gradient centrifugations (48.Halford S.E. Goodall A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The preparations were largely supercoiled monomeric plasmid, with <10% as either dimeric plasmid or nicked open circle DNA. Restriction enzymes were assayed by adding an aliquot (typically 5 μl) to a 3H-labeled plasmid (5 or 10 nm) in 200 μl of the buffer recommended by the supplier of the enzyme (or modifications thereof). For BglI, the aliquots were samples diluted to the requisite concentration in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. For the other enzymes, 1–15 units of the purchased stocks were added directly to the reactions. At various times after adding the enzyme, 15-μl samples were removed from the reaction and mixed immediately with 10 μl of stop mix (21.Taylor J.D. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through agarose to separate the supercoiled substrate and each of the reaction products. The segments of agarose that encompassed the substrate and each product were dissolved in 5 m sodium perchlorate and analyzed individually by scintillation counting to yield the concentration of each form of the DNA at each time point (48.Halford S.E. Goodall A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 49.Vipond I.B. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For plasmids with two recognition sites, the two fragments arising from cleavage at both sites were counted together to obtain one value for the concentration of doubly cut DNA. Values of v 1 andv 2A, the rates for the utilization of the one-site and two-site substrates, respectively, were evaluated from the initial linear decline in the concentration of the supercoiled substrate with time, whereas v 2B, the rate for cutting the second site on the two-site substrate, was assessed relative to v 2A by the curve-fitting procedure described previously (11.Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A 465-bp fragment with one BglI site was obtained by cleaving pUC19 with AatII andEcoRI (Fig. 1 a). An isogenic 465-bp fragment that lacked a BglI site was obtained by anAatII/EcoRI digest of a mutated form of pUC19 where BglI site A, GCCATTCAGGC, had been changed to GCCATTCAGAC by using the Quikchange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers CGCCATTCAGACTGCGCAACTG and its complement. The fragments were isolated by electrophoresis through agarose, purified with the Qiagen gel-purification kit, and labeled by using Klenow polymerase with [α-32P]dATP and dTTP (47.Sambrook J.C.

Varied amounts ofBglI (diluted in binding buffer) were added to the fragments to give 10-μl samples containing ∼50 pm DNA and 0–12.5 nm enzyme. The binding buffers contained the required concentration of NaCl in either EDTA buffer (50 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EDTA) or Ca2+buffer (the same supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2). After 20 min at room temperature, loading buffer (5 μl) was added to each sample, and the samples were applied to 6% polyacrylamide gels (17.Taylor J.D. Badcoe I.G. Clarke A.R. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8743-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The loading buffer was the same as that for the binding reaction, with either EDTA or CaCl2, augmented in both cases with 40% glycerol and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue. For samples in EDTA, the gel was prepared and run in 0.089 m Tris base, 0.089m boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. For samples with Ca2+, the gel buffer was as above except for 5 mm CaCl2 in place of the EDTA (23.Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the radioactivity on the gel was measured with a 400B PhosphorImager and analyzed by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A comparison of the reactions of a restriction enzyme on substrates with either one or two recognition sites can distinguish the following schemes (11.Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar): independent reactions at each site, in the conventional distributive manner for a type II enzyme; processive reactions, where the enzyme translocates from one site to another without leaving the DNA; activation by a second site, as proposed for the type IIe enzymes; concerted action at two sites, as noted with SfiI. A type II enzyme will cleave a supercoiled (SC) plasmid with one site first in one strand to give the open circle (OC) form of the DNA and then in the other strand, to give the full-length linear (FLL) form (Fig. 2 a). The cutting of both strands is often faster than the dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA (9.Erskine S.G. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7567-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Wright D.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31896-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and steady-state reactions then yield none of the OC form (48.Halford S.E. Goodall A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A plasmid with two sites is cleaved by an enzyme that acts independently at each site in sequential steps, leading first to the transient formation of FLL DNA as one site is cut and then, after a lag phase, to the final products cut at both sites, L1 and L2 (Fig.2 b). If the recognition sites on the one-site and two-site substrates are equally susceptible to the enzyme, then independent action at each site results in the same steady-state rates for the utilization of the one- and two-site substrates (v 1 and v 2A, respectively) and for the conversion of the FLL form of the two-site DNA to L1 and L2 (v 2B). Ifv 2A = v 2B, the maximal amount of FLL DNA formed during the reaction on the two-site substrate will be 40% of the total DNA. On the other hand, both processive and concerted reactions yield less of the FLL DNA, whereas an enzyme employing a second site, either as an activator or for a concerted reaction, would consume the two-site substrate at a faster rate than the one-site substrate (11.Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine which scheme applies to the BglI enzyme, the kinetics of DNA cleavage were analyzed on plasmids with one or twoBglI sites, pBGL1 and pUC19, respectively (Fig.1 a). Under steady-state conditions with lower concentrations of enzyme than DNA (Fig.2), the rates increased linearly with increasing concentrations of the enzyme (data not shown), and both substrates were converted completely to the final products expected from the cleavage of all BglI sites: FLL DNA from pBGL1 and L1 and L2 from pUC19. Hence, BglI carries out multiple catalytic turnovers, as expected for a type II endonuclease (1.Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). The reaction of BglI on the one-site plasmid yielded none of the OC DNA and instead progressed directly to the FLL form cut in both strands (Fig. 2 a). BglI thus cleaves both DNA strands at a single recognition site at rates that are faster than its dissociation from the cleaved DNA. The two-site substrate was cleaved in sequential stages; first at one site to give FLL DNA and then, after a lag phase, at the other site to give L1 and L2 (Fig. 2 b). Moreover, the rate of utilization of the two-site substrate (v 2A = 6.3 ± 0.3 min−1) was similar to the one-site substrate (v 1 = 5.4 ± 0.6 min−1). The BglI endonuclease therefore cleaves each recognition site in an independent reaction, in the orthodox manner for a type II enzyme. The above experiments with the SC form of pUC19 do not reveal whichBglI site is cleaved to yield the FLL form. The twoBglI sites in pUC19, noted as A and B(Fig. 1 a), are flanked by different sequences, and they also have different sequences in the 5-bp spacer of nonspecific DNA in the middle of the site. Restriction activity is often affected by sequences flanking the recognition site (1.Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar), and the activity of SfiI is also modulated by the sequence of the spacer (32.Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hence, oneBglI site in pUC19 may be more susceptible than the other. To monitor the cleavage of each site, pUC19 was cut withAlwNI, and the linearized DNA was used as a substrate forBglI (Fig. 3). The cleavage of either BglI site on this substrate gives rise to two fragments but the pair of fragments produced by cutting siteA are distinct from those from cutting B (Fig.3 a).

In the outer segments of rod photoreceptor cells (ROS),1 the visual G protein, transducin (Gt), couples the light receptor, rhodopsin (R), to the effector enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Photolyzed rhodopsin (R*) binds Gt and induces GDP/GTP exchange on the Gαt subunit, which upon dissociation from R* and Gβγt activates PDE. To activate the enzyme, Gαt·GTP interacts with the inhibitory PDE γ subunits (Pγ) and prevents them from blocking catalytic sites on the PDE αβ subunits. The following decrease in intracellular cGMP concentration leads to a closure of cGMP-gated channels in the ROS plasma membrane (1.Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2.Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Baylor D. Proc.

Unlike the cones that mediate high intensity daytime color vision, rod photoreceptors are designed for dim light vision during nighttime.Defects in the genes encoding key components of the visual transduction cascade have been linked to a number of retinal diseases. Certain forms of retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive photoreceptor degeneration, are caused by mutations in rhodopsin (4.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Cowley G.S. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have been identified in different forms of congenital stationary night blindness. Stationary night blindness is not associated with retinal degeneration and manifests itself in the inability to see in the dark, whereas daytime vision is largely unaffected. A missense Gαtmutation, G38D, was found in the Nougaret form of congenital stationary night blindness (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Initially, it was thought that Nougaret night blindness resulted from a loss of rod function. However, a recent study using electroretinographic analysis of Nougaret patients has indicated the presence of a detectable albeit subnormal rod function coupled with slight impairment of cone function (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A clear outcome of the disease is a significant loss of rod light sensitivity (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Functional consequences of the G38D mutation for transducin signaling have not been examined, although a Gly residue at the corresponding position in other GTP-binding proteins has been actively investigated. This Gly is located within the conserved P-loop with the consensus sequence GXXXXK(S/T) that binds the α- and β-phosphate of GDP and GTP in the superfamily of G proteins (14.Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). One of the most common transforming mutations in p21 ras is a substitution of the corresponding residue Gly-12 by Val. This mutation essentially blocks the GTPase activity of p21 ras and prevents its stimulation by GAPs leading to constitutive activation of p21 ras -mediated pathways (15.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar, 16.Seeburg P.H. Colby W.W. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17.Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar observation has been made for the analogous mutant of Gαi1, G42V, which hydrolyzes GTP with a 30-fold lower rate than that of the parent protein (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of Gαi1G42V to inhibit the effector enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, was not evaluated. Interestingly, Gαz, in which the Gly residue is replaced by Ser, has a characteristically lowk cat for GTP hydrolysis (19.Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of p21 ras G12V and Gαi1G42V seem to point to the constitutive activity of the GαtG38D mutant as a cause of Nougaret night blindness. However, the alternative possibility that the GαtG38D mutation leads to an inactive visual cascade remained. Such a possibility is supported by analysis of an analogous Gαs mutant, GαsG49V. The rate of GTP hydrolysis for GαsG49V is ∼4-fold lower than that for Gαs, and the GTP-bound mutant is capable of activation of adenylyl cyclase in vitro (20.Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GαsG49V was a very poor activator of adenylyl cyclase when expressed in a cyc− S49 cell line (21.Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of light sensitivity of the Nougaret rod photoreceptors could potentially be caused either by the desensitization due to constitutive activity of Gαt or by reduced ability to transduce a visual signal due to impaired Gαt function.To identify the molecular mechanism of Nougaret night blindness, we have introduced the G38D substitution into Gαt-like, effector-competent, Gαt/Gαi chimeric α-subunit. An extensive examination of the functional properties of this mutant has revealed a complete loss of the effector function.DISCUSSIONHeterotrimeric G proteins transduce a variety of extracellular signals (neurotransmitters, hormones, light, olfactory and taste signals) from specific cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Mutations in Gα subunits that lead to abnormal signaling are known to cause a large number of diseases (40.Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Iiri T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Abnormal G protein signaling might result from either attenuated or elevated signal transduction. Mutations of Gα subunits leading to lower protein stability, reduced ability for interaction with and activation by cognate receptors, inability to dissociate Gβγ, or diminished capacity to activate effectors would attenuate G protein transduction. Mutations causing an increase in spontaneous Gα GDP/GTP exchange, a lower GTPase activity, or impairment of interaction with GAP proteins are often a source of excessive G protein signaling.Recently, a mutation in the visual G protein, GαtG38D, was found in patients with the Nougaret form of dominant stationary night blindness (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although psychophysical and electrophysiological consequences of the Nougaret night blindness have been thoroughly investigated (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of the disease remained unclear. Despite a lack of biochemical characterization of GαtG38D, a wealth of information has been accumulated on mutations of an analogous Gly residue in small and heterotrimeric G proteins. The G12V mutation in p21 ras produces constitutively active signaling by inhibiting the p21 ras GTPase activity and abolishing its stimulation by GAP proteins (15.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar, 16.Seeburg P.H. Colby W.W. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17.Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Gαi1G42V mutant has a 30-fold lowerk cat for GTP hydrolysis in comparison to the wild-type Gαi1 and it is insensitive to RGS proteins (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By analogy with the p21 ras and Gαi1 mutants, constitutive activity of GαtG38D becomes the most appealing model for abnormal function of rod photoreceptors in the Nougaret pedigree. Persistent activation of PDE by the GTP-bound GαtG38D would also provide a simple explanation to the dominant inheritance of the disease (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, such a hypothesis would be consistent with existing biochemical evidence on dominant night blindness caused by two mutations in rhodopsin, G90D and A292E (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both rhodopsin mutants are constitutively active and capable of activating transducin even in the absence of the retinal chromophore (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PDE β-subunit gene, a third gene implicated in dominant stationary night blindness, carries a missense mutation H258N (11.Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although properties of the PDE mutant are not known, it has been suggested that it might be constitutively active due to impaired interaction with the Pγ subunit (11.Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Finally, an Oguchi disease, a recessive form of stationary night blindness, was found to be associated with null mutations in the rhodopsin kinase gene (41.Yamamoto S. Sippel K.C. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase is intimately involved in inactivation of R*. Transgenic mice lacking rhodopsin kinase displayed larger and longer than normal single-photon responses (42.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The excessive signaling is thought to saturate rod responses at abnormally low light-intensities in Oguchi disease (42.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Similarly to light adaptation, constitutive activation of the visual cascade would cause desensitization of rod photoreceptors by lowering cGMP levels, keeping the cGMP-gated channels closed, the plasma membrane hyperpolarized, and lowering intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Supporting the hypothesis for constitutive activity of GαtG38D, some of the abnormalities seen in the rod and cone functions of Nougaret patients have been simulated by light adaptation of the normal retina (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However attractive, constitutive activity toward effectors of Gα mutants with substitution of the Gly residue has not been firmly established. Examination of GαsG49V revealed that it can normally stimulate adenylyl cyclase in the reconstituted system (20.Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but only poorly in cyc− S49 cells expressing the mutant (21.Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of Nougaret night blindness, we investigated the key functional properties of Gαt*G38D, such as interaction with R* and Gβγt, GTPase activity, interaction with RGS9, binding the Pγ subunit, and the ability to stimulate PDE. Gαt*G38D interaction with Gβγt and activation by R* was found largely intact. In comparison with Gαt*, the mutant had only a very modest ∼2.5-fold reduction in the k cat value for GTP hydrolysis. The decrease in Gαt*G38D GTPase activity was significantly smaller than that seen in the Gαi1 G42V or G42S mutants (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike Gαi1G42V (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Gαt*G38D retained reduced ability to interact with RGS proteins, particularly, with a photoreceptor-specific RGS9. In contrast, the effector function of Gαt*G38D is markedly impaired. Gαt*G38D fails to bind Pγ and activate PDE. The inability of the G38D mutant, in a background of wild-type Gαt, to interact with the effector molecule was demonstrated using in vitro translated Gαt and GαtG38D. Lack of trypsin protection of GαtG38D (or Gαt*G38D) in the presence of AlF4− indicates that the active conformation of the switch II region of the mutant Gαtmay differ from that in wild-type transducin. The switch II region of Gαt is an essential effector binding domain (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43.Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and alterations in this region provide a plausible rationale for the loss of effector function. Moreover, similar patterns of sensitivity to trypsin between active conformations of Gαi1G42V (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and GαtG38D allow us to speculate that these mutations may have caused analogous conformational changes. A crystal structure of the GTPγS bound Gαi1G42V shows that the Val-42 side chain forces the peptide planes of the switch II residues 203–206 to rotate leading to disruption of ionic contacts between Arg-205 and the switch III/α3-helix residues Asp-237 and Glu-245 (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If a similar conformational change is caused by the GαtG38D mutation, it would break the linkage between the Gαt switch II Arg-201 and the switch III/α3-helix residues Glu-232 and Glu-241 (44.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This linkage is central to the ability of Gαt to assume the effector-competent conformation (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All mutations of the Gαt switch II region residues that are involved in the linkage with switch III/α3-helix have resulted in a severe impairment of Gαt effector function (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).An absolute inability of GαtG38D to activate PDE may only in part account for desensitization of rod photoreceptors in the Nougaret form of dominant night blindness. Heterozygous Nougaret patients, who presumably have about 50% functional transducin, display more than 99% reduction in rod sensitivity (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The observed rod sensitivity loss implies that GαtG38D somehow interferes with expression of the wild-type allele, or the mutant has dominant negative properties. We demonstrated that Gαt*G38D is unable to prevent PDE activation by Gαt*. Despite the lack of evidence to support the dominant negative nature of the G38D mutant, such a possibility cannot be ruled out. Gαt*G38D is fully capable of interaction with R*, and under dim light conditions and very low concentrations of R*, the mutant Gαt may potentially compete with wild-type Gαt for R*. Such a competition would slow the rate of formation of Gαt·GTP and, consequently, attenuate PDE activation.Overall, our results demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism in dominant stationary night blindness. In contrast to stationary night blindness caused by constitutive activation of the visual cascade by rhodopsin mutants (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the Nougaret form has its basis in decreased visual signaling due to loss of transducin effector function. The visual transduction cascade in vertebrate rod photoreceptor cells is among the best understood G protein signaling systems. In the outer segments of rod photoreceptor cells (ROS),1 the visual G protein, transducin (Gt), couples the light receptor, rhodopsin (R), to the effector enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Photolyzed rhodopsin (R*) binds Gt and induces GDP/GTP exchange on the Gαt subunit, which upon dissociation from R* and Gβγt activates PDE. To activate the enzyme, Gαt·GTP interacts with the inhibitory PDE γ subunits (Pγ) and prevents them from blocking catalytic sites on the PDE αβ subunits. The following decrease in intracellular cGMP concentration leads to a closure of cGMP-gated channels in the ROS plasma membrane (1.Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2.Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Baylor D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). An analogous visual cascade operates in cone photoreceptor cells. Unlike the cones that mediate high intensity daytime color vision, rod photoreceptors are designed for dim light vision during nighttime. Defects in the genes encoding key components of the visual transduction cascade have been linked to a number of retinal diseases. Certain forms of retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive photoreceptor degeneration, are caused by mutations in rhodopsin (4.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Cowley G.S. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9370-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), α- and β-subunits of PDE (5.McLaughlin M.E. Ehrhart T.L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), or Gαt (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have been identified in different forms of congenital stationary night blindness. Stationary night blindness is not associated with retinal degeneration and manifests itself in the inability to see in the dark, whereas daytime vision is largely unaffected. A missense Gαtmutation, G38D, was found in the Nougaret form of congenital stationary night blindness (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Initially, it was thought that Nougaret night blindness resulted from a loss of rod function. However, a recent study using electroretinographic analysis of Nougaret patients has indicated the presence of a detectable albeit subnormal rod function coupled with slight impairment of cone function (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A clear outcome of the disease is a significant loss of rod light sensitivity (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Functional consequences of the G38D mutation for transducin signaling have not been examined, although a Gly residue at the corresponding position in other GTP-binding proteins has been actively investigated. This Gly is located within the conserved P-loop with the consensus sequence GXXXXK(S/T) that binds the α- and β-phosphate of GDP and GTP in the superfamily of G proteins (14.Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). One of the most common transforming mutations in p21 ras is a substitution of the corresponding residue Gly-12 by Val. This mutation essentially blocks the GTPase activity of p21 ras and prevents its stimulation by GAPs leading to constitutive activation of p21 ras -mediated pathways (15.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar, 16.Seeburg P.H. Colby W.W. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17.Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar observation has been made for the analogous mutant of Gαi1, G42V, which hydrolyzes GTP with a 30-fold lower rate than that of the parent protein (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of Gαi1G42V to inhibit the effector enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, was not evaluated. Interestingly, Gαz, in which the Gly residue is replaced by Ser, has a characteristically lowk cat for GTP hydrolysis (19.Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of p21 ras G12V and Gαi1G42V seem to point to the constitutive activity of the GαtG38D mutant as a cause of Nougaret night blindness. However, the alternative possibility that the GαtG38D mutation leads to an inactive visual cascade remained. Such a possibility is supported by analysis of an analogous Gαs mutant, GαsG49V. The rate of GTP hydrolysis for GαsG49V is ∼4-fold lower than that for Gαs, and the GTP-bound mutant is capable of activation of adenylyl cyclase in vitro (20.Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GαsG49V was a very poor activator of adenylyl cyclase when expressed in a cyc− S49 cell line (21.Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of light sensitivity of the Nougaret rod photoreceptors could potentially be caused either by the desensitization due to constitutive activity of Gαt or by reduced ability to transduce a visual signal due to impaired Gαt function. To identify the molecular mechanism of Nougaret night blindness, we have introduced the G38D substitution into Gαt-like, effector-competent, Gαt/Gαi chimeric α-subunit. An extensive examination of the functional properties of this mutant has revealed a complete loss of the effector function. DISCUSSIONHeterotrimeric G proteins transduce a variety of extracellular signals (neurotransmitters, hormones, light, olfactory and taste signals) from specific cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Mutations in Gα subunits that lead to abnormal signaling are known to cause a large number of diseases (40.Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Iiri T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Abnormal G protein signaling might result from either attenuated or elevated signal transduction. Mutations of Gα subunits leading to lower protein stability, reduced ability for interaction with and activation by cognate receptors, inability to dissociate Gβγ, or diminished capacity to activate effectors would attenuate G protein transduction. Mutations causing an increase in spontaneous Gα GDP/GTP exchange, a lower GTPase activity, or impairment of interaction with GAP proteins are often a source of excessive G protein signaling.Recently, a mutation in the visual G protein, GαtG38D, was found in patients with the Nougaret form of dominant stationary night blindness (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although psychophysical and electrophysiological consequences of the Nougaret night blindness have been thoroughly investigated (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of the disease remained unclear. Despite a lack of biochemical characterization of GαtG38D, a wealth of information has been accumulated on mutations of an analogous Gly residue in small and heterotrimeric G proteins. The G12V mutation in p21 ras produces constitutively active signaling by inhibiting the p21 ras GTPase activity and abolishing its stimulation by GAP proteins (15.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar, 16.Seeburg P.H. Colby W.W. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17.Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Gαi1G42V mutant has a 30-fold lowerk cat for GTP hydrolysis in comparison to the wild-type Gαi1 and it is insensitive to RGS proteins (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By analogy with the p21 ras and Gαi1 mutants, constitutive activity of GαtG38D becomes the most appealing model for abnormal function of rod photoreceptors in the Nougaret pedigree. Persistent activation of PDE by the GTP-bound GαtG38D would also provide a simple explanation to the dominant inheritance of the disease (12.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Reboul T. Arnaud B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, such a hypothesis would be consistent with existing biochemical evidence on dominant night blindness caused by two mutations in rhodopsin, G90D and A292E (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both rhodopsin mutants are constitutively active and capable of activating transducin even in the absence of the retinal chromophore (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PDE β-subunit gene, a third gene implicated in dominant stationary night blindness, carries a missense mutation H258N (11.Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although properties of the PDE mutant are not known, it has been suggested that it might be constitutively active due to impaired interaction with the Pγ subunit (11.Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Finally, an Oguchi disease, a recessive form of stationary night blindness, was found to be associated with null mutations in the rhodopsin kinase gene (41.Yamamoto S. Sippel K.C. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase is intimately involved in inactivation of R*. Transgenic mice lacking rhodopsin kinase displayed larger and longer than normal single-photon responses (42.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The excessive signaling is thought to saturate rod responses at abnormally low light-intensities in Oguchi disease (42.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Similarly to light adaptation, constitutive activation of the visual cascade would cause desensitization of rod photoreceptors by lowering cGMP levels, keeping the cGMP-gated channels closed, the plasma membrane hyperpolarized, and lowering intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Supporting the hypothesis for constitutive activity of GαtG38D, some of the abnormalities seen in the rod and cone functions of Nougaret patients have been simulated by light adaptation of the normal retina (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However attractive, constitutive activity toward effectors of Gα mutants with substitution of the Gly residue has not been firmly established. Examination of GαsG49V revealed that it can normally stimulate adenylyl cyclase in the reconstituted system (20.Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but only poorly in cyc− S49 cells expressing the mutant (21.Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of Nougaret night blindness, we investigated the key functional properties of Gαt*G38D, such as interaction with R* and Gβγt, GTPase activity, interaction with RGS9, binding the Pγ subunit, and the ability to stimulate PDE. Gαt*G38D interaction with Gβγt and activation by R* was found largely intact. In comparison with Gαt*, the mutant had only a very modest ∼2.5-fold reduction in the k cat value for GTP hydrolysis. The decrease in Gαt*G38D GTPase activity was significantly smaller than that seen in the Gαi1 G42V or G42S mutants (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike Gαi1G42V (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Gαt*G38D retained reduced ability to interact with RGS proteins, particularly, with a photoreceptor-specific RGS9. In contrast, the effector function of Gαt*G38D is markedly impaired. Gαt*G38D fails to bind Pγ and activate PDE. The inability of the G38D mutant, in a background of wild-type Gαt, to interact with the effector molecule was demonstrated using in vitro translated Gαt and GαtG38D. Lack of trypsin protection of GαtG38D (or Gαt*G38D) in the presence of AlF4− indicates that the active conformation of the switch II region of the mutant Gαtmay differ from that in wild-type transducin. The switch II region of Gαt is an essential effector binding domain (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43.Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and alterations in this region provide a plausible rationale for the loss of effector function. Moreover, similar patterns of sensitivity to trypsin between active conformations of Gαi1G42V (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and GαtG38D allow us to speculate that these mutations may have caused analogous conformational changes. A crystal structure of the GTPγS bound Gαi1G42V shows that the Val-42 side chain forces the peptide planes of the switch II residues 203–206 to rotate leading to disruption of ionic contacts between Arg-205 and the switch III/α3-helix residues Asp-237 and Glu-245 (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If a similar conformational change is caused by the GαtG38D mutation, it would break the linkage between the Gαt switch II Arg-201 and the switch III/α3-helix residues Glu-232 and Glu-241 (44.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This linkage is central to the ability of Gαt to assume the effector-competent conformation (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45.Li Q. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

All mutations of the Gαt switch II region residues that are involved in the linkage with switch III/α3-helix have resulted in a severe impairment of Gαt effector function (26.Natochin M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).An absolute inability of GαtG38D to activate PDE may only in part account for desensitization of rod photoreceptors in the Nougaret form of dominant night blindness. Heterozygous Nougaret patients, who presumably have about 50% functional transducin, display more than 99% reduction in rod sensitivity (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The observed rod sensitivity loss implies that GαtG38D somehow interferes with expression of the wild-type allele, or the mutant has dominant negative properties. We demonstrated that Gαt*G38D is unable to prevent PDE activation by Gαt*. Despite the lack of evidence to support the dominant negative nature of the G38D mutant, such a possibility cannot be ruled out. Gαt*G38D is fully capable of interaction with R*, and under dim light conditions and very low concentrations of R*, the mutant Gαt may potentially compete with wild-type Gαt for R*. Such a competition would slow the rate of formation of Gαt·GTP and, consequently, attenuate PDE activation.Overall, our results demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism in dominant stationary night blindness. In contrast to stationary night blindness caused by constitutive activation of the visual cascade by rhodopsin mutants (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat.

Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although properties of the PDE mutant are not known, it has been suggested that it might be constitutively active due to impaired interaction with the Pγ subunit (11.Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Finally, an Oguchi disease, a recessive form of stationary night blindness, was found to be associated with null mutations in the rhodopsin kinase gene (41.Yamamoto S. Sippel K.C. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase is intimately involved in inactivation of R*. Transgenic mice lacking rhodopsin kinase displayed larger and longer than normal single-photon responses (42.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The excessive signaling is thought to saturate rod responses at abnormally low light-intensities in Oguchi disease (42.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Similarly to light adaptation, constitutive activation of the visual cascade would cause desensitization of rod photoreceptors by lowering cGMP levels, keeping the cGMP-gated channels closed, the plasma membrane hyperpolarized, and lowering intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Supporting the hypothesis for constitutive activity of GαtG38D, some of the abnormalities seen in the rod and cone functions of Nougaret patients have been simulated by light adaptation of the normal retina (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However attractive, constitutive activity toward effectors of Gα mutants with substitution of the Gly residue has not been firmly established. Examination of GαsG49V revealed that it can normally stimulate adenylyl cyclase in the reconstituted system (20.Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but only poorly in cyc− S49 cells expressing the mutant (21.Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of Nougaret night blindness, we investigated the key functional properties of Gαt*G38D, such as interaction with R* and Gβγt, GTPase activity, interaction with RGS9, binding the Pγ subunit, and the ability to stimulate PDE. Gαt*G38D interaction with Gβγt and activation by R* was found largely intact. In comparison with Gαt*, the mutant had only a very modest ∼2.5-fold reduction in the k cat value for GTP hydrolysis. The decrease in Gαt*G38D GTPase activity was significantly smaller than that seen in the Gαi1 G42V or G42S mutants (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike Gαi1G42V (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Gαt*G38D retained reduced ability to interact with RGS proteins, particularly, with a photoreceptor-specific RGS9. In contrast, the effector function of Gαt*G38D is markedly impaired. Gαt*G38D fails to bind Pγ and activate PDE. The inability of the G38D mutant, in a background of wild-type Gαt, to interact with the effector molecule was demonstrated using in vitro translated Gαt and GαtG38D. Lack of trypsin protection of GαtG38D (or Gαt*G38D) in the presence of AlF4− indicates that the active conformation of the switch II region of the mutant Gαtmay differ from that in wild-type transducin. The switch II region of Gαt is an essential effector binding domain (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43.Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and alterations in this region provide a plausible rationale for the loss of effector function. Moreover, similar patterns of sensitivity to trypsin between active conformations of Gαi1G42V (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and GαtG38D allow us to speculate that these mutations may have caused analogous conformational changes. A crystal structure of the GTPγS bound Gαi1G42V shows that the Val-42 side chain forces the peptide planes of the switch II residues 203–206 to rotate leading to disruption of ionic contacts between Arg-205 and the switch III/α3-helix residues Asp-237 and Glu-245 (18.Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If a similar conformational change is caused by the GαtG38D mutation, it would break the linkage between the Gαt switch II Arg-201 and the switch III/α3-helix residues Glu-232 and Glu-241 (44.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This linkage is central to the ability of Gαt to assume the effector-competent conformation (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45.Li Q. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All mutations of the Gαt switch II region residues that are involved in the linkage with switch III/α3-helix have resulted in a severe impairment of Gαt effector function (26.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An absolute inability of GαtG38D to activate PDE may only in part account for desensitization of rod photoreceptors in the Nougaret form of dominant night blindness. Heterozygous Nougaret patients, who presumably have about 50% functional transducin, display more than 99% reduction in rod sensitivity (13.Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Dan J. Arnaud B. Dryja T.P. Berson EL Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The observed rod sensitivity loss implies that GαtG38D somehow interferes with expression of the wild-type allele, or the mutant has dominant negative properties. We demonstrated that Gαt*G38D is unable to prevent PDE activation by Gαt*. Despite the lack of evidence to support the dominant negative nature of the G38D mutant, such a possibility cannot be ruled out. Gαt*G38D is fully capable of interaction with R*, and under dim light conditions and very low concentrations of R*, the mutant Gαt may potentially compete with wild-type Gαt for R*. Such a competition would slow the rate of formation of Gαt·GTP and, consequently, attenuate PDE activation. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism in dominant stationary night blindness. In contrast to stationary night blindness caused by constitutive activation of the visual cascade by rhodopsin mutants (9.Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the Nougaret form has its basis in decreased visual signaling due to loss of transducin effector function. We thank Dr. M. Natochin for valuable discussion."

As such, it has been considered a potential target for antineoplastic therapy. For this purpose, we have examined the role of ERK activation in myeloid leukemia cell growth and differentiation. Using a representative set of myeloid leukemia cell lines, we show that cell proliferation was not accompanied by increases on ERK1/2 activation, and mitogenic stimulation did not enhance ERK activity. Moreover, abolition of ERK function by the inhibitor PD98059 or by a dominant inhibitory mutant ERK2 had no significant effects on proliferation. With the aid of various differentiation inducers, we found that within the same cell line, differentiation to a given lineage could occur with and without ERK1/2 activation, depending on the stimulus. Also, a differentiator could have the same effect in the presence or absence of ERK stimulation, depending on the cell line. ERK inhibition did not affect the differentiation elicited by stimuli whose effects were accompanied by ERK activation. Finally, constitutive ERK activity was also ineffective on proliferation and differentiation.

Science. 1989; 339: 27-30Google Scholar). As such, cell lines derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML)1, like K562 (2.Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), KU812 (3.Kishi K. Leukemia Res. 1985; 9: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and KBM5 (4.Romero P. Beran M. Shtalrid M. Andersson B. Talpaz M. Blick M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 93-98PubMed Google Scholar), and from acute promyelocytic leukemias, such as HL-60 (5.Collins S.J. Gallo R.C. Gallagher R.E. Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) and U937 (6.Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar), are blocked at different stages of their respective differentiation pathways. These lines can be growth-arrested and terminally differentiated by culturing them in the presence of a broad spectrum of differentiation inducers including tumor promoters, antibiotics, and DNA synthesis inhibitors among others (7.Rovera G. O'Briene T.A. Diamond L. Science. 1979; 204: 868-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 8.Rowley P.T. Ohlsson-Wilhem B.M. Farley B.A. LaBella S. Exp.

Blood. 1988; 2: 121-133Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), thereby providing an invaluable tool for the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying in proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) have been shown to be pivotal elements in the processes that govern cell destiny upon the reception of an external stimuli, either promoting proliferation, switching on the genetic guidelines that will lead to terminal differentiation, or directing cells into programmed cell death (10.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Activation of p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 is a key step in the conveyance of signals from surface receptors to the nucleus through a route that includes the small GTPase Ras, Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase, and MEK dual specificity kinase as upstream components (11.Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that the duration and amplitude of the ERK signal is determinant in the decision between proliferation and differentiation (12.Qiu M. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 13.Traverse S.N. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Biochem.

It is now widely documented that ERKs play an essential role in fibroblasts proliferation and neoplasic transformation (14.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 15.Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Poyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Candia J.M. Rong K. Fukasawa G.W. Vande Wounde G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). In this context, ERKs are also found to be constitutively activated in some human neoplasias (18.Oka H. Chatani Y. Hoshino R. Ogawa O. Kakehi Y. Terachi T. Okada Y. Kawaichi M. Kohno M. Yoshida O. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4182-4187PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Sivaraman V.S. Wang H. Nuovo G.J. Malbon C.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20.Hoshino R.

On the other hand, ERKs also function actively in differentiation processes during development, like photoreceptor cell patterning in Drosophila melanogaster(21.Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), vulvar development in Caenorhabditis elegans (22.Sundaram M. Han M. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and mesoderm induction in Xenopus laevis (23.Umbhauer M. Marshall C.J. Mason C.S. Old R.W. Smith J.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Likewise, activation of the ERK pathway has also been shown to be critical in the control of cellular differentiation in myocytes (24.Grendiner E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), melanocytes (25.Englaro W. Bertolotto C. Busca R. Brunet A. Pages G. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). With regard to the hemopoietic system, it is known that ERK1/2 are activated by cytokines like thrombopoietin (28.Rouyez M. Boucheron C. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Four I. Porteau F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4991-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has also been established that ERK activation controls T-cell selection (29.Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and that sustained stimulation of the ERK pathway is required for megakaryocytic differentiation in cell lines like K562 and CMK (30.Whalen A.N. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 31.Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol.

However, an overall picture of the involvement of ERKs in hemopoiesis and leukemogenesis is still lacking. During these past years, and due to its unquestionable importance in the upbringing of oncogenic transformation and its deep implication in the events that will ultimately decide cell fate, much attention has been focused on the ERK pathway as a possible target for newly designed antineoplastic drugs (33.Heimbrook D.C. Oliff A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to establish the role that the activation of the ERK pathway plays in the processes that lead to malignant transformation within a specific tissue or cell type. For this purpose, we have investigated the role of ERK1/2 in several myeloid leukemia cell lines when proliferating and subjected to the effects of a wide array of well known antileukemic and differentiating agents. Our results indicate that myeloid leukemia cells responded to mitogenic stimuli and grew without pronounced variations on ERK1/2 activation and that blockade of ERK1/2 activity, both pharmacologically and genetically, did not affect the cell proliferation rate. Likewise, differentiation of leukemic cells, regardless of the lineage they were committed to, could take place with and without ERK stimulation. Moreover, a differentiating stimulus like the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbo-13-acetate (TPA), which invariably induces ERK1/2 activation, may or may not induce differentiation, depending on the cell line. Also, leukemic cell lines expressing an active mutant of MEK (34.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar) in which ERKs are constitutively activated do not exhibit alterations in their proliferation and differentiation behaviors. Overall, our results indicate that ERK activation is not an essential process in leukemic cell proliferation and differentiation, and therefore the ERK pathway would not be a suitable target for antileukemic therapy. Cells were regularly grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. 32D cells were supplemented with 10% interleukin-3-rich WEHI-conditioned medium. Cell densities were kept below 106 cells/ml. When indicated, exponentially growing cells at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml were treated for 3 days with the different differentiating agents: TPA (Sigma), 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) (Upjohn), hydroxyurea (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), busulfan (Sigma), staurosporine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Me2SO (Sigma), and daunomycin (Sigma). The MEK inhibitor PD98059 was from New England Biolabs. When indicated, cells were growth-arrested by serum starvation for 48 h in most cases or 4 h in the case of 32D. Growth arrest and routine cell growth and viability were assayed by hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion test counts. pCMVHA-ERK2 K52R, and pCDNA MEK E were transfected by electroporation (400 V, 500 microfarads) using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser apparatus. After electroporation, cells were incubated for 48 h, and 0.6 mg/ml G418 was added. Individual clones were isolated by minimal dilution in microtiter plates and cells were selected for the following 2–3 weeks. Morphological differentiation was monitored by examining fixed slide preparations stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and assessed using established cytological criteria. The fraction of hemoglobin-producing cells was scored by benzidine staining as described previously (35.Delgado M.D. Lerga A. Cañelles M. Gomez-Casares M.T. Leon J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1659-1665PubMed Google Scholar). Nitro blue tetrazolium dye reduction and α-naphtyl acetate esterase test were used to monitor monocyte/granulocytic differentiation (35.Delgado M.D. Lerga A. Cañelles M. Gomez-Casares M.T. Leon J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1659-1665PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of cell surface markers was measured by quantitative fluorescence analysis using an Epics Profile II flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics). The cells were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with the appropriate monoclonal antibodies. At least 10,000 cells were analyzed for each antibody for light scattering and fluorescence intensity. The antibodies used were anti-glycoprotein IIIa (CD61), CD41, CD64, and CD14 (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated) (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark). Nonspecific fluorescence was determined by using isotypic negative control antibodies. Leukemic cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmvanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with the corresponding antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm vanadate and boiled in 50 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Cappel). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against ERK1/2 (C-14) and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody was from Babco. Endogenous ERK1/2 activity was determined as described previously (36.Crespo P. Xu N. Daniotti J.L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody (C-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the precipitating antibody and myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate. pCDNAHA-ERK2 and -ERK1 were transfected by electroporation, after which cells were incubated for 48 h and serum-starved, and kinase assays were performed as described above using anti-HA antibody for immunoprecipitation. In this study, we have chosen a series of cell lines representative of the two main types of myeloid leukemias, including K562, KBM5, and KU812, typical Philadelphia-positive, chronic myelogenous leukemia lines, and HL60 and U937 archetypes of acute myeloid leukemias (9.Lubbert M. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1988; 2: 121-133Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We also included murine 32D cells that are diploid, nontumorogenic, interleukin-3-dependent myeloid progenitor cells (37.Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 38.Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4042-4050PubMed Google Scholar). As a first approach to study the role of ERKs in myeloid leukemia cell proliferation, we investigated the level of activation of ERK1/2 in actively growing cells. To do so, cultures of the different cell lines were serum-starved for different periods, ranging from 4 h in 32D cells to 48 h in the case of K562 and KU812, until a complete growth arrest took place, and ERK activation was compared with that found in exponentially growing cultures by means of an immunocomplex assay using MBP as a substrate, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Because ERK activities in leukemic cells are extremely low, films had to be overexposed to detect the minimal signal. However, under this prolonged exposure, the signal emitted by the control 293T epithelial cells would be saturating. To avoid this effect, kinase assays on 293T cells were performed with one-third of the cellular lysate. As shown in Fig. 1 A,top panel, basal ERK1/2 activities under growth arrest varied extensively among the cell lines tested, from almost undetectable levels in 32D and U937 cells to higher levels, such as those present in the CML lines KBM5 and KU812. However, no significant differences in ERK activity were found between proliferating and growth-arrested cells in most cases. Slight elevations were detected in growing U937 cells, although small when compared with the increase on ERK1/2 stimulation found in growing 293T cells, known to require ERK activation for proliferation (39.Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This results regarding ERK kinase activity were further verified by immunoblotting, using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated, thus activated, forms of ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 1 A, middle panel, significant levels of phospho-ERK1/2 were only detected in total lysates of growing 293T cells, being almost undetectable in the leukemic cell lines regardless of their proliferating status. ERK1/2 protein levels also varied extensively among the different cell lines, but no significant variations were detected between growth-arrested and proliferating cells, with the exception of K562 cells, in which a slight elevation was evident in growing cells (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). We next determined whether leukemic cells would respond to an acute mitogenic stimulus with an elevation on ERK1/2 activity. For this purpose, cells were growth-arrested by serum starvation and subsequently stimulated by the addition of serum for 5 min. While serum stimulation resulted in a potent elevation on the activation of ERKs in the control 293T epithelial cells, only the U937 leukemic cell line responded with a significant increase on ERK activity (Fig.1 B). In the rest of the cell lines, almost no variations on ERK1/2 function were found between serum-stimulated and -starved cells. Likewise, no variations were detected in ERK1/2 protein levels (Fig.1 B). This result was further substantiated utilizing defined mitogenic stimuli, such as PDGF and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), known to potently activate ERK1/2 in other cell types (10.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Quiescent K562 cells did not respond with a significant elevation on ERK activation upon the addition of LPA or PDGF (Fig.2 A), despite having functional receptors (Refs. 40.van der Eb R.L.

Landegent J.E. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1395-1399PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). While under the same experimental setting, stimulation with the tumor promoter TPA resulted in a pronounced ERK activation, as described previously (30.Whalen A.N. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 31.Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol.

Blood. 1997; 90: 3462-3470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as determined by ERK1/2 phosphorylating activity over MBP and phospho-ERK levels (Fig. 2 A, top and middle panels). Stimulation with either LPA or PDGF did not result in changes in the phosphotyrosine pattern, which remained at very high basal levels even in serum-starved cells. Only TPA treatment caused the appearance of newly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, such as the one running at around 42–44 kDa (arrow in Fig. 2 A,lower panel) that probably corresponds to ERK1/2. These findings were then verified by specifically assaying the individual activities of ERK1 and ERK2. For this purpose and because commercially available antibodies cannot discriminate accurately between the two ERKs, we transfected K562 cells with HA epitope-tagged versions of ERK1 and ERK2 that enabled us to assay selectively the activation of each isoform. As before, no differences were found in the activation status of ERK2 and ERK1 between growing and quiescent cells, and neither PDGF nor LPA were able to induce any activation of ERK1 or ERK2 that, as before, could only be elicited upon stimulation with TPA (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained in KU812 cells (data not shown). To investigate further the requirement for ERK activation during leukemic proliferation, we utilized the inhibitor PD98059, which has been reported to inhibit MEK activation by upstream effectors, thus blocking ERK activation in a wide variety of cell types (30.Whalen A.N.

It was found that treatment of exponentially growing cell cultures with PD98059 at a concentration of 10 μm, at which ERK1/2 activation by exogenous stimuli was effectively suppressed (see Fig. 5) and the basal ERK activity levels were diminished (Fig.3, inset, and data not shown), did not significantly affect the growth kinetics of most cell lines tested (Fig. 3), with the exception of HL60 cells, in which a 60% reduction in cell number was observed after 4 days of treatment. Increasing PD98059 concentration to 50 μm, however, completely blocked proliferation in the case of KBM5 or HL60 cell lines or reduced it by 40–50% in the rest of the cell lines tested in the absence of any detectable cell toxicity (data not shown).Figure 3Effects of PD98059 in the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Cultures of the different leukemia cell lines were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml, and the growth rate of untreated cells (open circles), cells growing in the presence of 10 μm PD98059 (closed circles), or 50 μm PD98059 (closed squares) was determined.

Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Poyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). To study the effects of the ERK2 mutant (hereafter referred to as ERK2 DK) in leukemic cell proliferation, we first stably transfected K562 and KU812 cells with an expression vector carrying an HA-tagged ERK2 DK to facilitate its detection, and individual colonies selected on the basis of their resistance to Geneticin were isolated. To check if ERK2 DK had growth-inhibitory properties, we compared the number of viable colonies arising after Geneticin selection of ERK2 DK-transfected cells with those yielded by the transfection of an empty vector and found no significant differences (data not shown). Ten clones were selected for each cell line, based on the stable expression of HA-ERK2 DK during extended culture conditions. In order to avoid misinterpretations due to clonal variations, these clones were pooled, resulting in mass cultures, named K562DK and KU812DK, in which HA-ERK2 DK was stably expressed as shown by anti-HA immunoprecipitation and anti-ERK immunoblotting (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). To confirm the functionality of the transfected ERK2 DK, we assessed its ability to interfere with the endogenous ERK activity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, top panel, TPA-induced ERK activation was markedly diminished in KU812DK cells in comparison with the response detected in TPA-treated KU812 parental cells. Moreover, upon prolonged exposure, a reduction of the basal ERK activity could be detected in the ERK2 DK transfectants in comparison with the parental cells (Fig. 4 B, lower panel), thus verifying its inhibitory effects. Expression of the dominant inhibitory ERK2 mutant, however, did not have a negative effect on the proliferation kinetics of both cell lines tested. As seen in Fig.4 C, both K562 DK and KU812 DK cell lines grew at the same rate and reached similar cellular densities after 4 days in culture as their respective parental cell lines, suggesting that active ERKs are not required for leukemic proliferation. It has been shown that activation of ERK2 is a requisite for TPA-induced differentiation of the CML cell line K562 (30.Whalen A.N. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 31.Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1998; 238: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine if this is a common feature to all of the cell lines of this type of leukemia, we investigated the effect of the blockade of ERK activation on the differentiation of KU812 cells. In a similar fashion to what has previously been shown in K562 cells (30.Whalen A.N. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), stimulation of KU812 cells with TPA induces a fast, potent, and sustained activation of ERKs, remaining at peak levels for more than 3 h after stimulation (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, a 30-min pretreatment with PD98059 at concentrations as low as 10 μm completely abolishes TPA-induced ERK activation (Fig.5 B). Likewise, 10 μm PD98059 inhibited to the same extent the specific ERK1 and ERK2 activities, determined in cells transfected with HA-ERK1 and HA-ERK2 (data not shown). Like K562, the KU812 cell line was characterized as a blast crisis CML, in which basophilic precursors are predominant (3.Kishi K. Leukemia Res. 1985; 9: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and closely resembles K562 in exhibiting the potential to differentiate into mature hematopoietic lineages such as basophils, monocytes, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes in response to various agents (44.Hara T. Yamada K. Tachibana H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Untreated cells showed a homogeneous population of typical blastic, lobulated cells with rounded nuclei and a diameter of 8–10 μm (Fig.6 A). After 3 days of TPA treatment, the cells had a more heterogeneous nature, 36% of them showed a monocytic-macrophagic morphology with a high cytoplasm/nucleus ratio and eccentrically located kidney-shaped nuclei (Fig.6 B), scored positive in nitro blue tetrazolium and α-naphtyl acetate esterase tests, a"

The cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD120a (p55) contains six basic Pro-directed kinase consensus phosphorylation motifs and four ERK consensus phosphorylation motifs located within the membrane proximal region of the receptor (residues 207–325). In recent studies, we investigated the ability of members of the MAPK family to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD120a (p55). Using a GST fusion protein comprising the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) (residues 207–425) as a solid phase substrate for in vitro kinase assays, we showed that although p42 mapk/erk2, p46 jnk1, and p38 mapk are all activated rapidly in response to stimulation of mouse macrophages with TNF-α, only p42 mapk/erk2 is capable of binding to and phosphorylating the GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein. 2Cottin, V., Van Linden, A., and Riches, D. W. H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 32975–32987. As a consequence of phosphorylation by p42 mapk/erk2, CD120a (p55) expression at the plasma membrane and within the Golgi complex is reduced, and the receptor is relocalized to intracellular tubular structures that are associated with elements of the endoplasmic reticulum.2 Thus, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) by p42 mapk/erk2 represents a novel mechanism to regulate the subcellular localization of the receptor. These findings have therefore focused our attention on the question of the number and positions of the Ser and Thr residues within the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) which are subject to phosphorylation. In this study, we have addressed this question by using deletional and site-directed mutagenesis to define the region(s) and the specific Ser and Thr residues that are phosphorylated by p42 mapk/erk2. In addition, we have investigated the role of specific TNF receptors in initiating this response. As we will show, stimulation with TNF-α via a CD120a (p55)-dependent mechanism results in the preferential phosphorylation of two residues, Thr-236 and Ser-270, located within the membrane proximal region of the receptor, by p42 mapk/erk2.

Briefly, bone marrow-derived progenitor cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in six-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 10% (v/v) L929 conditioned medium (as a source of CSF-1). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 10% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere for 5 days, at which time they were given additional medium. The media were replaced on day 6 and cells used between day 6 and day 8. The vector encoding the fusion protein between GST and the cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD120a (p55) (GST-CD120a207–425) has been described previously.2 NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal deletion mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase and full-length mouse CD120a (p55) as template. Point mutations were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of overlapping sections with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers followed by fusion of the mutated segments by polymerase chain reaction using upstream and downstream primers that contained EcoRI andSalI restriction sites, respectively. Following digestion with EcoRI and SalI, the cDNAs were ligated into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX 5X-1 to allow in-frame expression of the GST-cytoplasmic domain mutant fusion proteins. The primers used in the construction of the mutant GST-CD120a fusion proteins are shown in Table I. All constructs were subjected to automated DNA sequencing to verify their authenticity.Table IPrimer sequences used in the construction of CD120a (p55) phosphorylation point mutantsT236A(5′) 5′-GTCGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGG-3′(3′) 3′-GGGGAGGGGGCTGGAGCTAGGGGCTTTCCAGC-5′S240A(5′) 5′-CCCGCCCCAGCCTTCAGCCCCACCT-3′(3′) 5′-GGCTGGGGCGGGGGCTGGAGTTAGGGGCTTT-3′S244A(5′) 5′-TCCCCAGCCTTCGCCCCCACCTCCGGC-3′(3′) 5′-GCCGGAGGTGGGGGCGAAGGCTGGGGAGGGGGCTGG-3′S270A(5′) 5′-GTACCCCCATCGCCCCCATCTTCGGTCC-3′(3′) 5′-GGACCGAAGATGGGGGCGATGGGGGTAC-3′T236A/S240A/S244A(5′) 5′-AGCCCCCGCCCCAGCCTTCGCCCCCACCTCCGGCTTCAA-3′(3′) 5′-AGGCTGGGGCGGGGGCTGGAGCTAGGGGCTTTCCAGCCTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Wild type and mutant constructs encoding FLAG epitope-tagged mouse CD120a (p55) were prepared by amplifying the cDNA encoding residues 1–425 (i.e. the entire receptor except for the signal peptide sequence) using primers containing EcoRI restriction sites. Following digestion with EcoRI, the cDNA was ligated into EcoRI-digested pFLAG-CMV-1 downstream of the sequences encoding the preprotrypsinogen signal peptide and FLAG epitope. Site-directed mutations of individual amino acid residues, and combinations thereof, were prepared by overlapping polymerase chain reaction as described above. All constructs were also subjected to automated DNA sequencing to confirm their authenticity. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH-5α and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose as described by Frangioni et al. (36.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, DH-5α cells containing the plasmid of interest were grown in 500 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to anA 550 of 0.5–0.7. The fusion protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in ice-cold STE (10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mmNaCl and 1 mm EDTA), incubated on ice in 45 ml of STE containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme, and lysed in 1.5% (w/v) sarkosyl containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The supernatant was sheared through a 22-gauge needle, filtered through two or three layers of cheesecloth, and rendered 2% (v/v) with respect to Triton X-100. The lysate was then centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 3 ml of washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed six times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline as a 50% (v/v) slurry. The amount of GST fusion protein bound to each preparation of beads was quantified by SDS-PAGE, Gelcode Blue staining, and comparison with a bovine serum albumin standard curve. The phosphorylation of solid phase GST-CD120a (p55) cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins was assayed byin vitro kinase assays as described previously.2Briefly, after stimulation, macrophage monolayers were rinsed in ice-cold 20 mm Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed on ice in 500 μl of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4) (27.Winston B.W. Lange-Carter C.A. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of GST-Sepharose beads for 20 min at 4 °C. GST fusion protein beads were then added to the precleared lysates and incubated on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, twice in PAN buffer (10 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and resuspended in 35 μl of PAN buffer. Kinase buffer (20 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mmMnCl2 and 20 μg/ml aprotinin), together with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, was added to a final volume of 75 μl. The kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 5 × Laemmli buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were immediately boiled for 5 min, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described by Hunter and Sefton (37.Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 32P-Labeled GST-CD120a phosphoproteins were excised from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 2 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysate was lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in 10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (2.5% (v/v) formic acid, 7.8% (v/v) glacial acetic acid). Cellulose TLC plates were spotted sequentially with 1 μl of a mix of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards (5 mg/ml) and a fixed volume of the phosphoprotein hydrolysate. Phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer for the first dimension at 1,500 V for 40 min and pH 3.5 buffer (5% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine) in the second dimension for 20 min at 1,200 V using an HTLE-7000 system. The authentic phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by spraying with ninhydrin (0.05% (v/v) in acetone), and the32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Approximately 2 × 105 COS-7 cells were seeded in six-well (35-mm) dishes and transfected the following day with 0.5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent in a total volume of 1 ml of Opti-MEM. The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with pcDNA3 vector. 18 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-free medium and metabolically labeled by incubation in phosphate-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 1 mCi of32Pi for 6 h. The cells were then lysed in 250 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, and postnuclear supernatants were precleared with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. CD120a (p55) was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of antagonist hamster anti-CD120a (p55) monoclonal antibody and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 12 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and the released proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography. To investigate the phosphorylation of residues located within the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55), we used the GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein as a solid phase matrix both to purify kinases that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) and to serve as a substrate in in vitro kinase assays as reported previously (13.Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 Monolayers of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were incubated in the presence and absence of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for up to 30 min, lysed, and tested for CD120a (p55) kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1(top panel), a low and generally consistent level of basal phosphorylation of the GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein was detected at all time points in the absence of stimulation. However, stimulation with TNF-α resulted in a rapid and transient increase in the phosphorylation of the GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein, which was first detected at 5 min, peaked at 10 min, and had returned toward base-line levels by 30 min. The major phosphorylated species had a molecular mass of ∼51 kDa and comigrated with the GST fusion protein. However, at least two additional phosphoproteins with slower mobility, believed to represent multiply phosphorylated species, were also detected (Fig. 1). Scanning densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs indicated that the phosphorylation of GST-CD120a207–425 was increased ∼8–10-fold over that of unstimulated cells at 10 min. Phosphorylation of GST-coated Sepharose beads was not detected at any time point in either the presence or absence of TNF-α (Fig. 1 and data not shown). In addition, approximately equivalent amounts of fusion protein were present at each time point as reflected by the equality of protein staining using Gelcode Blue (Fig. 1, middle panel). Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of excised segments of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the phosphorylated GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein revealed that the fusion protein was phosphorylated on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues at a ratio of ∼2:1:0.2 at all time points using lysates from unstimulated macrophages as a source of kinase (Fig.2). However, stimulation with TNF-α increased the level of phosphorylation of both Ser and Thr residues, but the level of Tyr phosphorylation remained unchanged (Fig. 2). The ratio of phosphoserine to phosphothreonine remained constant at ∼2:1 at all time points. Thus, stimulation of mouse macrophages with TNF-α resulted in the rapid and transient activation of a protein Ser/Thr kinase that was capable of binding to and phosphorylating residues located within the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55).Figure 2Phosphoamino acid analysis of the GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein following phosphorylation by macrophage lysates stimulated with TNF -α for the indicated times. Basal kinase activity was mainly on Ser (upper left spot) and Thr (upper right spot) residues, with a lower although detectable level of basal Tyr phosphorylation (lower right spot). Stimulation with TNF-α led to an increase in Ser and Thr phosphorylation peaking at 10 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As can be seen in Fig. 1 (bottom panel), the time course of phosphorylation of sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) by macrophage lysates paralleled the time course of activation of p42 mapk/erk2 as reflected by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody. To investigate further the role of ERK in the phosphorylation of GST-CD120a207–425, we pretreated macrophages with PD098059 (a selective MEK1 inhibitor) prior to stimulation with TNF-α (10 ng/ml for 10 min). As can be seen in Fig.3 A, PD098059 pretreatment substantially inhibited the GST-CD120a207–425 kinase activity in macrophage lysates. In addition, incubation of GST-CD120a207–425-coated Sepharose beads with purified MEK1-activated recombinant rat p42 mapk/erk2 resulted in the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the fusion protein in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings thus confirm the conclusion that p42 mapk/erk2 is capable of phosphorylating the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55). Because CD120a (p55) serves as a substrate for Ser/Thr phosphorylation after stimulation with TNF-α, we investigated the roles of the two TNF-α receptors in the activation of CD120a (p55) kinase activity. First, because human TNF-α binds to mouse CD120a (p55) but not CD120b (p75), macrophage monolayers were stimulated with human or mouse TNF-α (0.01–100 ng/ml for 10 min), and the ability of lysates to support phosphorylation of GST-CD120a207–425was determined. As can be seen in Fig.4 A, stimulation with mouse TNF-α resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of GST-CD120a207–425 fusion protein which was detected initially at ∼1 ng/ml TNF-α and peaked at ∼10 ng/ml TNF-α. Incubation of mouse macrophages with human TNF-α also resulted in the activation of GST-CD120a207–425 kinase activity, although the sensitivity of the cells to human TNF-α appeared to be reduced compared with mouse TNF-α (Fig. 4 A). Similar decrements in the sensitivity of mouse cells to human TNF-α have been observed previously in a number of systems (38.Kalb A. Bluethmann H. Moore M.W. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Second, we quantified CD120a (p55) kinase activity in macrophage lysates from CD120a (p55) (−/−), CD120b (p75) (−/−), and CD120a (p55)/CD120b (p75) double (−/−) mice following stimulation with TNF-α (10 ng/ml for 10 min).

Of these, critical mutants were further characterized after purification or by different amino acid substitutions. H262A mutant showed reduced affinities both for glucose and PQQ without significant effect on glucose oxidase activity, indicating that His-262 occurs very close to PQQ and glucose, but is not the electron acceptor from PQQH2. W404A and W404F showed pronounced reductions of affinity for PQQ, and the latter rather than the former had equivalent glucose oxidase activity to the wild type, suggesting that Trp-404 may be a support for PQQ and important for the positioning of PQQ. D466N, D466E, and K493A showed very low glucose oxidase activities without influence on the affinity for PQQ. Judging from the enzyme activities of D466E and K493A, as well as their absorption spectra of PQQ during glucose oxidation, we conclude that Asp-466 initiates glucose oxidation reaction by abstraction of a proton from glucose and Lys-493 is involved in electron transfer from PQQH2.

Anthony C. Poole R.K. Advances in Microbial Physiology. 40. Academic Press, London1998: 1-80Google Scholar). Membrane-bound quinoprotein GDH of Escherichia colicatalyzes oxidation of the C-1 hydroxyl group of the pyranose form ofd-glucose to d-glucono-δ-lactone, which is spontaneously converted to d-gluconate, and concomitantly transfers electrons to ubiquinol oxidase through ubiquinone in the respiratory chain (2.Van Schie B.J.

Topological analysis revealed that the monomeric GDH possesses five trans-membrane segments at the N-terminal portion (residues 1–154), which ensure strong anchorage of the protein in the inner membrane (4.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining C-terminal portion (residues 155–796) occurs at the periplasmic side of the membrane. This portion is assumed to have a catalytic domain including PQQ (5.Duine J.A.

Three-dimensional structures of MDHs from three different bacteria have been determined by x-ray crystallography (10.Xia Z.-X. Dai W.-W. Xiong J.-P. Hao Z.-P. Davidson V.L. White S. Mathews F.S. J.

PQQ is tightly stacked within a chamber of the active site in the α subunit, and Ca2+ helps PQQ to be maintained in the correct configuration. Amino acid residues interacting with PQQ and Ca2+ are dispersed in the whole α subunit. Alignment of the PQQ-binding proteins or subunits among quinoprotein dehydrogenases reveals that the periplasmic domain of GDH in E. coli has 26% sequence similarity to the α subunit of MDH inMethylobacterium extorquens (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the basis of the superbarrel structure of the α subunit of MDH, a model structure of GDH was proposed except for its N-terminal trans-membrane domain and several unique segments lacking in MDH (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The proposed model depicted the possible amino acid residues interacting with PQQ in the catalytic domain of GDH (Fig. 1). A key feature of PQQ structure isortho-quinone at the C-4 and C-5 positions, which becomes reduced to the quinol during catalysis (14.Duine J.A. Frank J. Jongejan J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15.Duine J.A. Frank J. Jongejan J.A. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 59: 169-212PubMed Google Scholar). In the oxidized state, the C-5 carbonyl is very reactive toward nucleophiles such as alcohols, ammonia, amines, cyanide, and amino acids (15.Duine J.A. Frank J. Jongejan J.A. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 59: 169-212PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The PQQ in GDH is proposed to be sandwiched between Trp-404 and His-262 by analogy with the MDH structure in M. extorquens (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), where PQQ is tightly stacked between Trp-243 and a novel disulfide ring composed of Cys-103 and Cys-104 (17.Blake C.C.F. Ghosh M. Harlos K. Avezoux A. Anthony C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to such vertical interactions with PQQ, there are many equatorial interactions between substituent groups of PQQ and amino acid residues in the model GDH, many of which are conserved in MDH (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Among these residues, Lys-493 and Asn-607 are proposed to make hydrogen bonds with C-4 or C-5 carbonyl oxygen at the reactive site of PQQ, and Asp-466 is proposed to be involved in the initiation of glucose oxidation. Therefore, all the above residues are assumed to be important for the catalytic reaction of GDH. Some chemical approach (18.Imanaga Y. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. PQQ and Quinoproteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1989: 87-96Crossref Google Scholar) and mutagenic analyses (19.Yamada M. Inbe H. Tanaka M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. J. Biol.

To examine that assumption, we targeted the amino acid residues surrounding the reactive site of PQQ in the model. Several mutants were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis on the targeted residues and characterized by kinetic and spectral analyses.

Mutagenic primers used were: 5′-CTTTCCAGgccGTAACCTG-3′ for H262A, 5′-CAAACTCCgcgGCACCAGC-3′ for W404A, 5′-CAAACTCCtttGCACCAGC-3′ for W404F, 5′-CGATTGCCgccCCAATGGC-3′ for N607A, 5′-CTCCGGCGgcaACCGGCAA-3′ for K493A, 5′-CTCCGGCGcgtACCGGCAA-3′ for K493R, 5′-ACCTGTGGgccATGGATCTT-3′ for D466A, 5′-ACCTGTGGaacATGGATCTT-3′ for D466N, and 5′-ACCTGTGGgaaATGGATCTT-3′ for D466E. PCR of 30 cycles for site-specific mutagenesis was performed by using a Takara PCR Thermal Cycler MP; each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were recovered by ethanol precipitation after phenol extraction and introduced into MV1184. Kanamycin-resistance mutants were isolated, and mutation positions were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (28.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52760) Google Scholar) using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Conventional recombinant DNA techniques (29.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) were used for exchanging the mutated regions with the corresponding in pUCGCD1 bearing the wild-type GDH gene. The recombined mutant plasmids and their mutation positions were reconfirmed by restriction mapping and by DNA sequencing. Expression of GDH mutants was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody raised againstE. coli GDH as described previously (30.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells harboring the wild-type plasmid, pUCGCD1, or mutant pUCGCDs were grown in LB (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for 14 h at 37 °C. Membrane fractions were then prepared according to the procedure described previously (4.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Critical mutant GDHs as well as the wild-type GDH were purified according to the procedure described (4.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19.Yamada M. Inbe H. Tanaka M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. J. Biol.

For W404A mutant, all purification steps were performed in the presence of 0.1 μm PQQ to stabilize enzyme activity. Purified enzymes were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm their homogeneity. PMS reductase activity and glucose oxidase activity (glucose oxidase respiratory chain activity) were measured as described (4.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Matsushita K. Shinagawa E. Adachi O. Ameyama M. J. Biochem.

Note that PMS reductase activity with 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) was found to be about 2 times higher than that with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0), reported previously (19.Yamada M. Inbe H. Tanaka M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22021-22027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Q-2 reductase activity was measured at 25 °C by the addition of 33 mm glucose and 30 μm Q-2 in 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) after 20 min preincubation in the presence of 1 μm PQQ, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.025% Tween 20. One unit of PMS reductase and Q-2 reductase activities are defined as 1 μmol of 2,4-dichlorophenol indophenol and Q-2, respectively, reduced/min, both of which correspond to 1 μmol of glucose oxidized/min. One unit of glucose oxidase activity is defined as 1 microatom of oxygen consumed/min, which is equivalent to 1 μmol of glucose oxidized/min.K m values were estimated on the basis of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Protein content was determined according to the Dulley and Grieve method (32.Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Occurrence of the reduced form of PQQ during the catalytic reaction was examined by taking the absolute absorption spectra of purified apo-forms (4.5 μm each) of the wild-type and three mutant GDHs in 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% alkylglucoside on a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Multispec-1500). Spectra were then taken after holoenzyme formation, which was performed by incubation with 4.5 μm PQQ and 0.5 mm MgCl2for 20 min at 25 °C, and subsequently spectra were taken after the addition of 33 mm glucose to the holoenzyme.Table IIIPMS and Q-2 reductase activities of purified mutant GDHs and their Km values for PQQ and glucoseMutantPMS reductase activityQ-2 reductase activityK mPQQK mGluunits/mg (%)aValues in parentheses are percentages of activity of the wild type.units/mg (%)aValues in parentheses are percentages of activity of the wild type.nmmmWild type280 (100)40 (100)1150.95K493A3.0 (1.1)0.03 (0.075)531.1D466E0.40 (0.14)0.002 (0.005)1703.5D730N9.0 (3.2)4.0 (10)1200.80W404A0.04 (0.014)NDbNot determined.62001.9PMS reductase activity was measured in the presence of 33 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm PQQ, except that 10 μm PQQ was added at a final concentration for W404A mutant.

Reported values are the average of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. In order to examine the functions of the amino acid residues located close to the active site of the model GDH (Fig.1), several substitutions were introduced into it by site-specific mutagenesis. The plasmid clones of the mutants and their mutation sites were shown in TableI. The stability and expression level of mutant GDH proteins were checked by Western blot analysis (Fig.2). It revealed that contents of the mutant GDHs in the membrane fractions were 70–90% of that of the wild type except for D466A and W404A. The contents of the latter two mutants were about 10% and 40%, respectively, indicating that both GDH molecules may be unstable and presumably susceptible to intracellular proteolytic degradation. Characteristics of the mutant GDHs were defined by the PMS reductase and glucose oxidase activities of the membrane fractions (TableII), which were calculated based on their relative GDH contents in the fractions estimated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). These activities and K m values for PQQ and glucose were compared with those of the wild type. Moreover, some of the critical mutants were characterized after purification (Table III). Q-2 reductase activity was measured with the purified mutant GDHs, which may reflect the ability of intramolecular electron transfer. TheK m values for PQQ and glucose of the purified mutant GDHs were found to be nearly the same as those observed in the membrane fractions as shown in Table II. The K493A and D466E mutant GDHs showed very low Q-2 reductase activities compared with the wild type, which is consistent with the results of glucose oxidase activity observed in the membrane fractions.Table IIPMS reductase and glucose oxidase activities of mutant GDHs in membrane fractions and their Km values for PQQ and glucoseMutantPMS reductase activityGlucose oxidase activityaGlucose oxidase respiratory chain activity.Relative GDH amount in membranebThe relative amount of GDH protein in the membrane fractions was estimated from the results of Western blot shown in Fig. 2 and expressed as a percentage of that from the wild type.Relative PMS reductase activitycValues of PMS reductase and oxidase activities were corrected by the relative amount of GDH protein in the membrane fractions.Relative glucose oxidase activitycValues of PMS reductase and oxidase activities were corrected by the relative amount of GDH protein in the membrane fractions.K mPQQK mGlumilliunits/mg%milliunits/mg (%)dValues in parentheses are percentages of activity of the wild type.nmmmWild type12,000210010012,000 (100)2100 (100)1100.9H262A3900790904300 (36)880 (42)88010W404A1.230403 (0.03)75 (3.6)60001.2W404F14051090160 (1.3)570 (27)20,0002.0N607A3600690904000 (33)770 (37)2200.8K493A280670400 (3.3)8.6 (0.4)501.4K493R85170120 (1)1.4 (0.07)16,0001.5D466E32248040 (0.3)30 (1.4)1403.0D466N1401870200 (1.7)26 (1.2)14012PMS reductase activity was measured in the presence of 33 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm PQQ, and 8 mm NaN3 except that 10 μm PQQ was added at a final concentration for W404A, and 30 μm PQQ was added for W404F and K493R mutants.

K m values were estimated by measuring PMS reductase activity. Reported values are the averages of two to three independent experiments performed in triplicate. In the model GDH, PQQ was proposed to be sandwiched between Trp-404 on the lower side and His-262 on the upper side. As the disulfide ring in MDH of M. extorquens was proposed to play a role in electron transfer reaction (17.Blake C.C.F. Ghosh M. Harlos K. Avezoux A. Anthony C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), His-262 in GDH, being at the corresponding position to the ring, was postulated to act as an electron acceptor. The H262A mutation was found to have no significant effect on PMS reductase and glucose oxidase activities, but its affinities for glucose and PQQ were decreased about 11- and 8-fold, respectively, compared with those of the wild-type GDH in the membrane fractions (Table II). These results suggest that His-262 is not an electron acceptor from PQQH2, but it may be located very close to PQQ and glucose molecules at the active site. Recently, a similar conclusion has been drawn for the H262Y mutant by Cozier et al. (21.Cozier G.E. Salleh R.A. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 639-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The W404A showed a pronounced reduction of affinity for PQQ and very low PMS reductase and glucose oxidase activities compared with the wild type (Table II). The lower activity is probably because the alanine molecule may be too small as a lower planer support for PQQ. We thus constructed and tested another mutant, W404F. This mutant was found to have relatively higher activities of PMS reductase and glucose oxidase than W404A, although it showed extremely low affinity for PQQ (TableII). The substitution from Trp to Ala at position 404 may cause a local structural change, which influences the accessibility of PQQ or the positioning of PQQ in the catalytic site. Since W404F had nearly the equivalent glucose oxidase activity to that of the wild type, the Phe residue may be exchangeable with the Trp residue at least as a support for PQQ. Therefore, Trp-404 is assumed to be very close to PQQ and to confer a support for PQQ, which may be important for the positioning of PQQ as proposed previously (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, W404F was found to have very weak activity of PMS reductase but still retained glucose oxidase activity equivalent to that of the wild type (Table II). It is likely that somehow this mutation has weakened the electron transfer to PMS. There are many equatorial interactions between substituent groups of PQQ and amino acid residues in the model GDH (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the active site of GDH, the PQQ ligation to Ca2+ or Mg2+ may be nearly the same as in MDH (18.Imanaga Y. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. PQQ and Quinoproteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1989: 87-96Crossref Google Scholar), but the ligation to the protein would be different from that in MDH. It was proposed that Asn-607 is equatorially interacting with C-4 and Lys-493 interacting with C-4 and C-5 of PQQ, and Asp-466 is a possible residue involved in the initial proton abstraction reaction from glucose (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In order to clarify the catalytic reaction mechanism, substitutions were performed on these three residues, Asn-607, Lys-493, and Asp-466 of GDH. The model GDH showed that the amide group of Asn-607 makes a hydrogen bond interaction with the C-4 carbonyl of PQQ (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the N607A mutant showed only slightly reduced activities of PMS reductase and glucose oxidase without significant effect on the affinity for PQQ (Table II). Therefore, it is unlikely that Asn at the position 607 is a crucial residue for the catalytic reaction or the stabilization of PQQ in the active site. The K493A and K493R mutants were found to have very low activities of both PMS reductase and glucose oxidase in the membrane fractions compared with the wild type (Table II), and purified K493A also showed very low Q-2 reductase activity (Table III). K493A seemed to have no effect on the affinity for PQQ but K493R showed a pronounced reduction of affinity for PQQ (Table II). These results suggest that the positive charge of Lys may be crucial for reactivity, but the alteration from Lys to Arg at position 493 may cause a local structural change, resulting in extremely low glucose oxidase activity as well as low affinity for PQQ. Since Arg occurs in MDH at the corresponding position to Lys-493 in GDH, the distance between Lys-493 and C-4 and/or C-5 carbonyl oxygen might be important. Asp-466 was replaced with Asn or Glu. The resultant D466N and D466E were shown to have very low PMS reductase and glucose oxidase activities in the membrane fractions without influences on the affinity for PQQ (Table II). Purified D466E also showed extremely low Q-2 reductase activity, but almost no effect on the affinity for PQQ (TableIII). In addition, both D466N and D466E exhibited decreased affinities for glucose (Table II). These results suggest that Asp-466 may be located near the glucose molecule at the active site and important for the catalytic reaction. It is also suggested that Asp at position 466 is not exchangeable with Glu, presumably due to the restricted distance between Asp-466 and the C-1 hydroxyl group of glucose. Since D730N was demonstrated previously as a crucial residue in the catalytic reaction (19.Yamada M. Inbe H. Tanaka M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22021-22027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the mutant GDH was also purified and characterized (Table III). Its low PMS reductase and Q-2 reductase activities seemed to be consistent with the previous results, showing low PMS reductase, glucose oxidase, and ubiquinone-1-reductase activities in the membrane fractions. Judging from those results described above, at least Asp-466, Lys-493, and Asp-730 appeared to be crucial for a successive process of catalytic reactions from glucose oxidation to ubiquinone reduction. In order to further clarify their functions and positions in the catalytic cycle, we took the absolute absorption spectra of the purified apo- and holo-forms of the wild-type and mutant GDHs, and also followed changes of their spectra after the addition of glucose. As seen in Fig.3, PQQ in the wild type could be almost completely reduced within 10 s after the addition of glucose to the holo-enzyme solution, while only 50% or less reduction of PQQ were observed within 10 s in the case of K493A or D730N. By contrast, negligible reduction of PQQ was found in D466E even 60 min after glucose addition. These results clearly suggest that Asp-466 is involved in a catalytic reaction before PQQ reduction while Lys-493 and Asp-730 perform their functions at the steps after PQQ reduction. The slow and gradual reduction of PQQ in the K493A or D730N mutants may be due to changes of the local structure near the reactive site of PQQ by these mutations. Alternatively, such mutations influenced the pK value of Asp-466 as postulated in MDH (33.Anthony C. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis: A Mechanistic Reference. Academic Press, London1998: 155-180Google Scholar), which led to a decrease in the reaction rate. Two types of mechanism have been proposed in the case of MDH for the initial proton-abstraction reaction from methanol: 1) a reaction mechanism via a covalent hemiketal intermediate and 2) a reaction mechanism by a hydride transfer (34.Frank J. van Krimpen S.H. Verwiel P.E.J. Jongejan J.A. Mulder A.C. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35.Anthony C. Ghosh M. Blake C.C.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At least two lines of evidence supporting the former mechanism have been reported (34.Frank J. van Krimpen S.H. Verwiel P.E.J. Jongejan J.A. Mulder A.C. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,36.Itoh S. Kawakami H. Fukuzumi A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 439-440Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a putative catalytic reaction mechanism of E. coli GDH involving a hemiketal intermediate, where a negatively charged residue Asp-466 acts as a base, which initiates the oxidation reaction by abstraction of a proton from glucose. The proton abstraction leads to an oxyanion form of substrate, which attacks the electrophilic C-5 of PQQ, giving the hemiketal intermediate. The subsequent reaction leads to production of PQQH2 and release of glucono-δ-lactone. After that, Lys-493 hydrogen-bonding with the C-4 and C-5 carbonyl oxygens of PQQ receives electrons as the first electron acceptor from PQQH2, which allows PQQ to be back in the initial oxidized form. On the other hand, this and previous data (19.Yamada M. Inbe H. Tanaka M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22021-22027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) indicated that mutants at position 730 reduced the GDH activity but D730N still retained the ability of PQQH2 formation. Therefore, Asp-730 seems to be involved in the step between PQQH2 and ubiquinone. Its function, however, is not clear because Asp-730 is not present in the active site of the model GDH proposed by Cozier and Anthony (13.Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. H. Toyama for helpful discussion. We also thank Dr. C.

GTP was recently found to stimulate the D1 protein degradation of photoinactivated photosystem II (Spetea, C., Hundal, T., Lohmann, F., and Andersson, B. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.96, 6547–6552). Here we report that GTP enhances the cleavage of the D1 protein D-E loop following exposure of thylakoid membranes to either high light, low light, or repetitive single turnover flashes but not to trypsin. GTP does not stimulate D1 protein degradation in the presence of herbicides known to affect the accessibility of the cleavage site to proteolysis. However, GTP stimulates degradation that can be induced even in darkness in some photosystem II conformers following binding of the PNO8 herbicide (Nakajima, Y., Yoshida, S., Inoue, Y., Yoneyama, K., and Ono, T. (1995) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1230, 38–44). Both the PNO8- and the light-induced primary cleavage of the D1 protein occur in the grana membrane domains. The subsequent migration of photosytem II containing the D1 protein fragments to the stroma domains for secondary proteolysis is light-activated. We conclude that the GTP effect is not confined to a specific photoinactivation pathway nor to the conformational state of the photosytem II acceptor side. Consequently, GTP does not interact with the site of D1 protein cleavage but rather enhances the activity of the endogenous proteolytic system.

Consequently, GTP does not interact with the site of D1 protein cleavage but rather enhances the activity of the endogenous proteolytic system. photosystem proteins in the reaction center of photosystem II primary and secondary quinone acceptors of photosystem II chlorophyll N-octyl-3-nitro-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzamide 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile 2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol guanosine 5′-O-(γ-thiotriphosphate) thermoluminescence Exposure of photosynthetic membranes to light intensities exceeding saturation of electron flow leads to inactivation of photosystem II (PSII)1accompanied by degradation of the reaction center D1 protein (1.Prasil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. Topics in Photosynthesis. 11. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 295-348Google Scholar, 2.Andersson B. Aro E.-M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 780-793Crossref Google Scholar). Photoinactivation occurs initially at the acceptor side of PSII, inhibiting electron flow between the primary and secondary plastoquinone electron acceptors QA and QBbound to the reaction center D2 and D1 proteins, respectively. Impairment of the PSII acceptor side during photoinhibition has been assigned to the generation of stable QA− forms (3.Vass I Styring S. Hundal T. Koivuniemi A. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), a process that can be retarded by the presence of urea-type herbicides (4.Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Etienne A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Krieger-Liszkay and Rutherford (5.Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17339-17344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) showed that binding of phenol-type herbicides at the QBsite can lower the redox potential of the QA/QA−, increasing the sensitivity of PSII to light. The photoinactivation of electron transport causes oxidative damage to the reaction center because of triplet chlorophyll (3Chl) and singlet oxygen (1O2) formation (3.Vass I Styring S. Hundal T. Koivuniemi A. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The primary cleavage site during the proteolytic removal of the damaged D1 protein under acceptor side photoinhibition conditions is located in the stroma-exposed loop connecting the D and E transmembrane helices (6.Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Matoo A.K. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This is the same domain which is cleaved by externally added trypsin (7.Marder J.B. Goloubinoff P. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3900-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Not only very high light intensities but also low light intensities or single turnover flashes can efficiently damage PSII and induce subsequent degradation of the D1 protein (8.Keren N. van Kan P.J.M. Berg A. Shochat S. Styring S. Andersson B. Ohad I. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. 4. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 299-302Google Scholar, 9.Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I.

A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mechanism of photodamage under these conditions involves back electron flow via charge recombination between QB− and the S2,3 states of the oxygen-evolving complex. This process may lead to 3Chl and 1O2 formation as in the case of high light-induced inactivation although via a different pathway (10.Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A wide range of herbicides can interfere with the photoinhibition process. Such herbicides, derived from urea, phenol, or triazine, bind at the QB site, competing with the binding of plastoquinone and thus inhibiting electron flow (11.Trebst A. Draber W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12.Oettmeier W. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 349-408Crossref Google Scholar). Various types of herbicides may interact with different amino acid residues within the QB niche, hence affecting the conformation of this domain of the D1 protein in a specific manner. Such conformational changes can protect the cleavage site against the thylakoid endogenous protease as well as against externally added trypsin. Urea- and triazine-type herbicides but not phenol-type can induce such a protease resistance to the D1 protein (13.Trebst A. Depka B. Kraft B. Johanningmeier U. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 18: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14.Jansen M.A.K. Depka B Trebst A. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Zer H. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that another compound, PNO8, that shares the characteristics of phenol-type herbicides, but in addition has a phloroglucinol nucleus, binds to the QB site, thereby inhibiting PSII electron flow (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, unlike other phenol-type herbicides, the binding of PNO8 to PSII can induce the typical D1 protein degradation even in darkness. It is thought that this herbicide can induce conformational changes in the D-E loop of the D1 protein in a population of PSII centers, thereby exposing the cleavage site to the endogenous protease without any preceding photodamaging event (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The primary products of the D1 protein cleavage were identified as a 23-kDa fragment containing the N-terminal domain and the corresponding 9–10-kDa C-terminal fragment (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as is also the case during D1 protein degradation following acceptor side photoinactivation (17.Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Hirschberg J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1655-1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Salter A.H. Virgin I. Hagman Å. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3990-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19.De Las Rivas J. Shipton C.A. Ponticos M. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6944-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is also suggested that PNO8 triggers the degradation of the D1 protein in PSII centers having a certain conformation of the acceptor side. Short exposure of the thylakoid membranes to light (10 s), which by itself does not cause measurable photoinactivation, induces additional conformational changes of the site and results in an enhanced D1 protein degradation in darkness in the presence of PNO8 (20.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17383-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, this conformation(s) is not stable and decays with a half-life of 1 h. We have recently discovered that GTP is required for the degradation of the D1 protein during acceptor side photoinactivation of PSII (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The presence of GTP but not ATP accelerates the primary cleavage of the D1 protein and the formation of the 23-kDa N-terminal degradation fragment. The question arises whether GTP acts at the substrate level affecting the conformation of the susceptible QB domain or as a modulator of the endogenous proteolytic activity. The results obtained in this work demonstrate that, in dark-adapted thylakoids and in thylakoids photoinactivated under low excitation pressure or by high light, the acceptor side of PSII may assume different conformations which, upon binding of PNO8, expose to different degrees the D-E loop to the endogenous protease. In all cases, GTP promotes the primary cleavage irrespectively of the mode whereby the D-E loop is influenced. Thus, we suggest that GTP may regulate the proteolytic activity at the enzymatic level, but it does not interact directly with the cleavage site in the D-E loop of the D1 protein substrate. Thylakoid membranes were isolated from pea (Pisum sativum) or spinach (Spinacea oleracea) leaves as described previously (22.Andersson B. Åkerlund H.E. Albertsson P.-Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and finally resuspended in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.4 m sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Pea thylakoids diluted in resuspension buffer to a final concentration of 0.4 mg of Chl/ml (3-ml glass cuvettes, 1-cm optical path) were exposed to low light (30 μmol of photons/m2/s) or to single turnover light flashes (150 mJ/pulse, 9-ns pulse width, 532 nm) at a frequency of 1 flash/24 s for up to 4 h (600 total charge separation events) at 22 °C (20.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17383-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In certain experiments, 50% inactivation of electron transport was reached by exposure of spinach thylakoids (0.2 mg of Chl/ml) to heat-filtered visible light (5,000 μmol of photons/m2/s) from a 250 W projector lamp at −3 °C (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After dilution to 0.1 mg of Chl/ml in the resuspension buffer supplied with the indicated additions, the photoinactivated samples were transferred to darkness at 22 °C to allow proteolysis. Where indicated, spinach thylakoids (0.1 mg of Chl/ml) were illuminated with 1,500 μmol of photons/m2/s visible light for up to 2 h at 22 °C. Before illumination, 0.2 mm GTP or GTPγS were added to the thylakoids followed by incubation on ice in darkness for 30 min. Where indicated, various herbicides (10 μm DCMU, 50 μm ioxynil, and 100 μm dinoseb) were added at the beginning of the illumination. Control thylakoids or those subjected to 10 s preillumination were incubated with another herbicide, PNO8, in darkness at 22 °C. In some experiments, thylakoid subfractions (grana, grana margins, and stroma-exposed thylakoids) prepared by the digitonin method (23.Kyle D.J. Staehelin L.A. Arntzen C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were used. Trypsin treatment of dark control and 50% photoinactivated thylakoids was performed using 2 and 5 μg of trypsin/ml (Sigma, tosylphenylalanine chloromethane-treated, bovine pancreas) at Chl concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively. After 30 min of dark incubation at 22 °C, the proteolysis was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type 1-S). The inhibitor was in 4-fold excess to the trypsin (w/w). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1976; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 14% acrylamide and 6 m urea in the separation gel. Resolved thylakoid proteins were electrotransferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes according to Towbin et al. (25.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The D1 protein and its 23-kDa N-terminal fragment were identified with antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 234–242 of the spinach protein. For quantification of the level of the D1 protein and the 23-kDa fragment, 0.2 and 0.8 μg of Chl were loaded per lane, respectively. The plotted data represent averages from at least three independent experiments with the indicated standard deviations. Oxygen evolution was measured with a Clark-type electrode under saturating visible light at 22 °C in resuspension buffer supplemented with 0.5 mmphenyl-p-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor. Thermoluminescence (TL) signal in pea thylakoids photoinactivated or exposed to single turnover flashes was measured in 0.2-ml dark-adapted samples for 2 min at 22 °C. The samples were then rapidly cooled and excited with 2 flashes at 0 °C followed by freezing at −20 °C. The heating was of 0.5 °C/s, and the light emitted as a function of temperature was measured by photon counting (10.Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that infrequent excitation of PSII promotes formation of QB− but does not result in further reduction to plastoquinol. As in the case of the high light-induced photoinactivation, charge recombination between P680+ and Pheo− generates3Chl and 1O2 and thus induces degradation of the D1 protein. This phenomenon can be drastically enhanced by synchronizing the above charge separation/recombination process using series of single turnover light flashes (8.Keren N. van Kan P.J.M. Berg A. Shochat S. Styring S. Andersson B. Ohad I. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. 4. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 299-302Google Scholar, 9.Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10.Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate whether the effect of GTP on the degradation of the D1 protein may be related to photodamage to PSII in general and not specifically associated with the high light-induced acceptor side photoinactivation. We have consequently examined the degradation of the D1 protein in thylakoids exposed to single turnover flashes delivered at 24-s intervals in the absence and presence of 0.2 mm GTP or GTPγS. After 4 h of exposure (total of 600 charge separation events), 60% photoinactivation of electron transport occurred in all samples as indicated by thermoluminescence measurements (not shown). Notably, GTP accelerates the subsequent D1 protein degradation process, and about 40% of the initial D1 protein was degraded (not shown). This effect was paralleled by an enhanced appearance of the 23-kDa fragment of the D1 protein (not shown). As expected, addition of GTPγS slightly inhibited the degradation relative to control, as during high light-induced photoinhibition (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under illumination conditions leading to ∼20% inactivation, GTPγS completely prevented the loss of the D1 protein (not shown). It should be noted that the typical 23-kDa D1 fragment is generated under limiting light conditions irrespective of whether the thylakoids are exposed to repetitive single turnover flashes or to continuous low light intensity (30 μmol of photons/m2/s, not shown). This implies the involvement of the same GTP-dependent proteolysis for the D1 protein irrespective of the redox conditions of the quinone acceptors which lead to PSII inactivation and oxidative damage to the reaction center. The enhancement of the light-induced degradation by GTP could be because of the activation of the endogenous protease that induces the primary cleavage of the D1 protein or by alteration of the protein substrate conformation. In an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities, we have used the exogenous protease trypsin. The trypsin sensitivity of the D1 protein is well known (26.Regitz G. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 247-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Renger G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 440: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and has been used as a tool in connection with studies on light-induced D1 protein degradation. As shown in Fig.1 A, 0.2 mm GTP did not enhance the degradation by trypsin in dark-control thylakoids but rather slowed down the process in the first 10 min of incubation. In thylakoids that have been 50% inactivated in PSII electron transport by pre-exposure to high light at low temperatures (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and subsequently incubated in darkness, the GTP-stimulated reduction of the D1 protein cleavage by trypsin is more evident than in the dark-control samples (Fig. 1 B). The D1 protein is also degraded in photoinactivated samples incubated without trypsin, although with slower kinetics, indicating that the endogenous GTP-dependent proteolysis has been initiated. These data suggest that the D1 protein degradation by trypsin does not require GTP at variance with the light-mediated process catalyzed by the thylakoid endogenous protease(s). The occupancy of the QB site by plastoquinone or plastoquinone analogues modulates the conformation of the D-E loop domain of the D1 protein and thus modulates its degradation (13.Trebst A. Depka B. Kraft B. Johanningmeier U. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 18: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14.Jansen M.A.K. Depka B Trebst A. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Zer H. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28.Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21293-21299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies involving the use of various types of herbicides could be useful to elucidate the possible interaction of GTP with the QB site. Concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μm for DCMU, ioxynil, and dinoseb, respectively, leading to 75–85% inhibition of PSII activity, were added to thylakoids at the onset of exposure to high light in the presence of 0.2 mm GTP. After 2 h of illumination, 85% of PSII activity was lost in the samples to which no herbicide was added. As shown in Fig. 2, DCMU inhibited D1 protein degradation for more than 90 min. In contrast, ioxynil and dinoseb did not prevent the degradation, in accordance with Jansenet al. (14.Jansen M.A.K. Depka B Trebst A. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of GTP in the presence of the two phenol-type herbicides had no effect on the time course for degradation as compared with the situation in the absence of added GTP (not shown). The inhibition by DCMU of the D1 protein degradation is not abolished by the addition of GTP, indicating that the GTP effect is not related to its direct interaction with the cleavage site of the protein substrate. At variance with urea- or triazine-type herbicides which prevent exposure of the cleavage site to the thylakoid protease, herbicides such as PNO8 can promote the proteolysis even in darkness without preceding photoinhibitory treatment (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, the D1 protein degradation after 60 min of incubation in darkness, is saturated at 20–30 μm PNO8 when about 10–15% of the initial D1 protein has been lost. This degradation is enhanced by more than 2.5-fold following preillumination of the thylakoids. The corresponding formation of the 23-kDa primary degradation fragment follows the same pattern (Fig.3 B). The calculated K d values of PNO8 on the basis of the level of induced 23-kDa fragment were 7.8 and 3.4 μm for the dark-adapted and preilluminated thylakoids, respectively. The actual D1 protein degradation induced by the 10-s preillumination was calculated from the difference between the two curves (Fig. 3 B). The obtained K d value of 2.0 μm indicates a 4-fold higher affinity of PNO8 to the PSII complexes following photoinduced changes of the D1 protein, thereby increasing the efficiency of degradation. Nakajima et al. (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported suppression of the PNO8-induced D1 protein degradation and formation of the 23-kDa fragment by addition of excess DCMU in dark-incubated PSII complexes suggesting that the two compounds compete for the same binding niche at the QB site. The inhibition of PSII electron flow is saturated at 1 μm by both PNO8 and DCMU (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, our present results demonstrate that the concentration of PNO8 required to saturate the onset of D1 protein degradation in darkness is significantly higher than that required to inhibit electron flow. Thus, one should consider that the mode of binding of these two herbicides at the QB niche may show subtle differences. Only the binding of PNO8 can induce the conformation recognized by the protease as a substrate. It is plausible that within the QB binding niche different herbicides interact with different affinities to various amino acids, resulting in different conformations. We have investigated the DCMU competition with PNO8 by analyzing the prevention of the D1 proteolysis in dark-incubated as well as in preilluminated thylakoids in the presence of PNO8 (Fig. 4). Increasing the ratio of DCMU/PNO8 while using a PNO8 concentration of 5 or 10 μm progressively inhibited the formation of the 23-kDa D1 protein fragment. However, this inhibition was reduced in the preilluminated samples. These results indicate that following preillumination a change in the conformation of the QB site occurs, leading to a higher affinity for the PNO8 relative to DCMU and thereby making the D1 protein more susceptible to the primary proteolytic cleavage. Based on these results as well as on previous data (20.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17383-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the preillumination effect decays in darkness with slow kinetics, we suggest that the QB binding site may assume at least two different types of conformations that bind PNO8, with different affinity conferring different susceptibility of the D1 protein to the primary endogenous protease. There is an unstable form (t 12 about 1 h) (20.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17383-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that is induced by short illumination and a more stable form that persists in darkness for a longer period of time (hours). The latter form has the cleavage site in the D-E loop less accessible to the protease. It is possible that the stable form is the product of the decay of the unstable one. The question arises whether GTP enhances the D1 protein degradation induced by PNO8 in darkness without photoinactivation of PSII. To address this question, thylakoids were incubated in darkness for 90 min in the presence of 5 μm PNO8 and 0.2 mm GTP or GTPγS with or without 10 s of preillumination. Notably, the extent of D1 protein degradation was stimulated by addition of GTP in both types of samples (Fig.5 A). Addition of GTPγS inhibited the PNO8-induced degradation to a level below the dark control. The stimulation by GTP of the PNO8-induced D1 protein loss was paralleled by enhanced accumulation of the 23-kDa fragment in the dark-adapted thylakoids but not in the preilluminated samples (Fig.5 B). The latter observation can be explained if one considers that preillumination may enhance the further proteolysis of this D1 fragment. The degradation of the 23-kDa fragment in photoinhibited thylakoids has been suggested to be mediated by an ATP-dependent FtsH-type metallo-protease (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Addition of ATP and zinc ions did, however, not reduce the level of the PNO8-induced fragment in the dark-incubated thylakoids. In contrast, in the preilluminated samples, these effectors stimulated the degradation of the 23-kDa fragment by approximately 25% (Fig. 5 B). The possibility that the secondary proteolytic cleavage is light-activated should, therefore, be considered. More likely, the lateral migration of the damaged PSII centers from the grana to the stroma regions, where the final step(s) of D1 protein degradation takes place (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and where the FtsH protease is located (29.Lindahl M. Tabak S. Cseke L. Pichersky E. Andersson B. Adam Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), might be the specific light-dependent event in the degradation process of the 23-kDa fragment (see below). The data presented so far indicate that PNO8 interacts with a modified form of PSII, thereby exposing the D-E loop of the D1 protein to the endogenous primary protease. The question arises whether this modified form can accumulate as a result of photoinactivation. Thylakoid membranes were exposed to high light at low temperature, thereby inducing acceptor side photoinactivation of PSII but preventing the subsequent degradation of the D1 protein (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30.Aro E.-M. Hundal T. Carlberg I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 269-275Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The thylakoids were then further incubated in darkness at ambient temperature in the presence of GTP, and the degradation was allowed to occur in the absence or presence of PNO8 (Fig. 6). In control thylakoids incubated in darkness for 90 min in the presence of PNO8, 15% of the D1 protein was lost (Fig. 6 A). Preillumination for 10 s followed by transfer to darkness further increases the extent of degradation to about 25%. The effect of PNO8 on the degradation process in darkness following photoinactivation at low temperature for 45 and 90 min, respectively, are shown in Fig. 6,B and C. In the thylakoids illuminated for 45 min (75% active) (Fig. 6 B), addition of PNO8 at the beginning of the dark period induced further loss of the D1 protein as compared with the control sample without PNO8. A 10-s illumination increased the effect only slightly. The same stimulation of D1 protein degradation by PNO8 was observed in the case of thylakoids photoinactivated for 90 min (50% active) (Fig. 6 C). It should be noted that the enhancement of the D1 protein degradation by PNO8 in the photoinactivated thylakoids approaches the extent of loss in electron transport activity. As mentioned above, photoinactivation of PSII also occurs in thylakoids exposed to low light or series of saturating single turnover flashes because of charge recombination between QB−and the S2,3 states while the QA acceptor is oxidized (10.Keren N.

Hence, the effect of PNO8 on D1 protein degradation was investigated in pea thylakoids exposed to a series of single turnover flashes (Fig. 7). The TL measurements revealed peak temperatures of 33 ± 2 °C in the absence of PNO8 and 10 ± 2 °C in the presence of this herbicide, ascribed to charge recombination from QB− and QA−, respectively. This indicates that PNO8 could bind to the QB site and prevent its reduction to QB− irrespective of whether the thylakoids have been exposed to flashes or not. About 15% of the total D1 protein was degraded after 4 h of dark incubation with 10 μmPNO8 in control thylakoids (Fig. 7 A), which was matched by an accumulation of the 23-kDa fragment (Fig. 7 B). In samples exposed to single turnover flashes the D1 protein was degraded faster and to a higher extent (Fig. 7 A) because of photoinactivation induced by the charge recombination process. However, no D1 protein fragments could be detected (Fig. 7 B). Addition of PNO8 to thylakoids during the flash exposure considerably accelerated the D1 protein degradation and the fragment accumulation. After 2 h of exposure to flashes, the fragment level was comparable with the level detected after 4 h of dark incubation with PNO8 (Fig. 7 C). The extent of loss of the D1 protein reflects the extent of inactivation as measured by TL (about 30%, not shown). The above results suggest that photoinactivation of the thylakoids by high light or single turnover flashes results in the formation of heterogeneous populations of PSII reaction centers. Only in a part of these centers is the D-E loop of the D1 protein accessible to the protease, while in others binding of PNO8 can induce the conformational change required for proteolytic cleavage. However, following flash exposure the degradation of the D1 protein in this PSII population does not lead to a comparable increase in the amount of 23-kDa fragment. This could be because of the duration (4 h) of the flash treatment that may allow a slow migration of the centers containing the cleaved D1 protein to the stroma domains where the fragments are further degraded. Following high light-induced photoinactivation, the PSII core dissociates from the rest of the complex and migrates to the stroma thylakoid region (31.Hundal T. Virgin I. Styring S. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 235-241Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32.Adir N. Shochat S. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the D1 protein is degraded and the remaining components can reassemble with newly synthesized precursor D1 protein (33.van Wijk K.J. Bingsmark S. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25685-25695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The question arises at what stage the primary cleavage of the D1 protein occurs and whether the sequence of events is the same under high light-induced photoinactivation of PSII and incubation of active PSII complexes with PNO8 in darkness. To answer this question we have subfractionated the thylakoids into grana, grana margins (intermediate), and stroma membrane domains. The thylakoid membranes were photoinactivated or incubated in darkness with or without preillumination in the presence of 10 μm PNO8 for 90 min at 22 °C prior to subfractionation. The relative amount of the 23-kDa fragment was determined in intact thylakoids (Fig.8 A) and in the different membrane fractions (Fig. 8, B and C). The 23-kDa fragment generated following high light treatment was found preferentially in the stroma membrane domain irrespective of the presence or not of PNO8 during the illumination (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, the 23-kDa fragment formed during incubation of the thylakoid membranes in darkness with PNO8 with or without a 10-s preillumination was localized mostly in the grana membrane domains. These results strongly indicate that the primary cleavage induced by photoinactivation and/or PNO8 in darkness occurs in PSII complexes located in the grana regions. The D1 fragments produced by the primary cleavage are still assembled with the PSII core complexes, in line with previous observations (34.Virgin I. Ghanotakis D.F. Andersson B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The subsequent lateral migration of the PSII cores to the stroma membrane regions where the secondary proteolysis takes place (21.Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) requires prolonged illumination. In conclusion, our results demonstrate several novel aspects concerning the process of D1 protein turnover: the heterogeneity of the PSII population with respect to the conformation of the D-E loop, as well as the modulation of the proteolytic activity by GTP, as summarized in Scheme FS1. The binding of PNO8 to the QB site induces degradation of the D1 protein and loss of PSII electron flow in darkness in a limited population of PSII centers, indicating that this population is not photoinhibited but does possess, however, a changed conformation of the cleavage site as a result of previous light exposure (Scheme FS1, (PSII active)). This conformer of PSII is stable, and the D1 protein is not degraded unless PNO8 binds to the QB site and further alters its conformation to expose the cleavage site to the protease. The light-induced alteration of these PSII centers is not “reversed” and thus, they may persist in the thylakoid membrane for a long time (>12 h). Further short illumination (10 s) may induce additional but reversible changes in the conformation of the acceptor side in this population of PSII centers (Scheme FS1, [PSII active]). This conformer is not stable and reverses rather rapidly to the initial state (t 12 about 1 h) (16.Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of this conformer to PNO8-induced degradation is higher relative to that of DCMU (Fig. 4). Prolonged exposure to high light leads to PSII inactivation and may cause further changes in the cleavage domain. Some of this photoinactivated PSII population is still stable toward the endogenous protease activity. Binding of PNO8 to the QBsite of these conformers induces the D1 protein degradation (Scheme FS1, {PSII inactive}). Additional illumination further alters the conformation of the PSII complex, exposing the D-E loop to the protease even in the absence of PNO8 (Scheme FS1, 〈PSII inactive〉). However, irrespective of the mechanism whereby the cleavage site is exposed to the protease, GTP enhances the D1 protein degradation in all the above PSII conformer populations. The stimulation of the D1 protein degradation by GTP may be because of: (i) direct interaction of GTP with the susceptible D-E loop of the D1 protein; (ii) activation by GTP of the proteolytic system responsible for the degradation of the D1 protein. We interpret the results presented here as evidence for the second possibility. In this case, one may consider that GTP may interact directly with the protease or indirectly by binding to a component remote from the cleavage site, thereby affecting the conformation of the PSII core so as to expose the D1 protein to the primary protease.

The selectivity of this ionophore for Pb2+ is in contrast to that observed for A23178 and 4-BrA23187, which transport Pb2+ at efficiencies that are intermediate between those of other cations. When the selectivity difference of ionomycin for Pb2+ versus Ca2+ was calculated from relative rates of transport, with either cation present individually and all other conditions held constant, a value of ∼450 was obtained. This rose to ∼3200 when both cations were present and transported simultaneously. 1 μm Pb2+inhibited the transport of 1 mm Ca2+ by ∼50%, whereas the rate of Pb2+ transport approached a maximum at a concentration of 10 μm Pb2+ when 1 mm Ca2+ was also present. Plots of log rateversus log ionomycin or log Pb2+ concentration indicated that the transporting species is of 1:1 stoichiometry, ionophore to Pb2+, but that complexes containing an additional Pb2+ may occur.

To illustrate the magnitude of this problem, on the order of 1 in 10 American children currently possess blood lead levels above the toxic threshold of ∼0.5 μm (reviewed in Ref. 4.Gutgesell M.E. VA Med. Q. 1996; 123: 190-191PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of mechanisms leading to lead toxicity is therefore of considerable interest and actively investigated. Work of this type conducted at the cellular level has been facilitated by the recent demonstration that entrapped Indo-1 can be used to monitor Pb2+ transport into cells (5.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8346-8352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,6.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. Toxicol. Appl.

Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Transport studies utilizing Indo-1-loaded cells of several types have shown that Pb2+ enters via plasma membrane Ca2+ channels that are activated upon depletion of internal Ca2+ stores (5.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8346-8352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. Toxicol. Appl.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The investigation of lead toxicity at a cellular level would benefit from the availability of ionophores that transport Pb2+selectively in comparison with other cations; however, to date, no compound with this property has been identified. This situation may reflect the use of cells and subcellular preparations in early studies on the selectivity of ionophore-mediated transport (10.Reed P.W. Westley J.W. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar). Biological systems are not stable to toxic cations such as Pb2+, making it difficult to use them for such purposes. In addition, the difficulty inherent in distinguishing ionophore-derived transport from transport occurring via endogenous channels and carriers may also have discouraged attempts to identify ionophores that are selective for Pb2+. Unlike biological systems, phospholipid vesicles are stable to a wide range of cations and conditions and are free of endogenous transport activities. We have demonstrated that these structures, when prepared by freeze-thaw extrusion, are useful for investigating the transport mechanisms (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R.

In this report, we extend this work to include Pb2+ transport. The results indicate that ionomycin is substantially selective as an ionophore for Pb2+ and that this property is displayed in both phospholipid vesicles and cultured A20 B lymphoma cells. Accordingly, ionomycin may be useful for manipulating levels of Pb2+during studies of its toxic properties in other cell types and at higher levels of biological organization. Synthetic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (POPC)1 was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Purity was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography before use. Ionomycin, A23187, and 4-BrA23187 were obtained from Sigma, Calbiochem, or Teflabs and were used without further purification. Stock solutions in ethanol were standardized spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: ionomycin, ε278 = 13,560; A23187, ε278 = 21,040; and 4-BrA23187, ε290 = 15,600. Quin-2 (K+ salt) from Sigma was purified by passage over Chelex 100 resin (100–200 mesh) in the Cs+ form as described previously (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The nitrate and chloride salts of divalent cations were the ultrapure grade from Alfa Products. Stock solutions of these were standardized by titration with a primary standard EDTA solution (16.Vogel A.I. Quantitative Inorganic Analysis. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961: 415-446Google Scholar) or by atomic absorption spectroscopy using certified solutions (Fisher). Freeze-thaw-extruded POPC vesicles loaded with Quin-2 were prepared as described previously (17.Chapman C.J. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 55: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18.Chapman C.J. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 60: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 mg of POPC in chloroform was dried by rotation under a nitrogen stream to produce a film on the wall of a 25 × 150-mm culture tube. Residual solvent was removed under high vacuum (4 h), and the film was subsequently hydrated in 6 ml of a solution containing 5 mm purified Quin-2 (Cs+) and 10.0 mm Hepes adjusted to pH 7.00 with Chelex-treated CsOH (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mixture was vortexed, and the resulting multilamellar vesicles were frozen in a dry ice/acetone bath, thawed in lukewarm water, and vortexed again. The freeze-thaw and vortexing procedures were repeated two additional times, after which the vesicles were extruded three times through two stacked 100-nm polycarbonate membrane filters. This step was followed by six additional freeze-thaw cycles coupled with additional extrusions. The resulting preparations were applied to Sephadex G-50 minicolumns (19.Fry D.W. White J.C. Goldman D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) to remove extravesicular Quin-2. These columns were eluted by low speed centrifugation and had previously been equilibrated with a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.00. A single pass over such columns effectively removes the external Quin-2 (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17.Chapman C.J. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Chem. Phys.

Lipids. 1991; 60: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nominal concentration of POPC in the final preparations was determined by measurement of lipid phosphorus (20.Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was near 80 mm. The average diameter of these vesicles is 71 nm as determined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (17.Chapman C.J. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 55: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and they contain entrapped solutes at the following concentrations; Quin-2, 10.5 ± 0.8 mm; Hepes, 34 ± 8 mm (pH ≈7.4); and Cs+, 60 ± 5 mm. Specific values for Quin-2 and Cs+ were determined for each preparation by the methods described previously (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2350-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, entrapped Quin-2 was determined by spectrophotometric titration with standard CaCl2 following dispersion of the vesicles in deoxycholate. Entrapped Cs+ was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy following replacement of the external medium with one not containing Cs+ and dispersion of the vesicles in 0.1 n HCl. When of interest, buffer entrapment was determined from the other values by calculation using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, the buffer pK a, and the internal pH. When buffer entrapment was to be determined, the vesicles also contained the fluorescent pH indicator 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) so that the internal pH could be ascertained. The internal pH and solute concentrations differ from those of the vesicle formation medium because of a freeze-thaw-driven solute concentrating effect that operates during preparation of the vesicles (17.Chapman C.J. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 55: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18.Chapman C.J. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 60: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Vesicles loaded with BAPTA plus Indo-1 were prepared and characterized in an analogous way. For those preparations, the formation medium contained 5 mm BAPTA (in place of Quin-2) and 100 μm Indo-1. Accordingly, the resulting vesicles contained a relatively high level of BAPTA and a much lower level of Indo-1. The efficiency of BAPTA entrapment was similar to that of Quin-2 and was determined by titrating the intact vesicles with standard Ca2+ in the presence of excess ionomycin. Fluorescence of the Indo-1·Ca2+ complex was monitored at 400 nm (excitation at 336 nm) using an SLM-AMINCO 8100 spectrofluorometer operated in the analog mode. The end point can be taken to represent the end point for the simultaneous reaction of Ca2+ with BAPTA because the two compounds have essentially the same affinity for Ca2+ (7.Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 21.Yuchi A. Tanaka A. Hirai M. Yasui T. Wada H. Nakagawa G. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1993; 66: 3377-3381Crossref Google Scholar), as described further under “Results.” Knowledge of Indo-1 entrapment was not required during the present investigation, and that parameter was not determined. A20 B lymphoma cells (ATCC TIB-208) were grown to a density of 1.5–2.5 × 106 cells/ml at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. RPMI 1640 medium was employed and was supplemented with 25 mm Na+/Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μm streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 5% fetal bovine serum albumin (22.Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For loading with Indo-1, the cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a medium containing 4 μm Indo-1/AM plus 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na+/Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mml-glucose (23.Marriott I. Mason M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26732-26738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 1.0 mm probenecid was also present to inhibit the release of Indo-1 after loading (24.Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Following this, the loaded cells were maintained at 25 °C with gentle shaking and were used within 6 h. Pb2+ and Ca2+ were usually presented from a buffer system for transport into the vesicles or cells. 15 mm citrate was employed to buffer the concentration of cations, whereas 10 mm each Hepes and Mes were present to buffer H+. Seventeen equilibria involving citrate3−, H+, Pb2+, and OH− were accounted for when calculating the free Pb2+ concentration when this cation was present alone. Six additional equilibria involving Ca2+ were also considered when both Pb2+ and Ca2+ were present and the free concentration of both cations was of interest. The respective equilibrium constants were taken from literature sources (25.Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1976Crossref Google Scholar, 26.Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1977Google Scholar), and when necessary, the Davies equation (27.Davies C.W. Ion Association. Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd., London1962Google Scholar) was used to correct these to an ionic strength of 100 mm. The species distribution program COMICS (28.Perrin D.D. Sayce I.G. Talanta. 1967; 14: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) was used to solve the applicable sets of simultaneous equations at experimental conditions of interest and to allow the generation of standard curves. As examples of the latter, Fig. 1 A shows how free Pb2+ and PbOH+ vary in this system as a function of total Pb2+ when the medium pH is 7.0. Fig.1 B shows the pH dependence of this system. The transport of Pb2+ and other divalent cations into Quin-2-loaded vesicles was determined by monitoring formation of the Quin-2·cation complexes spectroscopically. Vesicles containing Quin-2 were present at a nominal POPC concentration of 1.0 mm in a medium that also contained 50 mm CsCl and 10 mmeach Hepes and Mes. The medium pH ranged from 6.0 to 8.0 and was adjusted with CsOH that had been passed over Chelex 100 columns to remove contaminating divalent cations (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To maintain internal pH at the external value, valinomycin (0.5 μm) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 μm) were also present (12.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2350-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Specific concentrations of ionophores and divalent cation chlorides and pH values are given in the figure legends. Reactions were started by the addition of the divalent cation ionophore following an initial 2–3-min period that was allowed for the equilibration of transmembrane pH. The formation of Quin-2·cation complexes was followed continuously by difference absorbance spectroscopy using an SLM-AMINCO DW2a spectrophotometer operated in the dual wavelength mode. An Oriel 59800 band-pass filter was used between the cuvette and the beam scambler-photomultipler assembly to prevent detection of the fluorescent light emitted by Quin-2. The sample wavelength used for all cations was 264 nm. The reference wavelengths were at an isosbestic point in the Quin-2/Quin-2·cation complex difference spectrum of interest. These wavelengths vary slightly from cation to cation, as described previously (14.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Wang E. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13817-13825Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data were collected on disc using Unkel Scope software. The vesicles loaded with BAPTA plus Indo-1 were used to monitor the simultaneous transport of Pb2+ and Ca2+, as further described under “Results.” Pb2+ transport into Indo-1-loaded A20 B lymphoma cells was monitored as described by Kerper and Hinkle (5.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8346-8352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmcol. 1997; 146: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with modifications that are also described under “Results.” To determine initial transport rates, an early portion of the progress curves was fit to Equation 1 using standard nonlinear least-squares methods.

B values obtained from Equation 1 were converted to the latter unit by referring to a standard curve for the cation of interest that was generated by titrating the vesicles in the presence of excess ionophore or after they had been lysed with 0.33% (w/v) Cs+ deoxycholate (11.Erdahl W.L.

This was with the exception of Pb2+, where apparent multiple equilibria between the cation and Quin-2 required a slightly modified approach (see “Results”). Transport selectivities are expressed as S values defined by Equation 2.

The vesicle-based transport system employed here is useful for determining selectivity and mechanisms of ionophore-mediated cation transport (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R.

J. 1998; 75: 1244-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but there are two features of importance that must be accounted for when applying the system to citrate-buffered solutions of Pb2+(PbOH+). The first is an apparent slow permeation of Pb2+ in the absence of an ionophore, as illustrated in Fig.2 A. This is seen at much lower free Pb2+ concentrations than with Ca2+permeation, with the uncatalyzed movements of both cations showing a complex dependence on concentration and pH (Fig. 2 B). Under the conditions we utilized, the rate of uncatalyzed transport was usually negligible, but was determined, and data were corrected accordingly when it exceeded 2–3% of the ionophore-dependent rate. The second feature relates to an apparent formation of multiple complexes between Pb2+ and entrapped Quin-2 and to how this impacts on the calibration procedure used to relate the Quin-2 difference absorbance measurements to Pb2+ transport. When the vesicles were suspended in an unbuffered Pb2+ solution and the total Pb2+ available for transport exceeded the total Quin-2 trapped within the vesicles, a biphasic progress curve was obtained upon the addition of a Pb2+ ionophore (Fig.3 A). During the first phase, entrapped Quin-2 approached an apparent saturation; however, as time proceeded, a second phase was observed that would indicate a partial release of previously accumulated Pb2+ if it were taken at face value (Fig. 3 A). However, titrating vesicle-entrapped Quin-2 with Pb2+ in the presence of excess ionophore also produced a biphasic pattern, wherein the apparent degree of saturation decreased as Pb2+ was added beyond the 1:1 equivalence point (Fig. 3 B). In addition, biphasic transport curves were not seen when Quin-2 was present in excess of total Pb2+(data not shown), and titration data were less multiphasic when the vesicles had been lysed to dilute the internal concentration of Quin-2 that originally existed (Fig. 3 B). We interpret these data to indicate that more than one complex is formed between Pb2+ and the indicator under conditions that pertain in the lumen of intact vesicles. There was no indication of multiple complexes when this system was employed to investigate ionophore-catalyzed transport of Ca2+ and other divalent cations, such that this factor was not considered in the previous studies that established procedures for utilizing the vesicle system to investigate ionophore-mediated transport (11.Erdahl W.L.

Here we have avoided possible errors in the reported rate and selectivity values by deriving these parameters from the initial portion of the progress curves, where internal Quin-2 was present in excess of internal Pb2+. There was no disagreement between the internal and external calibration methods within this region (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the same complex is considered in both cases. Ionomycin transported Pb2+ more efficiently than other divalent cations as shown in Fig. 4 A. This is in contrast to A23187 (Fig. 4 B) and 4-BrA23187 (data not shown), where rates of Pb2+ transport were intermediate in comparison with the others. Selectivity for Pb2+ compared with Ca2+ is of particular interest because Pb2+ enters cells via channels that normally transport Ca2+ (5.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8346-8352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6.Kerper L.E. Hinkle P.M. Toxicol. Appl.

Sci. 1998; 46: 90-100PubMed Google Scholar) and because competition between these cations at intracellular sites is important in mechanisms of Pb2+ toxicity (30.Quinn M.R. Harris C.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 196: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31.Schanne F.A.X. Long G.J. Rosen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using Equation 2 and the data in Fig. 4, it can be shown that S Pb is 98 for ionomycin and only 2.3 for A23187 under the conditions of this figure. The rate of ionomycin-catalyzed Pb2+ transport is a function of the ionophore (Fig. 5) and the Pb2+ (Fig. 6) concentrations, as expected for a mechanism where a discrete complex between the cation and the ionophore underlies activity. When the ionophore concentration was varied, a plot of log initial rateversus log of the ionophore concentration was well represented by a straight line of slope 1.0, as was also true for Ca2+ transport (Fig. 5) (11.Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Varying the free Pb2+ concentration produced a log versus log plot that also had a slope near 1 within the lower portion of the range examined, but a progressively smaller value as the free Pb2+ concentration rose (Fig. 6). This nonlinear behavior was less apparent with Ca2+ transport (Fig. 6), which resulted in lower values of S Pb being obtained from Equation 2 as higher concentrations of the two cations were compared. To avoid this circumstance and to obtain a more representative value of S Pb, we calculated a value based upon the x axis separation of the plots within regions where (near) linear behaviors were observed. Within these regions, both sets of data were separated by 2.65 log units, which translates into an S Pb value of ∼450.Figure 6Effect of Pb2+ concentration on the initial rate of Pb2+ transport. A, experiments are analogous to those shown in Fig. 5, except that the ionomycin concentration was held constant at 0.10 μm, and the free Pb2+ concentration was varied as shown to the right of the individual traces. B, shown is the log of the initial Pb2+ (●) or Ca2+ (○) transport rate as a function of log concentration for that cation. The data for Ca2+transport were obtained from experiments like those shown inA, wherein the free Ca2+ concentration was varied instead of free Pb2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if ionomycin retains high transport selectivity for Pb2+ over Ca2+ when both cations are present, we utilized vesicles loaded with BAPTA plus a small amount of Indo-1, rather than Quin-2. Quin-2-loaded vesicles are not suitable for investigating simultaneous transport because there is no spectral distinction between the primary Pb2+ and Ca2+ complexes that are formed with this indicator. The same is true for the corresponding BAPTA complexes; however, the Pb2+ and Ca2+ complexes of Indo-1 can be distinguished by their fluorescence pro"
https://openalex.org/W1981183182,"Prior genetic studies indicated that the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase can be assembled into enzyme complexes devoid of the γ-, δ-, or ε-subunits (Lai-Zhang, J., Xiao, Y., and Mueller, D. M. (1999) EMBO J. 18, 58–64). These subunit-deficient complexes were postulated to uncouple the mitochondrial membrane thereby causing negative cellular phenotypes. This study provides biochemical and additional genetic data that support this hypothesis. The genetic data indicate that in a diploid cell, a heterozygous deletion mutation in the gene encoding the γ- or δ-subunit of the ATPase is semidominant negative due to a decrease in the gene number from 2 to 1. However, the heterozygous atp2Δ mutation is epistatic to the heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding γ or δ, suggesting that the semidominant negative effect is because of a gain of activity in the cells. Biochemical studies using mitochondria isolated from the yeast strains that are heterozygous for a mutation in γ or δ indicate that the mitochondria are partially uncoupled. These results support the hypothesis that the negative phenotypes are caused by the formation of a γ- or δ-less ATP synthase complex that is uncoupled. Prior genetic studies indicated that the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase can be assembled into enzyme complexes devoid of the γ-, δ-, or ε-subunits (Lai-Zhang, J., Xiao, Y., and Mueller, D. M. (1999) EMBO J. 18, 58–64). These subunit-deficient complexes were postulated to uncouple the mitochondrial membrane thereby causing negative cellular phenotypes.

These results support the hypothesis that the negative phenotypes are caused by the formation of a γ- or δ-less ATP synthase complex that is uncoupled. The mitochondrial (mt) ATP synthase is the major enzyme responsible for the synthesis of ATP under aerobic conditions. The ATP synthase converts the energy obtained from the oxidation of foodstuffs to the usable form of ATP. Thus, the efficiency of energy transduction is dependent on the efficiency, or coupling capacity, of ATP synthesis. Mutations that alter the coupling capacity of the ATP synthase would be predicted to have profound effects on cellular metabolism.The ATP synthase is a multimeric enzyme composed of a water-soluble portion, F1, and a membrane portion, F0 (for reviews see Refs. 1.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar and 2.Nakamoto R.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The F1 is composed of five unique subunits with the stoichiometry, α3β3γδε, and contains the catalytic site of the enzyme (3.Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). There are three catalytic sites formed by the α- and β-subunits, which are arranged front to back forming a near sphere (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar).The mechanism of ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase proceeds by the binding site mechanism (5.Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the phosphorylation of ADP does not require energy and the reaction occurs at one of the three catalytic sites, which has a high affinity for ATP. The flow of protons alters the conformation of the high affinity site, decreasing its affinity for ATP, thereby allowing the release of newly formed ATP from the enzyme. This conformational change is thought to occur largely by interactions of the γ-subunit with the active site of the enzyme (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Indeed, γ is in the center of F1 and makes critical and unique contacts with each of the catalytic domains in F1. Furthermore, γ rotates in the center of F1 in an ATP-dependent fashion (6.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 7.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As such, the evidence indicates that F1 is a molecular motor that produces ATP.The F0 portion of the enzyme is a proton pore, which apparently drives the rotation of the γ-subunit within F1, coupled to the flow of protons from the cytosol to the matrix of the mitochondrion. The role of the δ and ε subunits is not certain, but studies suggest that they are involved in the coupling of ATP synthesis to proton translocation, with δ being part of the rotor (9.Lai-Zhang J.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alternatively, and maybe more descriptively, the δ- and ε-subunits may function as a molecular clutch (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As such, enzymes defective in the δ- and ε-subunits would be predicted to be unable to couple ATP synthesis to the flow of protons through F0.This study uses yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the assembly and structure/function relationship of the ATP synthase. The prior study provided genetic evidence that the ATP synthase could be assembled into an enzyme complex devoid of the γ-, δ-, or ε-subunit (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A hypothesis was proposed that the subunit-deficient enzyme complexes provided an enzyme that freely passed protons from the cytosol to the matrix of the mitochondrion, but was unable, or only poorly able to drive the synthesis of ATP, i.e. the ATP synthase was uncoupled. The uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane was proposed to be responsible for the cells tendency to lose their mtDNA (to become cytoplasmically petite or ρ−/ρo). The present study provides biochemical and additional genetic evidence that supports this hypothesis. The implications of these results are profound, because if these subunit-deficient complexes occur in the human cell, either in the normal or disease state, then the efficiency for ATP synthesis would be compromised and the physiology of the organism could be largely altered.RESULTSThe prior epistatic studies on mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the ATPase provided diploid strains with heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the γ- or δ-subunit of the ATPase (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These diploid strains were clearly phenotypically different from either the wild type strain, W303, or strains with heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the other subunits of the ATPase. One obvious difference was that these ade2− strains were pink rather than red. Typically, ade2− strains turn red on YPD medium because of the accumulation of an intermediate in the adenine biosynthetic pathway. However, strains that are ade2− and respiratory deficient are white (16.Pittman D. Webb J.M. Roshanmanesh A. Coker L.E. Genetics. 1959; 45: 1023-1037Crossref Google Scholar). The diploid strains with a heterozygous mutation in either the gene encoding the γ- or δ-subunit, in addition to being pink, apparently became cytoplasmically petite or ρ−/ρo (loss or deletion of mtDNA) at a higher frequency as based on the high percentage of white colonies on YPD plates. These preliminary observations suggested that these heterozygous mutations were semi-dominant negative.An extensive analysis was performed to understand the nature of the heterozygous mutations in either ATPδ or ATP3 (the genes that code for the δ- and γ-subunits, respectively). The percentage of cytoplasmic ρ−/ρo cells was determined for a number of strains (Table I, TableII). In Table II A, the percentage of ρ−/ρo is compared between the wild type strain and strains with heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the F1-ATPase. These results indicate that the strains with a heterozygous mutation in either ATP3 or ATPδ have a greatly increased rate of cytoplasmic ρ−/ρo formation, increasing from 1–3% in the wild type stain to about 35% in the mutant strains. However, strains with heterozygous deletion mutations in ATP1, ATP2, or ATPε (encoding the genes for the α, β, and ε-subunits, respectively) accumulated an equivalent percentage of ρ−/ρo mutations as the wild type strain.The increased rate of ρ−/ρo formation in the heterozygous mutant strains could be due to cis-acting effects of the mutations on neighboring genes. In other words, it is possible that the deletion mutations altered the expression of neighboring genes and this, and not the decrease in the gene number of ATPδ or ATP3, is responsible for the increased rate of ρ−/ρo formation. To differentiate between these possibilities, the ATP3 or ATPδ genes were integrated at a separate locus on the chromosome and assessed for the formation of ρ−/ρo mutations. Table II Bindicates that if ATP3 is integrated in the chromosome at the LEU2 locus in the strain that has a heterozygous mutation in ATP3, then the percentage of ρ−/ρo drops to the wild type level. Similarly, if the ATPδ gene is integrated into the chromosome at the URA3 locus in the yeast strain that has a heterozygous mutation in ATPδ, then the percentage of ρ−/ρodrops to the wild type level. These results indicate that the tendency to form ρ−/ρo in the mutant strains is because of the drop in the gene number of ATP3 or ATPδ from 2 to 1 and it is not due to any cis-acting events on the chromosome due to the atp3Δ or atpδΔ mutations.In our prior studies in the haploid strains, the mutation in ATP2 was epistatic to the mutation in either ATPδ or ATP3 (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This epistatic relationship was also evaluated in the diploid strains with the heterozygous mutations. Table II C shows that a heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding the β-subunit, ATP2, is epistatic to either the heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ. This was concluded because the percentage of ρ−/ρo in an atp2Δ/atp3Δ double mutant or the atp2Δ/atpδΔ double mutant strain was the same as the level in the cells with the atp2Δ mutation alone. Thus, the atp2Δ mutation “stands above” or is epistatic to either the atpδΔ or atp3Δ mutation. This result suggests that the semi-dominant negative effect of the atpδΔ or atp3Δ mutations is because of a gain of activity rather than a loss of function. This is suggested because the atp2Δ/atpδΔ and atp2Δ/atp3Δ yeast strains do not show the negative phenotypes and yet contain the heterozygous deletion mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ. As such, this result implies that the negative phenotype caused by the decrease in the gene dosage from 2 to 1 in ATP3 or ATPδ is not because of a decrease in the level of an enzyme, such as the ATP synthase. Rather, it is because of the gain of an activity not normally present in wild type cells or in cells with the atp2Δ heterozygous mutation alone or paired with heterozygous atp3Δ or atpδΔ mutations. This conclusion was also reached from results using haploid cells with mutations in ATP3 or ATPδ (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).A second phenotype that was observed for the strains with a heterozygous mutation in either the ATP3 or ATPδ genes is that they were not as effective growing in medium containing glycerol as the carbon source (Fig. 1). This phenotype was then used to address the same questions as those in Table II and identical conclusions were obtained. 1) Strains with a heterozygous mutation in either the ATP3 or ATPδ genes are defective (Fig.1 A). This is observed both in the slower approach to stationary state and the final cell density in stationary state. 2) These growth defects are because of a gene dosage effect and not because of a cis-acting effect of the mutation (Fig. 1 B). This was concluded because integration of either the ATP3 or ATPδ gene at a locus away from the corresponding deletion mutation complemented growth phenotype. 3) The atp2Δ mutation was epistatic to either the atp3Δ or the atpδΔ mutation (Fig. 1 C). This conclusion is based on the fact that the growth of the cells with the double atp2Δ/atp3Δ or the atp2Δ/atpδΔ mutations is similar to that of yeast with the atp2Δ mutation.The heterozygous mutations in ATP3 or ATPδ have the same phenotypic consequences on the cellular phenotypes as observed for deletion mutations in the haploid cell (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and differ only in their magnitude. Furthermore, the same epistatic relationship that occurs between the atp2Δ mutation and the atp3Δ and atpδΔ mutations in the haploid state occurs in the diploid state. Thus, it is concluded that the underlying biochemical defect responsible for the negative phenotypes in the haploid mutant cells is the same as that in the heterozygous mutant diploid cells.The mitochondria are uncoupled in the atp3Δ and atpδΔ mutant cells. The hypothesis suggested from this and the prior study (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is that the negative phenotypes of the strains with the deletion mutation in either ATP3 or ATPδ is because of the assembly of an ATP synthase complex that is devoid of the γ- or δ-subunit. These subunit-deficient enzyme complexes were postulated to freely pass protons into the mitochondrial matrix thereby uncoupling the mitochondria. To address this, mitochondria were isolated from the strains and the coupling of the mitochondrial membranes was determined by measuring the respiratory control ratio, the P/O ratio, and the ΔΨ across the membrane with the fluorescent probe, rhodamine 123 (Table III). The rate of oxygen consumption reflects the rates of respiration, which is indicative of the rate of electron transport along the electron transport chain. Because respiration is obligatory coupled to ATP synthesis, the rate of respiration in the absence of ADP (state 4) is indicative of the permeability of the membrane to protons. The results indicate that mitochondria isolated from the strains with heterozygous mutations in either ATP3 or ATPδ have an increased state 4 rate and thus an increased permeability to protons. However, the addition of an inhibitor of F0, DCCD, inhibits the state 4 rate of the mutant mitochondria to the level observed for the mitochondria isolated from the wild type strain. This suggests that the proton leakage is via F0 of the ATP synthase. Upon adding ADP (state 3) or the uncoupler CCCP, the rate of respiration of the same mitochondria was similar to mitochondria isolated from the wild type strain. This is reflected in the respiratory control ratio (respiratory control ratio, state 3/state 4), which decreases from 3.5 for the wild type strain to about 2.0 for the strains with the heterozygous mutations in ATP3 or ATPδ. This decrease in the respiratory control ratio indicates that the ATP synthase is partially uncoupled from respiration in the mutant strains.Table IIISemi-dominant biochemical effects of a heterozygous null mutation in ATP3 or ATPδStrainExperiment numberRespiration rateRCRP/OΔF Rhod. 123 (n)ATPase SA (n)State 4State 3+DCCD+CCCP+Og.W303182287974313.51.7546 (3)2.0 (3)0.12 (3)283290986053.51.76W303Δβ/β193320NDND3.41.6649 (3)2.1 (2)0.29 (2)292304NDND3.31.74W303Δγ/γ11683361034052.00.8926 (3)0.97 (3)0.08 (3)21934241005222.21.18W303Δδ/δ11743481053682.00.9624 (3)0.85 (3)0.14 (3)21582841024281.80.95W303Δε/ε184252NDND3.01.645 (2)2.2 (2)0.18 (2)276266NDND3.51.76W303Δγ/γ171256NDND3.61.7254 (2)2.2 (2)0.15 (2)/pO5ATPγ280240NDND3.01.75W303Δδ/δ187287NDND3.31.7855 (2)2.3 (2)0.22 (2)/pO6ATPδ285298NDND3.51.75W303198294934363.01.7151 (2)2.0 (2)0.16 (2)Δγ/γ/Δβ/β295285956022.951.64W303179240794763.01.6549 (2)2.0 (2)0.15 (2)Δδ/δ/Δβ/β297300926753.11.64Heterozygous null mutations in ATP2, ATP3, and ATPδ, were made in the wild type diploid strain W303.

The Δψ was evaluated by the quenching (arbitrary units) of rhodamine 123 fluorescence (ΔF) in buffer containing 5 mmTris-succinate, 0.2 μm rhodamine 123, 2.7 μm rotenone at a mitochondrial protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. The temperature was 30 °C for all assays. The specific ATPase activity is in units of μmol/min/mg of protein. The standard deviation of all the values did not exceed 20% of the reported values except for those of ATPase with oligomycin, which did not exceed 50% of the reported value. DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; Og, oligomycin; RCR, respiratory control ratio; Rhod., rhodamine; SA, specific activity; ND, not determined; n, number of independent experiments for ATPase and Δψ measurements. Open table in a new tab The P/O ratio is a measure of the amount of ATP made/oxygen atom reduced during respiration. Typically, this value is about 2 for wild type mitochondria using succinate as the carbon source. A decrease in the P/O ratio is indicative of an uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria isolated from the wild type strain has a P/O ratio just under 2, whereas mitochondria isolated from the yeast with heterozygous mutations in either ATP3 or ATPδ is reduced to about 1.0. This result also indicates that the ATP synthase is partially uncoupled from respiration in the mutant strains.The ΔΨ across the mitochondrial membrane was measured using the fluorescent probe, rhodamine 123 (25.Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), whose fluorescence decreases in response to a −ΔΨ across the mitochondrial membrane. These results indicate that the ΔF response, and thus the ΔΨ across the membrane, is lower for the mitochondria isolated from the strains with the heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ, as compared with the wild type strain. Again, these results indicate that the mitochondrial membrane is partially uncoupled in the cells with the heterozygous mutation in either ATP3 or ATPδ as compared with the wild type.The questions that were addressed by measuring the cellular phenotypes (Fig. 1 and Table II) were also addressed in the biochemical studies (Table III). The conclusions from the results of the biochemical measurements are consistent with those from the measurements of the cellular phenotypes. 1) The mitochondria isolated from cells with a heterozygous mutation in either ATP3 or ATPδ are impaired because they are partially uncoupled. This conclusion is based on the decreases in the respiratory control ratio, P/O ratio, and the ΔΨ across the membrane. 2) The decrease in the copy number of ATP3 or ATPδ from 2 to 1 is responsible for the partial uncoupling of the mitochondria. This is clear because when either the ATP3 or ATPδ gene is integrated at a separate location on the corresponding mutant cell chromosome, the coupling capacity of the mitochondria isolated from the cells is normal. 3) The atp2Δ mutation is epistatic to the atp3Δ and atpδΔ mutations. This is concluded because the mitochondria isolated from the atp2Δ/atp3Δ or the atp2Δ/atpδΔ mutant cells have a normal coupling capacity. Thus, the conclusions derived from the analysis of the biochemical phenotypes are consistent with those derived from the analysis of the growth and cellular phenotypes, and all are consistent with the initial hypothesis.Lastly, the level of the ATP synthase was measured by determining the level of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity. The relationship of the level of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase in the individual strains and the mutations in the strain paralleled the prior results: 1) the level was decreased in the mitochondria from cells that had a heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ, 2) the decrease was a result of the decrease in the gene number from 2 to 1, and 3) the atp2Δ heterozygous mutation was epistatic to the atp3Δ and atpδΔ mutations.The 50% decrease in the level of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase in the mitochondria from diploid cells with the heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ is not, however, responsible for the increased rate of ρ−/ρo formation or for the impaired ability to grow on YPG medium. This is clear because in atp2Δ haploid strains, the mitochondrial ATPase is absent and yet the percentage of ρo/ρ− cells is low (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the 50% decrease in the level of the ATP synthase per se, cannot be responsible for the increase in the percentage of ρ−/ρo cells. Further, the level of the mitochondrial ATPase can be decreased by 85% without causing a growth defect at 30 °C on YPG medium (26.Mukhopadhyay A. Uh M. Mueller D.M. FEBS Letts. 1994; 343: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and thus a 50% decrease is likely to have minimal effects on the ability of the cells to grow on YPG medium. Finally, the epistatic relationship of the atp2Δ mutation with that of the atp3Δ and atpδΔ mutations suggests that the negative cellular and biochemical phenotypes are because of a gain of activity rather than a loss of activity. More interestingly, what is the mechanism of this epistatic effect? How is it that a diploid cell with a heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ can have a 50% decrease in the level of the F1-ATPase, but when paired with a heterozygous mutation in ATP2, the level returns to normal? A model that explains this and the other results in this paper is presented under “Discussion.”DISCUSSIONIn the prior study, deletion mutations in the genes encoding the γ- (ATP3), δ-, (ATPδ) or ε- (ATPε) subunit of the ATPase provided phenotypes that were not present in strains with a mutation in the gene encoding the α- (ATP1) or β- (ATP2) subunit. In addition, the null mutations in ATP1 or ATP2 were epistatic to null mutations in ATP3, ATPδ, or ATPε. This means that the phenotypes of cells with mutations in ATP1 or ATP2 paired with null mutations in ATP3, ATPδ, or ATPε were that of the cells with mutations in ATP1 or ATP2 alone. Therefore, the atp1Δ and atp2Δ mutations were epistatic to the atp3Δ, atpδΔ, or atpεΔ mutations. A hypothesis was proposed to explain the epistatic effect and the growth defects of the mutant strains (9.Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This hypothesis suggested that the negative growth phenotypes were because of the assembly of an ATP synthase complex that was devoid of the γ-, δ- or ε- subunit. These enzyme complexes were proposed to be defective and uncouple the mitochondrial membrane because of the inability of the subunit-deficient complexes to couple proton translocation to the phosphorylation of ADP (Fig.2 A). The present study provides biochemical and additional genetic evidence that supports this hypothesis.Figure 2Model for observed effects. A, the mitochondrial ATP synthase normally couples proton translocation with ATP synthesis. In the subunit-less enzyme, proton translocation occurs without ATP synthesis. B, hypothetical model for the level of the holo-enzyme (ATP synthase) and the subunit-deficient enzyme as a function of the level of the γ- or δ-subunit in a diploid cell. The level of these peptides is predicted to decrease in changing the gene number from 2 to 1 by deletion of the gene in the cell.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The direct demonstration that the γ- or δ-subunit-deficient ATP synthase enzyme complex is responsible for the negative growth phenotype is difficult in a homozygous mutant strain because cells with a homozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ lose their mtDNA,i.e. become ρ−/ρo. Because the mtDNA encodes subunits of the F0 portion of the ATP synthase, this effect precluded the isolation of mitochondria that had the δ- or γ-less ATP synthase complex. In addition, prior studies indicated that even the F1-ATPase complex in strains with a mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ, if formed, was not stable (27.Giraud M.-F. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28.Paul M.-F. Ackermann S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. Ackermann S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This problem was overcome by using a diploid strain with heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the γ- or δ-subunit.The light color of the diploid cells with a heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ in the ade2− background suggested that these mutations were semi-dominant negative. Further studies on the percentage of ρ−/ρo (Table II), their growth on YPG medium (Fig. 1), and the biochemical studies on the isolated mitochondria (Table III) confirmed this suspicion. Furthermore, the studies indicated that the semi-dominant negative effect was because of a decrease in the gene number from 2 to 1, and not because of any cis-acting effect that the null mutations may have had on neighboring gene expression. Because the growth and cellular phenotypes observed in the diploid cells with the heterozygous mutations were the same, but less severe, as compared with the haploid cells with the deletion mutations, it is concluded that the same phenomenon is responsible for the negative phenotypes in cells with either the homozygous (haploid) or heterozygous null mutation.The biochemical studies on mitochondria isolated from the diploid cells with a heterozygous mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ demonstrated that they were partially uncoupled (Table III). The partial uncoupling might be predicted in the heterozygous mutant if the prior hypothesis was correct, i.e. assembly of the γ-less or δ-less enzyme complexes is responsible for the uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane. This prediction has one requirement: that the heterozygous mutation decreases the level of the subunit to a level that is limiting for the assembly of the holo-enzyme. Fig. 2 shows a schematic that illustrates this point and provides a model to explain the results in this study. It is postulated that two enzymes are formed in the cells with the heterozygous mutation: the holo-enzyme and the γ- or δ-less enzyme (Fig. 2 A). Theoretically, the level of the holo-enzyme will increase as the expression level of the γ- or δ-subunit is increased in the cell until it reaches a saturating level (Fig. 2 B). Conversely, as the level of either of these subunits in the cell is decreased, the level of the holo-enzyme will start to decrease once the level of the subunit reaches a limiting value. At the same time, the level of the subunit-deficient enzyme will start to increase and proceed to a maximum level. The maximum level of the subunit-deficient enzyme is not expected to be the same as the maximum level of the holo-enzyme, because the subunit-deficient enzyme is likely less stable than that holo-enzyme. Further, as the level of the subunit in the cell approaches 0, the level of the subunit-deficient enzyme decreases to 0. This minimal state is analogous to the haploid cell with a null mutation in ATP3 or ATPδ. These cells lose their mtDNA (ρo/ρ−) and thus the genes encoding subunits of F0, which precludes the assembly of the subunit-deficient ATP complex.In the diploid strain, the deletion of a single copy of either ATP3 or ATPδ (going from 2 to 1) would be expected to decrease their expression thereby reducing the level of these subunits in the cell (Fig. 2 B). In turn, this decrease in expression of these subunits would be expected to result in an"

Whereas the structures of other pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-bound intermediates have been determined, the structure of a quinonoid species has not yet been reported. Here, we investigate factors controlling the accumulation and stability of quinonoids formed at the β-active site of tryptophan synthase both in solution and the crystal. The quinonoids were obtained by reacting the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base with different nucleophiles, focusing mainly on the substrate analogs indoline and β-mercaptoethanol. In solution, both monovalent cations (Cs+ or Na+) and alkaline pH increase the apparent affinity of indoline and favor accumulation of the indoline quinonoid. A similar pH dependence is observed when β-mercaptoethanol is used. As indoline and β-mercaptoethanol exhibit very distinct ionization properties, this finding suggests that nucleophile binding and quinonoid stability are controlled by some ionizable protein residue(s). In the crystal, alkaline pH favors formation of the indoline quinonoid as in solution, but the effect of cations is markedly different. In the absence of monovalent metal ions the quinonoid species accumulates substantially, whereas in the presence of sodium ions the accumulation is modest, unless α-subunit ligands are also present. α-Subunit ligands not only favor the formation of the intermediate, but also reduce significantly its decay rate. These findings define experimental conditions suitable for the stabilization of the quinonoid species in the crystal, a critical prerequisite for the determination of the three-dimensional structure of this intermediate.

The internal and the external aldimines in the β-active site are in open and partially open conformations, respectively, and do not send regulatory signals to the α-active site (4.Pan P. Woehl E.

The α-aminoacrylate, E(A-A), exists both in an open and a closed conformation depending on the presence of monovalent cations, whereas the quinonoid, E(Q3), is predominantly in the closed state (13.Leja C.A.

Only the closed state of the β-subunit appears to be competent in the transmission of allosteric signals and, therefore, in stabilizing the closed, catalytically active conformation of the α-subunit. Through this mechanism, the catalytic activities of α- and β-subunits are finely tuned and kept in phase (4.Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem.

Determining the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme at different stages of the catalytic process is an important component of the effort to understand the structural basis of catalysis. In the case of tryptophan synthase, this is even more important since it would help to define the interplay between catalysis and regulation. Thus far, the structures of the internal aldimine (E(Ain), Scheme FS1) and of the external aldimine (E(Aex1), Scheme FS1) have been determined both in the absence and presence of α-subunit ligands (5.Hyde C.C.

In solution, this species is formed transiently during the β-reaction (8.Drewe W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2495-2501Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27.Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J.

However, it is possible to form quinonoid species that are analogous toE(Q3) by reacting the aminoacrylate intermediate with nucleophiles such as β-mercaptoethanol (β-MSH)1 (30.Goldberg M.E.

Here, we have mainly investigated the accumulation and the stability of the quinonoid species formed by using the indole analog indoline in solution and crystal. In particular, since the equilibrium between the external aldimine and α-aminoacrylate is profoundly affected by pH, monovalent cations and α-subunit ligands (33.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L.

The concentration of indoline was estimated on the basis of an extinction coefficient of 2,600m−1 cm−1 at 289 nm (32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F.

A solution containing the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex, 50–100 mml-Ser, 25 mm bis-tris propane-HCl, at 20 °C, was titrated with increasing concentrations of nucleophilic reagents. Titrations were monitored using a Cary 219 spectrophotometer (Varian), interfaced to a personal computer for data storage. Cuvette holders were thermostated at 20 °C. Data were analyzed using a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure available in the SigmaPlot software (Jandel). Single crystals were mounted in a flow cell, placed on the thermostated stage of a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer, equipped with a ×10 Zeiss UV-visible ultrafluar objective. Polarized absorption spectra were collected with the electric vector of the linearly polarized light parallel to the extinction directions on the (210) flat face of monoclinic crystals (29.Mozzarelli A.

Crystals of tryptophan synthase were suspended in either 25 mm bis-tris propane-HCl or 50 mm Bicine-NaOH containing 20% (w/v) PEGM r 8000, 1 mm EDTA. The formation of quinonoids was monitored by recording spectra of crystals suspended in a solution containing 50 mml-Ser and increasing concentrations of nucleophile, at 20 °C. The quinonoids are photosensitive chemical species that undergo accelerated decay when illuminated by strong light sources. To investigate quinonoid stability in the crystal, spectra were collected at intervals of 10–30 min, protecting the crystal from light between measurements. The reaction of indoline with E(A-A) leads to the formation of a metastable quinonoid species absorbing at 466 nm (32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This reaction was previously characterized under a unique set of experimental conditions (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 22 °C) (32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As it was later shown that pH and monovalent cations strongly affect the equilibrium distribution of catalytic intermediates (14.Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34.Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we have investigated in detail the reaction of indoline as a function of pH in the absence and presence of either Na+ or Cs+. These ions were selected because their binding mode and their structural effects have been characterized by x-ray crystallography (37.Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and their influence on the equilibrium distribution between the external aldimine and the α-aminoacrylate are known (33.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A representative titration of the enzyme-serine system with increasing concentrations of indoline is shown in Fig.1. From this and other similar titrations we obtained two parameters used for subsequent analysis:K d, i.e. the apparent indoline dissociation constant under a given set of conditions, 2K d reflects the overall affinity of indoline for the β-active site, including all steps between noncovalent binding and formation of the quinonoid species. andA ∞, the amplitude of the quinonoid band at saturating indoline concentration. The apparent indoline dissociation constant is affected by the presence and nature of monovalent cations (Fig.2 a). At alkaline pH, theK d measured in the presence of Cs+ is slightly lower than in the absence of monovalent cations, whereasK d measured in the presence of Na+ is 6–10-fold lower (Fig. 2 a; at pH values <7,K d in the absence of monovalent cations becomes too high to be reliably measured). Furthermore, the apparent dissociation constant is significantly pH-dependent, both in the absence and presence of metal ions (Fig. 2 a). Monovalent cations also significantly increaseA ∞ (Fig. 2 b). Assuming that the extinction coefficient of E(Q)Indoline is cation-independent, this finding suggests that monovalent cations affect the equilibrium between E(Q)Indoline andE(A-A), in the presence of saturating indoline. This observation and the effects of Na+ and Cs+ on the indoline K d explain the earlier observation that very little indoline quinonoid is formed in the absence of monovalent cations (14.Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The increase in quinonoid formation with pH (Fig.2 b) parallels the increase in the apparent affinity for indoline (Fig. 2 a). The pH dependence observed in the absence and presence of cations are markedly different (Fig.2 b), although, given the limited data set, a quantitative analysis of the pH profiles was not attempted. Above pH 7, A ∞ values measured in the presence of either Na+ or Cs+ are identical within error and nearly pH independent. This suggests that, under these conditions, almost all the enzyme active sites contain theE(Q)Indoline intermediate. Based on this assumption and on the known concentration of active sites in our assays, we estimate an extinction coefficient for the indoline quinonoid of ∼53,000 m−1 cm−1. This value is close to the extinction coefficients previously estimated for similar quinonoids (32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38.Metzler C. Harris A.G. Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4923-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39.Roy M. Miles E.W. Phillips R.S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8661-8669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine if the effects of ions and pH on the formation and accumulation of quinonoid species may depend on the structure of indoline, we investigated the reaction of the serine-enzyme system with a very different nucleophile, β-MSH. Attack of β-MSH on E(A-A) leads to the formation of anE(Q)β-MSH intermediate absorbing at 468 nm (2.Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 49: 127-186PubMed Google Scholar,28.Miles E.W. Hayaishi O. Ishimura Y. Kido R. Biochemical and Medical Aspects of Trytophan Metabolism. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1980Google Scholar, 30.Goldberg M.E. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); this species is less stable than the indoline quinonoid and decays with formation ofS-hydroxyethyl-l-cysteine (40.Miles E.W. Hatanaka M. Crawford I.P. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2742-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the concentration of nucleophile was kept below 50 mm to avoid the effects of β-MSH acting as a cosolvent (41.Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results of β-MSH titrations, carried out as a function of pH in the absence and presence of monovalent cations, are summarized in Fig.3. K d showed little dependence on pH. Furthermore, virtually identicalK d values were observed at high pH both in the absence of cations and in the presence of either Na+ or Cs+ (Fig. 3 a). This observation suggests that the effect of monovalent cations on indoline binding (Fig.2 a) depends on the structure of this aromatic nucleophile. In particular, whereas indoline presumably binds noncovalently to a hydrophobic pocket in the β-active site prior to reacting with the α-aminoacrylate, it is possible that formation of the β-MSH quinonoid may proceed without formation of a stable noncovalent adduct. Cesium ions were more effective than sodium ions at favoring accumulation of the β-MSH quinonoid (Fig. 3 b). This finding is consistent with previous observations showing that different metal ions stabilize preferentially different reaction intermediates (14.Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of Na+ or Cs+,A ∞ increased with pH up to about pH 7 and remained nearly stable thereafter (Fig. 3 b), similarly to what observed with the indoline quinonoid (Fig. 2 b). In a previous investigation on the reactivity of tryptophan synthase in the crystalline state, we reported formation of the β-MSH quinonoid in the presence of α-subunit ligands such as indole-3-propanol phosphate (Ref. 29.Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a modest amount of quinonoid could also be accumulated by reacting the enzyme with the product analog dihydro-5-fluoro-l-tryptophan). Here, we have characterized the formation of quinonoid intermediates upon reaction ofE(A-A) with a series of other nucleophiles: indoline, phenylhydrazine, N-methylhydroxylamine, aniline (Fig.4) or O-methylhydroxylamine (not shown). These quinonoids exhibit very high extinction coefficients and roughly similar band shapes, but differ significantly in λmax (11.Houben K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14.Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The polarized absorption spectra of these intermediates in the crystal (Fig. 4) closely resembled the spectra obtained in solution under similar experimental conditions. Titrations with indoline were carried out at pH 8.0 in the absence and presence of either cesium or sodium ions (Fig.5). The observed indolineK d values were comparable to those measured with the soluble enzyme under similar conditions, and were scarcely affected by the presence of monovalent cations (TableI). However, the maximal amount ofE(Q)Indoline significantly depended on the presence or absence of monovalent cations (Fig. 5). In sharp contrast with the behavior observed in solution, the presence of Na+markedly diminished the accumulation of quinonoid. When the α-subunit ligand d,l-α-glycerol-3-phosphate (GP) was present concomitantly with Na+, the amount ofE(Q)Indoline increased and was as high as in the presence of Cs+ (Fig. 5).Table IApparent affinity of indoline and rates of quinonoid decay in the crystal in the presence of different effectorsEffectorIndolineK dQuinonoid half-life in the crystalCrystalSolutionmmminNone3.7 ± 0.95.8 ± 0.5150100 mm CsCl3.6 ± 1.04.2 ± 0.2180250 mm NaCl1.8 ± 1.21.4 ± 0.1300250 mm NaCl + 50 mmGPNDaND, not determined.ND>600Indoline K d values for the crystalline enzyme at pH 8 were obtained from the data shown in Fig. 5.

Open table in a new tab Indoline K d values for the crystalline enzyme at pH 8 were obtained from the data shown in Fig. 5. For half-life measurements, the E(Q)Indoline intermediate was formed by reacting tryptophan synthase crystals with 50 mml-Ser and 15 mm indoline, at pH 7.8, 20 °C, and its decay was followed by collecting spectra at intervals of 10–30 min. The effect of pH on the accumulation of the quinonoid species was examined by recording polarized absorption spectra in the presence of 3 mm indoline at different pH values (6 to 9), either in the absence of cations or in the presence of Na+ or Cs+. In all cases, accumulation of the quinonoid increased with pH until it reached a maximum at about pH 8 and remained stable up to pH 9 (data not shown). Such observed pH dependence, measured in the presence of a single concentration of indoline, may arise from the same effects observed in solution: the effect of pH on the indolineK d and the pH dependence of the maximum amount ofE(Q)Indoline that can be accumulated. To carry out an x-ray crystallographic analysis of theE(Q)Indoline species, it is essential not only to accumulate this intermediate to the highest extent, but also to make sure that the quinonoid is reasonably stable as a function of time. Decay of E(Q)Indoline in the crystal was monitored at room temperature in the absence and presence of monovalent cations and/or of the α-subunit ligand GP (Table I). The observed half-lives were on the order of a few hours, confirming preliminary observations (42.Rossi G.L. Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rivetti C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A Math. Phys. Sci. 1992; 340: 191-207Crossref Google Scholar). Decay of E(Q)Indoline was particularly slow in the presence of Na+ and GP (Table I). The quinonoid species formed by phenylhydrazine and aniline also decayed on time scales of hours (not shown). The determination of the three-dimensional structures of chemical and conformational intermediates in enzyme-catalyzed reactions is essential for understanding the relationships between structure and biological function. Solution investigations of the αβ reaction of tryptophan synthase have revealed an essential interplay between chemical and conformational events (1.Yanofsky C. Crawford I.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes.

Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Catalytic steps and conformational changes are linked by an intricate set of allosteric interactions, which allow achievement of efficient catalysis at the α- and β-sites as well as regulation of indole channeling (4.Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43.Miles E.W. Rhee S. Davies D.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) has introduced critically important information about the architecture of the protein. However, both the nature of the chemical bonding interactions that result in catalysis and the allosteric regulation of channeling and catalysis remain unclear. Among the several facets of the catalytic and regulatory cycle that are still poorly understood are the following: (a) the structural basis of catalysis at the α- and β-sites; (b) the conformational events that trigger activation of the α-site; (c) the conformational changes induced by monovalent cations that establish allosteric communication between the α- and β-sites, and activate the β-site; and (d) the structure of a tryptophan synthase quinonoidal intermediate, a species that also stabilizes the activated conformation of the α-site. The partially closed structures determined for theE(Aex1) and E(Aex2) complexes of the βK87T mutant appear not to perturb the α-site (23.Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), a conclusion in agreement with the finding that the wild-type complexes of these species do not activate the α-site (12.Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), nor do they alter the dynamic properties of the α-site (9.Strambini G.B. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7535-7542Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of E(A-A) complexed with 5-fluoroindole propanol phosphate (26.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) reveals a completely closed conformation that is different from the βK87T complexes. Whereas structures of the Na+, K+, and Cs+ forms of the enzyme and several enzyme intermediates (or analogues thereof) have been solved, the structures of cation-free forms of the enzyme have not been reported, and the origins of the monovalent cation effects remain structurally obscure. The β-reaction catalyzed by tryptophan synthase involves at least nine covalent transformations and eight covalent intermediates. The bond scission and formation steps involve C-N single and double bonds, a C-O single bond, C-H bonds, N-H bonds, O-H bonds, and a C=C double bond. Scission of the C-H bond at the C-α of E(Aex1) is energetically difficult and rate determining for the β- and αβ-reactions under steady-state conditions (16.Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7131-7141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The proton removed from C-α ofE(Aex1) has been postulated to be trapped within a low barrier hydrogen bond at the β-site in the E(A-A) state (44.Hur O. Leja C. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Formation of E(A-A) is the chemical trigger that switches the protein to the closed state and brings about activation of the α-site (12.Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reversal of this conformational switch occurs when E(Q3) is converted toE(Aex2) (13.Leja C.A. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6552-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consequently, knowledge of the relationship between structure and function in the tryptophan synthase system will be significantly advanced by further work on the structures of the α-aminoacrylate and quinonoid complexes, both with and without monovalent cations bound to the β-site, and with substrate or effectors bound to the α-site. Toward this end, we have established conditions under which the indoline quinonoid is stabilized in the crystal. The indole analogues, aniline, phenylhydrazine, and methylated hydroxylamines were all shown to be potential candidates for the determination of a quinonoid structure. However, indoline appears to be the system of choice for several reasons: (a) indoline is a close structural homologue of indole; (b) indoline is an alternative substrate for tryptophan synthase, yielding the artificial amino acid, dihydroiso-l-tryptophan (32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); (c) indoline is a well established kinetic and mechanistic probe of theE(A-A) species (6.Dunn M.F. Aguilar V. Brzovic P.S. Drewe W.F. Houben K.F. Leja C.A. Roy M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8598-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12.Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); and (d) as discussed below, a suitable combination of monovalent cations, α-site ligand and pH conveys remarkable stability to the indoline quinonoid at room temperature, both in solution and in the crystalline state. Nevertheless, different conditions are required for optimizing quinonoid yield and stability in solution and crystal. The role of pH and monovalent cations in modulating the chemical and conformational equilibria involved in the formation of the indoline quinonoid is summarized in Scheme FS2. The equilibrium distribution between E(Aex1) andE(A-A) is controlled by two ionizations with pK a values of 7.8 and 10.2 (34.Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Low pH favors the accumulation of E(A-A), high pH favors accumulation ofE(Aex1) and α-subunit ligands strongly favorE(A-A) at all pH values. Different protein conformations are associated with E(Aex1) and E(A-A), the former residing in a partially open state and the latter in the closed state. BothE(QH)Indoline/E(Q)Indolineand E(A-A) are predominantly in a closed conformation (13.Leja C.A. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6552-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,14.Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22.Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reaction of indoline with the tryptophan synthase-serine system involves at least three steps (Scheme FS3); formation of a Michaelis complex at the β-subunit (step 1, Scheme FS3), nucleophilic attack on the β-carbon of E(A-A), to give a quinonoid intermediate, E(QH)Indoline (step 2, Scheme FS3; 32), which may be subsequently deprotonated by a basic group (B1, Scheme FS3) to give E(Q)Indoline. These steps are accompanied by adjustment of the α- and β-subunit conformational equilibria to binding and reaction. In contrast to the reaction of E(A-A) with indole, formation of the indoline quinonoid C-N bond is freely reversible (6.Dunn M.F. Aguilar V. Brzovic P.S. Drewe W.F. Houben K.F. Leja C.A. Roy M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8598-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since further reaction is very slow (32.Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the apparent affinity for indoline and the accumulation of quinonoid depend on the equilibria described in Scheme FS3 and on the factors that influence these equilibria (e.g. pH, monovalent cations, and α-site ligands). At equilibrium, in Stage I of the β-reaction, E(A-A) predominates at low pH, whereas the external aldimine is stabilized by high pH values (34.Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). If this effect were fully maintained in the presence of saturating indoline, it would antagonize the formation of quinonoid at high pH. Nevertheless, the accumulation of the indoline quinonoid increases with pH up to about 7.5 and remains nearly constant thereafter (Fig. 2 b). This finding suggests that the equilibrium betweenE(Aex1) and E(A-A) shifts toward the latter when indoline binds. The binding of indole (8.Drewe W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2495-2501Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or indole analogs (11.Houben K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is known to induce a redistribution of intermediates bound to the β-active site. Since the pH dependence of quinonoid accumulation is very similar for indoline (pK a ∼5; Ref. 13.Leja C.A. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6552-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and for β-MSH (pK a ∼9.5; Ref. 41.Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that quinonoid formation is controlled by the ionization properties of the nucleophile. 3If β-MSH binds to E(A-A) as the neutral thiol, with transfer of the thiol proton to B1 occurring prior to, or during, the nucleophilic attack on E(A-A), then, the pK a of β-MSH would not influence quinonoid yield in the pH range studied (pH 6 to 9). This observation suggests that the pH dependence reflects the ionization of a protein residue. Protonation of the basic residue (B1 Scheme FS3) that abstracts a proton fromE(QH)Indoline (45.Phillips R.S. Miles E.W. Cohen L.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) would decrease quinonoid accumulation. A similar proton transfer is known to occur for the indole system. The same factors that increase quinonoid stability also increase the apparent affinity for indoline. Hence, the modest effect of pH onK d may result from a trade off: the pH dependence of the E(Aex1) ↔ E(A-A) equilibrium should disfavor the noncovalent binding step at high pH, but this effect might be more than countered by the stabilization of the quinonoid species at high pH. Sodium and cesium ions bind to the same site in the β-subunit, about 8 Å from pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (37.Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A rotation of about 1° of the β-subunit with respect to the α-subunit was observed when either Cs+ or K+ is bound in place of Na+. Phosphorescence and NMR line width measurements suggest that both ions cause the β-active site to become less flexible (33.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46.Schnackerz K. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33247-33253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Yet the functional effects of these cations are distinct: in the absence of added nucleophiles, Cs+ perturbs theE(Aex1) − E(A-A) equilibrium, strongly favoring E(A-A), and likely stabilizes a closed conformation of the β-subunit, whereas Na+ favorsE(Aex1) and the “partially closed” conformation. In the absence of monovalent cations, the predominant species is E(A-A) (33.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of indoline, Cs+ favors a higher accumulation of quinonoid at all pH values tested (Figs. 2 band 3 b) and Na+ ions favor accumulation of the indoline quinonoid to nearly the same extent. Furthermore, both monovalent cations tested decrease the apparent K dfor indoline. This finding suggests that Na+ and Cs+ within a closed conformation act similarly despite the different effects these ions have on the equilibria between open and closed states. It is also possible that metal ions modulate the pK a of the residue responsible for quinonoid deprotonation (step 3, Scheme FS3). This would be consistent with the different pH dependence of quinonoid yield (A ∞) in the presence and absence of monovalent cations (Fig. 2 b). The results presented in Fig. 5 and in Table I establish both the conditions under which the crystalline indoline quinonoid may be formed and the extent to which stabilization may be achieved through the action of monovalent cation binding, the effects of pH, and the binding of GP. In contrast to the behavior observed in solution, in the absence of other effectors, Na+ is ineffective in stabilizing E(Q)Indoline; indeed, the highest yields of the quinonoid were obtained in the cation-free system (Fig.5). However, both the combination of Na+ and GP, or Cs+ alone, were found to be relatively effective. Analysis of the light absorbing properties of the quinonoid crystals measured along the direction of maximum absorbance is consistent with a high occupancy of β-sites by the indoline quinonoid. The apparent half-lives for E(Q)Indoline decay, shown in Table I, establish that the combination of Na+ and GP gives the greatest stabilization (by a factor >4-fold over the stability determined in the absence of effectors). Together, these observations concerning the influence of effectors and pH onE(Q)Indoline yield and stability indicate that the combination of Na+ and GP at pH 8 to 9 provides a highly stable quinonoid species that should be an excellent candidate for structure determination via single crystal x-ray diffraction. These results emphasize the utility of conducting spectroscopic analyses of protein-ligand interactions in the crystalline state to direct x-ray diffraction studies (47.Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This approach is particularly critical when dealing with catalytic intermediates such as quinonoids species that are metastable and have so far eluded structural determination. We thank Dr. Edith W.

Continuous synaptic activity relies on the constant recycling of synaptic vesicle proteins into newly formed synaptic vesicles. At least two different mechanisms are presumed to mediate synaptic vesicle biogenesis at the synapse as follows: direct retrieval of synaptic vesicle proteins and lipids from the plasma membrane, and indirect passage of synaptic vesicle proteins through an endosomal intermediate. We have identified a vesicle population with the characteristics of a primary endocytic vesicle responsible for the recycling of synaptic vesicle proteins through the indirect pathway. We find that synaptic vesicle proteins colocalize in this vesicle with a variety of proteins known to recycle from the plasma membrane through the endocytic pathway, including three different glucose transporters, GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4, and the transferrin receptor. These vesicles differ from “classical” synaptic vesicles in their size and their generic protein content, indicating that they do not discriminate between synaptic vesicle-specific proteins and other recycling proteins. We propose that these vesicles deliver synaptic vesicle proteins that have escaped internalization by the direct pathway to endosomes, where they are sorted from other recycling proteins and packaged into synaptic vesicles.

Current models of synaptic vesicle biogenesis suggest that at least two pathways exist for the formation of new synaptic vesicles after exocytosis: directly from the plasma membrane and indirectly via an intermediate endosomal compartment (1.Cremona O.

In the PC12 neuroendocrine cell line, synaptic vesicles are also derived from two different pathways as follows: directly from the plasma membrane (5.Schmidt A. Hannah M.J. Huttner W.B. J.

Together these data form an emerging model of multiple pathways to recycle both synaptic vesicle proteins and synaptic vesicle membrane.Although presumably all synaptic vesicle proteins undergo endocytic trafficking, relatively little is known about the intermediate steps in the pathway to mature synaptic vesicles. In order to understand fully the mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle biogenesis, it is critical that the synaptic vesicle protein trafficking pathways are fully elucidated. In neurons, synaptic vesicle proteins are present in heterogeneous vesicle populations, but the relationship of these compartments to the process of synaptic vesicle formation is almost impossible to determine, given the difficulty of performing a kinetic analysis of synaptic vesicle protein trafficking in brain (11.Huttner W.B.

In contrast, PC12 cells have proved to be a useful system for analyzing the trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins and the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles (5.Schmidt A. Hannah M.J. Huttner W.B. J.

We have characterized a vesicular compartment in PC12 cells containing the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin, SV2, and synaptotagmin. These vesicles are distinct in size and protein composition from synaptic vesicles; they contain two different endogenous glucose transporters, GLUT11 and GLUT3, as well as the transferrin receptor (TfR). Moreover, we show that exogenously expressed proteins such as GLUT4 and the sodium-dependent dopamine transporter (DAT) are also present in these vesicles. Our data provide evidence that this compartment is not derived by vesiculation of biosynthetic organelles or the plasma membrane and that vesicles with similar properties are present in rat brain. We suggest that this vesicle is part of the endocytic recycling system in neurons and PC12 cells, potentially operating as a primary endocytic vesicle involved in trafficking synaptic vesicle proteins that have escaped the direct targeting pathway to synaptic vesicles.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a vesicular compartment in PC12 cells with a counterpart in rat brain that is characterized by the colocalization of synaptic vesicle proteins with a variety of other proteins, including multiple different transporters and the transferrin receptor. In addition to providing evidence for cosedimentation of membranes containing these proteins with synaptic vesicle proteins, we show by organelle immunoisolation that synaptic vesicle proteins and GLUT1 are in the same vesicle and that these vesicles are not derived from a shared component of the biosynthetic pathway or by vesiculation of the plasma membrane.Vesicle populations with properties similar to the vesicle we have characterized in this paper have been described in PC12 cells and rat brain by two different laboratories. The earliest work, by Hermanet al. (24.Herman G.A. Bonzelius F. Cieutat A.M. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12750-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), demonstrated that GLUT4, exogenously expressed in PC12 cells by DNA transfection, colocalizes with a distinct vesicle population that overlaps in 5–25% glycerol velocity gradients with synaptic vesicles (GLUT4 is also targeted to large dense core vesicles in PC12 cells: Hudson et al. (23.Hudson A.W. Fingar D.C. Seidner G.A. Griffiths G. Burke B. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); these vesicles sediment in the P2 and do not appear in our glycerol gradient). Because the GLUT4 peak is quite distinct from the synaptophysin peak, these authors assumed that synaptic vesicle proteins and GLUT4 were not in the same vesicles. However, due to substantial overlap between the two peaks, a second minor peak of synaptic vesicle proteins is likely to be obscured by the major overlapping immunoreactivity of synaptic vesicle proteins in the classic position of the gradient. By organelle immunoisolation we have demonstrated the colocalization of synaptic vesicle proteins and the glucose transporters in the same vesicles. Whereas these authors suggested that GLUT4 is targeted to a specialized vesicle corresponding to the insulin-regulated secretory vesicle present in adipocytes, our data suggest little specificity in the targeting of GLUT4 to this compartment.While this manuscript was in preparation, a second description of these vesicles in PC12 cells appeared in Thoidis et al. (25.Thoidis G. Kupriyanova T. Cunningham J.M. Chen P. Cadel S. Foulon T. Cohen P. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14062-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using different gradient systems, these authors demonstrated two populations of vesicles in PC12 cells, one enriched for synaptic vesicle proteins only and a second population characterized by copurification of synaptic vesicle proteins with endogenous GLUT3 and aminopeptidase B. These authors also demonstrated the copurification of GLUT3 and aminopeptidase B with synaptic vesicle proteins in a similar vesicle population in rat brain. Since release of aminopeptidase B is reportedly calcium-dependent in PC12 cells, and aminopeptidase B is found in the insulin-responsive population of GLUT4 vesicles in adipocytes (26.Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 27.Kandror K.V., Yu, L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30777-30780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these authors hypothesized that the vesicle population is a distinct type of regulated secretory vesicle, perhaps a second population of synaptic vesicles. The types and diversity of proteins present in these vesicles suggest that these vesicles are unlikely to represent a regulated secretory pathway analogous to synaptic vesicles in neurons and endocrine cells or the insulin-responsive secretory vesicles in adipocytes and skeletal muscle. The proteins we have identified in this vesicle population are all proteins that traffic through the endosomal system, and several of them are constitutively abundant in the plasma membrane of neurons and PC12 cells, including the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, the monoamine transporter DAT, and the transferrin receptor. Furthermore, unlike classical synaptic vesicles, this second vesicle population does not appear to exclude any membrane proteins that we have examined. Further evidence for the specificity of synaptic vesicle protein targeting as compared with the vesicle population we have described is the inclusion of the plasma membrane protein Thy-1, but not other plasma membrane proteins, in classical synaptic vesicles in PC12 cells and neurons.If these vesicles are not likely to represent an alternative population of synaptic vesicles, then what are they? Our data show they are not derived from biosynthetic compartments, including the ER and the Golgi, nor do they appear to arise by vesiculation of the plasma membrane. The characteristics of these vesicles suggest two possibilities, either a generic postendosomal secretory vesicle or a primary endocytic vesicle. In support of a postendosomal identity, we have found that the steady state level of this vesicle population is decreased after prolonged incubation of PC12 cells at 15 °C, 3C. J. Provoda, M. T. Waring, and K. M. Buckley, unpublished observations. consistent with the decrease in a similar vesicle population containing exogenously expressed GLUT4 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (31.Wei M.L. Bonzelius F. Scully R.M. Kelly R.B. Herman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, although endocytosis is not blocked at this temperature, it is likely to be much reduced (32.Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), so sensitivity to 15 °C alone is not sufficient evidence to exclude the possibility that these vesicles are primary endocytic vesicles. In strong support of a primary endocytic identity, two distinct vesicle populations with the characteristics of this vesicle and of synaptic vesicles have been observed in coated vesicle preparations from rat brain after the coats have been removed (13.Thoidis G. Chen P. Pushkin A.V. Vallega G. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Thoidis G. Kupriyanova T. Cunningham J.M. Chen P. Cadel S. Foulon T. Cohen P. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14062-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of two types of clathrin-coated vesicles in brain homogenates has previously been reported, one enriched inN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive Cl− uptake activity (presumably based on the presence of the vacuolar proton pump), consistent with synaptic vesicles, and the other enriched in Na+,K+-ATPase, consistent with a more generic endocytic pathway (33.Uriu T. Omori K. Yamamoto A. Inoue M. Inagaki C. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1548-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The latter pathway was enriched in coated vesicle preparations from cultured glial cells, again consistent with a more generic endocytic function. In agreement with these results, Thoidis et al. (13.Thoidis G. Chen P. Pushkin A.V. Vallega G. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Thoidis G. Kupriyanova T. Cunningham J.M. Chen P. Cadel S. Foulon T. Cohen P. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14062-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) also found that the GLUT3/aminopeptidase vesicles have reduced amounts of the V-type ATPase compared with synaptic vesicles.Only a small percent of the total protein for each of the proteins we have examined in PC12 cells is expressed in these vesicles. Our ability to detect these proteins in this vesicle compartment is likely to be related to the level of a protein's flux through the endocytic pathway. For example, proteins with efficient internalization signals such as GLUT4 and the synaptic vesicle proteins may be more easily detected, whereas detection of proteins that are internalized at slower rates may be facilitated by higher levels of protein expression produced by transient as compared with stable expression (e.g. GLUT1HA, DAT). The small percent of total protein in these vesicles is by no means a measure of its significance to trafficking of these proteins, since we are detecting only the steady state levels in a presumably transient vesicle population and not the amount of protein that traffics through this compartment over time.Data from all these studies taken together support the identity of this vesicle population as a primary endocytic vesicle. Current models for synaptic vesicle biogenesis suggest that synaptic vesicles are generated by at least two different mechanisms. We hypothesize that this vesicle population is highly likely to represent the primary endocytic vesicle for trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins through the indirect pathway for synaptic vesicle biogenesis. In the direct pathway, synaptic vesicle proteins are selectively endocytosed from the plasma membrane. Possible mechanisms for this selectivity include a kiss-and-run mechanism of exocytosis, complex formation between synaptic vesicle proteins in the plasma membrane that excludes other proteins, and endocytosis from a restricted region of the presynaptic plasma membrane (1.Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34.Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35.Haucke V. De Camilli P. Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the indirect pathway, synaptic vesicle proteins that have escaped internalization by the direct pathway may be endocytosed along with other recycling membrane proteins and delivered to the endosomal recycling compartment. Here, synaptic vesicle proteins are sorted away from other nerve terminal proteins into synaptic vesicles, whereas the remaining proteins are sorted according to their appropriate destinations.Why should there be two different pathways for synaptic vesicle formation at the synapse? One obvious possibility is that high fidelity sorting of synaptic vesicle proteins cannot be maintained over time with only a direct pathway. Although the direct pathway has the advantage of rapid formation of synaptic vesicles, the formation of synaptic vesicles from the endosome provides a mechanism to maintain or vary the composition of synaptic vesicle proteins by insertion of newly synthesized synaptic vesicle proteins, the removal of aged proteins destined for degradation, and sorting away of non-synaptic vesicle proteins. Further studies of the diversity of coated vesicles with attention to correlation between specific adaptor proteins and cargo proteins may help decipher the characteristics of different endocytic vesicles responsible for protein trafficking in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. The biogenesis of synaptic vesicles is a complex orchestration of events culminating in a vesicle population responsible for the uptake, storage, and regulated secretion of neurotransmitters. Current models of synaptic vesicle biogenesis suggest that at least two pathways exist for the formation of new synaptic vesicles after exocytosis: directly from the plasma membrane and indirectly via an intermediate endosomal compartment (1.Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2.Hannah M.J. Schmidt A.A. Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

(25.Thoidis G. Kupriyanova T. Cunningham J.M. Chen P. Cadel S. Foulon T. Cohen P. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14062-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using different gradient systems, these authors demonstrated two populations of vesicles in PC12 cells, one enriched for synaptic vesicle proteins only and a second population characterized by copurification of synaptic vesicle proteins with endogenous GLUT3 and aminopeptidase B. These authors also demonstrated the copurification of GLUT3 and aminopeptidase B with synaptic vesicle proteins in a similar vesicle population in rat brain. Since release of aminopeptidase B is reportedly calcium-dependent in PC12 cells, and aminopeptidase B is found in the insulin-responsive population of GLUT4 vesicles in adipocytes (26.Keller S.R.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30777-30780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these authors hypothesized that the vesicle population is a distinct type of regulated secretory vesicle, perhaps a second population of synaptic vesicles. The types and diversity of proteins present in these vesicles suggest that these vesicles are unlikely to represent a regulated secretory pathway analogous to synaptic vesicles in neurons and endocrine cells or the insulin-responsive secretory vesicles in adipocytes and skeletal muscle. The proteins we have identified in this vesicle population are all proteins that traffic through the endosomal system, and several of them are constitutively abundant in the plasma membrane of neurons and PC12 cells, including the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, the monoamine transporter DAT, and the transferrin receptor. Furthermore, unlike classical synaptic vesicles, this second vesicle population does not appear to exclude any membrane proteins that we have examined. Further evidence for the specificity of synaptic vesicle protein targeting as compared with the vesicle population we have described is the inclusion of the plasma membrane protein Thy-1, but not other plasma membrane proteins, in classical synaptic vesicles in PC12 cells and neurons.If these vesicles are not likely to represent an alternative population of synaptic vesicles, then what are they? Our data show they are not derived from biosynthetic compartments, including the ER and the Golgi, nor do they appear to arise by vesiculation of the plasma membrane. The characteristics of these vesicles suggest two possibilities, either a generic postendosomal secretory vesicle or a primary endocytic vesicle. In support of a postendosomal identity, we have found that the steady state level of this vesicle population is decreased after prolonged incubation of PC12 cells at 15 °C, 3C. J. Provoda, M. T. Waring, and K. M. Buckley, unpublished observations. consistent with the decrease in a similar vesicle population containing exogenously expressed GLUT4 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (31.Wei M.L. Bonzelius F. Scully R.M. Kelly R.B. Herman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, although endocytosis is not blocked at this temperature, it is likely to be much reduced (32.Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), so sensitivity to 15 °C alone is not sufficient evidence to exclude the possibility that these vesicles are primary endocytic vesicles. In strong support of a primary endocytic identity, two distinct vesicle populations with the characteristics of this vesicle and of synaptic vesicles have been observed in coated vesicle preparations from rat brain after the coats have been removed (13.Thoidis G. Chen P. Pushkin A.V. Vallega G. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Thoidis G. Kupriyanova T.

The presence of two types of clathrin-coated vesicles in brain homogenates has previously been reported, one enriched inN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive Cl− uptake activity (presumably based on the presence of the vacuolar proton pump), consistent with synaptic vesicles, and the other enriched in Na+,K+-ATPase, consistent with a more generic endocytic pathway (33.Uriu T. Omori K. Yamamoto A. Inoue M. Inagaki C. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1548-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The latter pathway was enriched in coated vesicle preparations from cultured glial cells, again consistent with a more generic endocytic function. In agreement with these results, Thoidis et al. (13.Thoidis G. Chen P. Pushkin A.V. Vallega G. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Thoidis G.

Our ability to detect these proteins in this vesicle compartment is likely to be related to the level of a protein's flux through the endocytic pathway. For example, proteins with efficient internalization signals such as GLUT4 and the synaptic vesicle proteins may be more easily detected, whereas detection of proteins that are internalized at slower rates may be facilitated by higher levels of protein expression produced by transient as compared with stable expression (e.g. GLUT1HA, DAT). The small percent of total protein in these vesicles is by no means a measure of its significance to trafficking of these proteins, since we are detecting only the steady state levels in a presumably transient vesicle population and not the amount of protein that traffics through this compartment over time.Data from all these studies taken together support the identity of this vesicle population as a primary endocytic vesicle. Current models for synaptic vesicle biogenesis suggest that synaptic vesicles are generated by at least two different mechanisms. We hypothesize that this vesicle population is highly likely to represent the primary endocytic vesicle for trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins through the indirect pathway for synaptic vesicle biogenesis. In the direct pathway, synaptic vesicle proteins are selectively endocytosed from the plasma membrane. Possible mechanisms for this selectivity include a kiss-and-run mechanism of exocytosis, complex formation between synaptic vesicle proteins in the plasma membrane that excludes other proteins, and endocytosis from a restricted region of the presynaptic plasma membrane (1.Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34.Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35.Haucke V. De Camilli P. Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the indirect pathway, synaptic vesicle proteins that have escaped internalization by the direct pathway may be endocytosed along with other recycling membrane proteins and delivered to the endosomal recycling compartment. Here, synaptic vesicle proteins are sorted away from other nerve terminal proteins into synaptic vesicles, whereas the remaining proteins are sorted according to their appropriate destinations.Why should there be two different pathways for synaptic vesicle formation at the synapse? One obvious possibility is that high fidelity sorting of synaptic vesicle proteins cannot be maintained over time with only a direct pathway. Although the direct pathway has the advantage of rapid formation of synaptic vesicles, the formation of synaptic vesicles from the endosome provides a mechanism to maintain or vary the composition of synaptic vesicle proteins by insertion of newly synthesized synaptic vesicle proteins, the removal of aged proteins destined for degradation, and sorting away of non-synaptic vesicle proteins. Further studies of the diversity of coated vesicles with attention to correlation between specific adaptor proteins and cargo proteins may help decipher the characteristics of different endocytic vesicles responsible for protein trafficking in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. We have identified a vesicular compartment in PC12 cells with a counterpart in rat brain that is characterized by the colocalization of synaptic vesicle proteins with a variety of other proteins, including multiple different transporters and the transferrin receptor. In addition to providing evidence for cosedimentation of membranes containing these proteins with synaptic vesicle proteins, we show by organelle immunoisolation that synaptic vesicle proteins and GLUT1 are in the same vesicle and that these vesicles are not derived from a shared component of the biosynthetic pathway or by vesiculation of the plasma membrane. Vesicle populations with properties similar to the vesicle we have characterized in this paper have been described in PC12 cells and rat brain by two different laboratories. The earliest work, by Hermanet al. (24.Herman G.A. Bonzelius F. Cieutat A.M. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12750-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), demonstrated that GLUT4, exogenously expressed in PC12 cells by DNA transfection, colocalizes with a distinct vesicle population that overlaps in 5–25% glycerol velocity gradients with synaptic vesicles (GLUT4 is also targeted to large dense core vesicles in PC12 cells: Hudson et al. (23.Hudson A.W. Fingar D.C. Seidner G.A. Griffiths G. Burke B. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); these vesicles sediment in the P2 and do not appear in our glycerol gradient). Because the GLUT4 peak is quite distinct from the synaptophysin peak, these authors assumed that synaptic vesicle proteins and GLUT4 were not in the same vesicles. However, due to substantial overlap between the two peaks, a second minor peak of synaptic vesicle proteins is likely to be obscured by the major overlapping immunoreactivity of synaptic vesicle proteins in the classic position of the gradient. By organelle immunoisolation we have demonstrated the colocalization of synaptic vesicle proteins and the glucose transporters in the same vesicles. Whereas these authors suggested that GLUT4 is targeted to a specialized vesicle corresponding to the insulin-regulated secretory vesicle present in adipocytes, our data suggest little specificity in the targeting of GLUT4 to this compartment.

These variants were designed to promote the formation of heterodimers and to destabilize the formation of inactive variant homodimers of HIV-1 protease through substitutions at Asp-25, Ile-49, and Gly-50 (Babé, L. M., Rosé, J., and Craik, C. S. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 10069–10073; McPhee, F., Good, A. C., Kuntz, I. D., and Craik, C. S. (1996)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.93, 11477–11481). The mechanism of action of these dominant-negative inhibitors was established using recombinantly expressed defective monomers. The defective monomers were refolded in vitro in the presence of wt HIV PR and showed dose-dependent inhibition of proteolytic activity. This inhibition was shown to result from the formation of inactive heterodimers between defective and wt HIV PR monomers. Heterodimer formation was detected by (i) isolating refolded, inactive heterodimers using histidine-tagged defective monomers and (ii) isolating heterodimers from bacteria coexpressing both wt and defective variants of HIV PR. Single-chain variants of HIV PR, in which the C terminus of the wt HIV PR monomer was covalently tethered to the N terminus of the defective monomer, were also expressed and analyzed. Thermal denaturation of these single-chain heterodimers using differential scanning calorimetry revealed a 1.5–7.2 °C greater thermal stability than single-chain wt HIV PR. The thermodynamic trend shown by these three variants mirrors their relative inhibition in provirus transfection assays. These data support the model that the effects seen both in tissue culture and in vitro arise from an increase in stability conferred on these heterodimers by interface mutations and identifies heterodimer formation as their mechanism of inhibition.

Because dimerization is required for activity, an alternative strategy to small-molecule inhibitors that target the active site of HIV PR is to develop compounds that destabilize or disrupt dimerization by binding at the dimer interface. Such a strategy has been investigated by several researchers (4.Zhang Z.Y. Poorman R.A. Maggiora L.L. Heinrikson R.L. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol.

A defective variant should be less sensitive than small-molecule inhibitors to the emergence of resistance mutations because of the large interacting surface area (3224 Å2) at the dimer interface (9.Wlodawer A. Miller M. Jaskólski M. Sathyanarayana B.K. Baldwin E. Weber I.T. Selk L.M. Clawson L. Schneider J. Kent S.B. Science. 1989; 245: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 10.Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the strict requirement of dimerization for enzyme activity. In addition, the potency of the inhibitor could be improved by engineering the inactive, heterodimeric interface to be more stable than the wild type homodimeric interface. Since the K d of HIV PR has been reported to be decreased by inhibitor and substrate binding (3.Grant S.K. Deckman I.C. Culp J.S. Minnich M.D. Brooks I.S. Hensley P. Debouck C. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9491-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), one possibility for increasing the potency of the dominant-negative inhibitor is to introduce substitutions that fill the neighboring wt HIV PR substrate binding pocket in the heterodimer. An understanding of the interactions that make a dominant-negative inhibitor effective may lead to the optimization of peptide or other small molecule inhibitors that are less sensitive to resistance. The design of several such defective HIV PR monomers, with one or more substitutions at Asp-25, Gly-49, and/or Ile-50, has been reported. All defective monomers studied have demonstrated inhibition in cell culture (1.Babé L.M. Rosé J. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2.McPhee F. Good A.C. Kuntz I.D. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Coexpression of the inactive protease variant with wt HIV PR inhibited viral maturation in both transiently transfected and stably integrated cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with dominant-negative inhibition of the viral protease (1.Babé L.M. Rosé J. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, other changes were introduced at the active site dimer interface to further promote heterodimer formation and to minimize defective monomer homodimerization (2.McPhee F. Good A.C. Kuntz I.D. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11477-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A variant monomer of HIV PR containing three substitutions, D25K/G49W/I50W (KWW), was the most potent dominant-negative inhibitor. A heterodimer composed of wt HIV PR and HIV PR KWW is shown in Fig. 1. The substitution of lysine for the catalytic Asp-25 may stabilize the heterodimer by both (i) hydrophobic interactions between the methylene groups of the lysine side chain and the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket and (ii) favorable charge-charge interactions with the aspartate of the wt monomer (2.McPhee F. Good A.C. Kuntz I.D. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11477-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The replacement of residues Gly-49 and Ile-50 with tryptophans introduces favorable hydrophobic interactions with the S1 and S2′ subsites of an associated wt monomer via a pseudo-substrate-like mechanism. These substitutions were predicted not only to promote heterodimer formation but also to destabilize homodimer formation through both steric and electrostatic repulsion. That some of these defective monomers demonstrated greater inhibition than others was predicted to be a result of their higher affinity for wild-type monomers and their decreased tendency to self-associate (2.McPhee F. Good A.C. Kuntz I.D. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11477-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the results obtained from tissue culture experiments are consistent with our model of dominant-negative inhibition, there is no direct evidence showing the formation of inactive heterodimers. We report here the in vitro inhibition of wt HIV PR by defective variants, biochemical evidence of heterodimer formation, and the biophysical characterization of three inactive heterodimers. For these studies, we examined the following defective monomers with single, double, and triple mutations, respectively: (i) HIV PR D25K, (ii) HIV PR G49W/I50W (WW), and (iii) HIV PR KWW. The experimental results presented here demonstrate that dominant-negative inhibition is attributable to heterodimer formation and that the dimer interface of HIV PR can be engineered to stabilize these inactive heterodimer complexes relative to homodimeric wt HIV PR. All HIV PR variants described were expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pTacTac, a derivative of the pHSe5 vector (11.Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). A synthetic gene for the 99-amino acid HIV-1 PR (12.Pichuantes S. Babé L.M. Barr P.J. Craik C.S. Proteins. 1989; 6: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13.Rosé J.R. Babé L.M. Craik C.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned downstream of a gene encoding the highly transcribed CheY protein, obtained from the plasmid pCHEY15LOX (14.Sigal E. Grunberger D. Highland E. Gross C. Dixon R.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to facilitate ribosome capture. To further enhance translational efficiency, an intervening bicistronic linker was placed between the CheY and HIV PR coding regions. This linker, 5′-TAAGGAGGTTACC ATG-3′, introduces a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a three-nucleotide spacer (in boldface) between the CheY stop codon and the HIV PR start codon (underlined). This vector, pT2Cb3/HIV-1, was used to express wt HIV PR, defective HIV PR monomers, and single-chain tethered variants of HIV PR (Fig.2, A and B). Nontethered heterodimers were coexpressed using related plasmids in which a second, histidine-tagged HIV PR gene was placed downstream of the untagged, wt HIV PR with an additional bicistronic linker sequence inserted between the two coding regions (Fig. 2 C). All of the HIV PR constructs contain the mutation Q7K, which greatly reduces autoproteolysis (15.Rosé J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11939-11945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding variant HIV PR monomers, including the C-terminal histidine-tagged variants, were made by Kunkel mutagenesis (16.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis on the HIV PR gene in a pBluescript (pBS) based shuttle vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contained the entire bicistronic region between unique BamHI and SalI sites (Fig. 2 A), was carried out using various oligonucleotides singly or in combination. To introduce a lysine at position 25 of the protease, the oligonucleotide 5′-GAAGCTTTG CTTAAG ACCGGTGCTGACG-3′ was used, and positive clones were identified by digestion with the restriction endonuclease AflII (underlined nucleotides). Tryptophan codons were introduced at positions 49 and 50 using the oligonucleotide 5′-AAAATGATAGGGTGGTGGGGAGGTTTTATC-3′. The sequences encoding Gly-(His)3 and Gly-(His)6 were introduced at the C terminus of wt HIV PR and the defective monomers using the oligonucleotides 5′-GTACTTTAAATTTCGGTCACCACCACTAGTCGAC CTCG-3′ (Gly-(His)3) and 5′-GTACTTTAAATTTCGGTCACCACCACCACCACCACTAGTCGACCTCG-3′ (Gly-(His)6). For all oligonucleotides, mutated sequences are indicated in bold. The BamHI-SalI fragment was then ligated into BamHI-XhoI-restricted pT2Cb3/HIV-1 to generate the expression plasmid. All constructs were sequenced through the protease gene to confirm the mutations. Constructs expressing tethered heterodimers were made using Kunkel mutagenesis, in two parallel mutagenesis steps: (i) the stop codon at the 3′ end of the HIV PR gene was replaced with a sequence encoding three glycines using the oligonucleotide 5′-GTACTTTAAATTTCGGAGGAGGGGCCCGGTACC-3′; this sequence also introduces an ApaI site (underlined); and (ii) the start codon at the 5′ end of (His)6-tagged variants was replaced with a sequence also encoding an ApaI site using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGGTAGCCGGGCCCCAAATCACCTTG-3′. Two separate double restriction digests were then performed: (i)BamHI-ApaI digestion of the first construct containing wt HIV PR yielded a fragment encoding CheY-HIV PR; and (ii)ApaI-XhoI digestion of the second construct yielded a fragment encoding the (His)6-tagged variant. A triple ligation was then performed, which joined the 3′ end of the CheY-HIV PR fragment to the 5′ end of the (His)6 variant fragment via the cohesive ApaI ends to make the tethered construct. This fragment was ligated into pT2Cb3 for expression in the same manner as nontethered HIV PR. The clone pT2Cb3/wt&KWW-His6, used for coexpressing wt HIV PR along with a C-terminally His-tagged KWW variant in E. coli, was constructed using a three-fragment ligation. Gene fragments encoding the two protease genes were synthesized in two separate PCR reactions. Wt HIV PR was synthesized using a pT2Cb3/HIV-1 wt template with the primers 5′-GAAAACAATTCGTGCGGATGG-3′ and 5′-GGGCATGCAACCTCCTATTAGAAATTTAAAGTACAACCAAT-3′; HIV PR KWW-His6 was synthesized using pBS/KWW-His6 as a template in a PCR reaction with the primer 5′-TAATAGGAGGTTGCATGCCCCAAATCACCTTGTGGAAG-3′ and a primer designed to anneal to the upstream T7 promoter. PCR fragments were digested with either KpnI (HIV PR wt fragment) orSalI (HIV PR KWW fragment) and SphI (encoded by primers, shown underlined). They were then ligated into aKpnI-SalI-digested pT2Cb3 vector using T4 DNA ligase. Positive clones were identified using the SphI site and confirmed by sequencing. Clones for coexpressing D25K-His6 or WW-His6 along with wt HIV PR were constructed with the same primers and appropriate templates. Untagged wt HIV PR was expressed inE. coli (X90 strain; see Ref. 15.Rosé J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11939-11945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified using pepstatin affinity chromatography as described (13.Rosé J.R. Babé L.M. Craik C.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Mora P.T. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). (His)3-tagged wt HIV PR was purified using nickel chelate chromatography. Clarified cell lysates containing (His)3-tagged wt HIV PR were adsorbed to a cellulose phosphate (Whatman, Fairfield, NJ) column (2.5 × 6 cm) in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing protease were pooled and applied to a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) column (0.25 × 5 cm). The resin was thoroughly washed and the (His)3-tagged protein was eluted with a 0–300 mm imidazole gradient. Wt and inactive single-chain (His)6-tagged variants were expressed and purified in the same manner but eluted with a 0–350 mm imidazole gradient. (His)3-tagged, defective HIV PR variants were expressed in insoluble inclusion bodies and purified by solubilizing the inclusion bodies in 10 ml of 8 m deionized urea. The solubilized inclusion bodies were clarified by centrifugation and then applied to a G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) size exclusion column (2.5 × 120 cm) equilibrated in 8 m urea and eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions containing protease were identified by immunoblot analysis, pooled, applied to a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (0.25 × 5 cm), and eluted with a 0–300 mm imidazole gradient in 8 m urea. HIV PR nontethered dimers were co-expressed in E. coli. Clarified lysates were adsorbed to cellulose phosphate resin as described above. Protease was eluted using 1 m NaCl and then passed through a pepstatin column to remove HIV PR wt dimers (17.Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Mora P.T. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The unbound fraction from the pepstatin column was retained and applied to Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (0.75 × 2.3 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES, pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The resin was washed, and the protein was eluted with 600 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions were analyzed using immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody to HIV PR (Covance, Richmond, CA) after separation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel run with a Tricene buffer system (18.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Purified defective monomers were mixed with wt HIV PR in 8 m urea and refolded by 10 × dilution in 50 mm NaOAc (pH 5.5). This procedure has been shown to restore enzymatic activity to denatured preparations of HIV-1 PR (19.Tomasselli A.G. Olsen M.K. Hui J.O. Staples D.J. Sawyer T.K. Heinrikson R.L. Tomich C.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Refolded heterodimers containing a (His)3-tagged monomer were separated from refolded wt protease by nickel chelate chromatography (0.25 × 5 cm). Elution fractions were separated on a 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using a Tris-glycine buffer system (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described above. Heterodimer formation was confirmed by the appearance of two bands: one corresponding to (His)3-tagged variant and the other to untagged, wt protease. Fractions containing heterodimers were pooled and concentrated to ∼40 μmusing Amicon-10 spin columns (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Heterodimer stock solutions were frozen and thawed repeatedly with no decrease in protein concentration from precipitation. Purified fractions of defective monomers were concentrated in 8 m urea using Amicon-10 spin columns as described above. To 100 μl 8 m urea solutions containing 1.5 μm wt HIV PR were added varying amounts of defective monomers. Dimers were then refolded as described above. The activity of wt HIV PR in the resulting 1-ml solution was measured by the rate of cleavage of the synthetic substrate Arg-Val-Nle-Phe(NO2)-Glu-Ala-Nle-Ser-NH2(AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA) in HIV PR assay buffer (50 mmNaOAc (pH 5.5), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), as described (21.Salto R. Babé L.M. Li J. Rosé J.R., Yu, Z. Burlingame A. De Voss J.J. Sui Z. Ortiz de Montellano P. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10691-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activity measurements were performed in duplicate; 0.5 ml of the 1 ml refolded solution was assayed after the addition of 0.5 ml of 2 × assay buffer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were collected on a Sciex (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) model API-III mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode. The desalted (His)3-tagged wt HIV PR sample in water was infused into the mass spectrometer via a Harvard model 22 syringe pump. The ion spray needle was kept at 5300 V, and the orifice potential was held at 80 V. The mass range of m/z 2000–15000, containing selected charged states of the molecular ion, was scanned repetitively with a step size of 0.2 Da, a dwell time of 1.5 ms, and a total scan time of 4.0 s. The combined data from several charge states were used to calculate the average molecular mass. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed on a Microcal MC-2 differential scanning calorimeter. Wt HIV PR and single-chain tethered variants were concentrated using Amicon-10 concentrators, and the buffer was exchanged extensively to remove all traces of imidazole. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were carried out in MES Buffer A (50 mm MES (pH 6.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) or MES Buffer B (50 mm MES (pH 6.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol). The final concentration of all HIV PR solutions was between 1.0 and 1.5 mg/ml. Wt HIV PR, the single-chain wt PR, and the three tethered heterodimers were heated to 95 °C at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. The observed thermal denaturation profiles, excess heat capacity versus temperature, were superimposed without baseline correction using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). For all protease variants, a bicistronic expression system was used in which the first 293 nucleotides of the efficiently translated CheY gene were inserted upstream of the HIV PR gene to improve translation levels (14.Sigal E. Grunberger D. Highland E. Gross C. Dixon R.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system does not rely on the use of a fusion protein to overcome the poor translational efficiency of the protease gene and thus eliminates the requirement for post-translational processing. In general, synthesis of the protease diminished ∼2 h after induction, concurrent with a dramatic decrease in cell viability. Protease yields were typically between 1 and 3 mg/l of growth media. Postinduction times were lengthened for expression of defective variants of HIV PR and the inactive tethered heterodimers. Cells expressing these inactive HIV PR constructs did not show a similar, rapid decrease in cell viability (data not shown). The introduction of a second, defective HIV PR gene downstream of the wt HIV PR gene resulted in the co-expression of approximately equal amounts of wt and defective variants as determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Strategies used to purify the D25K, WW, and KWW variants under nondenaturing conditions, with or without a C-terminal (His)3 tag, were unsuccessful. All three of these variants were relatively insoluble and precipitated after bacterial cell lysis. The majority of expressed protein was found in insoluble inclusion bodies. Because the binding of poly-l-histidine to nickel is unaffected by denaturants, inclusion bodies containing the His-tagged variant monomers were resolubilized in 8 m urea and purified to homogeneity by nickel chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions. To ensure that the histidine tag was not cleaved during expression or purification, the purified Gly-(His)3-tagged wt HIV PR was analyzed by mass spectrometry. An HIV PR monomer containing a Gly-(His)3C-terminal extension showed the expected molecular mass (measured molecular mass, 11,257.4 ± 1.1 Da; expected molecular mass, 11,257 Da), indicating that the histidine tag was not cleaved. Wt HIV PR was assayed with all the aforementioned modifications as well as in all relevant buffer systems to ensure that the protein being studied was catalytically competent. Neither poly-l-histidine tags nor a three-glycine tether linking two wt monomers reduced the solubility or activity of wt HIV PR in HIV PR assay buffer. All wt HIV PR variants were active in MES Buffer A. Under the same conditions, the single-chain wt PR retained proteolytic activity in both MES Buffers A and B, suggesting that the protease is well folded under all conditions studied here. Repeated attempts were made to crystallize tethered wt/KWW heterodimers using crystal conditions reported previously (22.Rutenber E. Fauman E.B. Keenan R.J. Fong S. Furth P.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Meng E. Kuntz I.D. DeCamp D.L. Salto R. Rosé J.R. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15343-15346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Rose R.B. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2607-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), as well as using the Hampton screening kit (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). None of the conditions yielded crystals, most likely because the heterodimers could not be concentrated at >1 mg/ml protein. Varying amounts of (His)3-tagged D25K, WW, and KWW variants were refolded in the presence of a fixed amount of untagged wt HIV PR. Inhibition profiles of all three variants demonstrated a similar dose dependence (Fig. 3). At equimolar ratios of wt and defective variant, wt HIV PR activity was reduced by ∼50%. When the molar ratio of variant monomer to wt was >3:1, proteolytic activity became undetectable. Heterodimers were isolated after either refolding from urea or coexpression in E. coli. After refolding, histidine-tagged heterodimers were isolated using nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. Heterodimer formation was confirmed by the appearance of two bands on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel that corresponded to the molecular masses of an unmodified HIV PR monomer (wt) and a (His)3-tagged monomer (defective variant). These refolding experiments were performed under conditions in which either the wt HIV PR or the (His)3-tagged variant HIV PR was in excess. In both cases the two monomer bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were of equal intensity, indicating that equimolar amounts of wt HIV PR and defective variant were bound to the nickel resin (Fig.4 A). No proteolytic activity was detected in purified heterodimer samples. Controls with untagged wt HIV PR were applied to the Ni-affinity resin; however, nonspecific binding was not detected. Clarified lysates of E. coli coexpressing wt and variant HIV PR contained approximately equal amounts of each species based on immunoblot analysis (data not shown). All species bound to and eluted from cellulose phosphate in a manner similar to wt HIV PR. Material eluted from cellulose phosphate was mixed with pepstatin affinity resin. In every case, wt HIV PR was present and bound to the affinity resin. No histidine-tagged variants were observed to bind to the pepstatin affinity resin. The fraction of protein that did not bind to pepstatin was further purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography. Immunoblot analysis showed that the two species elute from the Ni resin in an ∼1:1 ratio for all analyzed heterodimers (Fig. 4 B). Wt HIV PR, when expressed alone, does not significantly bind to the Ni affinity resin. One measure of protein stability is the temperature at which it is half-denatured (T m). All calorimetry studies (except those otherwise marked) were conducted using tethered dimers of HIV PR. Tethered dimers were studied to ensure homogeneity within each sample as well as to eliminate the concentration dependence of thermal stability for dimers (24.Neet K.E. Timm D.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The T mvalues of untethered and tethered wt HIV PR in MES Buffer A were determined to compare the effect of the three-glycine tether covalently linking the two monomers. In MES Buffer A, untethered wt HIV PR melts with a single transition at 52.5 °C, compared with 64.5 °C for tethered wt HIV PR (Fig. 5). The shapes of these two denaturation curves both indicate a single transition. The shape of the tethered wt denaturation curve is sharper than untethered wt, which is typical for proteins with higher T mvalues and higher enthalpies of unfolding. In Buffer A, the tethered heterodimers were soluble only to a concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml, which is below the detection level of the instrument. Attaining sufficient concentration for differential scanning calorimetry experiments required the addition of the cosolvents glycerol and ethylene glycol. The tethered heterodimers were stabilized in MES Buffer B, allowing them to be concentrated up to 1.3 mg/ml. The transition for tethered wt HIV PR in the presence of glycerol and ethylene glycol increased by 7.7 °C to 72.2 °C. All three tethered heterodimers of HIV PR denatured at higher temperatures than tethered wt HIV PR in MES Buffer B.T"

Its reactivity with apoE variants resembles that of the LDLR: it binds well with apoE3 and poorly with apoE2. The heavy chain complementarity-determining region (CDRH) 2 of 2E8 shows homology to the ligand-binding domain of the LDLR. To define better the structural basis of the 2E8/apoE interaction and particularly the role of electrostatic interactions, we generated and characterized a panel of 2E8 variants. Replacement of acidic residues in the 2E8 CDRHs showed that Asp52, Glu53, and Asp56 are essential for high-affinity binding. Although Asp31 (CDRH1), Glu58 (CDRH2), and Asp97 (CDRH3) did not appear to be critical, the Asp97 → Ala variant acquired reactivity with apoE2. A Thr57 → Glu substitution increased affinity for both apoE3 and apoE2. The affinities of wild-type 2E8 and variants for apoE varied inversely with ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic forces contribute to both antigen binding and isoform specificity. We propose a model of the 2E8·apoE immune complex that is based on the 2E8 and apoE crystal structures and that is consistent with the apoE-binding properties of wild-type 2E8 and its variants.

As a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)1 and for other members of the LDLR family, it plays an important role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. ApoE exists as three common isoforms: apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. The most common isoform, apoE3, has cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158, respectively, whereas apoE2 has cysteine and apoE4 has arginine at both positions. ApoE2 binds poorly to the LDLR, and homozygous inheritance of the apoE2 allele is strongly associated with type III dyslipoproteinemia (1.Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that positively charged amino acids at positions 136–150 of apoE interact directly with the LDLR (2.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LDLR-binding site is in the 22-kDa amino-terminal domain, and the strongest lipid-binding region is in the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain. In a lipid-free form, the 22-kDa amino-terminal domain is folded into an elongated four-helix bundle; basic residues that have been implicated in LDLR binding are situated on helix 4, where they form a region with strong electropositive potential (3.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Arg158 does not participate directly in apoE-mediated binding to the LDLR, but its replacement by a cysteine in apoE2 causes the rearrangement of intramolecular salt bridges within the LDLR-binding site, altering the alignment of the positively charged residues of apoE that interact with the LDLR (4.Dong L.-M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S.D. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The LDLR, an integral membrane protein composed of 831 amino acids, mediates the uptake of lipoproteins through its ability to bind to apoE and apoB. The amino terminus of the LDLR contains the ligand-binding domain that is composed of seven imperfect repeats of 40 amino acids. Each repeat includes six conserved cysteine residues and a cluster of acidic residues near its carboxyl terminus. Although the dual specificity of the LDLR appears to result from homology between the LDLR-binding sites of apoE and apoB (5.Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the individual cysteine-rich repeats may participate differentially in apoE- and apoB-mediated binding (6.Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of cysteine-rich repeats 1 and 2 (7.Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.T. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10994-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of repeat 5 have been determined (8.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Repeat 5 forms a folded calcium cage, and the side chains of many of the conserved aspartic and glutamic acid residues are involved in coordinating the divalent ion. Previously, these acidic residues were thought to be available for ionic interactions with the basic residues in the receptor-binding sites of apoE and apoB; however, these new structural observations have necessitated a reassessment of the existing models for the binding of the LDLR to its ligands (9.Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).2E8 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to apoE and prevents apoE-mediated binding of lipoproteins to the LDLR. The epitope recognized by 2E8 corresponds to the LDLR-binding site on human apoE (10.Raffaı̈ R. Maurice R. Weisgraber K. Innerarity T. Wang X. MacKenzie R. Hirama T. Watson D. Rassart E. Milne R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1905-1918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the LDLR, 2E8 binds well with apoE3 and poorly with apoE2. Antibodies recognize chemical structures by presenting physical surfaces complementary to those of the antigen (11.Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The antigen-binding site, or paratope of an antibody, is composed mainly of amino acids residing within the three heavy and light chain complementarity-determining regions (12.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar), which exist as looped structures extending from the surface of the folded variable domains (13.Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). van der Waals, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions provide the binding energy that is required to form the immune complex. Electrostatic forces participate in the initial attraction of grossly compatible structures of oppositely charged surfaces. The subsequent burial of hydrophobic residues within the interface contributes most of the binding energy (14.Novotny J. Sharp K. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Because the 2E8 epitope possesses arginines and lysines, electrostatic interactions may be a major determinant of the affinity and specificity of the antibody for apoE.In addition to the striking similarities in the binding specificities of 2E8 and the LDLR, CDRH2 of 2E8 also contains elements of sequence homology to the ligand-binding domain of the LDLR. We have proposed that 2E8 is an antibody mimetic of the LDLR (10.Raffaı̈ R. Maurice R. Weisgraber K. Innerarity T. Wang X. MacKenzie R. Hirama T. Watson D. Rassart E. Milne R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1905-1918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could potentially serve as a surrogate for this receptor in studies designed to elucidate the structural basis for the interaction between apoE and the LDLR. Although detailed structural information on the intact ligand-binding domain of the LDLR is not yet available, the crystal structure of the 2E8 Fab fragment has recently been solved (16.Trakhanov S. Parkin S. Raffaı̈ R. Milne R. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To investigate further the interaction of 2E8 with apoE, which may provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for the binding of apoE to the LDLR, we characterized the antigen-binding properties of a number of 2E8 variants that were generated by in vitro mutagenesis. We propose a model of the 2E8·apoE immune complex that is consistent with the tertiary structures of the 2E8 paratope and its epitope on apoE and with the apoE-binding characteristics of the 2E8 variants.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the acidic residues Asp52, Glu53, and Asp56 within CDRH2 of 2E8 are critical for high-affinity binding to apoE. The replacement of these residues resulted in a severe loss of apoE-binding activity, suggesting that formal negative charges are required at these positions for high-affinity binding. This study also demonstrates an inverse relationship between ionic strength and the binding of 2E8 to apoE, which suggests that electrostatic interactions are important in the formation of the 2E8·apoE immune complex.Although Asp97 does not appear to be essential for the binding of 2E8 to apoE, 2E8(Asp97 → Ala) showed a loss of apoE isoform specificity. As measured by SPR under conditions of physiological ionic strength, the variant had similar affinity constants for apoE3 and apoE2. As measured by ELISA, however, the substitution exerted its full effect on isoform specificity only under conditions of reduced ionic strength. The loss of isoform specificity primarily reflected increased reactivity with apoE2 rather than decreased reactivity with apoE3. Asp97 therefore appears to dictate the apoE isoform specificity of WT 2E8. In the crystal structure of the 2E8 Fab fragment, the side chain of Asp97lies on the periphery of the paratope (16.Trakhanov S. Parkin S. Raffaı̈ R. Milne R. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Replacement of Asp97 with alanine may create a cavity that can accommodate apoE side chains. Our model of the 2E8·apoE immune complex (described below) suggests that this apoE mass could originate from the side chain of apoE2 Arg103. Introduction of a glutamic acid residue at position 57 of 2E8 CDRH2 results in a variant that has a small increase in affinity for apoE3 and a large increase in affinity for apoE2, resulting in similar equilibrium affinity constants for apoE3 and apoE2. We suggest that Glu57 forms a stabilizing ionic or hydrogen bond with Lys146 of apoE.We previously reported that 2E8 and the LDLR have similar binding specificities for apoE isoforms (10.Raffaı̈ R.

Substitution of neutral residues for basic residues within the apoE LDLR-binding site at positions 143, 145, 150, and 158 resulted in variants that bound defectively to both the LDLR (19.Lalazar A. Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Giladi H. Innerarity T.L. Levanon A.Z. Boyles J.K. Amit B. Gorecki M. Mahley R.W. Vogel T. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1905-1918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, introduction of proline residues at positions 144 and 152 in apoE, which would be predicted to disrupt the secondary structure, prevented apoE from interacting with the LDLR and 2E8. We show here that a Lys146 → Glu (but not a Lys146 → Gln) substitution in apoE abolishes binding to 2E8. Finally, introduction of a positive charge at position 158 of apoE2 through cysteamine modification, known to restore LDLR-binding ability, restored the binding of apoE2 to the antibody. However, the LDLR and 2E8 react differently with apoE2(Asp154 → Ala). The replacement of Asp154 by Ala in apoE2 restored LDLR-binding activity to 80% of that of apoE3 (4.Dong L.-M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S.D. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This variant does not react with 2E8, even after cysteamine treatment, suggesting that Asp154 is a critical residue in the 2E8 epitope, consistent with our model. The structural basis for the apoE isoform specificity of 2E8 could nevertheless be the same as that for the LDLR, although we cannot exclude the direct participation of Arg158 in the 2E8 epitope, which is not the case for the LDLR. Although residues 136–150 on helix 4 of apoE clearly have a major role in the binding of apoE to the LDLR and 2E8, other residues may also contribute to binding. For example, our model of the 2E8·apoE3 immune complex suggests that Arg103 on helix 3 of apoE participates in the interaction.The overall architecture of the 2E8 paratope consists of a relatively flat surface composed primarily of CDRHs coupled with an asymmetric distribution of surface-accessible electrostatic charge (Fig.7). Within the portion of the paratope defined by CDRHs, a depression can be observed between the second half of CDRH2, which forms the outer rim of the paratope, and the crest of elongated CDRH3. The bottom of the depression is lined jointly by CDRH1 and the first half of the CDRH2 loop. As shown in Fig. 7, there is a striking complementarity in terms of electrostatic surfaces between the 2E8 epitope on apoE and the region of the 2E8 paratope that is contributed by CDRHs.From the tertiary structures of 2E8 and apoE and the functional analysis described here, we developed a model of the 2E8·apoE3 immune complex, which was submitted to energy minimization analysis (Fig.8). We propose that the 2E8 paratope is composed primarily of CDRHs and would recognize a discontinuous epitope on apoE that includes residues from the hydrophilic surfaces of helices 3 and 4 (Fig. 9). Most of the contact residues on apoE would be situated between residues 140 and 154 on helix 4. Both apoE helices, which are unusually elongated (3.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), adopt general curvatures that complement the positive and negative depressions formed by the 2E8 paratope (Fig. 8). Helix 4, which contains the basic residues required for high-affinity binding, loops within the depression of the 2E8 paratope. Furthermore, the convex curvature of helix 3 conforms well to the elevated portion of 2E8 formed conjointly by CDRH3 and CDRL3.Figure 8General shape complementary of the putative 2E8·apoE immune complex. The general curvatures of apoE3 helices 3 and 4 are superimposed on the 2E8 paratope. Helix 4, which contains the basic amino acids required for high-affinity binding to both the LDLR and mAb 2E8, loops within the groove formed by the outer portion of CDRH2 and the crests of CDRL3 and CDRH3. The concave structure of helix 3 loops above the crest formed by CDRL3 and CDRH3. In this arrangement, regions of highest acidic potential in the 2E8 paratope overlap with the region of highest basic potential in the LDLR-binding site of apoE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Predicted electrostatic interactions in the models of the 2E8·apoE3 (upper panel) and 2E8·apoE2 (lower panel) immune complexes.

Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). In the 2E8·apoE immune complex, apoE Arg150 would lie close to the 2E8 acidic pit. It would likely participate in favorable salt bridges or hydrogen bonds with the formally charged oxygen atoms of Asp52 and Glu53 or with the adjacent hydroxyl groups of residues such as Tyr33 and the backbone carbonyl of Lys30. A salt bridge or hydrogen bond at the center of the protein-protein complex, an environment with a low dielectric constant, would be expected to have a high energetic value and, in addition, would permit the burial of some 80 Å2 of apoE surface per arginine from solvent (23.Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This scenario would be consistent with the observed importance of Asp52 and Glu53 and apoE Arg150 in the antibody/antigen interaction. In the model, the side chains of Lys30 and Glu53 of the 2E8 heavy chain both contribute to stabilizing hydrogen bonds with apoE Asp154. The energetic importance of Asp56 could be explained by the formation of a hydrogen bond between its side chain carboxylate and the main chain carbonyl group of apoE Lys146.According to our model, the formation of a salt bridge between Asp154 and Arg150 in apoE2 (Fig. 5) would effectively abolish three important interactions (Fig. 9). First, the burial of Arg150 within the 2E8 acidic pit would be hindered, with the concomitant loss of both a high-energy electrostatic bond in an area of low dielectric constant and favorable van der Waals interactions due to the large acyl side chain. Second, potential electrostatic bonds between Asp154 of apoE and Lys30 and Glu53 of the 2E8 heavy chain would be lost. The importance of Arg150 and Asp154 in the 2E8 epitope is apparent from the defective reactivity of apoE3(Arg150 → Ala) and apoE2(Asp154 → Ala). Introduction of a positive charge at residue 158 in apoE2 by cysteamine treatment would presumably reposition Arg150, Asp154, and Arg103, allowing the 2E8 epitope to be restored. Although repositioned by energy minimization in our model, before computer docking, the side chain of Arg103 in apoE2 would severely clash with the WT 2E8 paratope, but not with that of the CDRH3(Asp97 → Ala) variant, which would presumably accommodate the extra apoE mass due to the loss of the bulky carboxylate group (Fig. 9). As with CDRH2 Glu58, the energy needed to physically distort the apoE and 2E8 side chains may outweigh the contributions of electrostatic bonds between these residues as predicted by the minimized complex.Interestingly, through computer-assisted measurements and energy minimization of the 2E8·apoE3 immune complex, all of these experimentally derived intermolecular electrostatic interactions have been predicted to occur simultaneously, with minimal steric clashes and no changes to the main chain conformation of the two molecules (TableIII). However, after energy minimization of the 2E8·apoE2 complex, the side chain of Arg150 was accommodated by distortion of the main chain conformation of CDRH2 Ile54, which widened the CDRH2 loop by 1.5 Å, allowing for the formation of electrostatic bonds with the carboxylate group of CDRH2 Asp52. The side chain of Arg103 was accommodated by the displacement of both this side chain and CDRH3 Asp97 in opposite directions, resulting in the concomitant formation of electrostatic interactions between the two residues. Evaluation of the intermolecular contact energies of the computer-docked complexes revealed large electrostatic contributions in both cases. Thus, a more severe intramolecular remodeling of both reactants, in addition to the loss of a few intermolecular electrostatic bonds, may well explain the lower binding affinities of apoE2 for the 2E8 antibody.Table IIIComputer-determined electrostatic interactions of the modeled 2E8 · apoE3 immune complex and accompanying intermolecular distances2E8 rFab (heavy chain)ApoE3 intermolecular distanceApoE2 intermolecular distanceÅFRH1aFRH1, heavy chain famework region 1.

Open table in a new tab The finding that charged residues in both apoE and 2E8 are critical for binding suggests the involvement of electrostatic interactions and charge neutralization. Although it had been previously thought that a similar mechanism was responsible for the interaction of apoE with the LDLR, Fass et al. (8.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) have questioned this concept. In the crystal structure of cysteine-rich repeat 5, the side chains of many of the conserved acidic residues in the repeat that were thought to interact with basic residues in ligands of the LDLR are buried and participate in the coordination of a calcium ion. Fass et al. (8.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) also proposed that a hydrophobic concave surface of the cysteine-rich repeat provides a lipoprotein-binding surface. Alternatively, it has been suggested that other acidic residues within the cysteine-rich repeats, which are not implicated in the coordination of calcium, could be implicated in the interaction with ligands or that the conformation of individual repeats could be altered in the context of other repeats (9.Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that, under specific conditions (e.g. in the presence of ligand or lipoprotein surface lipid), the individual repeats could be amenable to conformational changes that could lead to the loss of tertiary structure among multiple repeats, revealing cryptic acidic residues. It may also be possible that the remaining exposed acidic side chains in conjunction with main chain carbonyl oxygens create a suitable electrostatic surface for apoE recognition. Although the exact mode of interaction of the LDLR and 2E8 with apoE need not be identical, the two molecules do recognize overlapping sites on apoE and show a remarkable similarity in their respective fine specificities. Given the importance of charge neutralization in the binding of apoE to 2E8, it would be surprising if this were not also the case for the interaction of apoE with the LDLR. ApoE, a 34-kDa protein composed of 299 amino acids, is an important functional component of chylomicrons and very low, intermediate, and high density lipoproteins. As a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)1 and for other members of the LDLR family, it plays an important role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. ApoE exists as three common isoforms: apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. The most common isoform, apoE3, has cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158, respectively, whereas apoE2 has cysteine and apoE4 has arginine at both positions. ApoE2 binds poorly to the LDLR, and homozygous inheritance of the apoE2 allele is strongly associated with type III dyslipoproteinemia (1.Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that positively charged amino acids at positions 136–150 of apoE interact directly with the LDLR (2.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LDLR-binding site is in the 22-kDa amino-terminal domain, and the strongest lipid-binding region is in the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain. In a lipid-free form, the 22-kDa amino-terminal domain is folded into an elongated four-helix bundle; basic residues that have been implicated in LDLR binding are situated on helix 4, where they form a region with strong electropositive potential (3.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Arg158 does not participate directly in apoE-mediated binding to the LDLR, but its replacement by a cysteine in apoE2 causes the rearrangement of intramolecular salt bridges within the LDLR-binding site, altering the alignment of the positively charged residues of apoE that interact with the LDLR (4.Dong L.-M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S.D. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The LDLR, an integral membrane protein composed of 831 amino acids, mediates the uptake of lipoproteins through its ability to bind to apoE and apoB. The amino terminus of the LDLR contains the ligand-binding domain that is composed of seven imperfect repeats of 40 amino acids. Each repeat includes six conserved cysteine residues and a cluster of acidic residues near its carboxyl terminus. Although the dual specificity of the LDLR appears to result from homology between the LDLR-binding sites of apoE and apoB (5.Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the individual cysteine-rich repeats may participate differentially in apoE- and apoB-mediated binding (6.Russell D.W.

The mechanisms underlying the regulation of EGFR expression have not been defined completely, but transcriptional control appears to play a major role in this regulation. The PC12 cell line is a clone derived from a pheochromocytoma tumor of the rat adrenal medulla which has become the premier model for the study of the action of nerve growth factor (NGF) (12.Togari A.

These cells stop dividing and differentiate morphologically and biochemically into sympathetic neuron-like cells when treated with NGF. Before treatment, PC12 cells express plasma membrane receptors for EGF, which is a mild mitogen for them (14.Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15.Chandler C.E. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, PC12 cells display receptors for both NGF, which stops them from dividing (14.Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J.

Recent advances in the understanding of the signaling pathways activated by NGF receptors make PC12 cells a useful model for the study of cross-regulation among differentiating agents, such as NGF, and mitogens, such as EGF, during neuronal differentiation. To study the molecular mechanisms of the down-regulation of the EGFR during the differentiation of PC12 cells, a rat cell line, it seemed reasonable to clone the promoter region of the rat EGFR from a rat P1 library. In this study, 2.7 kbp of the promoter region of the rat EGFR have been characterized. Six transcriptional start sites have been identified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and primer extension. We have characterized the receptor gene promoter by deletion and mutation analysis using an in vivo transfection assay. Finally, we have identified TCC repeat sequences of the promoter region that are at least partially responsible for the down-regulation of the EGFR by NGF during the differentiation of PC12 cells. Mouse NGF and rat type I collagen were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). LipofectAMINE was a product of Life Technologies, Inc. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 100 units of penicillin/ml. For NGF treatment, 100 ng of NGF/ml was added to the culture medium every other day. African green monkey kidney cells (CV-1) or C6 glioma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 100 units of penicillin/ml. In all experiments, cells were cultured on collagen. Collagen coating of culture dishes and flasks was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (5 μg/cm2). To clone the rat EGFR 5′-flanking region, the following two primers were used: 5′-GGACCGCCACCAAGACAGGC-3′, which spanned nucleotides 1–20 of rat EGFR cDNA sequence, and 5′-ATCCCGGCTCGGCAGTCGTTGG-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 134–155 of the cDNA sequence (19.Boorstein W.R. Craig E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The PCR product amplified from rat genomic DNA using the above two primers was sequenced. The primers were then used in a PCR screen to identify bacteriophage P1 clones encoding the rat EGFR 5′-flanking region (custom service provided by Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The PCR profile involved denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s, with a final concentration of Mg2+ of 1 mm. One P1 clone named GS17714 encoding the rat EGFR gene was obtained using PCR screening. Two DNA restriction fragments, named pBS1 and pBS2 (see Fig.1), derived from the GS17714 clone, were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) for restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA with a random labeled probe spanning nucleotides 1–155 of rat EGFR cDNA sequence was performed as described (18.Petch L.A. Harris J. Raymond V.W. Blasband A.J. Lee D.C. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The clones were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated DNA sequencer. Sequence comparison was carried out using the Blast and Bestfit programs from Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). Primer extension was carried out as described previously (19.Boorstein W.R. Craig E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). An antisense nucleotide (5′-AGCAGTAGCTTGGTTCTCGCAG-3′) complementary to nucleotides 170–191 of the rat EGFR cDNA sequence was radiolabeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiolabeled primer (15 ng) was added to 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from either PC12 or C6 cells in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 0.4m NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA) at 95 °C for 10 min. Hybridization between the mRNA and the labeled oligonucleotide was accomplished for 16 h at 42 °C. Reverse transcription was initiated by adding 30 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) to the mRNA/oligonucleotide mixture in 20 μl of a mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 mmspermidine, and the reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The extension products were dissolved in a denaturing dye solution and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The size was determined by comparison with a DNA sequencing ladder. Standards for sizing primer extension products were generated from the control sequence of the Sequenase version 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). These were synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions with [γ-32P]ATP using single-stranded M13mp18 DNA and the −40 primer provided. 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA (rat kidney) was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Rat EGFR-specific primers regfr1325A (5′-GCCGACAACCGCCAGAGAAAACTGACC-3′, 1453–1479 nucleotides in the reported sequence) was selected using the Prime program from Genetics Computer Group. PCR parameters were 94 °C for 30 s, 94 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 5 cycles 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 3 min for 5 cycles, 94 °C for 5 s, and 68 °C for 3 min for 25 cycles. Major bands of about 1.4–1.6 kbp were obtained after amplification, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen). 30 recombinant clones were picked for subsequent sequencing analysis. To analyze the active promoter region of the rat EGFR gene, a series of reporter plasmid constructs was made using pBS1, pBS2, and the backbone of the pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega). Two subclones were obtained: pRE318 contained a 317-bp BamHI/SfaNI DNA fragment (−318 to −2) from pBS1 inserted at the HindIII vector site after ligation with the HindIII linker; pER1102 contained a 1101-bp fragment (−1102 to −2) and was obtained from the rat EGFR promoter fragment that was cut from pBS2 with NheI and then fused into pER317, which was also digested withNheI. More than 12 serial constructs using pER318 and pER1102 as a starting template with different deletions were obtained for promoter activity analysis. Deletions were made using unique restriction endonuclease sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Plasmid DNAs were prepared from these constructs using Maxi-prep kits (Qiagen) and quantitated by UV spectroscopy. A second plasmid pRL-TK (Promega), containing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the thymidine kinase promoter, was prepared in a similar way and used as an internal control. Chimeric pRL-TK-Luc reporter plasmid was constructed by cloning a HSV-TK promoter fragment from pRL-TK into the BglII andHindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. Heterologous promoter constructs of the rat EGFR promoter region (−318 to −260) were prepared by cloning different annealed oligonucleotides containing deletion or mutant TCC repeat sequences into pRL-TK-Luc at theNheI and XhoI sites. Plasmid DNAs from the clones were purified, and the presence of mutations within the −318/−260 element was confirmed by sequencing. PC12 cells cultured on collagen-coated six-well plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were transfected using LipofectAMINE with 1 μg of the pER plasmid and 0.1 μg of the internal control pRL-TK (Promega), which contains Renillaluciferase downstream of the HSV-TK promoter. After NGF treatment (100 ng/ml) for 5 days, cells were transfected for 3 h. 9 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega), and both firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were measured in an LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). The transfection efficiency was normalized according to the Renilla luciferase activity. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. For rat EGFR promoter basal activity analysis, C6 and CV-1 cells were also transfected in the same way. Nuclear protein extracts from PC12 cells were prepared according to Katagiri et al. (20.Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A duplex probe corresponding to the rat EGFR promoter sequence −318 to −260 was end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP, T4 kinase, and forward reaction buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by incubation for 25 min at 37 °C. Binding reaction mixtures, which were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min, contained 10 μg of crude nuclear extracts in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and, for competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (at 50-fold excess). Different annealed oligonucleotides containing deletion or mutant TCC repeat sequences and oligonucleotide sequences for Sp1 and AP2 response element-binding protein were used in the competition assays. Labeled probes (about 25,000 cpm) were added to the mixtures to a final volume of 15 μl and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes and unbound probes were separated by electrophoresis through 4% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. To explore the down-regulation of the rat EGFR by NGF in rat PC12 cells, the promoter region of the rat EGFR gene was isolated from a rat P1 library. One P1 clone encoding the rat EGFR gene was obtained using PCR screening. Restriction fragments derived from the P1 clone GS17714 were subcloned into plasmids (Fig.1). Primer extension was employed to determine the transcription start site of the rat EGFR gene. Six products were seen from −268 to −78 relative to the ATG translation start codon (Fig.2 A). These products were observed in poly(A)+ RNA from both PC12 and rat C6 glioma cells. These data indicate that transcription of the rat EGFR gene is initiated in this region, and the 5′-most start site is located at −268 relative to the translation start site. To map the region of the rat EGFR transcription start sites more precisely, 5′-RACE was performed using 5′-RACE-Ready rat kidney cDNA and a rat EGFR gene-specific primer. Major bands of about 1.4–1.6 kbp were obtained after amplification (Fig.2 B(i), lane 4). Southern blots of the amplified products were hybridized using a rat EGFR-specific internal probe that recognizes a sequence upstream of the 5′-RACE primer (Fig.2 B(ii)). These studies indicated that several rat EGFR-related sequences had been amplified. The products of the 5′-RACE PCR reactions, which resolved into multiple bands of approximately 1.4–1.6 kbp by Southern blot analysis, were subcloned and sequenced. From a total of 30 clones that were obtained form rat kidney cDNA, 24 were found which initiated from the same sites identified by primer extension. At least two RACE clones were identified for each of the start sites mapped by primer extension. Of the remaining six clones, PCR products that initiated from intermediate sites between the proximal and distal transcription start sites were observed. These clones may represent incompletely reverse transcribed sequences and could not be examined by primer extension. A summary of rat EGFR transcript start sites and a comparison with the corresponding human sequences are shown in Fig. 2 C. Screening of a rat genomic P1 library by PCR with a rat EGFR primer that hybridized upstream of the ATG codon according to the published sequence (19.Boorstein W.R. Craig E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) resulted in the isolation of a single clone GS17714 of inserted DNA. Complete sequencing of one BamHI and one PvuII subclone showed nucleotide sequence identity with the 5′-part of the published rat EGFR sequence and one exon-intron boundary, between bp 88 and 89 of the coding region. The exon-intron boundary is shown in Fig. 3. The exon-intron boundary mapped in the rat receptor gene agrees with that reported for the gene for the human EGFR (21.Haley J. Whittle N. Bennett P. Kinchinton D. Ullrich A. Waterfield M. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 375-396PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence upstream of the rat EGFR start sites contains neither a “TATA box” nor a “CAAT box” (Fig. 2 C). Studies of transcription in vitro have shown that the TATA box serves to fix the site at which transcription will start (22.Fromm M. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 457-481PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the rat EGFR gene has numerous transcription initiation sites is not surprising in view of the findings with the gene for the human receptor (21.Haley J. Whittle N. Bennett P. Kinchinton D. Ullrich A. Waterfield M. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 375-396PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence between nucleotides −540 and −1, which contains the putative promoter and the 5′-untranslated region, has a G+C content of 64%; the region further upstream of −540 has a G+C content of only about 45%. Further analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the rat EGFR gene shows that a repeated sequence (TCCTCCTCC) was found at −343, −317, and −298. Similar sequences have been found in the upstream promoter region of the gene for human EGFR (Fig. 2 C) and for chicken and mouse alpha2(I) collagen and appear to occur at sites sensitive to nuclease S1 (23.McKeon C. Schmidt A. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6636-6640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Kadonaga T.J. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar). To determine the features of the promoter region responsible for transcriptional regulation, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the rat EGFR promoter sequence (−1102 to −2 bp), and with promoter constructs with selective deletions, fused upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The promoter activities were then determined by analysis of luciferase expression in the transfected cell extracts. The luciferase activity was normalized with the Renillaactivity in the same cell extracts. Activities of the EGFR promoter deletion constructs are shown in Fig. 4. To determine if other cell types exhibited a similar pattern upon DNA transfection, rat C6 glioma cells, known to express high levels of EGFR, and African green monkey kidney cells (CV-1), which express very low levels of EGFR, were also used (25.Saleh M. Stacker S.A. Wilks A.F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 393-401PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ishii S. Xu Y. Stratton R.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Comparing 5′-deleted constructs (Fig. 4 A), it can be seen that 60% of maximum luciferase expression (pRE318) was retained when the deletion extended to −318. Further deletions to −260 and −181 (pRE260, pRE181) led to drastic reductions in luciferase expression. The results show that the 5′-most region, −1102 to −318, could be removed without substantially altering promoter activity. Thus, the nucleotide sequence between −318 and −2 is essential for basal transcription. Consistent with this, it was observed from the constructs with 3′-deletions (Fig. 4 B) that there is no significant decrease upon deleting −181 to −2 (pRE1102D181). Indeed, the lysates of the cells transfected with pRE1102D260 showed a 50% increase in luciferase expression compared with pRE1102. Further deletion to −318 (pRE1102D318) caused significant decreases in luciferase expression. Thus the major control of the basal transcription of the rat EGFR gene is between −318 and −260, and the first transcription start site −268 is just in this region. To define the regulatory regions further, internal deletions were performed (Fig. 4 C). pER318D260 contained only the sequences from −318 to −260. This 59-bp DNA fragment was expressed at a level that was 25% of the original pRE1102 activity. Two constructs lacking this region (pER1102D318–260, pRE1102D318–181) exhibited markedly reduced promoter activity. These data indicate that the region from −318 to −260 and the transcription start site −268 may be important for maximal promoter function. This result also correlates with the previous result in Fig. 4 B; luciferase expression was reduced drastically when cells were transfected with pRE1102D318. However, as shown in Fig. 4 C, luciferase expression was increased 100% when transfected with pER1102D260–181 or pRE318D260–181 compared with pRE1102 and pRE318, respectively. This suggests that this region (−260 to −181) may not be necessary for rat EGFR transcription. The reason for the increase is not clear, but it may indicate the presence of a negative regulatory element in this region. Different rat EGFR constructs were used in naive PC12 and in cells treated with NGF in order to localize the sequences responsible for NGF-induced decrease in transcription. Inhibition of the rat EGFR promoter (48–74%) was observed in NGF-treated PC12 cells compared with naive cells with the several constructs (Fig.5), although in some lower basal activity constructs such as pRE260, pRE181, pRE1102D318, and pRE1102D318–260, these numbers may not be completely reliable. Most interestingly, after NGF treatment, the normalized rat EGFR promoter activity of nonoverlapping pRE1102D318–181 and pRE318D260 transfectants was decreased 76% and 72%, respectively. These results suggest the presence of at least two and possibly more NGF-responsive sequences in this construct (pRE1102) which are necessary for NGF inhibition. To demonstrate a nuclear protein factor(s) specific for binding to the 59-bp region extending from −318 to −260 in the rat EGFR promoter, nuclear protein-DNA interaction was detected by reduced electrophoretic mobility on a polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 6, A andB, two major complexes (A and B) were formed with nuclear extracts from untreated PC12 cells, but complex A was decreased with nuclear extracts from NGF-treated PC12 cells. The specificity of these complexes for the sequence was shown by a competition experiment in which the signals from both complexes were abolished completely by competition with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe (Fig.6 A, lanes 2 and 6; Fig. 6 B,lane 3). In contrast, the same molar excess of a DNA fragment containing an Sp1 site failed to compete complex A (Fig.6 A, lanes 3 and 7; Fig. 6 B,lane 4), and a DNA fragment containing an AP2 site failed to compete either of the complexes (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4and 8). The specificity of TCC repeat sequences and Sp1 motif for complexes A and B was examined further in the competition assays with unlabeled probe and oligonucleotides that contain the wild type and mutant TCC repeat and Sp1 sequences (Fig. 6 B). The unlabeled Sp1 motif itself competed effectively for complex B (Fig. 6 B,lane 5), whereas the oligonucleotide containing the mutant Sp1 binding consensus failed to compete (Fig. 6 B, lane 7). The unlabeled and single site mutant TCC repeat sequences competed effectively for complex A (Fig. 6 B, lanes 6 and 9–15), whereas the oligonucleotide containing the multiple sites mutant TCC repeat sequences failed to compete (Fig.6 B, lane 8). These results indicate that the 59-bp region contains NGF-responsive elements for transcription factor binding, which are specific for TCC repeat sequences, but neither Sp1 nor AP2. To determine whether TCC repeat sequences are functionally responsible for the down-regulation of the EGFR by NGF, we cloned oligonucleotides containing the 59-bp duplex fragments extending from −318 to −260 bearing wild type, deletion, or mutant elements (for Sp1 and TCC motif) upstream of the HSV-TK-LUC promoter reporter plasmid and transfected into untreated and NGF-treated PC12 cells (Fig. 7). Inhibition of the rat EGFR promoter (67–78%) was observed in NGF-treated PC12 cells compared with control cells with the constructs containing TCC repeat sequences and single site mutant TCC repeat sequences. The inhibition was abolished when using the constructs containing no TCC repeat sequences or multiple sites mutant TCC repeat sequences. These results are consistent with the results from the gel shift assays, indicating that the TCC repeat sequences are required for the inhibition of rat EGFR by NGF in PC12 cells. The rat EGFR gene promoter has been isolated from cloned genomic DNA from a rat P1 library. The rat EGFR gene, like the human EGFR gene, does not contain typical TATA or CAAT boxes, and, also like the human gene, initiation of RNA transcription occurs at multiple sites. The 5′-flanking region of this gene is G+C-rich (64%), has one Sp1 binding site, and three repeats of the sequence TCCTCCTCC. The overall homology of rat EGFR gene promoter with that of human promoter is approximately 62%. The function of the 5′-promoter sequences in the transcription of the receptor has been examined here by the construction of deletion mutants. The variation in DNA uptake between individual DNA preparations and separate transfection experiments was normalized by quantitating the amount of Renilla luciferase DNA taken up by the cells in each transfection. Approximately 60% activity of the 1-kbp 5′-region of the rat EGFR gene promoter was retained by a 317-bp (−318 to −2) fragment. Removal of an additional 58-bp (−318 to −260) region reduced the activity 6-fold, indicating the presence of positive control elements within this region. The sequence from −318 to −260 alone also showed a substantial basal level of activity after transfection and transient assay. However, removal of the other 80 bp (−260 to −181) increased the activity 2-fold, indicating the possibility that negative regulatory elements are located in this region. In the human EGFR gene, the sequence −140 to +80 also serves as a negative element (21.Haley J. Whittle N. Bennett P. Kinchinton D. Ullrich A. Waterfield M. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 375-396PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two TCCTCCTCC motifs and one Sp1-binding element are located between −318 and −260. Primer extension and 5′-RACE analysis indicate that the first and the major transcription initiation site is also located in this region. The best defined eukaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters contain proximal TATA elements that control the transcription start site and distal sequences that bind proteins that regulate transcriptional activity (27.Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Two types of promoters lacking TATA elements have been identified. In one type, an element called the initiator dictates accurate basal transcription from a start site within its sequence (28.Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). The second type of TATA-less promoter is the G+C-ich class found in a number of genes. In contrast to TATA-containing promoters, which accurately initiate at a single site, only a few of these G+C-rich promoters initiate transcription from a single site (29.Jakobovits E.B. Schlokat U. Vannice J.L. Derynck R.G. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5549-5554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Araki E. Shimada F. Uzawa H. Mori M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262 (16191): 16816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas many demonstrate multiple transcription start sites (31.Reynolds G.A. Basu S.K. Osborne T.F. Chin D.J. Gil G.

G+C-rich sequences play a critical role in controlling the expression of various genes, including housekeeping genes and many cellular oncogenes. The differentiation of PC12 cells by NGF involves striking morphological and biological changes including the induction or repression of numerous proteins required for the acquisition of a differentiated phenotype similar to that of a sympathetic neuron (34.Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Immunology. 1991; 165: 119-170Google Scholar). One of the proteins decreased during this differentiation is the EGFR. It is possible that this down-regulation is part of the mechanism by which NGF instructs PC12 cells to stop dividing, because EGF is a mild mitogen for these cells (14.Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that the down-regulation is transcriptional, the detailed mechanism of this down-regulation is not known. Because there are clearly many genes whose transcription is decreased during such differentiation, it is possible that the EGFR can serve as a model with which to understand the mechanism of the down-regulation of key proteins by NGF in PC12 cells. By using a series of deletion and mutation reporter constructs, we have shown that a 59-bp region on the rat EGFR promoter is transcriptionally activated in untreated PC12 cells and is transcriptional inhibited in NGF-treated PC12 cells. There are at least two sites in this region which may mediate the basal promoter activity and NGF action: the TCCTCCTCC motif and the Sp1 binding site. By electrophoretic mobility shift experiments with a single copy of a rat EGFR promoter sequence, bp −318 to −260 was shown to bind nuclear proteins from both untreated and NGF-treated PC12 cells. One of the two complexes that was found to bind specifically to the TCC repeat sequences was decreased after NGF treatment. No difference was found between NGF-treated and untreated PC12 cells using Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides as probe. By reporter assays, the inhibition was abolished when using the constructs containing only Sp1 binding motif, no TCC repeat sequences or completely mutated TCC repeat sequences, respectively. These results indicate that down-regulation of rat EGFR is not caused by Sp1 binding but by altered binding of proteins to the TCCTCCTCC repeat sequences. TCC repeat sequences are required for the down-regulation of rat EGFR by NGF in PC12 cells. The proteins binding to the TCC repeat sequences might be activators, and decreased binding of these unknown proteins may provide a mechanism to diminish rat EGFR promoter activity by preventing its activation. Further experiments are needed to define precisely the transcription factors binding to these sites. In this study, we have found that the TCC repeat sequences of the promoter region appear responsible, at least in part, for the down-regulation of the EGFR by NGF. The more detailed mechanisms responsible for down-regulation of the rat EGFR by NGF in PC12 cells remain to be described. In this regard, experiments are under way to characterize the protein factors binding to TCC repeat sequences. We thank Dr. Philip Lazarovici for advice on P1 cloning service."

To identify alpha(4) subunit amino acids important for alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 interaction, we expressed mutant alpha(4) and wild type beta(7) chains in K562 cells and analyzed the effect of the mutations on cell adhesion to a soluble MAdCAM-1 (sMAdCAM-1-Ig). Transfectants expressing mutated alpha(4) at Tyr(187) displayed a substantial decrease in adhesion to this ligand, which was associated with a reduced alpha(4)beta(7)/sMAdCAM-1-Ig interaction, as determined by soluble binding assays. Addition of Mn(2+) to the adhesion assays did not restore the impaired adhesion. Mutations at alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) also affected transfectant adhesion to sMAdCAM-1-Ig, but did not involve an alteration of alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 binding, and adhesion was restored by Mn(2+). Instead, mutations at alpha(4) Asn(123)Glu(124) did not affect this adhesion. Mutation of alpha(4) Tyr(187) abolished alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated cell adhesion to CS-1/fibronectin, an additional ligand for alpha(4)beta(7), while alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) transfectant mutants showed a reduced adhesion. These results identify alpha(4) Tyr(187) as a key residue during receptor alpha(4)beta(7)/ligand interactions, indicating that it plays important roles in alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated leukocyte adhesion, and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention in several inflammatory pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2023895292,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that (i) Dal81p and Dal82p are required for allophanate-induced gene expression inSaccharomyces cerevisiae; (ii) the cis-acting element mediating the induced transcriptional response to allophanate is a dodecanucleotide, UIS ALL; and (iii) Dal82p binds specifically to UIS ALL. Here we show that Dal82p is localized to the nucleus and parallels movement of the DNA through the cell cycle. Deletion analysis of DAL82identified and localized three functional domains. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a peptide (consisting of Dal82p amino acids 1–85) that is sufficient to bind a DNA fragment containingUIS ALL. LexA-tethering experiments demonstrated that Dal82p is capable of mediating transcriptional activation. The activation domain consists of two parts: (i) an absolutely required core region (amino acids 66–99) and (ii) less well defined regions flanking residues 66–99 that are required for full wild-type levels of activation. The Dal82p C terminus contains a predicted coiled-coil motif that down-regulates Dal82p-mediated transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2083818458,"Repetitive elements flanked by exons 2 and 3 of the human transaldolase gene, thus termed transaldolase-associated repetitive elements, TARE, were identified in human DNA. Nonpolyadenylated TARE transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis and cloned by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction from human T lymphocytes. A dominant 1085-nucleotide long transcript, TARE-6, contained two adjacent Alu elements, a right monomer and a complete dimer, oriented opposite to the direction of transcription of the transaldolase gene. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in vitrotranscription analyses showed that transcription of TARE-6 proceeded in the orientation of the RNA pol III promoter of the Alu dimer and opposite to the orientation of the TAL-H gene. TAREs lacking RNA polymerase III promoter showed no transcriptional activity.In vitro transcription of TARE-6 was resistant to 1 μg/ml α-amanitin but sensitive to 100 μg/ml α-amanitin and tagetitoxin, suggesting involvement of RNA polymerase III. TAREs in both the transaldolase and HSAG-1 genomic loci were surrounded by TA target site duplications. Homologies between transaldolase and HSAG-1 break off internally at splice donor and acceptor sites.

They are generally considered as a major force in shaping of the genome (1.Temin H.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1985; 2: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Weiner A.M. Deininger P.L. Efstratiadis A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 631-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retrotransposable elements can be divided into two major classes: those with long terminal repeats (LTRs)1 and those without. The LTR class of elements replicate through RNA intermediates similar to retroviruses (2.Weiner A.M. Deininger P.L. Efstratiadis A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 631-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the mechanism of retrotransposition of the second class of retrotransposons, the non-LTR elements. Representatives of this class in the human genome include the long (6–7 kb) (LINEs) (3.Fanning T.G. Singer M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 910: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and short (90–400 bp) interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs) (4.Shen M. Batzer M. Deininger P. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These elements lack most of the genes encoded by the LTR-containing retrotransposons. The RNA intermediate involved in retroposition of LINEs is transcribed by RNA polymerase II, while that for SINEs is produced by RNA polymerase III. Both LINEs and SINEs are present in the order of 105 copies dispersed throughout the genome. A third family of non-LTR retroposons are retropseudogenes. They represent cDNA copies of fully processed mRNA transcripts. These retropseudogenes lack introns present in the chromosomal locus and always include a poly(A) tract at their 3′ end. Since retropseudogenes are deprived of promoter elements located upstream from the transcription initiation site in the parental gene locus, retrotransposition of a correctly initiated mRNA will result in an inactive retropseudogene. However, on rare occasions, retrotransposition of fully processed mRNAs can lead to the creation of new functional genes such as the rat and mouse preproinsulin I gene (5.Soares M.B. Schon E.

Langley C.H. Science. 1993; 260: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Evolution of split genes has been suggested to occur by development of a splicing system that could join discontinuous gene structures to make functional proteins or, alternatively, by intron mobility, i.e. a reversal of the splicing process at the RNA level (7.Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 397-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8.Roger A.J. Doolittle W.F. Nature. 1993; 364: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9.Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) or insertion of transposable elements into pre-existing genes (10.Cavalier-Smith T. Nature. 1985; 315: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The exon-intron structure of genes has been very important in the generation of new genes during evolution (9.Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 of every 20 genes is expressed by alternative pathways of RNA splicing. As an example, this mechanism allows tissue or growth stage-specific production of 20 different proteins from a single fibronectin gene (11.Hynes R.O. Fibronectin. Springer Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar). We have previously determined that the coding sequence of the human transaldolase (TAL-H) gene contains a transaldolase-associated repetitive element (TARE) (12.Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAREs constitute a family of 1,000 to 10,000 repetitive elements encompassed by the 2nd and 3rd coding exons of TAL-H and contain internal sequences of variable length. Nonpolyadenylated TARE transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis and cloned by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human T lymphocytes. A dominant transcript, TARE-6, contained a typical RNA polymerase III promoter within an internal Alu dimer. TARE-6 was transcribed in vitro in the orientation of the RNA pol III promoter. Resistance to α-amanitin, sensitivity to tagetitoxin, and mutagenesis studies showed the dependence TARE-6 transcription on RNA polymerase III. Transcriptionally active TAREs have contributed to distinct functional genes and may be a source of mobility in the human genome. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and cell lines, digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel, blotted to nylon membrane, and hybridized to32P-labeled DNA probes under high stringency conditions as described previously (13.Perl A.

Total RNA was extracted by the RNAzol method (19.Jurka J. Milosavljevic A. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by binding to poly(U) Sephadex column (Life Technologies, Inc.), fractionated in 1% glyoxal gels, and transferred to nylon membranes (13.Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A human lymphocyte genomic DNA library was prepared in λ DASH phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and screened with TAL-H cDNA fragments 4/2 and 4/1 (12.Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under high stringency conditions as earlier described (13.Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 10 ng of DNA was subjected to PCR amplification under the following conditions: denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 40–65 °C experimentally determined for each primer pair for 1 min, primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min in 30 cycles. Following amplification, 10 μl of the 100-μl PCR reaction volume was electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane in 0.4 NaOH, and hybridized to 32P-labeled probe as earlier described (14.Srivastava B.I. Banki K. Perl A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4391-4395PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Agarwal R.K. Perl A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5283-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 3 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by 200 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD) using 80 ng of oligonucleotide or 50 ng of random hexamers as primers for 10 min at room temperature and then for 50 min at 42 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating at 90 °C for 5 min. After chilling on ice, RNA template was digested with 2 units of Escherichia coli RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, the first strand cDNA was subjected to PCR. RT-PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced by the chain termination method (16.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52761) Google Scholar). Three partially overlapping λ DASH genomic clones were analyzed (12.Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assure reliable sequence data for Alu-rich regions of the TAL-H locus, two adjacentEcoRI fragments (between nucleotides 3541–10172 and 10167–12772) were cloned in the pSP72 vector for transposon-mediated sequencing (17.Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.E. Meyerowitz E.M. Palazzolo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). pSP72-based plasmids were transformed into HB101F′ cells. Transposon insertions were created by mating HB101F′ donor strains with the JGM recipient strain and plating out the progeny on doubly selective plates (50 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin). 28 plasmids with γδ transposons spaced 300–400 base pairs apart were selected by PCR-based mapping using primer NGDIR (5′-GTTCCATTGGCCCTCAAAC-3′) located at both ends of the transposon and PM001 (5′-CGTTAGAACGCGGCTACAAT-3′) or PM002 (5′-GCCGATTCATTAATGCAGGT-3′) primers flanking the multiple cloning site of pSP72. Thus, M13 forward (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′ and reverse (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′) sequencing priming sites, carried by the transposon, were introduced throughout the target sequence at 300–400-nucleotide intervals. Sequences of both strands were determined and analyzed with the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software (18.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Alu sequences were identified with the Pythia program (19.Jurka J. Milosavljevic A. J. Mol.

As TARE-specific templates, RT-PCR clone 2/8 in Bluescript KS+ plasmid, gel-purified full-length TARE-6-equivalent 2/8 insert and its fragments, truncated at theTAL-H exon 3-proximal end, were utilized. The VA1 template (XbaI-BalI fragment from the adenovirus type 2 genome cloned into the XbaI/SmaI sites of pUC12) pVA1 was used as positive control for RNA polymerase III (pol III)-mediated transcription (21.Lassar A.B. Martin P.L. Roeder R.G. Science. 1983; 222: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The adenovirus major late promoter sequence from −400 to +10 fused to a G-less cassette in the pML(C2AT) plasmid was used as positive control template for RNA polymerase II (pol II)-mediated transcription (22.Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). 8 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was incubated with 0.8 μl of 0.5 μg/μl template for 10 min on ice to allow binding of transcription factors to DNA. Reaction mixtures (11.2 μl) containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 30 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 600 μm ATP, 600 μm UTP, 35 mm CTP, 200 μm 3′-O-methyl-GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 ng/μl poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.), 25 units of RNase T1 and 40 units of rRNasin were added to the nuclear extract G-less cassette template complex. Reaction mixtures containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 85 mm KCl, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 600 μm ATP, 600 μm UTP, 35 mm CTP, 600 μm GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 ng/μl poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.), and 40 units of rRNasin were added to VA1 and test template-nuclear extract complexes. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and terminated by adding 400 μl of stop solution containing 70 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 140 μg/ml proteinase K, 250 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold filtered ethanol, and vacuum dried for 10 min. Precipitates were resuspended in formamide dye mixture and electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea, and gels were exposed to x-ray film. α-Amanitin, a bicyclic octapeptide from the mushroom Amanita phalloides, which selectively inhibits RNA pol II-mediated transcription at low concentrations (23.Lindell T.J. Weinberg F. Morris P.W. Roeder R.G. Rutter W.J. Science. 1970; 170: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), was obtained from Sigma. Tagetitoxin, an inhibitor of RNA pol III (24.Steinberg T.H. Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). In vivo transcription in Jurkat (ATCC number CRL8163) and Molt-4 T cell leukemia cell lines (ATCC number CRL1582) was inhibited by a 5-h incubation with 50 μg/ml α-amanitin in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as earlier described (25.Zieve G. Benecke B. Penman S. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4520-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Effect of α-amanitin on in vivo transcription was assessed by Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from α-amanitin-treated and untreated cells. Transcription by RNA polymerase I was monitored by a 28 S ribosomal probe (pES-28 S cloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pGEM4, kindly provided by Dr. Joan Steitz of Yale University). Inhibition of RNA pol II was evaluated by levels of transcription of human β-actin (26.Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) and 4/1 segment ofTAL-H cDNA (12.Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 7SL RNA probe (pSP7SL cloned intoEcoRI/XbaI sites of SP64, a gift from Dr. Peter Walter of the University of California at San Francisco) was utilized to monitor RNA pol III transcription. Total RNA or in vitrotranscribed RNA were used as templates. Prior to primer extension, radiolabeled and non-radioactive in vitro transcription reactions were carried out and separated in a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea. TARE transcripts were excised from the gel and passively eluted in 500 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at room temperature overnight. Then, RNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated and used for primer extension as earlier described (27.Piras G. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Duvall J.F. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6170-6179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase were annealed with 5 μg of total RNA or 0.5 μg of gel-purified in vitro transcribed RNA at 70 °C for 10 min, chilled on ice for 2 min. RNA was resuspended in extension buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP, preincubated at 42 °C for 5 min, then 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added, and the sample was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. The reactions was terminated by heating at 70 °C and chilling on ice. Samples were analyzed in a 6% sequencing gel. cDNA generated with primer extension was cloned by anchored PCR using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, cDNA generated with 4/2ORFc primer was treated with RNase, purified on a Glassmax spin cartridge, tailed with dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), amplified with nested 4/2ORFd and deoxyinosine-containing anchor primers, and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector. The full-length TAL-H cDNA clone 4/2-4/1 contains 474-bp 5′ (4/2 subclone) and 827-bp 3′ (4/1 subclone)EcoRI fragments (Fig.1 A). Southern blot hybridizations under high stringency conditions revealed that the 5′ segment of the TAL-H cDNA was repetitive while the 3′ fragment appeared to be a single copy element in the human genome (Fig.1 B). The functional TAL-H gene has been mapped to a single copy genomic locus (TALDO1) on human chromosome 11 at p15.4-p15.5 (28.Banki K. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Halladay D.L. Bullrich F. Croce C.M. Jurecic V. Baldini A. Perl A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on comparative Southern blot analyses and screening of two human lymphocyte genomic DNA libraries, the copy number of TARE was estimated between 1,000 and 10,000 per haploid genome (12.Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Boundaries of the repetitive element within theTAL-H gene were assessed by gene amplification via PCR from genomic DNA of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. A panel of overlapping primer pairs spanning exons 1–8 of TAL-HcDNA were utilized. A series of TARE fragments were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers spanning exons 2 and 3 ofTAL-H (Fig. 2, primer seta). These fragments (designated as TAREs 1–6 corresponding to molecular weights 145, 438, 508, 691, 779, and 992 bp in Fig. 2) were cloned and sequenced (Fig.3 A). Each TARE unit was bounded by highly conserved regions corresponding to exons 2 and 3 of the TAL-H gene in an orientation matching with that of theTAL-H locus (Fig. 3 B). TARE could not be amplified with 5′ primer from TAL-H exon 1 (not shown) or 3′ primers from exons 4 through 8 (Fig. 2, primer pairs b, c, and d). Presence of similar TARE units 2–6 was confirmed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of four normal donors and Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells using primers derived from exons 2 and 3 (Fig.4). This suggested that the repetitive element was confined to exons 2 and 3 of the TAL-H gene.Figure 3A, nucleotide sequence of TARE-6. Open reading frames corresponding to exon 2 (positions 1–125) and exon 3 (positions 977–1085) of TAL-H are capitalized. The Alu-Y monomer (positions 479–640) is italicized. The Alu-Y dimer (positions 641–931) is underlined. Typical RNA pol III split promoter sites A and B are indicated in TARE-6. Orientation of the Alus and RNA pol III promoter are opposite to that of transcription of the TAL-H gene. Splice donor (SD) and acceptor (SA) sites aredouble-underlined. Boundaries of TAREs 2–5 correspond to splice sites in the antisense orientation and are indicated inlowercase letters.

TARE-6 was the longest of among TARE units with related internal sequences. The most notable site of sequence variation among different TARE-6 clones was a G → C transition at nucleotide position 974 converting a splice acceptor site in the sense orientation into a splice donor site in the antisense orientation (Fig. 3 A). While TARE-1 contained no intron, other members of the TARE family (TAREs 2–5) harbored related internal sequences successively truncated at their TAL-Hexon 3-proximal end corresponding to splice sites in the antisense orientation. This may account for the varying size distribution of TAREs in genomic DNA. In contrast to the repetitive exons 2 and 3, the functionalTAL-H gene locus (TALDO1) is a single copy element (28.Banki K. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Halladay D.L. Bullrich F. Croce C.M. Jurecic V. Baldini A. Perl A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TheTAL-H locus contains 28, an unusually high number of Alu elements (Table I). Alignment of TARE-6 with the TAL-H locus demonstrated a considerable homology between corresponding regions flanked by exons 2 and 3 (Fig.5A). TARE-6 clones harbor two adjacent Alu cassettes. Both of these Alus in TARE-6 are in the antisense orientation with respect to the direction of transcription of the TAL-H gene. Based on alignment with major Alu subfamilies (19.Jurka J. Milosavljevic A. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20.Batzer M.A. Deininger P.L. Hellman-Blumberg U. Jurka J. Labuda J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Zietkiewitz E.

An Alu-Y R monomer and an Alu-Y dimer matching with those in TARE-6, were found at base positions 8920–9085 and 11185–11460, i.e. 2100 nucleotides apart in theTAL-H locus. Interestingly, in TAL-H DNA, the Alu-Y R monomer is adjacent to an older Alu-J dimer (base positions 9099–9376). Thus, in comparison to the TAL-H locus, TARE-6 appears internally deleted between two Alu elements. Discontinuation of homologies and possible sites of recombination between the Alu-J (9099–8376) and Alu-Y repeats (11185–11460) are shown in Fig.5 A. These results suggest that TARE-6 may have evolved from the TAL-H locus via recombination between these Alu elements. In the antisense orientation, Alu cassettes of TARE-6 contain several potential splice donor sites (29.Makalowski W. Mitchell G.A. Labuda D. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 188-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) which may have been utilized in formation of TARE-3, -4, and -5 (Fig. 3, A andB). Non-Alu intronic sequences of TARE isolates 2–6 are homologous, which further supports their common origin.Table IAlu elements in the TAL-H locusNucleotide positionTypeArmsOrientation1703–1975ScL + RSense3120–3400YL + RSense4094–4370Ya5L + RSense4665–4816Yb8RAntisense4833–4980YLAntisense5681–5808Ya5LSense5819–6106Yb8L + RSense6145–6292YRSense6349–6469Ya5RSense6593–6842SxR + LAntisense7064–7339SpR + LAntisense7365–7472YRAntisense7734–8007YR + LAntisense8920–9085YRAntisense9125–9376JR + LAntisense9889–10147YR + LAntisense10420–10506JLSense10507–10854YL + RSense9855–11020JRSense11185–11460YR + LAntisense11843–12121SqR + LAntisense12163–12431ScR + LAntisense13200–13311JLSense13343–13424YLSense13487–13596YRSense13614–13902Ya8L + RSense13938–14069JRSense14574–14815SpR + LAntisenseNucleotide position, type (19.Jurka J.

Sequence alignments showed that homologies between TAL-Hexons 2 and 3 and the two segments of similar length, 1262 nucleotides apart, in HSAG-1 broke off at internal splice sites (Fig.5 B). Moreover, homologous TARE regions in theTAL-H and HSAG-1 loci were bounded by TA direct repeats (Figs. 3 B and 5 B). TA is the target sequence of most prokaryotic and eukaryotic transposable elements (31.Doak T.G. Doerder F.P. Jahn C.L. Herrick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.
