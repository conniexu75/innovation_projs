https://openalex.org/W2083628969,"Columnar stromatolites (organosedimentary structures built by bluegreen algae) show a marked decrease in diversity in the Late Precambrian; this decrease in diversity occurs at approximately the same time as the appearance of metazoans, 600 to 700 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2002588559,"The first broad program of scientific shallow drilling on the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf has delineated rocks of Pleistocene to Late Cretaceous age, including phosphoritic Miocene strata, widespread Eocene carbonate deposits that serve as reflective seismic markers, and several regional unconformities. Two sites, off Maryland and New Jersey, showed light hydrocarbon gases having affinity to mature petroleum. Pore fluid studies showed that relatively fresh to brackish water occurs beneath much of the Atlantic continental shelf, whereas increases in salinity off Georgla and beneath the Florida-Hatteras slope suggest buried evaporitic strata. The sediment cores showed engineering properties that range from good foundation strength to a potential for severe loss of strength through interaction between sediments and man-made structures."
https://openalex.org/W2076543693,"Variations in the ratio of K(2)O to SiO(2) in andesitic rocks suggest early and middle Cenozoic subduction beneath the western United States along two subparallel imbricate zones dipping about 20 degrees eastward. The western zone emerged at the continental margin, but the eastern zone was entirely beneath the continental plate. Mesozoic subduction apparently occurred along a single steeper zone."
https://openalex.org/W1972231260,"Carbon particles extracted from sediments collected by box coring from southeastern Lake Michigan were compared with carbon particles extracted from oil, coal, and wood fly ash. Sediments deposited after 1900 contained coal, oil, and wood carbons; older sediments contained only wood carbon."
https://openalex.org/W2082287939,The collisional reaction probabilities of several atmospheric species on bulk sulfuric acid surfaces indicate that heterogeneous processes may be important in tropospheric chemistry.
https://openalex.org/W2038221667,"Unlabeled and (14)C-labeled enantiomorphs of abscisic acid (ABA) were obtained through acetylcellulose chromatography and tested as inducers of abscission, as inhibitors of seed germination, and as antagonists of gibberellic acid-induced synthesis and release of alpha-amylase. The activity of the R isomer was either equal to or less than that of the naturally occurring S form. Greatest differences were in the inhibition of root-related growth. In excised beam axes, although uptake of S-[(14C)]ABA is faster, the internal concentration of R-ABA is higher because of faster conversion of S-ABA to inactive metabolic products. In axes a reversal in chirality is less important to the physiological action of ABA than to its metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2036146991,Numerous underwater mounds found on the continental shelf of the Beaufort Sea are thought to be pingos (hills that have a central core of ice) which have formed in the marine environment subsequent to oceanic transgression.
https://openalex.org/W2041167697,"The diapause factor which is responsible for the induction of embryonic diapause in the silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) was isolated from the heads of female moths. It was extracted with 80 percent ethanol or 80 percent methanol and was heat-stable and not dialyzable. Since the active material was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and lost when incubated with proteolytic enzymes, it is highly probable that the diapause factor is a protein or a complex molecule containing peptide bonds. Molecular sieve techniques revealed two species of the diapause factor. The molecular weight of the smaller species lies between 5,000 and 10,000."
https://openalex.org/W2081828710,"Small mineral grains (10 to 50 micrometers) of high uranium concentration (100 to 3000 parts per million) were located in polished sections of eight potsherds from Cyprus, England, Greece, and Mexico by induced fission-track mapping. Most of the grains were identified as zircons or apatites by a microprobe attachment to a scanning electron microscope. The advantages in using such radioactive grains for thermoluminescence dating and alpha-recoil track dating are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1994021489,"A recurring pattern with a period of 26(7/8) days observed in the polar geomagnetic field during the interval from 1926 to 1941 appears to persist in the interplanetary magnetic field polarity observed with spacecraft during the interval from 1963 to 1968. This observation suggests the existence of a rotating solar magnetic ""dipole"" with a period of 26(7/8) +/- 0.003 days."

https://openalex.org/W2039573918,"The eutrophication potentials of a phosphate-containing detergent and two phosphate-free detergents, as determined in oligotrophic algal microcosms after activated sludge treatment, were not significantly different. All activated sludge effluents, including those from detergent-free waste water, lowered the algal diversity of the microcosms to about the same extent below that of the lake water controls."

https://openalex.org/W2169692499,Several incidences of human exposure as well as exposure of rats to organic mercury compounds are related with no apparent debilitating effects. The author has yet to see scientific evidence to support the limit of 0.5 ppm set for mercury in foodstuffs. He questions whether an arbitrary regulation redounds to the detriment of the many for the sake of the few. Perhaps the toxicity of alkylmercurials is a matter of human idiosyncrasy.
