However, the molecular basis and specificity of the actions of dantrolene on RYR channels have remained in question. Here we utilize [3H]ryanodine binding to further investigate the actions of dantrolene on the three mammalian RYR isoforms. The inhibition of the pig skeletal muscle RYR1 by dantrolene (10 μm) was associated with a 3-fold increase in the Kd of [3H]ryanodine binding to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles such that dantrolene effectively reversed the 3-fold decrease in the Kd for [3H]ryanodine binding resulting from the malignant hyperthermia RYR1 Arg615 → Cys mutation. Dantrolene inhibition of the RYR1 was dependent on the presence of the adenine nucleotide and calmodulin and reflected a selective decrease in the apparent affinity of RYR1 activation sites for Ca2+ relative to Mg2+. In contrast to the RYR1 isoform, the cardiac RYR2 isoform was unaffected by dantrolene, both in native cardiac SR vesicles and when heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. By comparison, the RYR3 isoform expressed in HEK-293 cells was significantly inhibited by dantrolene, and the extent of RYR3 inhibition was similar to that displayed by the RYR1 in native SR vesicles. Our results thus indicate that both the RYR1 and the RYR3, but not the RYR2, may be targets for dantrolene inhibitionin vivo.

Ryanodine receptors (RYRs) 1The abbreviations used are: RYRryanodine receptorSRsarcoplasmic reticulumMHmalignant hyperthermiaMHSMH-susceptibleECexcitation-contractionCaMcalmodulinAMPPCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphatePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid are intracellular Ca2+ channels specialized for the rapid and massive release of Ca2+, as is necessary for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in striated muscle (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Three different RYR isoforms have been identified in mammalian tissues: the RYR1, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle; the RYR2, which is predominantly expressed in cardiac muscle; and the RYR3, which is expressed at comparatively low levels in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Because RYR channels play critical roles in the diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic cell processes that are controlled by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), these channels represent potentially important pharmacologic targets for modulating cell regulation (3Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the key functional properties that may distinguish the different RYR isoforms remain unclear (4Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar), and few if any drugs are known to act as isoform-specific modulators of these channels (3Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). ryanodine receptor sarcoplasmic reticulum malignant hyperthermia MH-susceptible excitation-contraction calmodulin adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid To date, the muscle relaxant dantrolene remains the only drug targeting RYR channels that is used clinically (3Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 5Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). Early investigations indicated that dantrolene may act selectively on the physiologic mechanism responsible for activating Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during skeletal muscle EC coupling (6Ellis K.O. Butterfield J.L. Wessels F.L. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1976; 224: 118-132PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Accordingly, dantrolene (∼10 μm) shifts the sensitivity of contractile activation to higher voltages and reduces the skeletal muscle twitch force by more than half (7Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hainaut K. Desmedt J.E. Nature. 1974; 252: 728-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Dantrolene inhibition of SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle has provided a lifesaving treatment for the pharmacogenetic disorder malignant hyperthermia (MH). Thus, the uncontrolled SR Ca2+ release, muscle contracture, and accelerated metabolism that threaten the MH-susceptible (MHS) patient exposed to volatile anesthetics during surgery are effectively suppressed upon treatment with dantrolene (9Loke J. MacLennan D.H. Am. J. Med. 1998; 104: 470-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,10Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Dantrolene also reverses the increased sensitivity of MHS muscle to activation by caffeine (11Britt B.A. Scott E. Frodis W. Clements M. Endrenyi L. Can. Anaesth. Soc. J. 1984; 31: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which constitutes the basis of in vitro diagnostic tests of this syndrome (12Tong J.

Lehmann-Horn F. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 4-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The efficacy of dantrolene in the treatment of MH is in large part a function of the selective action of this drug on SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle, while exerting no comparable negative inotropic effect on the beating heart (6Ellis K.O. Butterfield J.L. Wessels F.L. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1976; 224: 118-132PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14VanWinkle W.B. Science. 1976; 193: 1130-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Notably, the absence of major effects of dantrolene on SR Ca2+ release in the heart is consistent with the possibility that dantrolene may act selectively on the RYR1 but not the RYR2 channel isoform (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At the same time, it is also clear that the effects of dantrolene on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores are not strictly limited to skeletal muscle but extend to certain nonmuscle cells, including central neurons (16Mody I. MacDonald J.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 356-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Wei H. Perry D.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2390-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Pelletier M.R. Wadia J.S. Mills L.R. Carlen P.L. J.

The basis of the effects of dantrolene in nonmuscle cells remains unclear, however, because of uncertainty regarding the precise molecular mechanism of dantrolene inhibition and the selectivity of this mechanism for different Ca2+ release channel isoforms. In a previous report (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that dantrolene acts directly on the RYR1 to reduce the extent of channel activation by calmodulin (CaM) and thereby decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of channel activation. Here we further define the mechanism and isoform selectivity of dantrolene as an inhibitor of RYR channels. MHS pigs homozygous for the RYR1 Arg615 → Cys mutation were obtained from the University of Minnesota Experimental Farm; normal control animals were obtained from commercial suppliers. Skeletal muscle SR vesicles were prepared from longissimus dorsi muscles of MHS and normal pigs, and cardiac SR vesicles were prepared from porcine ventricular tissue as described previously (20Mickelson J.R.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All isolation buffers contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 nm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). [3H]Ryanodine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and nonradioactive ryanodine was purchased from Calbiochem. Dantrolene, porcine brain CaM, and AMPPCP (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) were from Sigma. Azumolene (a water-soluble analog of dantrolene) was manufactured by Procter & Gamble and provided by Dr. Esther Gallant (University of Minnesota). Dantrolene stock solutions (1 mm) were prepared fresh every 1–2 days in 50% methanol (0.5% methanol final concentration) and stored in the dark at room temperature. The cloning and sequencing of the full-length cDNA encoding the mouse cardiac RYR2 (22Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the rabbit uterus RYR3 (23Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have been described previously. RYR clones were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells following transfection by Ca2+ phosphate precipitation. HEK-293 whole-cell lysates were prepared as described (24Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris/HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% CHAPS, and 0.5% phosphatidylcholine. [3H]Ryanodine binding to SR vesicles (2 mg/ml) or HEK-293 cell lysates (1.4–1.9 mg/ml) was determined following ∼10-min preincubations in 37 °C media containing 120 mmpotassium propionate, 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 2 mm Na2AMPPCP, 1 μm CaM, and either 10 μm dantrolene or methanol vehicle. Following the addition of [3H]ryanodine (20 nm), samples were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and then collected on Whatman glass fiber filters with three 3-ml washes with ice-cold 100 mm KCl. RYR expression levels in HEK-293 cells were quantitated via determinations of the maximal [3H]ryanodine binding capacity of cell lysates in media containing 600 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2ATP, and 100 μm Ca2+(0.01 ± 0.009 pmol/mg for mock-transfected controls; 0.85 ± 0.06 pmol/mg for RYR2-expressing cells; 0.68 ± 0.5 pmol/mg for RYR3-expressing cells). Data were corrected for nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 100-fold excess nonradioactive ryanodine. Concentrations of ionized Ca2+ were obtained using calcium acetate-EGTA buffers (25Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory demonstrated that dantrolene inhibition of skeletal muscle SR vesicle Ca2+ release was associated with reduced levels of [3H]ryanodine binding to the isolated RYR1 (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and thus indicated that dantrolene may act directly at the RYR1 to inhibit channel activation. Other laboratories, however, have proposed that the effects of dantrolene on SR Ca2+ release may be mediated via its binding to non-RYR proteins (26Parness J. Palnitkar S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18465-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Pessah I.N. Lynch C.I.I.I Gronert G.A. Anesthesiology. 1996; 84: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and have questioned whether the magnitude of the actions of dantrolene on [3H]ryanodine binding in vitro may adequately explain the clinical effects of this drug. The current experiments therefore sought to further define the mechanism and selectivity of the actions of dantrolene on [3H]ryanodine binding and to determine whether this mechanism might reasonably account for thein vivo actions of dantrolene in reversing MH. The experiments shown in Fig. 1 compared the effects of dantrolene and the pig MHS mutation on theKd and Bmax of [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal muscle SR vesicles. The concentration of dantrolene in these experiments was 10 μm, a concentration that approximates therapeutic drug levels in vivo (28Flewellen E.H. Nelson T.E. Jones W.P. Arens J.F. Wagner D.L. Anesthesiology. 1983; 59: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and at which the inhibition of SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding by dantrolene was maximal (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the absence of dantrolene, the Kd for [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS SR vesicles was approximately one-third of that for normal SR vesicles (TableI), consistent with the magnitude of the effect of the MHS mutation on [3H]ryanodine binding affinity as documented previously (20Mickelson J.R. Gallant E.M. Litterer L.A. Johnson K.M. Rempel W.E. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9310-9315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, theKd for the binding of [3H]ryanodine to both MHS and normal SR vesicles was increased ∼3-fold in the presence of dantrolene. Neither the MHS mutation nor dantrolene significantly altered the Bmax of SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding. Consequently, [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS SR vesicles in the presence of dantrolene was essentially equivalent to that of normal SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding in the absence of dantrolene over the range of the ryanodine concentrations examined (Fig. 1). These results thus demonstrate that dantrolene inhibition of the RYR1 was associated with a reduced affinity of the channel for [3H]ryanodine and further indicate that the magnitude of the effect of dantrolene on [3H]ryanodine binding was comparable with that of the MHS Arg615 → Cys mutation.Table IEffect of dantrolene on SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine bindingKdBmaxnnmpmol/mgNormal SRControl112 ± 8.511.9 ± 0.34Dantrolene303 ± 271-a11.4 ± 0.54MHS SRControl32 ± 3.31-b10.9 ± 0.34Dantrolene93 ± 6.3 1-a[3H]Ryanodine binding was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence or presence of 10 μm dantrolene.

Open table in a new tab Previous results demonstrated that dantrolene decreased the sensitivity of the isolated RYR1 to activation by Ca2+ (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and thereby suggested that a reduced affinity of Ca2+ binding to RYR1 activation sites may constitute the basis of dantrolene inhibition of Ca2+release in skeletal muscle. To further examine this possibility, we determined the effect of dantrolene on the sensitivity of RYR1 to other effectors known to modulate RYR activation by Ca2+. Caffeine, for example, is known to activate the RYRI by increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel (29Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Stephenson D.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reduced threshold for caffeine activation is characteristic of MHS RYR1 mutations at diverse sites within the primary sequence of this channel protein (12Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Fig.2 indicates that the threshold for the caffeine activation of [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS SR was decreased relative to that of normal SR, and the EC50for the caffeine activation of MHS SR was reduced by approximately one-half (Table II). Conversely, dantrolene (10 μm) shifted the caffeine threshold for the activation of [3H]ryanodine binding to higher caffeine concentrations and increased the EC50 for the caffeine activation of both MHS and normal SR vesicles by ≥2-fold. Dantrolene thus reduced the apparent caffeine sensitivity of the RYR1 and opposed the effect of the MHS mutation on the caffeine activation of the channel.Table IIEffect of dantrolene on RYR1 sensitivity to caffeine, Mg2+, and Sr2+Normal SRMHS SREC50 caffeinenHEC50caffeinenHmmmmControl8.0 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.22-bSignificantly different from corresponding value for normal SR.1.4 ± 0.1Dantrolene24.6 ± 2.62-a[3H]Ryanodine binding to skeletal muscle SR vesicles was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence or presence of 10 μm dantrolene.

Open table in a new tab Mg2+ is an endogenous inhibitor of RYR channels that may act by competing with Ca2+ at channel activation sites (30Laver D.R. Baynes T.M. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 56: 213-229Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar,31Liu W. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C120-C128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the physiologic significance of any changes in RYR1 Ca2+ sensitivity in the presence of dantrolene will depend on whether dantrolene also effects corresponding changes in the Mg2+ sensitivity of the channel. To better understand how dantrolene may influence the selectivity of RYR1 activation sites for Ca2+ relative to Mg2+, we determined the Mg2+ sensitivity of [3H]ryanodine binding in media containing 100 nm Ca2+ (Fig.3 A). In the absence of dantrolene, [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS SR vesicles was slightly less sensitive to inhibition by MgCl2 than was binding to normal SR (the IC50 for MHS SR increased 23%, p = 0.03) (Table II). Dantrolene, however, did not significantly alter the IC50 for MgCl2inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding to either MHS or normal SR vesicles. Whereas Mg2+ competitively blocks RYR1 activation by Ca2+, Sr2+ ions may replace Ca2+ in activating RYR channels (31Liu W. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C120-C128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the results in Fig.3 B indicate that SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding was activated by Sr2+ and that the EC50for activation was significantly decreased for MHS SR vesicles (TableII). Furthermore, dantrolene significantly increased the EC50 for Sr2+. These results are thus in agreement with the effect of dantrolene on the Ca2+sensitivity of the RYR1 (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) but are in contrast to the lack of any effect of dantrolene on RYR1 sensitivity to Mg2+ (Fig.3 B). Together, our results therefore support the possibility that dantrolene inhibits SR Ca2+ release in situby reducing the sensitivity of the RYR1 to activation by Ca2+ and further indicate that this mechanism may operate independently of any effect of dantrolene on the Mg2+sensitivity of the channel. Ohta and co-workers (32Ohta T. Ito S. Ohga A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 178: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) originally noted that the effect of dantrolene on skinned muscle fibers was more pronounced when the media contained ATP, and more recently, Palnitkar and co-workers (33Palnitkar S.S. Bin B. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Williams P.G. Paul-Pletzer K. Parness J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reported that adenine nucleotides enhanced the binding of [3H]dantrolene to SR vesicles. To better define the role of adenine nucleotides in the mechanism of RYR1 inhibition by dantrolene, we examined the effect of AMPPCP on the inhibition of skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding by dantrolene (Fig. 4). Initial experiments compared the CaM-dependent activation of MHS SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence and absence of AMPPCP. The results in Fig. 4 A show that SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding was dependent on both AMPPCP and CaM. Thus, in the presence of AMPPCP (2 mm), dantrolene decreased by one-third the extent of CaM-activated [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS SR vesicles. In contrast, dantrolene did not significantly inhibit [3H]ryanodine binding when AMPPCP was omitted from the binding media (Fig.4 A). This loss of dantrolene inhibition was confirmed in the determinations of Kd and Bmaxvalues for [3H]ryanodine binding in the AMPPCP-free media (Fig. 4 B, Table I). A comparison of the dose dependence of dantrolene inhibition at different [AMPPCP] also indicated that RYR1 inhibition was strictly dependent on the presence of adenine nucleotide (Fig. 4 C); however, neither the extent nor the concentration dependence of dantrolene inhibition was altered when the concentration of the nucleotide was increased from 1 to 4 mm (IC50 for dantrolene = 129 ± 48 nm versus 112 ± 32 nm, respectively). The possible effects of dantrolene on the Kd of [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac SR vesicles were investigated in media that contained either 100 or 300 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 5). In 100 nm Ca2+-containing media, neitherKd nor Bmax determinations (Table I) were significantly affected by dantrolene (10 μm), whereas in the same media, dantrolene increased theKd of [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal muscle SR vesicles 3-fold (Fig. 1). When Ca2+ was increased to 300 nm, the affinity of [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac SR vesicles was increased (∼7-fold); however, dantrolene again had no effect on either Kd or Bmax determinations. These results thus demonstrate that, in comparison with the RYR1, the RYR2 isoform in cardiac SR vesicles was insensitive to clinical concentrations of dantrolene. To further investigate the isoform selectivity of dantrolene as an inhibitor of RYR channels, we also examined [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant RYRs heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells (22Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells provide a valuable system for the functional expression of the different RYR isoforms because any endogenous RYRs in these cells are expressed only at very low levels (34Tong J. Guang G. Chen S.R.W. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, Fig. 6 A shows that the [3H]ryanodine binding activity of lysates prepared from mock-transfected HEK-293 cells was low (≤5 fmol/mg protein) and was not significantly affected by dantrolene (10 μm). [3H]Ryanodine binding to RYR2-transfected HEK-293 cell lysates was increased ∼20-fold relative to mock-transfected controls. Moreover, [3H]ryanodine binding to the recombinant RYR2 in these cells was unaffected by dantrolene (Fig. 6 A), consistent with the results obtained using cardiac SR vesicles (Fig.5). In comparison, [3H]ryanodine binding to lysates prepared from RYR3-expressing cells was significantly inhibited by dantrolene (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect of dantrolene on the recombinant RYR3 (60% of control [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of dantrolene) was comparable with the effect of dantrolene on the RYR1 in native SR vesicles (Fig. 1 and data not shown). These results therefore demonstrate that the sensitivity of a cell to dantrolene may be determined by the RYR isoform(s) expressed and identify the RYR3 isoform as a target for dantrolene action. Dantrolene inhibition of the recombinant RYR3 isoform was further characterized to investigate whether a similar mechanism may explain the effects of dantrolene on the RYR1 and RYR3 isoforms. The Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to HEK-293 cell lysates containing heterologously expressed RYR3 (Fig. 6 B) indicated that dantrolene inhibition of RYR3 was most pronounced at ∼100 nm Ca2+. In the presence of dantrolene (10 μm), the EC50 for the Ca2+ activation of [3H]ryanodine binding was increased 2.3-fold (from 97.8 ± 37 nm to 229 ± 48 nm). Although this increase in the Ca2+EC50 for RYR3 did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07), the magnitude of the effect was comparable with that previously documented for dantrolene inhibition of the RYR1 (∼2.5-fold increase in Ca2+ EC50 for RYR1 in the presence of 10 μm dantrolene (see Ref. 15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the results shown in Fig. 6 C indicated that the binding of [3H]ryanodine to RYR3 was also inhibited by azumolene (10 μm), a dantrolene analog known to inhibit the RYR1 isoform (33Palnitkar S.S. Bin B. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Williams P.G. Paul-Pletzer K. Parness J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Finally, as was true for the RYR1 (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), RYR3 inhibition by dantrolene was also abolished when the temperature in the [3H]ryanodine binding media was reduced to 20 °C or when AMPPCP was omitted from the binding media (Fig.6 C). These results thus indicate that dantrolene inhibition of the RYR3 isoform exhibited properties similar to those previously demonstrated for the dantrolene inhibition of the RYR1 isoform in SR vesicles (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Despite the importance of dantrolene both in the treatment of MH and as a pharmacologic probe of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, the molecular basis and specificity of the actions of dantrolene on RYR channels have remained uncertain. In this study, we have used [3H]ryanodine binding to further characterize the mechanism by which dantrolene may selectively inhibit the RYR1 but not the RYR2 channel isoform and to determine whether the RYR3 isoform may also be a target for dantrolene action. Although dantrolene is only a partial inhibitor of the isolated RYR1, the current results clearly demonstrate that the magnitude of the effect of dantrolene on the functional activity of this channel is comparable with the effect of the MHS RYR1 Arg615 → Cys mutation. Thus, dantrolene effectively opposed the ∼3-fold increase in the affinity of SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding resulting from the MHS mutation (Fig. 1). Dantrolene similarly opposed the ∼2-fold increase in RYR1 caffeine sensitivity resulting from the MHS mutation (Fig. 2). Increased RYR1 caffeine sensitivity is diagnostic for human MHS mutations at diverse sites in the primary sequence of the channel protein (12Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and this result is therefore consistent with the general efficacy of dantrolene in the treatment of this genetically heterogeneous disorder. The basis of the increased caffeine sensitivity of MHS channels is uncertain (29Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Stephenson D.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) but is unlikely to reflect the actual effects of the various mutations on the affinity of caffeine binding to the RYR1 (35Shomer N.H. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1253-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, increased caffeine sensitivity may indicate that MHS mutations, like caffeine, act by reducing the threshold for RYR1 activation by Ca2+ (29Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Stephenson D.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this view, the observed 2–3-fold increase in the caffeine EC50 in the presence of dantrolene is consistent with the 2–3-fold shifts in the sensitivity of MHS and normal channels to both Ca2+ (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and Sr2+ (Fig. 3 B) in the presence of dantrolene. Physiologic Mg2+ concentrations (∼1 mm) may fully block RYR1 activation by Ca2+ (30Laver D.R. Baynes T.M. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 56: 213-229Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Lacampagne A. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and this suggests that dynamic changes in the affinity of this channel for either Ca2+ or Mg2+ may be a requisite step for channel activation in situ (29Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Stephenson D.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Lacampagne A. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to the model of Lamb and Stephenson (37Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 270-274Google Scholar), for example, RYR1 activation during EC coupling is dependent on a decrease in the Mg2+ affinity of the channel, which is mediated via the coupling of RYRs to transverse tubule voltage sensors. It is also possible, however, that the Ca2+ affinity of RYR1 activation sites might be modulated independently of major changes in the sensitivity of the channel to [Mg2+]i. In light of the effects of dantrolene both on EC coupling in intact muscle (7Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hainaut K. Desmedt J.E. Nature. 1974; 252: 728-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and on the Ca2+sensitivity of the isolated RYR1, we examined the potential role of altered Mg2+ sensitivity in the mechanism of dantrolene inhibition. Our results (Fig. 3) indicate that dantrolene inhibition of SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding was not associated with an altered IC50 for Mg2+ (Table II). Because this inhibition reflects the competitive binding of Mg2+ to RYR1 Ca2+ activation sites (30Laver D.R. Baynes T.M. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 56: 213-229Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Liu W. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C120-C128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results indicate that the effect of dantrolene on the apparent Ca2+ affinity of RYR1 activation sites (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) is not associated with corresponding changes in the affinity of these same sites for Mg2+. Similarly, Murayama and co-workers (38Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) recently concluded that the effect of caffeine on the Ca2+ affinity of RYR activation sites was also not associated with changes in the affinity of Mg2+ binding to these sites. Thus, in intact muscle, both dantrolene and caffeine may modulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of the RYR1 via mechanisms that operate independently of any changes in the affinity of the channel for Mg2+. Accumulating evidence now supports a model in which the effects of dantrolene on SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle may be explained by the direct binding of dantrolene to the RYR1 channel protein without invoking putative non-RYR dantrolene receptors (26Parness J. Palnitkar S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18465-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accordingly, purified, solubilized preparations of the RYR1 channel protein retain sensitivity to dantrolene (15Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and cross-linking experiments have identified the RYR1 as the major SR protein labeled with a photoaffinity dantrolene analog (33Palnitkar S.S. Bin B. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Williams P.G. Paul-Pletzer K. Parness J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the explanation for the dantrolene insensitivity of EC coupling in cardiac muscle has remained uncertain. For example, cardiac insensitivity to dantrolene might potentially be explained by a difference in the dantrolene binding properties of the RYR2 isoform itself, by some cardiac-specific modification of the RYR2 protein, or by other differences in the molecular machinery that controls SR Ca2+ release in cardiac as compared with skeletal muscle. We therefore investigated the possible effects of dantrolene on the RYR2 isoform heterologously expressed in a nonmuscle cell (22Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 6 A) show that the RYR2 expressed in HEK-293 cells remained insensitive to dantrolene. In comparison, the RYR3 isoform expressed in the same cell type was significantly inhibited by dantrolene. These results indicate that the RYR2 itself is intrinsically insensitive to dantrolene and thus suggest that this isoform may lack a high affinity dantrolene site that is present in both the RYR1 and the RYR3 isoforms. We conclude that the absence of major effects of dantrolene on SR Ca2+ release in the heart is likely a simple function of the predominant expression of the RYR2 channel isoform in cardiac muscle. The insensitivity of the cardiac RYR2 to dantrolene is associated with other notable differences in the regulation of this channel isoform. Thus, in comparison with both the RYR1 and the RYR3 isoforms, the RYR2 isoform is less responsive to activation by adenine nucleotide (21Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and CaM (39Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that CaM, together with adenine nucleotide, activates the RYR1 by increasing the Ca2+sensitivity of the channel (39Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, dantrolene inhibits the RYR1 by reducing Ca2+ sensitivity via a mechanism that is dependent on both adenine nucleotide and CaM. Thus, we postulate that the selective action of dantrolene on the RYR1 and RYR3 may in effect oppose the nucleotide- and CaM-dependent activation of these channel isoforms. The identification of the RYR3 as a target for dantrolene suggests that this more broadly expressed channel isoform may potentially underlie the effects of dantrolene in various nonmuscle tissues and cell types. In this regard, the effects of dantrolene on Ca2+ signaling in central neurons are of particular interest. For example, dantrolene has been shown to inhibit the elevations of neuronal Ca2+ evoked byN-methyl-D-aspartate, glutamate, or potassium depolarization (16Mody I. MacDonald J.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 356-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Moreover, dantrolene may protect central neurons from disruptions in Ca2+ homeostasis resulting from ischemic injury (16Mody I. MacDonald J.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 356-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Wei H. Perry D.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2390-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), epileptic seizure (18Pelletier M.R. Wadia J.S. Mills L.R. Carlen P.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 3054-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or exposure to amyloid β-peptide (19Mattson M.P. Zhu H., Yu, J. Kindy M.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Central nervous system effects of dantrolene are also suggested by reports that subjects treated with the drug may experience dizziness, blurred vision, and fatigue (40Wedel D.J. Quinlan J.G. Iaizzo P.A. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1995; 70: 241-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, resolving the molecular targets that underlie the effects of dantrolene on central neurons is difficult because all three RYR isoforms are expressed in the brain and multiple isoforms may be present within a single cell type (41Furuichi T. Furutama D. Hakamata Y. Nakia J. Takeshima H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4794-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31544-31551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, notably, the predominant RYR in the brain as a whole is RYR2 (41Furuichi T. Furutama D. Hakamata Y. Nakia J. Takeshima H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4794-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), whereas our results indicate that RYR1 and RYR3, but not RYR2, may be targets for dantrolene. In light of our results, it may now be of interest to define the specific RYR isoforms that may be responsible for the various effects of dantrolene on Ca2+ signaling in different neuronal cells. Regardless, it is clear that understanding the molecular basis of the effects of dantrolene on intracellular Ca2+ release channels may have implications that extend beyond skeletal muscle and MH to diverse cell types and disease states.

During infection, PrPSc appears to serve as a template for the conversion of the native prion protein, because host PrPC expression is required for infection with prions (4Büeler H. Fischer M.

There is evidence that copper plays a role in the formation of PrPSc (5McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PrPC is nearly ubiquitously distributed to all tissues. The highest levels are found in the brain (6Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L. Wen G.Y. Kascsak R.J. Cashman N.R. Bolton D.C.

Native PrPC is an asparagine-linked sialoglycoprotein that is attached to the surface of the plasma membrane via a C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol anchor (7Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B.

The structured C-terminal half of the full-length recombinant PrP23–231 (amino acids 23–231) from amino acids 126–231 is made up of two strands of one small antiparallel β-sheet and three α-helices (8Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half from amino acids 23–125 showed no structure in NMR analysis and is therefore postulated to be highly flexible (9Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K.

In 1995 it was suggested that the octarepeat region ([PHGGGWGQ]4) from amino acids 60–91 within the flexible N-terminal half of the prion protein may play a role in binding copper (13Hornshaw M.P.

Kretzschmar H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8866-8875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with almost no binding at pH 5. The lack of affinity and stoichiometry data for the full-length prion protein at a physiological pH of 7, as well as the question of which part of the prion protein is responsible for the copper binding, prompted us to systematically investigate the copper binding to the full-length prion protein as well as to different N- and C-terminal fragments using fluorescence spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In this paper we present for the first time copper binding data on the full-length prion protein under physiological conditions at pH 7. Our data show that the prion protein binds up to five copper ions and is almost saturated at 5 μm copper(II). Furthermore, our data suggest that the highly flexible N-terminal half is the cooperative copper-binding domain of the prion protein. MOPS, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, CuSO4·5H2O, andN-ethylmorpholine were purchased from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany). Chelite P was obtained from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Ion exchange matrices EMD-COOH, EMD-TMAE, and thrombin were ordered from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents used were of analytical grade. The peptideshumPrP60–91 and humPrP60–109were synthesized on an 9050-peptide synthesizer (Millipore) using amino acids protected with Fmoc (1-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) and activated with benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium-hexafluorophoshpate (PyBOP) (19Coste J. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 205-208Crossref Scopus (642) Google Scholar). After cleavage from resin and removal of protecting groups, peptides were first purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a 1.9 × 30-cm2 Delta Pac C18 column (Millipore) with a gradient from 0 to 50% acetonitrile including 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 50 min. Both peptides were further purified on an EMD-COOH column eluting with a gradient from 0.02 to 1 mammonium acetate, pH 5.0. Finally, peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column (4 × 250 mm) using a linear water acetonitrile gradient of 10–50% acetonitrile including 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The N-terminal fragment humPrP23–98 was expressed in E. coli according to Brown et al.(18Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After expression and thrombin cleavage of the GST-humPrP23–98 fusion protein, the reaction mixture was applied to an EMD-COOH column andhumPrP23–98 was eluted with a gradient from 0m up to 1 m ammonium acetate pH 6.0. The plasmid pEThuPrP23–112 was constructed for the expression of humPrP23–112 following the cloning of the human PRNP ORF from genomic DNA (20Windl O. Dempster M. Estibeiro J.P. Lathe R. de Silva R. Esmonde T. Will R. Springbett A. Campbell T.A. Sidle K.C.L. Palmer M.S. Collinge J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 98: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The coding region of the N-terminal segment of PrP (aa 23 to 112) was amplified via PCR under standard conditions using primers huPrP23–112up (5′-GGCCGGTCATGAAGAAGCGCCCGAAGCCT-3′) and huPrP23–112do (5′GCCGGGAATTCTTATCACATGTGCTTCATGTTGGT-3′). Primer huPrP23–112up contains a BspHI cleavage site and a start codon. Primer huPrP23–112do contains two stop codons and an EcoRI cleavage site. The construct was cloned into the NcoI andEcoRI sites of the inducible expression vector pET-21d (Novagen) and the sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequence analysis The expression of the humPrP23–112 in E. coli was induced with IPTG. Harvested cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 18,500 g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to an EMD-COOH column, washed with 10 mmammonium acetate pH 6.0. humPrP23–112 and eluted with a linear gradient up to 1 m ammonium acetate pH 6.0 from the column. Finally, both N-terminal PrP fragments were purified by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column (4 mm x 250 mm) using a linear water acetonitrile gradient of 10% to 50% acetonitrile including 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The full-length murPrP23–231 was expressed and purified according to Liemann et al. (21Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Before lyophilization, protein was dialyzed with Chelite P to remove traces of bound copper. The C-terminal fragmentmurPrP121–231 was expressed and purified as described earlier (22Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 614-619Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out on an LS 50B from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Überlingen, Germany). Measurements were performed in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTAC. MOPS buffer was treated with Chelite P to remove traces of heavy metal ions. To excite selectively tryptophan fluorescence, a wavelength of 295 nm was chosen, and the fluorescence signal was detected on the emission side at 355 nm. Excitation slit width varied from 3 to 5 nm, and emission slit width was in the range of 10–15 nm. For reasons of sensitivity the excitation wavelength for murPrP121–231 was set to 285 nm. Copper sulfate was added carefully to prevent possible precipitation (monitored by systematic excitation peak broadening in the emission spectra). Each point in the fluorescence titration curves represents the average of at least three measurements. Fluorescence titrations were performed at 20 °C. Due to absorption of copper in the UV range, fluorescence titration curves were corrected for inner filter effect (23Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap R.B. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All curves were corrected for background fluorescence. Mass spectrometry of N-terminal PrP fragments with and without copper were performed on a TSQ7000 (Finnigan) in the nano spray mode. The buffer was 1 mmNEMO/formic acid at pH 7.4. The applied spray voltage was 0.8–1.0 kV. Capillary temperature was set to 150 °C. Peptide and protein concentrations were determined in 6 m guanidinium chloride according to Gill and von Hippel (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Peptide quantification by amino acid analysis for humPrP60–91 resulted in identical values. ESI mass spectrometry was used to elucidate the stoichiometry of copper binding to the different N-terminal fragmentshumPrP60–91,humPrP60–109,humPrP23–98, andhumPrP23–112 as well as for the C-terminal fragment murPrP121–231 and for the full-length prion protein murPrP23–231. The experimental conditions for metal interaction studies at pH 7.4 with respect to suitable buffers and additives were intensively investigated. Finally, we introduced N-ethylmorpholine at pH 7.4 as a new buffer system for metal interaction studies with ESI MS, because it did not interfere with copper binding to peptides and protein compared with ammonium salt-containing buffers. Furthermore, addition of solvents like acetonitrile or methanol significantly affected the copper population in the ESI mass spectra (data not shown) and were therefore omitted. To avoid unspecific binding the copper concentration as well as the peptide concentration were kept as low as possible. For a negative control experiment we used hen egg lysozyme, since it is similar to the prion protein with respect to its size and isoelectric point. Besides the potential unspecific copper binding sites at the N-terminal amino group as well as C-terminal and side chain carboxyl groups, it has one histidine at amino acid position 15 just after the first helix, which is exposed to the solvent. As clearly shown in the spectra of lysozyme with (Fig. 1,B and C) and without copper (Fig. 1 A), even at a 10-fold excess of free copper(II) no significant binding occurred. For the first and second copper adduct mass differences of 61.7 and 61.3 average mass units were obtained, respectively. The low unspecific copper binding to lysozyme as a negative control demonstrated that NEMO is an excellent new buffer system for copper interaction experiments with proteins at a physiological pH of 7. ESI mass spectrometry of the N-terminal fragments (Fig.2) resulted in the expected average masses for the apopeptides ofhumPrP60–91,humPrP60–109, andhumPrP23–98 (TableI). In the spectrum of apohumPrP60–109, a by-product (Fig. 2 C, marked with triangles) with a corresponding mass of 4934.3 amu is observed. The mass difference of 127.6 suggests a missing lysine or glutamine residue in the by-product. The mass calculated from the spectrum of humPrP23–112 (Fig. 2 G) was 1 amu higher than the theoretically expected 9354.2 amu. This is probably due to the hydrolysis of Asn108 to Asp108 (25Sandmeier E. Hunziker P. Kunz B. Sack R. Christen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The same holds for the by-product (marked withtriangles) for which a mass of 8958.6 amu was obtained. The mass difference indicated that the three C-terminal amino acids KHM after Met109 have been cleaved off fromhumPrP23–112.Table IMolecular masses for the copper binding of the prion protein and its fragments calculated from ESI mass spectraPeptide/ProteinMass (amu)Δm(amu)humPrP60–913125.0 ± 0.13187.1 ± 0.562.13248.3 ± 0.161.23309.6 ± 0.361.33371.4 ± 0.261.8Average = 61.6humPrP60–1095061.9 ± 0.55123.4 ± 2.061.55184.5 ± 0.761.15246.3 ± 0.561.85306.8 ± 0.660.55367.4 ± 1.160.6Average = 61.1humPrP23–987813.0 ± 0.87873.9 ± 1.760.97936.4 ± 1.262.57998.1 ± 1.261.78059.2 ± 1.261.18121.2 ± 1.261.98184.0 ± 0.662.8Average = 61.8humPrP23–1129355.4 ± 0.39416.6 ± 0.961.29478.4 ± 0.661.89540.3 ± 0.761.99600.5 ± 0.860.19660.8 ± 1.560.3Average = 61.1murPrP121–23113335.5 ± 0.713397.3 ± 1.5Average = 61.8murPrP23–23123110.6 ± 3.123171.9 ± 2.161.323233.7 ± 3.861.823294.5 ± 4.360.823355.7 ± 2.761.223418.2 ± 2.862.5Average = 61.5 Open table in a new tab Adding a 5–10-fold excess of copper(II) to the apopeptides resulted in mass spectra (Fig. 2, B, D, F, andH) with several copper adduct peaks. On addition of 100 μm copper sulfate to 20 μm humPrP60–91, new m/z peaks appeared (Fig. 2 B) corresponding to up to four bound copper(II) per peptide molecule. The two small peaks between the two followingm/z copper peaks are always due to unspecific sodium and potassium adducts commonly observed in mass spectrometry of peptides and proteins at neutral pH. Adding 100 μm copper(II) to 10 μm humPrP60–109resulted in the appearance of additional m/z peaks due to the complex formation of up to five bound copper perhumPrP60–109 (Fig. 2 D). Note that the peaks apparently corresponding to zero (marked bydiamonds) and one bound copper forhumPrP60–109 are also the main peaks for the by-product with two and three bound copper, because their masses differ only by 4 amu and thus appeared as poorly resolved double peaks. Addition of 70 μm copper(II) to 10 μm humPrP23–98 (Fig. 2 F) led to the appearance of m/z peaks for up to six bound copper ions. It should be noted that adding a 10-fold excess (data not shown) above all significantly raised the intensity of them/z peaks for six bound copper ions, suggesting a less specific copper binding site. In contrast, only adduct peaks for up to five bound copper were observed on addition of 100 μm copper sulfate to 10 μm of the 14 amino acids longer humPrP23–112 (Fig. 2 H). The significant shift of m/z peaks to lower charge valuesz and thus higher m/z values on addition of copper suggests conformational changes associated with copper binding, resulting in a more folded or structured conformation compared with the apopeptides. The structured C-terminal domain of the prion proteinmurPrP121–231 was analyzed by ESI mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 I) and yielded a mass of 13335.5, which corresponds to the expected average molecular weight of 13334.8. On addition of up to 100 μm copper to 13 μmprotein, only one bound copper was observed (Fig. 2 J). This could be seen easier from the deconvoluted spectra (Fig.3 A). This site appears to be of lower affinity, because at 20 μm copper(II), which is the 1.5-fold excess in copper, only a peak of little intensity is observed. At 40 μm copper (a 3-fold excess of copper) the apoprotein peak almost disappeared, and the molecular weight peak for one bound copper became prominent. This remained almost unchanged, increasing the copper concentration up to 100 μm and indicating that there is probably one copper-binding site with lower affinity in murPrP121–231. In contrast to the N-terminal fragments, there is no shift of the m/z charge envelope to lower values. Thus, presumably no conformational change occurs on binding of the copper ion. From the mass spectrum of the apoprion proteinmurPrP23–231 (Fig. 2 K) an average mass of 23110.6 with a S.D. of 3.1 is obtained, which is about 6 amu higher than the expected molecular mass of 23104.4. The reason for this difference was unclear. On addition of up to 100 μm copper, several not very well resolved copper adduct peaks (Fig. 2 L) appeared. Due to the broad half-peak width and the high charges, the copper adduct peaks could be observed better from the deconvoluted spectra (Fig. 3 B). The deconvoluted spectra showed molecular weight peaks for up to five bound copper on addition of 20–100 μm copper. In contrast to the preceding spectra (20, 40, 60, and 80 μm) there are only minor changes in the spectra going from 80 to 100 μmcopper, suggesting a saturation of murPrP23–231with copper. The average molecular masses for all used peptides and proteins are summarized in Table I. From this table the average mass differences between the copper sites almost corresponds to 61.5 amu, which is typically observed in copper(II) binding ESI mass spectrometry experiments. Because the average mass of copper is 63.5 amu, the difference of 2 amu is explained as displacement of two hydrogens on binding of each copper ion (M + n·Cu − 2·n·H+). Comparing the results of humPrP60–109,humPrP23–98, andhumPrP23–112 only tohumPrP23–98, an additional sixth copper ion appears to be bound. ForhumPrP23–112, which is almost identical tohumPrP23–98 but C-terminally extended, only five bound copper were observed. AlsohumPrP60–109, which shares an almost identical C-terminal extension to the octarepeat region, binds only five copper ions. Therefore the binding of a sixth copper ion tohumPrP23–98 appears to be an unspecific copper-binding site. Thus up to five copper ions appear to be bound specifically to humPrP60–109,humPrP23–98, andhumPrP23–112, whereas four copper ions are bound to the octarepeat region, suggesting an additional copper-binding site within the N-terminal segment. Because the additional copper-binding site occurs already inhumPrP60–109, which is compared withhumPrP60–91 C-terminally extended, this additional binding site has to be located C-terminally of the octarepeat region. Fluorescence measurement and quantification of the copper binding to PrPC and its fragments were difficult with respect to some items. First, to prevent unspecific binding of copper to PrPC and its fragments, 100 mm NaCl was included. Second, to prevent unspecific aggregation and adsorption to surfaces 1 mm DTAC was added at a concentration clearly below critical micelle concentration (26Hjelmeland L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 135-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Third, for the quantification of affinities the peptide or PrPC concentrations were chosen to be significantly lower than the dissociation constants, to assume that the free copper concentration is approximately equal to the added copper concentration. Fourth, in contrast to, e.g. calcium, the fluorescence of peptides and proteins is not only quenched by conformational changes induced by copper(II) binding but also by diffusion-controlled collision of copper(II) with tryptophan and tyrosine side chains (27Syvertsen C. Melö T.B. Ljones T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 6-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Chen R.F. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1976: 573-606Google Scholar, 29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Thus fluorescence titration curves have to be recorded at copper concentrations far beyond the saturation point to get quantitative data from the fluorescence titration curves. The fluorescence titration curves with copper(II) for the N-terminal fragments humPrP60–91,humPrP60–109,humPrP23–98, andhumPrP23–112; the structured C-terminal fragment murPrP121–231; as well as for the full-length recombinant murPrP23–231 are shown in Fig. 4, A–F. All curves, except that for murPrP121–231, show more or less clearly visible sigmoidal changes in fluorescence intensity upon addition of copper, suggesting a basic cooperative binding mechanism. It appears that the peptides/protein cannot be saturated with copper at high concentrations. This is due to collisional quenching, which can be shown by plots according to the Stern-Volmer equation (28Chen R.F. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1976: 573-606Google Scholar), Fo/F=1+KSV·[Q]Equation 1 where F is the fluorescence at the individual concentration of the quencher [Q] (which is copper in this case), Fo is the initial fluorescence without quencher, and KSV is the quenching constant also called the Stern-Volmer constant. Above the saturation point of copper binding to the peptides or protein, the changes ofFo/F should be linear in Stern-Volmer plots if this is only due to collisional quenching. Indeed, with the exception of murPrP121–231 (Fig. 4 F,inset) the linearity in the Stern-Volmer plots of PrPC and its N-terminal fragments (Fig. 4, A—E,insets) showed that the fluorescence changes above ∼30–50 μm are the result of collisional quenching. The nonlinearity of the Stern-Volmer plot formurPrP121–231 might be explained by the different excitation wavelength of 285 nm instead of 295 nm used for reasons of sensitivity. The fluorescence ofmurPrP121–231, which has 11 tyrosines and only 1 tryptophan, probably reflects not only the Trp fluorescence but also the fluorescence of tyrosines, which are expected to have different dynamic copper-quenching properties. From these Stern-Volmer plots, the Stern-Volmer constants as well as the fraction of conformational fluorescence change caused by binding of copper fconf are calculated by linear regression analysis at high copper concentrations. For this purpose Equation 1 has to be modified, because it is only valid where exclusively collisional quenching occurs. In the presence of conformational fluorescence changes true values for KSV can be calculated, introducing a correction factor according to Equation 2. Fo/F=(1+KSV·[Q])/(1−fconf)Equation 2 where fconf is the fraction of conformational fluorescence changes. Thus to obtain the true value forKSV the slopes from the Stern-Volmer plots have to be divided by the value of the ordinate 1/(1 −fconf). The Stern-Volmer plots yield values forfconf and KSV (TableII). The Stern-Volmer constant is used later to fit fluorescence data by nonlinear regression to obtain copper binding data. The values for KSVrepresent a measure for the accessibility of tryptophan residues. ForhumPrP60–109,humPrP23–98, andhumPrP23–112, KSVdecreases from almost 4000 m−1 to about 2500 m−1, suggesting that the tryptophans become more buried in the holopeptides with longer fragment size. The reason for the at least 5–10-fold higher value for murPrP23–231 is not known but has to be an effect of the C-terminal domain. Although the Stern-Volmer plot of murPrP121–231 (Fig. 4 F,inset) could not be fitted very well with Equation 2, a similar Stern-Volmer constant of 22,000m−1 could be estimated considering only data from 30 to 80 μm copper.Table IIParameter for the dynamic and conformational fluorescence quenching of the prion protein and its N-terminal fragments by copper(II)KSV2-aData obtained by fitting with modified Stern-Volmer Equation 2.fconf2-bData obtained by fitting to Equation 2 data in parentheses are the sum of findand fcoop.Kind2-cData obtained by fitting to Equation 3.find2-cData obtained by fitting to Equation 3.Kcoop2-cData obtained by fitting to Equation 3.fcoop2-cData obtained by fitting to Equation 3.nHill2-cData obtained by fitting to Equation 3.m−1μmμmhumPrP60–9132300.53 (0.53)—2-dOnly cooperative sites were assumed and thus fitted without a mathematical term for an independent site (Equation 3).—2-dOnly cooperative sites were assumed and thus fitted without a mathematical term for an independent site (Equation 3).5.50.532.4humPrP60–10939800.71 (0.73)8.80.252.50.483.7humPrP23–9834900.76 (0.78)1.40.192.20.583.6humPrP23–11225600.72 (0.73)2.40.252.20.483.7murPrP23–231225000.75 (0.76)1.80.282.20.484.22-a Data obtained by fitting with modified Stern-Volmer Equation 2.2-b Data obtained by fitting to Equation 2 data in parentheses are the sum of findand fcoop.2-c Data obtained by fitting to Equation 3.2-d Only cooperative sites were assumed and thus fitted without a mathematical term for an independent site (Equation 3). Open table in a new tab From the fluorescence titration curves (Fig. 4, A–E) it is apparent that there is a significant increase in affinity for copper(II) going from humPrP60–91 (Fig.4 A) to humPrP60–109 (Fig.4 B). Again a small increase in affinity can be observed going further to humPrP23–98 (Fig.4 C), whereas the affinities ofhumPrP23–98 andhumPrP23–112 (Fig. 4 D), as well as for the full-length recombinant murPrP23–231(Fig. 4 E) seem to be identical. To get quantitative copper binding data the titration curves were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis. ESI mass spectrometry has confirmed that four copper ions bind to the octarepeat region (humPrP60–91). The mass spectrometry data suggest that one additional copper binding site exists forhumPrP60–109,humPrP23–98,humPrP23–112, andmurPrP23–231. This site was assumed to be independent, because particularly the titration curves forhumPrP23–98,humPrP23–112, andmurPrP23–231 could only be fitted with a"

Jean C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is unclear how signaling by these nonsteroid growth factors or kinase pathways overlap with the AR activation pathway. Either they directly affect the assembly or transport of the transformed AR or they affect AR transcriptional activity by interacting with overlapping general transcriptional regulators. Recent studies by Thompson and colleagues (9Yang G. Truong L.D. Timme T.L. Ren C. Wheeler T.M. Park S.H. Nasu Y. Bangma C.H. Kattan M.W. Scardino P.T. Thompson T.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1873-1880PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that expression of caveolin-1 may regulate androgen responsiveness in prostate cancer. They found, in samples from patients with prostate cancer, a positive correlation between expression of caveolin-1 and progression of the cancer (9Yang G. Truong L.D. Timme T.L. Ren C. Wheeler T.M. Park S.H. Nasu Y. Bangma C.H. Kattan M.W. Scardino P.T. Thompson T.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1873-1880PubMed Google Scholar). Using tumor cells derived from the mouse prostate reconstitution model (10Thompson T.C. Park S.H. Timme T.L. Ren C. Eastham J.A. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Kadmon D. Yang G.

Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of caveolin-1 in tumor samples from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy suggested that caveolin-1 immunostaining is an independent predictor of disease progression (13Yang G. Truong L.D. Wheeler T.M. Thompson T.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5719-5723PubMed Google Scholar). Among 187 specimens from lymph node-negative cancers, 47 were found with caveolin-1 immunoreactivity, which correlates with a shorter interval to postsurgical recurrence. Caveolin-1, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a major component of the caveolae membrane structures, with a flask-shaped invagination that are enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipid as well as with lipid-modified signaling proteins. Caveolin-1 has been implicated as a principal structural scaffold for the oligomerization and organization of cytoplasmic signal complexes (14Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 15Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev.

Interaction with and modulation by caveolin-1 has been shown in many signal transduction pathways, including those regulated by receptor or soluble tyrosine kinases. Caveolin-1 has been shown to regulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (17Zundel W. Swiersz L.M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and to associate with and regulate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (18Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression in 3T3 cells results in hyperactivation of mitogen-activated p42/44 protein kinases as well as loss of anchorage-dependent cell growth (22Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 23Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, the physiological consequences of caveolin-1 overexpression remain controversial. Interaction of caveolin-1 with many of the signal transduction components is thought to have important consequences for cellular transformation. In lung and breast cancer cells, overexpression of caveolin-1 results in reduced transformation phenotypes (24Racine C. Belanger M. Hirabayashi H. Boucher M. Chakir J. Couet J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), suggesting a tumor suppressor role of caveolin-1. A reciprocal relationship between Her2/Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 expression has been documented in mammary adenocarcinoma. Ectopic overexpression of caveolin-1 inhibits Her2/Neu activityin vivo, a further suggestion of a tumor suppressor role of caveolin-1 (26Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M.

In cells derived from an mouse prostate reconstitution model, however, overexpression of caveolin-1 promotes resistance to apoptosis induced by androgen withdrawal, suggesting a promoter role of caveolin-1 in prostate tumor progression (12Nasu Y. Timme T.L. Yang G. Bangma C.H. Li L. Ren C. Park S.H. DeLeon M. Wang J. Thompson T.C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Steroid hormone estrogen receptors have been shown to be potentiated by caveolin-1 in their transcriptional activities (27Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nongenomic estradiol stimulation of nitric oxide release has been shown to be mediated by estrogen receptors localized in caveolae (28Kim H.P. Lee J.Y. Jeong J.K. Bae S.W. Lee H.K. Jo I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we investigate the potential interactions between AR signaling and caveolin-1. We demonstrate that overexpression of caveolin-1 potentiates ligand-dependent AR activation and, conversely, that down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression by a caveolin-1 antisense expression construct can down-regulate ligand-dependent AR activation. We also demonstrate an association between these two molecules by finding co-localization of AR with caveolin-rich, low-density membrane fractions isolated by an equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation method. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST fusion protein pull-down experiments demonstrated that interaction between AR and caveolin-1 is an androgen-dependent process, offering further evidence for a physiological role of this interaction. Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay system, we determine that the caveolin-1 NH2 terminus region is responsible for the interaction with both the NH2-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR. Dihydrotesteosterone (DHT) was purchased from Sigma, polyclonal antibody to caveolin-1 from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), monoclonal antibody against AR from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal antibody to hemagglutinin antigen (HA) from Berkeley Antibody (Berkeley, CA). A kit for selection of transfected cells, Capture-Tec System, was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and charcoal-dextran treated fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Denver, CO). Human AR pSV-hAR (29Trapman J. Klaassen P. Kuiper G.G. van der Korput J.A. Faber P.W. van Rooij H.C. Geurts van Kessel A. Voorhorst M.M. Mulder E. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was cloned into pCDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) downstream of a CMV immediate early promoter. Sense and antisense caveolin-1 constructs, a gift from H. Chapman (Harvard Medical School), were cloned into the pCEP4 and pMEP4 vectors, respectively (Invitrogen). An androgen-responsive luciferase reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter was constructed by inserting four synthetic tandem repeats of the androgen-responsive element (ARE) primers (5′-TGTACAGGATGTTCTGAATTCCATGTACAGGATGTTCT-3′ and 5′-AGAACATCCTGTACATGAATTCAAGAACATCCTGTACA-3′) in front of an E1b minimal TATA box sequence, followed by a firefly luciferase gene. A renilla luciferase reporter gene driven by a CMV promoter was used as a transient transfection internal control. Mammalian two-hybrid expression vectors expressing fusion protein of VP16-AR (full-length), AR-N-(1–500), DBD-(501–660), and LBD-(661–919) were constructed by cloning the corresponding fragments in-frame with partial herpes transactivating protein (VP16, residues 411–456) as a fusion gene into the pACT vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Caveolin-1 full-length and truncated mutants (Cav-(1–60), Cav-(58–178), Cav-(60–100), and Cav-(135–178)) were cloned in-frame fused with GAL4-DBD (residues 1–147) in a pBIND vector (Promega). Luciferase reporters pTet-off (encoding a tetracycline repressor protein driven by CMV promoter) and pTRE-luc (luciferase reporter driven by seven tandem repeats of tetracyclin-responsive element-fused minimal promoter) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), pGAL-VP16 (CMV-driven expression vector of Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused with VP16 transactivating domain) (O. Gjoerup, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), and pG5-Luc (luciferase driven by five tandem-repeats of Gal4 binding sequence-fused minimal promoter) (Promega) were used as nonandrogen responsive reporter control vector for monitoring general transcriptional activities. PC3 and LNCap cells were kept in RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells overexpressing caveolin (293-Cav) or harboring an antisense caveolin driven by a metallothionine promoter (293-AS), gift of Dr. Chapman (30Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), were kept in the same medium as 293 cells supplemented with hygromycin. For androgen stimulation experiments, cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Cells were transfected by electroporation with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), and a luciferase assay was performed 48 h after transfection. The pCDNA3.0 vector (Invitrogen) was used to subclone the full-length human caveolin-1 cDNA downstream of the CMV promoter. LNCap cells were transfected with pCDNA-Cav (LNCap-Cav), and an empty vector was used as a noncaveolin expressing LNCap parental control. Clones were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. Low-density, caveolae-rich membrane fractions were isolated as described previously (31Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Four 100-mm dishes of caveolin-1-expressing LNCap cells (LNCap-Cav) were grown to confluence (a total 2 × 107 cells), scraped into 1.5 ml of 0.5m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11.0), homogenized with a hand-held Polytron on ice (three 3-s bursts at medium speed), and sonicated (three 1-min bursts at 90% output with a Branson 450 sonicator). The resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation on a bench-top centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were mixed with equal amounts of 90% sucrose in Mes-buffered saline (MBS; 50 mm Mes, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl) to make a concentration of 45% sucrose. Lysates containing the 45% sucrose were transferred to a centrifuge tube and overlaid with 4 ml each of 35 and 5% sucrose in MBS containing 0.25m carbonate. The gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm (200,000 × g) for 21 h with a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. The resulting gradient fractions were analyzed by collecting 12 1-ml fractions from the bottom of the gradient. The fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against either AR or caveolin-1. A mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed with the vector system, pBIND and pACT, commercially available from Promega. Interaction between AR and caveolin-1 was determined with pACT-AR and its truncated mutants derived from full-length AR with pBIND-caveolin constructs. HeLa cells were transfected with the above expression constructs along with a luciferase reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter fused with GAL4-binding element. Activity was determined by a dual luciferase assay (Promega) in the presence and absence of 1 nm DHT. Fold induction relative to basal activity of cells transfected with straight pACT and pBIND control vectors was calculated and normalized to the renilla luciferase internal transfection control. A standard protocol was used for immunoprecipitation of AR and caveolin-1. In brief, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 60 mm octylglucoside and supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm edta). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with individual antibodies (1 μg) and protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl of packed beads) at 4 °C for 1 h. At the end of incubation, beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitated immunocomplexes were solubilized in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein complex was detected by Western blot analysis and developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). GST-caveolin fusion protein was created by fusing full-length caveolin-1 in-frame to the 3′ end of glutathione transferase using a PGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under the regulation of a tac promoter. In vitro translated AR labeled with [35S]methionine was obtained with the TNT system for coupled transcription and translationin vitro (Promega). GST-Cav fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads and resuspended in binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). GST-Cav packed beads (20 μl) were incubated with in vitro translated AR labeled with [35S]methionine in a total of 40 μl of binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 nm DHT for 4 h. After incubation, the beads were washed 5 times with 1.5 ml of washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). The resulting GST·Cav complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To enrich positive transfectants in a transient transfection experiment, we employed the commercially available kit Capture-Tec (Invitrogen). The procedure for isolation of positive transfectants was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, PC3 cells for AR reporter assay experiments were co-transfected with pHook-1 plasmid encoding a membrane-anchored single-chain antibody (sFv) directed against the hapten 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one. 16 h after transfection, cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline; 10 μl of hapten-coated colloidal beads was added to 2 × 106 transfected cells and incubated at 37 °C with constant mixing for 30 min. Transfected cells expressing sFv were selected by immobilizing cells on a magnetic stand in an Eppendorf tube, while cells not expressing sFv were washed away. The resulting cells were subjected to biochemical analysis or replating for the AR reporter gene assay. To determine the recovery efficiency for positive transfectants, we used PC3 cells that were co-transfected with pHook-1 and green fluorescence protein and then counterstained with Hochst dye in a parallel experiment to monitor recovery rate by counting green fluorescent cells under a fluorescence microscope. We were constantly able to enrich cells from 90% to 95% with positive green fluorescence protein expression as compared with <10% positive transfectants in a preselected population. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with a standard reducing condition protocol. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein bands were visualized by Ponceau S staining. Blots were blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl). Immunoblotting was performed with designated antibodies and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. High levels of caveolin-1 expression have been observed to correlate with the sensitivity of murine metastatic prostate cancer cells to androgen withdrawal (12Nasu Y. Timme T.L. Yang G. Bangma C.H. Li L. Ren C. Park S.H. DeLeon M. Wang J. Thompson T.C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), a finding that suggests caveolin plays a role in AR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we used a cell culture model to determine whether changes in the levels of caveolin-1 expression alter ligand-dependent AR activation. The HEK293 cells expressed detectably lower levels of caveolin-1 compared with the PC3 cells, allowing for greater manipulation of caveolin-1 expression by transfection (data not shown). We used HEK293 lines stably transfected with either a wild-type caveolin-1 construct (293-Cav) or an antisense caveolin-1 construct (293-AS) driven by either CMV or an inducible metallothionine promoter, respectively. As shown in Fig.1 A, 293-Cav constitutively expresses levels of caveolin-1 ∼10 times higher than those expressed by the parental vector control HEK293 line, as determined by video densitometry. Expression of caveolin-1 in the 293-AS cells was further reduced to 25% of the level of parental 293 control group when an antisense construct driven by a metallothionine promoter was induced by inclusion of 1 μm cadmium in the culture medium. Responses of AR signaling in cells expressing different levels of caveolin-1 expression were determined by transient co-transfection of pCDNA-hAR and p(ARE)4-Luc into the above mentioned cell lines, followed by exposure to DHT (1 nm). As shown in Fig.1 B, in the absence of DHT stimulation, overexpression of caveolin-1 resulted in a 4-fold elevation of basal ARE-luciferase reporter activity in 293-Cav cells as compared with that of parental 293 vector control cells. These results suggest that caveolin-1 overexpression sensitizes cells to AR mediated signaling which induces a moderate ligand-independent activation of AR. This observation is consistent with the previous finding that caveolin-1 overexpression promotes estrogen receptor α ligand-independent signaling (27Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the DHT-stimulated groups (293 versus 293-Cav), overexpressing caveolin-1 dramatically up-regulated the expression of ARE-luciferase reporter which may be the result of cell sensitization. Down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression by a caveolin antisense construct limited the induction of ligand-dependent AR transcription activation to one-half of level of the control parental cells. Thus, caveolin-1 overexpression is sufficient to induce a moderate ligand-independent activation of AR, and caveolin-1 potentiates AR transcriptional activity in the presence of ligand. On the other hand, the anti-androgen bicalutamide (Casodex) completely blocked the AR-mediated transactivation of luciferase gene expression regardless of caveolin-1 overexpression. Overexpression of caveolin-1 does not alter AR ligand specificity since estrogen does not stimulate the AR response (data not shown). We determined that this modulated AR transactivation response was not the result of different levels of AR expression in various transfection groups. As demonstrated in Fig.1 A (lower panel), the expression level of AR is maintained at similar levels in each group. Two AR unresponsive negative control promoter/reporter systems, pGAL-VP16/pG5-luc and ptetR-VP16/pTRE-luc, were tested to demonstrate that changes in the level of caveolin-1 expression do not affect the general transcription activities (Fig. 1 C). We hypothesize that cultured cell lines overexpressing caveolin-1 sensitize AR (making it “hyperactive”) by lowering the critical concentration of androgen required for AR activation. Using the same transient transfection assay, we tested this hypothesis by establishing an androgen dose-response curve for ligand-dependent AR activation in HEK293 cells expressing various levels of caveolin-1. As shown in Fig. 2, the IC50 for the ligand-dependent activation of vector control parental 293 cells was approximated at 0.5 nm DHT. In contrast, the 293-Cav cells required only 0.02 nm DHT to achieve the same fold stimulation (determined by interpolation), 25 times lower than that required by the parental 293 cells. The left-shift of the dose-response curve indicated an increase in fold stimulation of AR in response to DHT in 293-Cav cells compared with parental 293 cells and 293-AS cells. This experiment demonstrated that caveolin-1 overexpression in 293-Cav cells dramatically increased androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional activation as 293-CAV cells required a much lower concentration of androgen to achieve the same androgenic responses as that achieved by the 293 parental vector control cells. To further confirm these results, we tested the prostate cancer PC3 cell line. Since PC3 expresses very high levels of caveolin-1, efforts to increase levels of caveolin expression appreciably by heterologous overexpression proved futile (data not shown). We used a transient system with an antisense caveolin-1 construct to down-regulate the expression. By co-transfecting a membrane-anchored mouse sFv receptor (see “Experimental Procedures”) with antisense caveolin-1 into PC3 cells, we were able to enrich the positive transfectants harboring the caveolin antisense expression vector in a transient transfection experiment with the aid of colloidal magnets coated with sFv-binding hapten. As shown in Fig. 3 A, an antisense vector dose-dependent down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression in PC3 cells was observed, whereas the levels of AR protein remained equal in various groups. This system was used in parallel to test our hypothesis concerning caveolin-1 modulation of AR transcription. As shown in Fig. 3 B, down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression in PC3 cells by antisense caveolin-1 reduced the androgen sensitivity of AR. This reduction in AR transactivation activity, as shown in Fig. 3 A, was not due to reduced levels of AR expression. Down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression by antisense did not affect AR-unresponsive general transcriptional activity of the pGAL-VP16/pG5-Luc reporter system (Fig. 3 C). These results strongly suggest that cross-talk occurs between the AR activation pathway and the caveolin-1-associated signal complex and further indicate that the level of caveolin expression correlates positively with AR-mediated transcriptional activity. The results of AR activity modulated by caveolin-1 expression suggest potential physical interactions between these two molecules. To evaluate the association of AR with caveolin-rich caveolae membrane complex, we performed equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation (31Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) to determine whether these two molecules co-localize in the caveolin-enriched membrane fractions"
https://openalex.org/W2010503769,"Collectrin, a novel homolog of angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2), was identified during polymerase chain reaction-based cDNA subtraction and up-regulated in 5/6 ablated kidneys at hypertrophic phase. Collectrin, with 222 amino acids, has an apparent signal peptide and a transmembrane domain; the sequence is conserved in mouse, rat, and human and shares 81.9% identity. Human collectrin has 47.8% identity with non-catalytic extracellular, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains of ACE2; however, unlike ACE and ACE2, collectrin lacks active dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase catalytic domains. The collectrin mRNA transcripts are expressed exclusively in the kidney. <i>In situ</i> hybridization reveals its mRNA expression in renal collecting ducts, and immunohistochemistry shows that it is localized to the luminal surface and cytoplasm of collecting ducts. Immunoprecipitation studies, using [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled renal cortical and inner medullar collecting duct cells, <i>i.e</i>. M-1 and mIMCD-3, indicate that the protein size is ∼32 kDa. During the development of mouse kidney, mRNA signal is detectable at day 13 of gestation, and the protein product is observed in the ureteric bud branches. Its expression is progressively increased during later stages of the gestation extending into the neonatal periods and then is decreased in adult life. Up-regulated expression of collectrin in the hypertrophic kidneys after renal ablation and restricted spatio-temporal expression during development indicates a possible role(s)in the process of progressive renal failure and renal organogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2089947504,"Previously, we noted that inorganic phosphate (Pi), a major component of bone extracellular matrix, induced osteoblast apoptosis (Meleti, Z., Shapiro, I. M., and Adams, C. S. (2000) Bone (NY) 27, 359–366). Since Ca2+ along with Pi is released from bone during the resorption process, we advanced the hypothesis that Ca2+ modulates Pi-mediated osteoblast apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, osteoblasts were incubated with both ions, and cell death was determined. We noted that a modest increase in the medium Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]e) of 0.1–1 mm caused a profound and rapid enhancement in Pi-dependent death of cultured osteoblasts. An elevation in [Ca2+]e alone had no effect on osteoblast viability, whereas Ca2+ channel blockers failed to inhibit killing of ion pair-treated cells. These results indicated that Pi-mediated cell death is not dependent on a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling analysis and measurement of caspase-3 activity of the ion pair-treated cells suggested that death was apoptotic. Apoptosis was confirmed using caspase-3 and endonuclease inhibitors. The mitochondrial membrane potential and cytosolic Ca2+ status of the treated cells were evaluated. After incubation with [Ca2+ ]e and Pi, a decrease in mitochondrial fluorescence was noted, suggesting that the ions decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Subsequent to the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential, there was a transient elevation in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Results of the study suggest that the ion pair conspire at the level of the plasma membrane to induce intracellular changes that result in loss of mitochondrial function. The subsequent increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration may trigger downstream events that transduce osteoblast apoptosis. Previously, we noted that inorganic phosphate (Pi), a major component of bone extracellular matrix, induced osteoblast apoptosis (Meleti, Z., Shapiro, I. M., and Adams, C. S. (2000) Bone (NY) 27, 359–366). Since Ca2+ along with Pi is released from bone during the resorption process, we advanced the hypothesis that Ca2+ modulates Pi-mediated osteoblast apoptosis.

Subsequent to the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential, there was a transient elevation in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Results of the study suggest that the ion pair conspire at the level of the plasma membrane to induce intracellular changes that result in loss of mitochondrial function. The subsequent increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration may trigger downstream events that transduce osteoblast apoptosis.

N. Eng. J. Med. 1973; 289: 864-865PubMed Google Scholar). Within each of these units, the actual process of bone removal is carried out by osteoclasts; replacement bone matrix is synthesized and mineralized by cells of stromal origin, osteoblasts. Examination of resorbing sites in developing skeletal tissues indicates that many of the cells are apoptotic (3Bronckers A.L.J.J. Goei W. Luo G. Karsenty G. D'Souza R.N. Lyaruu D.M. Burger E.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1281-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, there is evidence of DNA fragmentation in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes (4Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 5Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast, in mature skeletal tissues, only about 1–2% of all bone cells are dying or dead. In both the developing and mature skeleton, most of the apoptotic cells are confined to bone remodeling sites or locales of high bone turnover (5Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M.

Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). How osteoclasts communicate with and regulate the life history of other cells of the basic multicellular unit is a topic of intense debate. It is clear that osteoclast differentiation and activation are dependent on paracrine signals received from stromal cells in the multicellular unit (9Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T.,. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Within the past four years, chemical modulators of these processes have been identified, and recent evidence indicates that growth factors provide survival signals that result in bone cell proliferation and depression of the apoptotic process (5Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 6Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that a number of pharmacological agents can induce osteoblast apoptosis in vitro (5Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Hill P.A. Tumber A. Meikle M.C.

Tissue Int. 1998; 63: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, little is known of events that promote osteoblast death in situ. Although the resorption process may generate agents that stimulate osteoblast proliferation, it is probable that products of the resorbing bone may also stimulate bone cell death. Recent work from this laboratory has clearly demonstrated that one of the ions present in the bone matrix, inorganic phosphate (Pi), induces apoptosis of cultured human osteoblasts and chondrocytes (1Meleti Z. Shapiro I.M. Adams C.S. Bone ( NY ). 2000; 27: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Mansfield K. Rajpurohit R. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since Ca2+ as well as Pi are released from the bone apatite lattice during the resorption process, the possibility exists that Ca2+ may influence Pi-mediated bone cell apoptosis. To test the hypothesis that this ion pair may trigger the death program, we examine the effect of Pi and Ca2+ on human osteoblast-like cells. We ask the questions, Can Ca2+ modulate Pi-induced cell death, and, if so, is death mediated by apoptosis? Using a cell culture system, we demonstrate that Ca2+ accentuates the apoptogenic effect of Pi. In addition, we provide evidence for the involvement of mitochondria and intracellular Ca2+ in the apoptotic pathway activated by the ion pair. Specimens of human bone were obtained during dental surgery performed at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and during spinal surgery performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA). Ages of the samples ranged from 9 to 32 years. The bone was chopped into very small pieces using a pair of rongeurs. The pieces were then digested in 10 ml of bacterial collagenase (4.6 mg/ml) (Sigma) in Ca2+- and Mg+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaker bath. The supernatant was discarded, and the bone fragments were placed into cell culture dishes (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) containing Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM)1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. The Piconcentration of this medium was 0.9 mm, and the Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) was 1.8 mm. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a sterile incubator, and the medium was changed every day. Cell migration from the bone fragments was monitored daily by light microscopy. After a period of 3–6 weeks, osteoblast-like cells grew out from the explant. When confluent, cells were released from the tissue culture dishes by a brief treatment with 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% bacterial collagenase (Sigma) in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were collected and replated at a density of 140 cells/mm2. Secondary cultures were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and antibiotics. After 48 h, fresh ascorbate (10 μg/ml) was added to the medium. Cells were fed fresh ascorbate at every media change. The osteogenic characteristics of the cells were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using probes for Cbfa-1, osteocalcin, osteonectin, and type I collagen (as described in Meletiet al. (1Meleti Z. Shapiro I.M. Adams C.S. Bone ( NY ). 2000; 27: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)). We also examined the effect of the ion pair on MC-3T3-E1 cells, a cell line that, in culture, recapitulates each of the major steps in osteoblast maturation (14Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These cells were grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml ascorbate as described above. After 7 days in culture, the osteogenic characteristics of the cells were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using probes for Cbfa-1, osteocalcin, osteonectin, and type I collagen (see above). Osteoblast viability was assessed as a function of the Pi concentration and [Ca2+]e as well as treatment time. Piwas added to the medium in the form of sodium phosphate. The addition of 2, 4, and 6 mm sodium phosphate resulted in a final medium Pi concentration of 3, 5, and 7 mm. Ca2+ was added as calcium chloride. The addition of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm Ca2+ resulted in final medium Ca2+ concentrations of 2.0, 2.4, and 2.9 mmCa2+, respectively. In a parallel experiment, the effect of the Na-Pi transport inhibitor, phosphonoformic acid (PFA), on ion pair-induced cell death was also evaluated. In addition, we determined whether the Ca2+ channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, lanthanum chloride, and gadolinium chloride) could modulate Ca2+- and Pi-dependent apoptosis. All of these agents were purchased from Sigma. In each case, cell death was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MTT assay is based on the ability of mitochondria in live cells to oxidize thiazolyl blue, a tetrazolium salt (MTT; Sigma)), to an insoluble blue formazan product. Cells were treated with the agents for the indicated time periods, washed, and then incubated with MTT (120 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h. The reagent was removed, and 400 μl of 0.04 m HCl in isopropanol was added to each well. The optical density of the solution was read at 595 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) plate reader (15McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Since the generation of the blue product is proportional to the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, the decrease in the absorbance at 595 nm provided a direct measurement of cell death. Although we have previously demonstrated that Pi induced osteoblast apoptosis (1Meleti Z. Shapiro I.M. Adams C.S. Bone ( NY ). 2000; 27: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), it was important to determine whether the ion pair kills bone cells by activating apoptosis. Three different approaches were employed. The TUNEL assay takes advantage of the fact that during apoptosis, nuclear endonucleases cleave linker DNA into fragments of multiples of ∼200 base pairs. The cell cultures were treated with the ion pair, and the fragmented nucleotide ends were labeled using a Klenow FragEL kit (Oncogene Research products, Cambridge, MA). Untreated osteoblasts were used as controls. Cells were then treated with proteinase K (20 mg/ml) at room temperature for 15 min. We have previously established that the duration of proteinase K treatment does not cause cleavage of linker DNA (13Mansfield K. Rajpurohit R. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by exposing cells to 3% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were equilibrated in a transferase buffer for 5–10 min and then incubated in a reaction mixture containing biotin-labeled deoxynucleotides and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase at 37 °C. After 60 min, the reaction was stopped, and the biotinylated nucleotides were attached to streptavidin peroxidase. These labeled nucleotides were then detected using an antidigoxigenin antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. To aid detection, the cells were not counterstained. Caspase-3 is a downstream effector of the apoptotic response in osteoblasts. To confirm that the ion pair induced osteoblast apoptosis, we evaluated the activity of the enzyme in treated cells using a fluorescent caspase substrate, PhiPhiLuxG1D2 (OncoImmunin Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). This reagent becomes fluorescent after interaction with the activated enzyme, and the increase in fluorescence is proportional to the change in caspase-3 activity (16Komoriya A. Packard B.Z. Brown M.J. Wu M.L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with the ion pair for time periods ranging from 30 to 275 min. At each time point, the wells were washed twice and incubated with 10 μm PhiPhiLux-G1D2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess substrate was removed, the cells were washed twice, and the cellular fluorescence was captured by the confocal microscope. Apoptosis is dependent on activation of a number of effector enzymes; inhibition of these enzymes blocks apoptosis. To confirm that the ion pair induces apoptosis, we inhibited the upstream effector enzyme, caspase-3, and downstream endonucleases. To block caspase activity, osteoblasts were incubated with DEVD-CHO (50–300 μm) (Calbiochem), a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, for 2 h before treatment with 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mmCa2+. After 24 h, cell death was evaluated by the MTT assay. To block endonuclease activity, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (Sigma) was utilized (17Andrew D.J. Hay A.M. Evans S.W. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 41: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 10–100 μm ATA for 2 h and then treated with 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+. Again, cell death was evaluated by the MTT assay. Osteoblasts were treated with a number of different Ca2+ channel blockers to determine if it was necessary for [Ca2+]e to enter the cell to activate apoptosis. Initially, cells were incubated for 2 h with the specificl-type Ca2+-channel inhibitors, nifedipine (10–100 μm), and verapamil (10–100 μm) (18Atlas D. Adler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Then the osteoblasts were treated with 5 mmPi and 2.9 mm Ca2+ for a further 24 h. The experiment was repeated using the generalized Ca2+ channel inhibitor, lanthanum chloride (19Radding W. Jordan S.E. Hester R.B. Blair H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and a specific stretch-activated Ca2+ channel inhibitor, gadolinium chloride (20Ryder K.D. Duncan R.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 67: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all cases, cell death was determined using the MTT procedure. A combination of fluorescent probes was used to examine the impact of exogenous inorganic ions on the cytosolic Ca2+ status and mitochondrial membrane potential (as indicated in Lemasters et al. (21Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y.X.C.R. Cascio W.E. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Herman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar)). Cells plated onto 12-well plates were treated with 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+for 2, 4, and 6 h, as described earlier. At the end of each of these time periods, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM containing 1 μm Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or 5 μm Calcium Green 1- AM (Molecular Probes) for 20–40 min. This medium was then removed and replaced with fresh phenol red-free DMEM. Cells were then analyzed with the Olympus Fluoview inverted confocal microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) with a long-working distance lens; a specialized cap was used to permit evaluation of the cells through the plastic dish. To permit quantification, the plane of maximum fluorescence was determined, and the photomultiplier tube voltage was set at that point for the control wells. These parameters were then utilized to measure the relative fluorescence of the treated cells. Cellular brightness was quantified using the Fluoview software. For each field of view, the brightness of 20 cells was averaged. Data from the MTT assay were normalized to control well values and expressed as a percentage of the control. The values were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance test, testing the effect of treatment of each well on cell vitality. When required, the data were normalized by taking the square roots of the measured value (22Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 6th Ed. The Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa1967Google Scholar). When that correction did not achieve normality, a Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance on ranks was run. Each cohort of cells removed from the explant seed cultures was treated as a separate replicate. The figures show data representative of experiments repeated 3–5 times. Significance was assessed whenp < 0.05. When treated with Ca2+ and Pi, osteoblast-like cells exhibit a dose-dependent decrease in viability (Fig. 1). It should be noted that in the presence of 1 mm Pi, an elevation in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) does not induce cell death. Even if [Ca2+]e is raised to 9.8 mm, when the medium Pi concentration is held constant at 1 mm, there is no loss of viability (Fig. 1 A). However, when the medium Pi level is set at 3 mm, a small rise in [Ca2+]e causes a marked increase in cell death (Fig. 1 B). At this Pi concentration, 2.9 mm[Ca2+]e decreases osteoblast-like cell viability by 80%. At higher concentrations of Pi (5 and 7 mm), elevated [Ca2+]e levels increase the sensitivity of the cells to Pi (Figs. 1, Cand D). At these concentrations, 2.4 mm[Ca2+]e kills more than 80 and 90% of osteoblasts, respectively. Fig. 1, A–E, also indicates that the response of MC-3T3-E1 cells to the ion pair is similar but not identical to that of osteoblast-like cells. Thus, in comparison with osteoblast-like cells, MC-3T3-E1 cells show a greater sensitivity to both 3 mm Pi and 2.4 mmCa2+ and 5 mm Pi and 1.9 mm Ca2+. In summary, the combined data set shown in Fig. 1 indicates that a modest elevation in [Ca2+]e promotes Pi-mediated cell death in primary osteoblasts and in MC-3T3-E1 cells. The Ca2+ activation of Pi-mediated cell death is quite rapid (Fig. 2). By 2 h, there is a 50% loss of cell viability and by 6 h, more than 80% of the osteoblasts are dead. A rapid loss of viability is also observed when MC-3T3-E1 cells are treated with medium containing similar concentrations of [Ca2+]e and [Pi]. These results together with those shown in Fig. 1 confirm that [Ca2+]e promotes a sustained elevation in the rate of induction of death processes in Pi-treated osteoblasts. Results of three different series of experiments indicate that the osteoblast dies by apoptosis after treatment with Ca2+ and Pi. TUNEL analysis suggests that cells treated with 3 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+exhibit fragmented DNA. Fig. 3 shows that the osteoblast-like cells have contracted away from the underlying matrix and contain TUNEL-positive nuclei. These morphological changes are characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. Use of the fluorescent caspase-3 substrate, PhiPhiLuxG1D2, indicates that in the presence of the ion pair, there is a progressive rise in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4). With time, there is an elevation in fluorescent cells. Thus, by 30 min, a few faintly positive cells are evident; by 140 min, many of the cells are positive, and some cells exhibit a high level of fluorescence. This proportion of positive cells remains constant through successive time points. It is likely that the cell to cell variation in fluorescence is due to the transitory nature of caspase-3 activity. A parallel experiment was performed to inhibit activities of downstream death effector endonucleases. When the ion pair concentration is elevated to 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+, ATA blocks cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Likewise, the inhibition of caspase-3 activity blocks apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). At concentrations above 200 μm, DEVD-CHO, the specific inhibitor of caspase-3, stops cell killing. In summary, a combination of [Ca2+]e and Pi induce cell death, which is caspase- and endonuclease-dependent and characterized by the appearance of fragmented DNA. These results are all consistent with the notion that the ion pair induces osteoblast apoptosis.Figure 4Activation of caspase-3 by treatment with Pi and Ca2+. Osteoblasts were treated with 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+for the indicated time periods. Cells were then treated with the fluorescent caspase-3 substrate, 10 μm PhiPhiLux-G2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Images of the cells were then captured using the Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. Note the progressive increase in cellular fluorescence, indicating activation of caspase-3, a critical apoptosis effector enzyme.

Cells were then cultured for 24 h in the presence of 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mmCa2+. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. At concentrations above 40 μm, ATA, an endogenous endonuclease inhibitor, completely blocked osteoblast death. Likewise, DEVD-CHO, an inhibitor of caspase-3, at concentrations above 100 μm prevented cell killing. Both of these enzymes are downstream effectors of the apoptotic process. Each barrepresents the mean and S.E. of the mean (n = 3). *,p < 0.05, when compared with control Ca2+and Pi concentrations; #, p < 0.05, when compared with cells treated with 5 mm Piand 2.9 mm Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When Pi transport is blocked, the ion pair fails to trigger cell death (Fig.6). Thus, over 80% of the osteoblasts die when exposed to 2.9 mm Ca2+ and 3 mm Pi. The presence of PFA, an inhibitor of Pi transport, completely abrogates osteoblast apoptosis (Fig. 6 A). Indeed, even if the Pi concentration is raised to 7 mm, PFA blocks cell death. PFA also protects MC-3T3-E1 cells from apoptosis. Fig. 6 B shows that if the medium contains PFA, the cells retain their viability even when treated with high levels of the ion pair (2.9 Ca2+ and 7 mm Pi). PFA alone has no effect on bone cell MTT activity. Results of this series of experiments suggest that uptake or binding of Pi by the treated cells is a requirement of the apoptotic process. Although Pi transporters are required for Ca2+-Pi-induced cell death, inhibitors of Ca2+ channel transport exert little effect on ion pair-mediated osteoblast apoptosis. Treatment with verapamil or nifedipine effected no significant change in Ca2+-dependent Pi-mediated bone cell death. Table I shows that at all concentrations evaluated, these specific l-type Ca2+ channel blockers fail to increase the percentage of viable cells. Lanthanum chloride, a general Ca2+ channel inhibitor, appears to offer some protection from ion pair-induced apoptosis. At a concentration of 100 μm, this agent doubles the number of vital cells. However, since high lanthanum chloride levels are toxic to cells, it is probable that the increase in vitality is due to the lanthanides precipitating apatite out of solution (23Mayer I. Layani J.D. Givan A. Gaft M. Blanc P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 73: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Deposition of the mineral phase would lower the activity of the ion pair as well as reducing the concentration of lanthanum chloride to nontoxic levels. Gadolinium chloride, an inhibitor of the stretch-activated (SA-Cat) Ca2+ channels also provides no protection from Ca2+- and Pi-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Together, results of these experiments indicate that inhibition of Ca2+transport through a number of common channels has a minimal effect in blocking Ca2+ dependent Pi-mediated bone cell apoptosis.Table IEffect of calcium channel blockers on calcium and phosphate-mediated osteoblast apoptosisControl0 μm25 μm50 μm100 μmVerapamil100.1 (1.62)28.8 (5.98) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.16.1 (2.33) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.15.9 (3.76) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.23.8 (2.20) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.Nifedipine100.1 (1.62)33.8 (5.98) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.31.8 (1.56) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.33.8 (2.51) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.41.2 (3.35) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.Lanthanum chloride100.1 (1.62)20.1 (2.55) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.24.4 (0.93) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.22.5 (2.62) 1-ap < 0.05 from control values.57.0 (5.40) 1-bp < 0.05 from 0 μm values.Each of the experimental groups was treated with 5 mmPi and 2.9 mm Ca2+ along with the indicated concentration of Ca2+ channel blocker for 24 h.

Confocal microscopy indicates that mitochondria are involved in the activation of apoptosis (Figs.7 and 8). When probed with Mitotracker Red (500 nm), a membrane voltage dye, osteoblasts display a low level of mitochondrial fluorescence (Fig. 7 A). Two h after treatment with 5 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+there is a transient but marked increase in Mitotracker fluorescence (Fig. 7 B); by 4 h, the fluorescence has returned to base-line values (Fig. 7 C). Six hours after treatment, the cells are shrunken, cell to cell contacts are lost, and many of the cells are dead (Fig. 7 D). The residual fluorescence of these cells is probably due to the dye binding to membrane remnants. The change in mitochondrial fluorescence is shown graphically in Fig.9 A.

Here we describe a new molecular and functional interaction between two functionally unrelated types of G protein-coupled receptors, namely the metabotropic glutamate type 1α (mGlu1α receptor) and the adenosine A1 receptors in cerebellum, primary cortical neurons, and heterologous transfected cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a close and subtype-specific interaction between mGlu1α and A1 receptors in both rat cerebellar synaptosomes and co-transfected HEK-293 cells.

Our results provide a molecular basis for adenosine/glutamate receptors cross-talk and open new perspectives for the development of novel agents to treat neuropsychiatric disorders in which abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved. metabotropic glutamate G protein-coupled receptors adenosine A1 receptors N-methyl-d-aspartate (R)-phenylisopropyladenosine antibody γ-aminobutyric acid A polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar), and its function through ionotropic and metabotropic (mGlu)1glutamate receptors can be modulated by other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (2Conn P.J. Pin J-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Eight members of the mGlu receptor family have been identified and categorized into three subgroups on the basis of their sequence homology, agonist selectivity, and signal transduction pathway. Group I contains mGlu1 and mGlu5 subtypes, which are coupled to phospholipase C in transfected cells, and have quisqualic acid as their most potent agonist. Five splice variants of mGlu1 receptor have been described, mGlu1α, mGlu1β, mGlu1c, mGlu1d, and mGlu1e receptors (3Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), all of them differing in the length of their C-terminal tail. The functional significance of the different splice variants has not yet been fully explored. It has been suggested that the C-terminal tail, which is intracellular, might play a role in the subcellular targeting of the receptor (5Grandes P. Mateos J.M. Ruegg D. Kuhn R. Knopfel T. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2249-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that the C terminus of mGlu1α receptor interacts with tubulin (6Ciruela F. Robbins M.J. Willis A.C. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that it can regulate the cell surface expression of the receptor (7Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and its plasma membrane anchoring (8Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. McIlhinney R.A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. Chan W.Y. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Adenosine is an important neuromodulator implicated in a variety of brain activities, particularly those related to sleep and ischemic-hypoxic episodes (10Phillis J.W. Wu P. Prog. Neurobiol. 1981; 16: 187-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous nucleoside exerts its actions via specific receptors, four of which (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) have been cloned (11Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The A1R is functionally coupled to members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive family of G proteins (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, and Go), and its activation regulates several membrane and intracellular proteins such as adenylate cyclase, Ca2+ channels, K+channels, and phospholipase C (11Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Of the multiple neurophysiological actions of adenosine, inhibition of glutamate neurotransmission has been observed in several brain regions (12Dunwiddie T.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1985; 27: 63-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and is probably a result of the inhibition of presynaptic calcium influx (13Wu L.G. Saggau P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Apart from this inhibitory effect, there is some evidence documenting functional interactions between adenosine and glutamate receptors in the central nervous system. Of particular interest are reports of group I mGlu receptors signaling being enhanced by group II mGlu receptors in hippocampal and cerebrocortical slices (14Genazzani A.A. L'Episcopo M.R. Casabona G. Shinozaki H. Nicoletti F. Brain. Res. 1994; 659: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Schoepp D.D. Salhoff C.R. Wright R.A. Johnson B.G. Burnett J.P. Mayne N.G. Belagaje R.

Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and by adenosine A1 receptors in cultured hippocampal type 1 astrocytes (17Ogata T. Nakamura Y. Tsuji K. Shibata T. Kataoka K. Schubert P. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Very recently, Toms and Roberts (18Toms N.J. Roberts P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have described that type 2 astrocytes contain group I mGlu receptors coupled to [Ca2+]isignaling and that co-activation of adenosine A1 receptors enhances group I mGlu-evoked [Ca2+]i responses in these cells via Gi/o G protein-mediated mechanism. Despite these observations, no clear molecular mechanism of this interaction between glutamate and adenosine receptors has been provided yet. Here we report a molecular interaction between metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1α and the adenosine A1 receptor, two members of different GPCR families. This interaction suggests that both receptors may form part of a signaling complex in vivo that could play a critical role in fine-tuning neurotransmission at glutamatergic synapses. Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK-293, were grown as described (9Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. Chan W.Y. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Rat mGlu1 receptor was truncated after amino acid position 885 (see Fig. 4). A stop codon was introduced into the coding sequence of the FLAG epitope containing mGlu1α receptor cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (8Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. McIlhinney R.A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Forward primer was MGR1-F7 (5′-GGCCCTGGGGTGCATGTTTACTC-3′, position 2833–2855 of the mGlu1 receptor cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X57569)), and reverse primer was MGR1-R22 (5′-CGTCTCGAGTTTAATTCCCTGCCCCGGGCTTCTTT-3′, position 3026 to 2992, but also encoded XhoI restriction site (underlined) and a stop codon (shown in bold)). TheBspEI-XhoI fragment of the amplified cDNA sequence, which contained a stop codon, was used to substitute corresponding fragment of rat mGlu1α receptor cDNA in pcDNA3 vector thus resulting in mGlu1-M7 construct (see Fig. 4). The truncation introduced was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the transient expression of mGlu1α, mGlu1β, mGlu1-M7, and/or A1 receptors, cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of cDNA encoding the rat metabotropic glutamate receptors and/or rat adenosine A1 receptor (ratio 1:1; pcDNA containing LacZ reporter was used to equilibrate the amount of total DNA) by calcium phosphate precipitation (19Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The cells were used for experimentation at either 24 or 48 h after transfection. Cells were grown in glutamate-free medium (ICN, Basingstoke, UK) in the absence of both glutamine and glutamic acid for 3 h before their use. Cortical hemispheres from E16 rat embryos were dissected, and primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (9Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. Chan W.Y. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and used after 14–21 daysin vitro. To determine the NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity, the culture-conditioned medium was collected, and the cortical neurons were washed once with serum-free B27-supplemented Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) (BNG medium) and preincubated with or without 30 μm NMDA (Tocris, Bristol, UK) for 10 min at 37 °C, as described previously (20Nicoletti F. Bruno V. Catania M.V. Battaglia G. Copani A. Barbagallo G. Ceña V. Sanchez-Prieto J. Spano P.F. Pizzi M. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Quisqualic acid (100 μm) (Tocris, Bristol, UK) and/or (R)-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) (100 nm) (Sigma) were transiently applied for 1 min during the 5 min prior to the addition of NMDA (20Nicoletti F. Bruno V. Catania M.V. Battaglia G. Copani A. Barbagallo G. Ceña V. Sanchez-Prieto J. Spano P.F. Pizzi M. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and then added together with the NMDA. Neurons, after being washed with the BNG medium, were returned to the culture-conditioned medium and further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After the NMDA pulse (24 h), neurons were stained with propidium iodide (80 μg/ml) for 5 min and examined immediately with a standard epi-illumination fluorescence microscope. Neuronal injury was determined by the ability of propidium iodide (Sigma) to penetrate and interact with DNA in damaged neurons, yielding red fluorescence. For immunohistochemistry, rat cerebellum was embedded in OCT and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Eight micrometer sections were cut on a cryostat cooled to −18 °C. Sections were collected onto SuperFrost Plus (BDH, Darmstadt, Germany) slides, air-dried, and stored at −70 °C. Sections were blocked for 30 min in 10% donkey serum in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Slides were incubated with affinity-purified anti-mGlu1α receptor (F2-Ab, 2–4 μg/ml) (21Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified anti-A1R (PC21, 5–10 μg/ml) (22Ciruela F. Casado V. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed twice for 5 min in TBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoReserach Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) was applied in TBS at a dilution of 1:100. Section were rinsed and mounted with Vectashield immunofluorescence medium (Vector Laboratories, Orton Southgate, UK). For immunocytochemistry, HEK-293 cells transiently transfected (see above) and primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm glycine (buffer A) to quench the aldehyde groups. Where indicated, cells were permeabilized with buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were labeled for 1 h at room temperature with the indicated primary antibody, washed, and stained with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1/100) and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (1/100). Coverslips were rinsed for 30 min in buffer B and mounted with Vectashield immunofluorescence. Confocal microscope observations were made with a Leica TCS NT (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal scanning laser microscope adapted to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope. Rat cerebellum synaptosomes (6Ciruela F. Robbins M.J. Willis A.C. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or transfected HEK cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) for 1 h on ice. The solubilized preparation was then centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant (1 mg of protein/ml) was processed for immunoprecipitation as described before (6Ciruela F. Robbins M.J. Willis A.C. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using the anti-A1R antibody (PC21-Ab) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma, Clone M2; 10 μg/ml). The immune complexes were dissociated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer by heating to 100 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7% gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Watford, UK) using a semi-dry transfer system and immunoblotted using the primary antibodies indicated in the figure legends and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Ely, UK) as a secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce), as described previously (6Ciruela F. Robbins M.J. Willis A.C. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Membrane suspensions from transiently transfected HEK cells were obtained according to Casadó et al. (24Casadó V. Canti C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For competition experiments to determine the KD values, 30 nm[3H]quisqualic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 20 nm [3H]R-PIA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) binding to membrane suspensions of HEK cells transiently expressing mGlu1α−FLAG receptor or A1R (0.5 mg protein/ml) were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of quisqualic acid or R-PIA, as described previously (24Casadó V. Canti C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After 2 h of radioligand incubation, free and membrane-bound radioligand were separated by rapid filtration in a Brandel cell harvester through Whatman GF/C filters. Filters were transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml of Formula 989 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radioactivity was counted using a Packard 1600 TRI-CARB scintillation counter with 50% of efficiency. Competition data were fitted using a non-linear regression program as described previously (24Casadó V. Canti C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Casado V. Franco R. Mallol J. Lluis C. Canela E.I. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To determine the density of expressed receptors in HEK cells transiently transfected with A1R, mGlu1α-FLAG or A1R plus mGlu1α−FLAG, the binding of 70 nm[3H]quisqualic and 15 nm[3H]R-PIA was performed as described above, and theBmax was deduced taking into account theKD values as described previously (24Casadó V. Canti C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK cells (106 cell/ml) were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and subsequently incubated in HBSS containing 0.2 units/ml adenosine deaminase. Calcium peak induction was achieved by the addition of R-PIA or quisqualic acid. Intracellular calcium was determined at 37 °C in a dual-wavelength Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Europe, Duisberg, Germany) by using the excitation wavelength ratio of 334/366 nm with emission cut-off at 500 nm. Free calcium concentration was calculated as described previously (26Mirabet M. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies showed that mGlu1α receptors are present in cerebellum, and its expression is mainly restricted to the cell body and the dendritic tree of Purkinje cells and basket cells located in the molecular layer (Fig.1 a). This is in agreement with the previously described location of these receptors in an annulus, which surrounds the post-synaptic density (27Baude A. Nusser Z. Roberts J.D.B. Mulvihill E. McIlhinney R.A.J. Somogyi P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 771-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The A1R had a more ubiquitous distribution in cerebellum being expressed in Purkinje cells and basket cells, as mGlu1α receptor, and also in granule cells (Fig. 1 a). This fits with the localization of adenosine A1 receptors both presynaptically and postsynaptically (28Ochiishi T. Chen L. Yukawa A. Saitoh Y. Sekino Y. Arai T. Nakata H. Miyamoto H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1α and adenosine A1 receptors showed a similar distribution in human cerebral cortex being expressed in large pyramidal cells located at layers V and II/III (data not shown). The in vivo co-distribution of mGlu1α and A1 receptors in some cerebellar neurons (Fig. 1 a) suggests a potential interaction between both receptors at precise brain areas. The existence of mGlu1α/A1 receptors' heteromers was assayed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using a soluble extract from rat cerebellum synaptosomes that had been shown by Western blotting to contain both adenosine A1 (Fig. 1 b, lane 1) and mGlu1α receptors (Fig. 1 b, lane 2). When this soluble extract was immunoblotted using a specific antibody against A1 receptor (PC21-Ab), two bands of around 39 and 74 kDa of molecular size were shown (Fig. 1 b, lane 3); these bands, which are glycosylated proteins (29Gao Z. Robeva A.S. Linden J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), have been demonstrated previously to correspond to the adenosine A1 receptor monomer and dimer, respectively (22Ciruela F. Casado V. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a specific antibody against the mGlu1α receptor (F2-Ab) immunoblotted in the cerebellum synaptosomes extract a band with apparent molecular size of 150 kDa that corresponds to the mGlu1α receptor (Fig. 1 b, lane 4), which is a glycosylated protein as it has been described previously (21Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). From this extract, the antibody against A1R (PC11-Ab) immunoprecipitated a band of 150 kDa that was detected by the F2-Ab (Fig. 1 b). This band was also immunoprecipitated using a different antibody against mGlu1 receptor (F1-Ab) but was not present in immunoprecipitates generated with an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 1 b, lane 5). It should be noted that the efficacy of immunoprecipitation of mGlu1α receptor by the anti-adenosine receptor antibody was much less than when an anti-mGlu1 receptor antibody was used. Overall, these results indicate that there are zones in which mGlu1α and A1 receptors do not co-distribute and that there are zones in which the two receptors co-distribute and form aggregates (heteromers). The close association of mGlu1α and A1 receptors was subsequently studied in co-transfected HEK-293 cells by co-immunoprecipitation and double immunolabeling experiments. By confocal microscopy analysis of HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNAs for mGlu1α-FLAG and A1 receptors, a marked overlap in the distribution of the two proteins was found (Fig.2). As deduced from horizontal optical sections of permeabilized (+Triton) and nonpermeabilized (−Triton) cells, co-localization was not restricted to the plasma membrane but extended to intracellular compartments. Interestingly, when the double immunolabeling experiment was performed on HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNAs for mGlu1β-FLAG, the C-terminal splice variant of mGlu1 receptor (Fig. 4 a), and A1 receptors, no co-localization between both proteins was observed at the plasma membrane level (Fig. 2), suggesting a specificity for the co-localization between mGlu1α-FLAG and A1 receptors. From co-transfected HEK cell extracts, the antibody against A1R (PC11-Ab) co-immunoprecipitated a band of 150 kDa, which corresponds to the mGlu1α-FLAG receptor (Fig.3, lane 5). This band did not appear in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the cDNA for either A1 receptors (Fig. 3, lane 4) or mGlu1α (Fig. 3, lane 6) or when an irrelevant antibody was used (data not shown). Conversely, when we immunoprecipitate with the FLAG antibody to pull down mGlu1α-FLAG receptor in the transiently co-transfected HEK-293 cells, and subsequently the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-A1R antibodies, a band which corresponds to the A1R was observed (Fig. 3, lane 11). Interestingly, no immunoprecipitation of mGlu1β receptor, the C-terminal splice variant of mGlu1 receptor (Fig.4 a), was obtained from co-transfected cells using the antibody against A1R (PC11-Ab) (Fig.4 b, lane 7). Additionally, the construct mGlu1-M7, a deleted mutant close to the splice variant site of the mGlu1 receptor (Fig. 4 a), also did not interact with A1R (Fig. 4 b, lane 8). Overall, these results suggest that the C-terminal tail of the mGlu1α receptor (Fig. 4 a) is implicated in the interaction of both receptors. To test the functional significance of an mGlu1α/A1 receptors interaction, measurements of calcium mobilization in co-transfected HEK-293 cells were performed. In HEK cells transiently expressing A1R or A1R plus mGlu1α-FLAG R-PIA mobilized intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 value of 46.8 ± 4.4 nm for the single expressing A1R cells or 45.7 ± 5.1 nm for the doubly A1R plus mGlu1α-FLAG expressing cells. On the other hand, in these cells quisqualic acid also mobilized intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 value of 4.1 ± 1.1 μm for the single expressing mGlu1α-FLAG cells or 5.6 ± 1.1 μm for the doubly A1R plus mGlu1α-FLAG expressing cells. The densities of the transiently expressed receptors were controlled by means of ligand binding experiments performed in these cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells transfected with the cDNA for A1R alone express 3.4 ± 0.4 pmol of A1R/mg protein as detected by [3H]R-PIA binding with aKD of 27 ± 3 nm. In these cells the A1R agonist R-PIA leads to a calcium peak (Fig.5). On the other hand, cells transfected only with the cDNA for mGlu1α receptor express 3.3 ± 0.9 pmol of mGlu1α receptor/mg protein as detected by [3H]quisqualic binding with aKD of 177 ± 46 nm, and a weak calcium peak was detected when treated with the agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor, quisqualic acid (Fig. 5). Interestingly, in HEK-293 cells co-transfected with both receptors (3.3 ± 0.2 pmol of A1R/mg of protein and 2.8 ± 1.5 pmol of mGlu1α/mg of protein), preincubation with quisqualic acid markedly potentiated the calcium peak obtained in response to A1R activation (140 ± 10%; n = 3). Conversely, preincubation of co-transfected cells with the agonist for A1R led to a marked enhancement of the signal provided by quisqualic acid (180 ± 20%; n = 3) (Fig. 5). Quisqualic acid or R-PIA failed to bind or to provide any signal in nontransfected HEK-293 cells. These results clearly show a heterologous sensitization or synergistic effect upon mGlu1α and A1 receptors activation. To assess the physiological relevance of the mGlu1α/A1 receptors interaction, we analyzed the distribution of both receptors in primary rat cortical neurons. Both receptors showed a similar punctate distribution throughout the proximal and distal dendrites, and the degree of co-localization at these locations was very high (Fig. 6,a–c). In fact, some of the mGlu1α receptor− or A1R-containing puncta co-distributed with the synaptic marker protein synaptophysin (Fig. 6, d–i), suggesting that they could be localized to synapses. Thus, synapses are one of the specific cellular sites where mGlu1α and A1 receptors interact. Glutamate/adenosine receptors interaction may be important for modulating the role of mGlu1α receptor in neurodegeneration/neuroprotection, an issue that is still controversial. When examining this role a number of factors, including the heteromeric composition of NMDA receptors, the time of exposure to drugs or to ambient glutamate, and the function of astrocytes clearing extracellular glutamate and producing neurotoxic or neuroprotective factors must be taken into account (20Nicoletti F. Bruno V. Catania M.V. Battaglia G. Copani A. Barbagallo G. Ceña V. Sanchez-Prieto J. Spano P.F. Pizzi M. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, glutamate could also modulate the well known function of adenosine as neuroprotective factor (12Dunwiddie T.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1985; 27: 63-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the interaction of mGlu1α/A1 receptors could be beneficial in situations of enhanced neuronal activity, in which potentiation of postsynaptic adenosine A1 receptor limits evoked depolarization and results in decreased activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+channels and NMDA receptor ion channels, through which Ca2+enters cell bodies (30Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the effect of activating of both mGlu1 and A1 adenosine receptors on NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures. In agreement with previously described data (20Nicoletti F. Bruno V. Catania M.V. Battaglia G. Copani A. Barbagallo G. Ceña V. Sanchez-Prieto J. Spano P.F. Pizzi M. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), submaximal concentrations of NMDA induced neuronal death, which was enhanced by the presence of quisqualic acid during the NMDA treatment (Fig.7). In contrast, when the adenosine A1 receptor agonist, R-PIA, was present during the NMDA treatment, the induced neurotoxicity was reduced by nearly 50%. When added simultaneously, R-PIA reduced the enhancement of the neurotoxicity induced by quisqualic acid (Fig. 7). On the other hand, pre-exposure of neurones to R-PIA or to quisqualic acid also reduced the NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. This reduction was more marked if both quisqualic acid and R-PIA were present during the pre-exposure, showing that the simultaneous activation of both receptors appears to increase the protection of the neurones against the NMDA treatment compared with the effect evoked by either quisqualate or R-PIA applied separately. These results show the relevance of the interaction of mGlu1α/A1 receptors and support the concept of specificity and complexity of this interaction, being the spatiotemporal segregation profile of adenosine/glutamate during synaptic activity of special importance to achieve a neuroprotective or a neurotoxic effect. Here we describe a novel interaction between two unrelated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), namely the metabotropic glutamate type 1α and the adenosine A1 receptors. Although the cooperativity of the agonist binding to GPCR suggested the possibility of oligomerization of G proteins and their associated receptors (31Schubert P. Ogata T. Marchini C. Ferroni S.

https://openalex.org/W1982681624,"High throughput sequencing of a mouse keratinocyte library was used to identify an expressed sequence tag with homology to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors. We have named the protein encoded by this expressed sequence tag Epigen, for epithelial mitogen. Epigen encodes a protein of 152 amino acids that contains features characteristic of the EGF superfamily. Two hydrophobic regions, corresponding to a putative signal sequence and transmembrane domain, flank a core of amino acids encompassing six cysteine residues and two putativeN-linked glycosylation sites. Epigen shows 24–37% identity to members of the EGF superfamily including EGF, transforming growth factor α, and Epiregulin. Northern blotting of several adult mouse tissues indicated that Epigen was present in testis, heart, and liver. Recombinant Epigen was synthesized in Escherichia coli and refolded, and its biological activity was compared with that of EGF and transforming growth factor α in several assays. In epithelial cells, Epigen stimulated the phosphorylation of c-erbB-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinases and also activated a reporter gene containing enhancer sequences present in the c-fos promoter. Epigen also stimulated the proliferation of HaCaT cells, and this proliferation was blocked by an antibody to the extracellular domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-erbB-1. Thus, Epigen is the newest member of the EGF superfamily and, with its ability to promote the growth of epithelial cells, may constitute a novel molecular target for wound-healing therapy.AJ291391 High throughput sequencing of a mouse keratinocyte library was used to identify an expressed sequence tag with homology to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors.

Although members of the EGF superfamily have relatively low homology with each other at the amino acid level, the presence of six conserved cysteine residues in the active peptide suggests that all have a similar tertiary structure. Indeed, the solution structure of EGF and TGFα demonstrated that identical disulfide linkages between these conserved cysteine residues enable the formation of a three-looped structure (17Campbell I.D. Cooke R.M. Baron M. Harvey T.S. Tappin M.J. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Central to the function of the EGF superfamily is a conserved domain known as the EGF motif, which is present in all EGF superfamily members identified to date. This motif encompasses three of the six conserved cysteine residues and contains additional residues important for tertiary structure stabilization and receptor binding (18Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Just as the EGF superfamily comprises structurally similar members, so do the receptors through which the peptides signal. In mammals, the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase family includes c-erbB-1 (EGFR, HER-1), c-erbB-2 (HER-2, Neu), c-erbB-3 (HER-3), and c-erbB-4 (HER-4) (19Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Kruiger W. Stolarsky L.S.

Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Signaling is such that a single receptor, e.g. c-erbB-1, can bind to several EGF superfamily ligands (EGF, TGFα, epiregulin, AR, HB-EGF, betacellulin; see Ref. 24Riese D.J. Kim E.D. Elenius K.

Toyoda H. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of C-terminal residues of c-erbB receptors activates the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, leading to regulation of c-fos expression by the binding of transcription factors to sites such as the serum inducing element and SRE within the c-fos promoter (see Ref. 26Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar for review). The Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway is widely used by receptor tyrosine kinases to promote diverse cellular responses including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (27Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M.

We have identified a novel member of the EGF ligand superfamily from mouse keratinocytes, which we have named Epigen, forepithelial mitogen. mRNA encoding Epigen has a restricted tissue distribution, present in heart, liver, and testis. We have purified recombinant Epigen and compared its biological activities with that of EGF and TGFα. In epithelial cells, Epigen stimulates the phosphorylation of c-erbB-1 and MAP kinase proteins. Epigen also activates genes under the control of the SRE. In addition, Epigen is a mitogen for HaCaT cells, and this activity can be significantly reduced by a blocking antibody to the receptor c-erbB-1. HaCaT and A431 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.77 mml-asparagine (Sigma), 0.2 mmarginine (Sigma), 160 mm penicillin G (Sigma), 70 mm dihydrostreptomycin sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HaCaT SRE cells were also supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A population of basal keratinocytes from the epidermis of neonatal mouse skin was used to generate a directionally cloned cDNA library in pBK-CMV using the Zap Express kit (Stratagene). Clones excised from the library were sequenced from the T3 primer, and homology searches were performed using the FastA and FastX algorithms. An adult mouse tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH and probed with a [32P]dATP end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence 5′-GGTCGATATAGGAACCAGCTACCTTTGCCTGCTCTGGATCTGCTG-3′ according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was reprobed using the control β-actin fragment provided with the blot. For bacterial expression, the vector pET16b (Novagen) was modified to shorten the bacterial leader sequence. The vector was digested with NcoI and XhoI to remove the existing leader sequence. This was replaced by the sequence 5′-ccatgggccatcaccatcaccaccatgcgaattcgctcgag-3′, which encodes the amino acid sequence MGHHHHHHANSLE. DNA encoding residues 53–103 of Epigen was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the primers 5′-gggaattctctgaagttctctcatc-3′ and 5′-gcggatccttaagcatacgaagttag-3′. The resulting DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI andBamHI and ligated into the modified pET16b vector. A pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) containing the neomycin resistance gene was used to develop an SRE luciferase reporter construct where the SRE was inserted 5′ of the SV40 promoter. The following primers were used to generate the enhancer region of the human c-fos promoter: SRE1, 5′-gatccgcagcccgcgagcagttcccgtcaatccctcccccctta-3′; SRE2, 5′-cacaggatgtccatattaggacatctgcgtcagcaggtttccacggcctttccctgtagcccta-3′; SRE3, 5′-cctaatatggacatcctgtgtaaggggggagggattgacgggaactgctcgcgggctgcg-3′; and SRE4, 5′-gatctagggctacagggaaaggccgtggaaacctgctgacgcagatgt-3′. Primers were annealed to prepare two double-stranded oligonucleotides: SRE1/3 and 2/4. SRE1/3 and SRE2/4 were then ligated together into theBamHI and BglII sites of pGL3 to form the SRE. A concatamer of eight SRE enhancers was prepared by subsequent rounds of digestion and SRE ligation into pGL3. Small scale expression of Epigen in pET16b was induced in BL21/DE3/Lys cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein induction was monitored by analyzing whole bacterial lysates by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-His antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For purification, expression was scaled up, and bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To the lysed cells, 1% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were further disrupted by sonication on ice at 95 watts for 4 × 15 s and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet the inclusion bodies. The pellet containing inclusion bodies was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% w/v CHAPS and sonicated on ice for 5–10 s. This mixture was stored on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was once more resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% w/v CHAPS, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed as before. The pellet was resuspended in solubilizing buffer (6 mguanidine HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), sonicated at 95 watts for 4 × 15 s, and then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatant was stored at 4 °C until use. Recombinant Epigen was purified using a nickel-chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For refolding, the protein solution was added to 5 times its volume of refolding buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm reduced glutathione, 0.25 mm oxidized glutathione, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) over a period of 1 h at 4 °C. The refolding buffer was stirred rapidly during this time, and stirring was continued at 4 °C overnight. The refolded proteins were then concentrated by ultrafiltration using standard protocols. For MAP kinase phosphorylation assays, HaCaT cells were seeded in 6-well dishes such that the cells reached 80% confluence after an overnight incubation. Cells were then transferred into serum-free media and incubated for a further 24 h. Recombinant Epigen, TGFα (Genzyme), or control protein (TR1002P, a secreted protein produced as for Epigen) was added to the cells at a concentration of 18 nm and incubated for up to 20 min. Media was removed after the indicated times, and cells were immediately lysed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin). MAP kinase phosphorylation was then assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-ACTIVETM MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were stripped and reprobed using anti-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to ensure equal protein loading. For c-erbB-1 phosphorylation assays, A431 cells were substituted for HaCaT cells and treated in the same manner. c-erbB-1 phosphorylation was assessed as above, using an antibody to EGF receptor (activated form, Transduction Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were stripped and reprobed using anti-EGF receptor (Transduction Laboratories) to ensure equal protein loading. HaCaT cells were stably transfected with the concatamerized SRE construct described above, using standard techniques. For the assay, 5 × 103 cells were aliquoted into wells of a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. Media was changed to 0.1% fetal bovine serum, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were incubated in the presence of recombinant Epigen, EGF (PeproTech), TGFα, or a control protein at concentrations titrating from 180 nm for 6 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 40 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). 10 μl was transferred to a 96-well plate, and 10 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) was added by direct injection into each well by a Victor2 fluorometer (Wallac); the plate was shaken, and the luminescence for each well was read at 3 × 1-s intervals. -HaCaT proliferation assays were performed in 96-well flat-bottomed plates in 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.05% fetal calf serum. Recombinant Epigen, EGF, TGFα, or a control protein was titrated into the plates from a concentration of 12 nm, and 1 × 103 HaCaT cells were added to each well. The plates were incubated for 5 days in an atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye reduction. HaCaT inhibition assays were performed essentially as above except that anti-c-erbB-1 (USB) or isotype control antibodies were titrated into wells (from 1 μg/ml) containing a constant amount of Epigen (1.75 nm) or TGFα (0.1 nm). High throughput sequencing of a mouse immature keratinocyte library identified an expressed sequence tag of 1715 base pairs containing a single open reading frame of 459 nucleotides (Fig.1 A). A putative translation initiation codon was found within the sequence GAATATGG, which matched the consensus sequence established for eukaryotic translational initiation (47Kozac M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 26: 8125-8148Crossref Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Only 5 base pairs of sequence was found upstream of the ATG codon in this cDNA, whereas the 3′ untranslated region was 1.25 kilobases in length and contained a poly(A) stretch preceded by a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA). Conceptual translation of the 459-base pair open reading frame produced a predicted protein of 152 amino acids. Hydrophobicity analysis identified a stretch of 18 amino acids, starting from the putative initiating methionine, indicative of a signal peptide. The putative cleavage site of the signal peptide was predicted to be located between Ala18 and Ala19 (SignalP; Ref. 48Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar). An additional hydrophobic region was present between Ile111and Cys130, suggesting the presence of a transmembrane domain. A search against the Prosite data base (release 15.0; Ref. 49Hofmann K. Bucher P. Faiquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) revealed that residues 83–94 (CRCFTGYTGQRC) matched the consensus pattern of EGF 1 and 2 domains. In addition, the predicted protein also contained two N-linked glycosylation sites between amino acids 36 and 39 (NWTF) and between amino acids 40 and 43 (NNTE). Alignment of the predicted protein, which we have named Epigen, with entries in the Swiss-Prot Database indicated that Epigen was similar to several members of the EGF family. Over the entire Epigen protein sequence, this homology was relatively low, displaying 26 and 29% identity to TGFα and Epiregulin, respectively. This compares favorably with the protein sequence identity between other EGF family members, which ranges from 23 to 33%. Because EGF family members exist in a functional form as small peptides, we aligned the functional peptides of the EGF family with Epigen (Fig. 1 B). This revealed that a 51-amino acid internal segment of Epigen was more than 40% identical to the active peptides of EGF, TGFα, and Epiregulin. The active peptides of the EGF family are sufficient for activity and contain several conserved residues critical for the maintenance of this activity. Epigen has also retained these residues, which include six cysteines (Cys59, Cys67, Cys72, Cys83, Cys85, Cys94), three glycines (Gly70, Gly88, Gly91), and an arginine and leucine (Arg93 and Leu99). The six cysteine residues in TGFα form three disulfide bonds that are required for optimum binding affinity to c-erbB-1 (50Tou J.S. McGrath M.F. Zupec M.E. Byatt J.C. Violand B.N. Kaempfe L.A.

Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and Gly91 and Arg93 are highly conserved within EGF family members but not in proteins that contain EGF units without growth factor activity (52Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Together, the conserved features of Epigen with members of the EGF family at the amino acid level suggested that Epigen encoded a novel member of the EGF family. Furthermore, an increase in sequence conservation of a 51-amino acid internal peptide of Epigen with the functional peptides of the EGF family suggested that this peptide would encompass residues sufficient for its biological activity. The pattern of Epigen expression in adult mouse tissues was assessed by Northern blotting using commercial poly(A)+ blots fromCLONTECH. A [32P]dATP end-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide hybridizing to the 3′ untranslated region of mouse Epigen was used as a probe. Expression of mouse Epigen was evident in testis and liver tissues, with some expression in heart (Fig. 2). A longer exposure indicated that Epigen was also expressed in lung and kidney (data not shown). As a loading control, the blot was reprobed with a β-actin fragment. We assessed whether Epigen, like other EGF family members, could activate the Ras/MAP kinase/c-fos signal transduction pathway (26Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). For this purpose, primers were designed to amplify cDNA that encoded Epigen from residues Leu53 to Ala103. Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET16b, in frame with an N-terminal poly-histidine tag (Fig. 3 A). The presence of a poly-histidine tag at a similar position in TGFα was found to have no effect on its biological activity (13Derynck R. Roberts A.B. Winkler M.E. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1984; 38: 287-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli to prepare recombinant Epigen (Fig. 3 B). We assayed for MAP kinase phosphorylation upon stimulation of HaCaT cells by Epigen over a 20-min period. In this assay, phosphorylated MAP kinase was detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated forms of MAP kinase only (Fig. 4, A–C,panel P). As shown in Fig. 4 A, an increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation was detected following a 5-min incubation of HaCaT cells with Epigen. The level of MAP kinase phosphorylation steadily increased to a maximal level at 20 min of stimulation. TGFα also induced MAP kinase phosphorylation after 5 min of incubation; however, maximal levels were reached at 10 to 15 min post-stimulation and had begun to decrease by 20 min (Fig. 4 B). A control protein was only able to stimulate weak MAP kinase phosphorylation at 20 min when compared with Epigen and TGFα (Fig. 4 C). Reprobing each blot with an antibody recognizing total MAP kinase verified that an equal quantity of protein from the control and test samples had been analyzed (Fig. 4, A–C, panel T).Figure 4Induction of MAP kinase phosphorylation in HaCaT cells by Epigen and TGFα.

In the presence of heparin-like molecules, both receptors also function as receptors for the heparin-binding 165-amino acid isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165). Both receptors are unable to bind to the 121-amino acid isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF121), which lacks a heparin-binding domain.

These complexes do not seem to represent complexes of 125I-VEGF121 with a truncated form of VEGFR-1, presumably formed as a result of the presence of Np-1 or Np-2 in the cells, because such truncated forms could not be detected with anti-VEGFR-1 antibodies.

To perform the reciprocal experiment we have expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells a Np-2 receptor containing an in-framemyc epitope at the C terminus. Surprisingly, themyc-tagged Np-2 receptor lost most of its VEGF165 binding capacity but not its semaphorin-3F binding ability.

The various forms of the growth factors belonging to the VEGF1 family (VEGF, PlGF, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D) act as inducers and modulators of angiogenesis in vivo (1Neufeld G. Cohen T.

The active forms of the VEGF family members are synthesized as homodimers (4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N.

Targeted disruption of the VEGF gene has shown that angiogenesis is severely disrupted even in heterozygous animals containing a single functional allele of the VEGF gene. It is therefore believed that the maintenance of correct levels of VEGF in vivo is critical for the development of the cardiovascular system (7Ferrara N. Carvermoore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L.

Five splice forms of human VEGF ranging from 121 to 206 amino acids (VEGF121–VEGF206) have been characterized (4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). These differ primarily in the presence or the absence of the heparin-binding domains encoded by exons 6 and 7, giving rise to forms that differ in their heparin and heparan-sulfate binding ability (11Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Poltorak Z. Tessler S. Gengrinovitch S. Levi B.-Z. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Likewise, other VEGF family members such as PlGF and VEGF-B are also expressed in several forms that differ in their heparin binding ability. For example, the peptide encoded by exon 6 of PlGF is found only in PlGF-2 and confers a heparin binding ability to PLGF-2, whereas PlGF-1 does not bind to heparin (12Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Delvecchio S. Lei K.J. Chou J.Y. Persico M.G.

By contrast, the activation of VEGFR-1 does not seem to result in the induction of cell proliferation or angiogenesis, although exceptions have been observed (21Ziche M. Maglione D. Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. Vincenti V. Granger H.J. Viglietto G. Persico M.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar, 22Landgren E.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both receptors play pivotal roles in embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Embryos lacking the VEGFR-2 gene die before birth because differentiation of endothelial cells does not take place and blood vessels do not form (26Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of the gene encoding the VEGFR-1 receptor did not prevent the differentiation of endothelial cells in homozygous animals, but the development of functional blood vessels from these endothelial cells was severely impaired (27Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar).Endothelial cells also contain another type of VEGF receptor possessing a lower mass than either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-1 (28Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently found that these smaller VEGF receptors of the endothelial cells are isoform-specific receptors that bind VEGF165 but not VEGF121 (30Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additional experiments revealed several types of prostate and breast cancer-derived cell lines that express unusually large amounts of these isoform-specific receptors (31Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The receptors were purified from such cells using affinity chromatography on VEGF165 affinity matrices followed by partial protein sequencing and were found to be the products of the neuropilin-1 (Np-1) gene (32Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). It was subsequently observed that the heparin-binding form of placenta growth factor (PlGF-2) and VEGF-B, two additional members of the VEGF family of growth factors, are also able to bind to Np-1 (33Migdal M.

When the role of Np-1 as a VEGF receptor was discovered, it was already known that Np-1 functions in the nervous system as receptor for sema-3A. sema-3A is a Np-1 agonist that causes repulsion of growing tips of axons (35He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 36Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). It was recently observed that sema-3A is also able to inhibit migration of endothelial cells (37Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These results indicate that signaling via Np-1 affects angiogenesis and possibly the development of the cardiovascular system. Targeted disruption of the Np-1 gene resulted in severe cardiovascular defects, confirming these suspicions (38Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T. Fujisawa H.

Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Np-1 is part of a gene family that includes the closely related receptor Np-2. In the nervous system Np-2 is activated by another class 3 semaphorin, sema-3F, which also induces the repulsion of axons that express Np-2 (41Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that Np-2 is also able to bind VEGF165 and PlGF-2 but not VEGF121. However, unlike Np-1, Np-2 was also able to interact with the VEGF145 form of VEGF. VEGF145lacks the peptide encoded by exon 7 of VEGF, which is included in VEGF165, but contains instead the heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 6 of the VEGF gene (9Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 42Gluzman-Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).The neuropilins have a short intracellular domain and are unlikely to function as independent receptors. Indeed, no responses to VEGF165 were observed when cells expressing either Np-1 or Np-2 but no other VEGF receptors were stimulated with VEGF165 (32Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 42Gluzman-Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It was recently found that plexins form complexes with neuropilins and that these complexes mediate signal transduction by sema-3A (43Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 44Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H.

It is possible that neuropilins associate with additional cell surface molecules to form complexes that transduce VEGF signaling. We present evidence indicating that Np-2 and possibly also Np-1 form complexes with the VEGFR-1 receptor and that the formation of these complexes changes the binding characteristics of neuropilins so that they are now able to bind VEGF121, a splice form that is not recognized by neuropilins in cells that do not express VEGFR-1.DISCUSSIONNp-1 and Np-2 were originally found to function as receptors for several class 3 semaphorins that repel growing tips of axons during the development of the nervous system (35He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 36Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). These discoveries were followed by experiments that have demonstrated that Np-1 and Np-2 can function in addition as receptors for VEGF165, one of the heparin-binding forms of the angiogenic factor VEGF (32Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 42Gluzman-Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These experiments indicated that the neuropilins may play a role in cardiovascular biology, in addition to their role in the nervous system. In the case of Np-1 these expectations were verified when it was shown that targeted disruption of the Np-1 gene results in severe cardiovascular defects (38Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation it was found that the Np-1 agonist sema-3A inhibits migration of endothelial cells (37Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), but the consequences of the binding of VEGF to Np-1 are not completely clear as yet. In contrast, mice lacking functional Np-2 receptors are viable, and no vascular defects were reported so far (51Giger R.J. Cloutier J.F. Sahay A. Prinjha R.K. Levengood D.V. Moore S.E. Pickering S.

Nevertheless, the absence of vascular defects in these gene targeted mice does not necessarily preclude a physiological role for these receptors in vascular biology because the absence of a phenotype may be explained by redundancy with other signaling pathways.We have not been able to demonstrate any biological responses to VEGF165 in PAE cells expressing either recombinant Np-1 or recombinant Np-2 receptors and no other types of VEGF receptors (32Soker S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that for the transduction of VEGF signals the neuropilins may perhaps have to associate with other membrane-bound proteins. Neuropilins possess short intracellular domains, and it was demonstrated that binding of sema-3A to Np-1 is not sufficient for induction of sema-3A mediated growth cone collapse (53Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It was indeed found that neuropilins form complexes with plexin receptors to be able to transduce semaphorin signals (43Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 44Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Our binding/cross-linking experiments and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that in addition, Np-2 can form complexes with VEGFR-1. Our experiments also suggest that Np-1 too can associate with VEGFR-1. This was recently verified in a manuscript that was published during the preparation of this manuscript in which complexes between Np-1 and VEGFR-1 were observed using completely different methods (49Fuh G. Garcia K.C. De Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26690-26695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which VEGFR-1 enables the binding of VEGF121 to Np-1 and Np-2 is unclear. The binding of VEGFR-1 to the neuropilins may induce a neuropilin conformation that binds VEGF121 with increased affinity. It is possible that VEGF121 binds initially to VEGFR-1, placing the bound VEGF121 in close proximity to neuropilins in cells co-expressing both receptor types and effectively increasing the affinity of the neuropilins toward VEGF121. The effect of VEGFR-1 on VEGF121 binding may therefore be similar to the potentiating effect that heparin-like molecules have on the binding of VEGF165 to neuropilins (32Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 33Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).VEGFR-1 and Np-2 may be able to form complexes prior to the addition of VEGF. Alternatively, it is possible that VEGFR-1 binds to Np-2 only subsequent to the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-1. We have not been able to differentiate between these two possibilities. We have attempted to detect co-immunoprecipitated Np-2 or VEGFR-1 using Western blot analysis, but we have failed regardless of whether the cells were exposed or not to VEGF prior to the immunoprecipitation. It is possible that these experiments failed because the sensitivity of the assays was insufficient or because the VEGFR-1·Np-2 complexes are sensitive to the detergents used during the solubilization of the cells, making the detection of VEGFR-1·Np-2 complexes by less sensitive techniques than the technique we have used difficult. To circumvent these problems we have therefore used antibodies to immunoprecipitate recombinant receptors that have been covalently cross-linked to125I-VEGF prior to the immunoprecipitation using a previously described method (50Omura T. Miyazawa K. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23317-23322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The method we used utilized the high sensitivity afforded by the use of 125I but did not allow us to determine whether complex formation between Np-2 and VEGFR-1 was VEGF-dependent or not.We have no data regarding the biological significance of VEGFR-1·Np-2 complexes at this stage. The formation of complexes between Np-2 and VEGFR-1 may contribute to VEGF-induced signal transduction by VEGFR-1. If that assumption is correct, then it may provide a clue to a puzzling observation. Mice deficient in VEGFR-1 expression die before birth because of severe cardiovascular defects (27Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice that retain the extracellular and trans-membrane domains of VEGFR-1 but lack the signaling tyrosine-kinase domain develop normally (54Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). It is unclear how the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 is able to restore the normal embryonic development of mice. It is possible that the extracellular domain is required for VEGF sequestration, so as to limit the activity of VEGF. Alternatively, the extracellular domain may associate with another membrane protein to form a signaling holo-receptor. It is possible that Np-2 and Np-1 may perhaps participate in the formation of such a putative VEGFR-1 containing holo-receptor.In the course of our experiments we have found that when amyc epitope is inserted in-frame after the conserved SEA terminal tripeptide of Np-2a, the modified Np-2myc receptor loses most of its VEGF165binding ability. It was shown that Np-1 and Np-2 can form homodimers and heterodimers (55Chen H. He Z. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1283-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Formation of such dimers may perhaps be required for high affinity binding of VEGF to neuropilins. The insertion of themyc epitope may perhaps interfere with dimer formation and consequently with VEGF binding. Interestingly, the VEGF165binding ability of Np-2myc was restored to some extent in cells co-expressing VEGFR-1, perhaps because following complex formation a high affinity VEGF-binding conformation of Np-2myc is favored. Interestingly, the sema-3F binding properties of Np-2 were not affected by the introduction of themyc epitope, perhaps because the sema-3F-binding domain of Np-2 seems to be distinct from the VEGF-binding domain as suggested by the results of the competition experiments.To conclude, our experiments indicate that VEGFR-1 forms complexes with Np-2 and possibly also with Np-1. The presence of VEGFR-1 changes the specificity of VEGF binding, allowing VEGF121 to bind to Np-2. However, the biological function of these VEGFR-1·Np-2 complexes is still unclear. In addition our experiments indicate that changes in the intracellular domain of Np-2 can affect VEGF binding to Np-2 and provide evidence indicating that VEGF and semaphorins bind to nonoverlapping sites in the extracellular part of Np-2. The various forms of the growth factors belonging to the VEGF1 family (VEGF, PlGF, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D) act as inducers and modulators of angiogenesis in vivo (1Neufeld G. Cohen T.

The active forms of the VEGF family members are synthesized as homodimers (4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N.

Targeted disruption of the VEGF gene has shown that angiogenesis is severely disrupted even in heterozygous animals containing a single functional allele of the VEGF gene. It is therefore believed that the maintenance of correct levels of VEGF in vivo is critical for the development of the cardiovascular system (7Ferrara N. Carvermoore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L.

The molecular mechanism underlying PAR1 involvement in tumor invasion and metastasis, however, is poorly defined. Here we show that PAR1 increases the invasive properties of tumor cells primarily by increased adhesion to extracellular matrix components. This preferential adhesion is accompanied by the cytoskeletal reorganization of F-actin toward migration-favoring morphology as detected by phalloidin staining. Activation of PAR1 increased the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, and the induced formation of focal contact complexes. PAR1 activation affected integrin cell-surface distribution without altering their level of expression. The specific recruitment of αvβ5 to focal contact sites, but not of αvβ3 or α5β1, was observed by immunofluorescent microscopy. PAR1 overexpressing cells showed selective reciprocal co-precipitation with αvβ5 and paxillin but not with αvβ3 that remained evenly distributed under these conditions. This co-immunoprecipitation failed to occur in cells containing the truncated form of PAR1 that lacked the entire cytoplasmic portion of the receptor. Thus, the PAR1 cytoplasmic tail is essential for conveying the cross-talk and recruiting the αvβ5 integrin. While PAR1 overexpressing cells were invasive in vitro, as reflected by their migration through a Matrigel barrier, invasion was further enhanced by ligand activation of PAR1. Moreover, the application of anti-αvβ5 antibodies specifically attenuated this PAR1 induced invasion.

It is well known that in tumor invasion and metastasis, the pericellular proteolytic systems, consisting of proteases and their specific cell surface receptors, are tightly regulated to modulate cellular functions and degrade selective matrix barriers (1Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 2Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Romer J. Almholt K. Dano K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the proteolytically activated receptor 1 (PAR1,1 thrombin receptor) plays a central role in the malignant and physiological invasion processes of both breast carcinoma metastasis and placental implantation (3Even-Ram S. Uziely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Reich R. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, tumor invasion is mediated via the combined interactions of the host cell signaling machinery and the regulation of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM). Extensive proteolysis in the tumor microenvironment is also responsible for the activation of several enzymatic precursors, like plasminogen, pro-matrix metalloproteinase, and prothrombin (4Carroll V.A. Binder B.R. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1999; 25: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Kurschat P. Zigrino P. Nischt R. Breitkopf K. Steurer P. Klein C.E. Krieg T. Mauch C. J. Biol.

In addition, the extravascular deposition of fibrin within the tumor microenvironment is well established (7Shoji M. Hancock W.W. Abe K. Micko C. Casper K. Baine R.M. Wilcox J.N. Danave I. Dillehay D.L. Matthews E. Contrino J. Morrissey J.H. Gordon S. Edington T.S. Kudryk B. Kreutzer D.L. Rickles F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 399-411PubMed Google Scholar), pointing to the significant role of the coagulation proteins in tumor progression. Indeed, the tissue factor (TF), a protease receptor that plays a central role in hemostasis, has also been implicated in angiogenesis and tumor cell metastasis by means of intracellular events mediated by its cytoplasmic tail and by the perivascular extracellular proteolysis (8Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawashe J.F. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 9Mueller B.M. Ruff W. J. Clin.

These features are shared by other cellular receptors involved in the proteolytic modification of the tumor environment. Among these is the receptor for the serine protease urokinase, which, when bound to its cell surface receptor (uPAR), converts plasminogen to plasmin; plasmin, in turn, is known to effectively degrade various matrix glycoproteins (1Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 11Vassali J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). It has been shown also that uPAR serves as an adhesion receptor for vitronectin (12Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and that the vitronectin receptor αvβ3 not only supports the migration of tumor cells on various matrix-proteins but also binds matrix metalloproteinase-2, thus presenting an immobilized enzyme with improved matrix-collagen degradation properties at the invasive front (13Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Additional cell surface protease receptors include the PAR family, which are proteolytically cleaved G-coupled receptors of seven transmembrane-spanning domains. Unlike most cellular growth factor receptors, the PAR family members do not require the traditional ligand-receptor complex formation for activation. Instead, they are activated by a specific cleavage within their extracellular N-terminal portion to unmask a new amino acid terminus, which serves then as an internal ligand for activation (14Kahn M.L.

Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Until now, four members of the PAR family have been identified and of these, three (PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4) have been established collectively as “thrombin receptors,” possibly serving as a redundant receptor system for the coagulation protease cellular response (14Kahn M.L. Hammes S.R. Botka C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23290-23296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since solid tumors are in close contact with ECM components, malignant cell invasion into the surrounding tissues is facilitated by mutual interactions that convey essential signaling cues to the cells (19Liotta L.A. Rao C.N. Barsky S.H. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 636-649PubMed Google Scholar,20Crowe D.L. Shuler C.F. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar). These cell-ECM interactions are mediated by integrins, a family of adhesion receptors that mediate the attachment of the cell to both structural and matrix-immobilized proteins to promote cell survival, proliferation, and migration (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3807) Google Scholar, 22Bissell M.J. Weaver V.M. Lelievre S.A. Wang F. Petersen O.W. Schmeichel K.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (; Discussion 1763s–1764s): 1757s-1763sPubMed Google Scholar). It is widely recognized that integrins perform a significant function in cellular invasion and metastasis (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar, 24Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Non-ligated integrins are generally distributed diffusely over the cell surface with no apparent linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. However, ECM-bound integrins frequently cluster into specialized structures termed focal adhesion complexes (FACs), thus providing a convergence site for multiple signaling components (26Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 27Gilmore A.P. Burridge K.

Deming S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1615-1622PubMed Google Scholar). A growing number of studies indicate that signals driven by integrins act in concert with signals initiated by the G-protein-coupled receptors and with receptors for tyrosine kinase to promote the pathological tumor cell invasion process, on the one hand, and physiological activities like angiogenesis and wound healing (37Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 38Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) on the other. The combined signals involved with the activation of focal adhesion proteins indicate that the cooperation between the signaling pathway takes place most likely within these FAC structures. In the present work, we have studied the molecular mechanism of PAR1 involvement in tumor cell invasion. We show here that PAR1 modulates the invasive phenotype of melanoma cell lines, inducing the otherwise non-invasive cells to migrate effectively through Matrigel barriers. This process is accompanied by the increased adherence of the cells to various matrix components, actin stress fiber formation, and adhesion-triggered signaling, with no alteration of the cell surface integrin levels. We demonstrate now, for the first time, that PAR1 mediates these functions via selective cross-talk with the αvβ5 integrin to confer FAC formation, distinct signaling events, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Combined, these processes promote tumor cell invasion. SB-2 non-invasive human melanoma and A375-SM “super-metastatic” human melanoma cells (kindly provided by J. Fidler and M. Bar-Eli, Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) were grown in 10‥ FCS-DMEM supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in a humidified incubator with 8‥ CO2 at 37 °C. The PAR1 stable transfectants, clone 13 and clone Mix L, were grown under the same conditions; for long term maintenance, these were supplemented also with 200 μg/ml G418 antibiotics. MCF-7 cells were maintained as previously described (3Even-Ram S. Uziely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Reich R. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 30–40‥ confluence and then transfected with 0.5–2 μ g/ml plasmid DNA in Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 10 days of selection, stable, transfected clones were established in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Antibiotic-resistant cell colonies were transferred to separate culture dishes and were grown in 200 μg/ml G418 medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, transiently transfected cells were collected and tested by immunoprecipitation analyses (see below). Using polymerase chain reaction, we constructed a PAR-1 mutant protein truncated in its cytoplasmic tail after the amino acid Leu-369. As a template, we used PAR-1 cDNA in the pCDNA 3 vector. For amplification, we used a T7 sense primer and the reverse primer GGTCTAGAAAACTATAGGGGGTCGATGCACGAGCT containing a STOP codon and anXbaI site. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned using the polymerase chain reaction-blunt technique (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The insert was released from the vector byXbaI digestion and cloned into plasmid pCDNA3. To confirm the functional integrity of the DNA constructs, wild type and mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in 293 cells that were subsequently stained with a PAR-1-specific antibody (WEDE15, Immunotech, Cedex, France). Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1‥ Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were saved and their protein contents were measured; 50 μg of the lysates were loaded onto 10‥ SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After the proteins were separated, they were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked and probed with 1 μg/ml amounts of the appropriate antibodies as follows: anti-PAR1 thrombin receptor mAb, clone II aR-A (Biodesign Int.); anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone 349 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington KY); anti-human focal adhesion kinase, rabbit polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.); anti-vinculin mAb (Transduction Laboratories). The antibodies were suspended in 1‥ BSA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5‥ Tween 20. After washes with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5‥ Tween 20, the blots were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent using Luminol and p-cumaric acid (Sigma). Cells were treated for 30–60 min with thrombin at a concentration of 1 NIH unit/ml of serum-free DMEM medium (0.5‥ BSA), and then lysed as described above. We used 400 μg of total protein for immunoprecipitation of αvβ3, αvβ5, paxillin, FAK, or both paxillin and FAK. All the antibodies were used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. After overnight incubation, Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the suspension (50 μl) that was subsequently rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Elution of the reactive proteins was made by re-suspending the beads in protein 2× sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20‥ glycerol, 20‥ SDS, 0.01‥ bromphenol blue, 5‥ β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02 m dithiothreitol) and boiling for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded on a 10‥ SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by the same procedure as in Western blotting. We used blind-well chemotaxis chambers with 13-mm diameter filters. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Costar Scientific Co., Cambridge, MA) were coated with basement membrane Matrigel (25 μg/filter) as described previously (39Albini A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 1998; 4: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Matrigel was diluted to the desired final concentration with cold distilled water, applied to the filters, dried under a hood, and reconstituted with serum-free medium. In the upper compartment of the Boyden chamber, we placed 2–3 × 105 cells suspended in DMEM containing 0.1‥ bovine serum albumin. As a chemo-attractant, into the lower compartment of the Boyden chamber, we put 3T3 fibroblast conditioned medium. Assays were carried out in 5‥ CO2 at 37 °C. After 2 h of incubation, we observed that more than 90‥ of the cells were attached to the filter. At this time, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. The filters were fixed in DifQuick system (American Scientific Products) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cells from various areas of the lower surface were counted. Each assay was performed in triplicate. For chemotaxis studies (a control of Matrigel invasion), the filters were coated with collagen type IV alone (5 mg/filter) to promote cell adhesion. Cells were added to the upper chamber and conditioned medium to the lower compartment. The medium of cells grown in 10‥ FCS was replaced by DMEM with 0.5‥ BSA, and the cells were detached from the plate by treating with 0.05‥ trypsin in a solution of 0.02‥ EDTA in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). After washing, 0.5 × 106cells/ml cells were re-suspended in a serum-free DMEM medium (as above) and laid on 13-mm culture dishes pre-coated with either 100 μg/ml fibronectin or Th-1, a thrombin-derived RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) peptide. After a 45-min incubation period to allow cell adhesion, the excess cells were washed away. The adhered cells were fixed to the plates with 4‥ formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for at least 2 h. After fixation, the plates were washed in 1‥ boric acid solution and the cells were stained with 1‥ methylene blue reagent (Sigma) in 1‥ boric acid for 30 min. After extensive washing with tap water, the methylene stain was eluted by the addition of 500 μl of 1m HCl. The intensity of the color staining was measured by color spectrometry at a wavelength of 620 nm. Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 16-mm culture dishes; after the cells had grown to subconfluence, they were washed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.5‥ Triton X-100-containing 3.5‥ paraformaldehyde/PBS solution on ice for 2 min, and finally fixed with 3.5‥ paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min. Reactions with the appropriate antibodies were performed in room temperature for 60 min, after which the cells were washed extensively in PBS. The antibodies included the following: anti-αvβ3 mAb clone LM609, anti-αvβ5 clone P1F6, and anti-α5β1 clone JBS5, (all from Chemicon Int.). After the 60-min incubation with the primary antibodies, followed by extensive washes in PBS, an additional 60-min incubation was carried out in the dark with secondary antibodies, goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse IgG each conjugated with Cy-3 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) diluted 1:700. Labeling of filamentous actin by 1 μ g/ml FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was performed similarly. The labeled cells were visualized and photographed by fluorescent confocal microscopy (MRC-1024 confocal imaging system, Bio-Rad). The medium of cells grown in 10‥ FCS-DMEM was replaced by serum-free DMEM containing 0.5‥ BSA. Thrombin at a concentration of 1 IU/ml was added to the plates that were activated by incubation for 60 min. The plates were washed with PBS, and the cells were detached from the plates by treatment with 0.05‥ trypsin in a solution of 0.02‥ EDTA in 0.1 m sodium phosphate at pH 7.4 (Biological Industries). After being washed twice in PBS, the cells were re-suspended in 200 μl of PBS and the appropriate antibodies were added to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. These reactions, performed at room temperature for 60 min, were followed by extensive washing in PBS. A 1-h incubation with a secondary antibody goat-anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) conjugated with FITC and diluted 1:500 was carried out in the dark. The treated cells were washed extensively, re-suspended in 100 μl of PBS, and analyzed by FACS. In previous work (3Even-Ram S. Uziely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Reich R. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we showed that there is a direct correlation between PAR1 expression and the metastatic potential of primary tumor biopsies and tumor cell lines, as reflected by theirin vitro potential to invade through a Matrigel barrier. 2E. Pokroy, B. Uziely, S. Even-Ram Cohen, M. Maoz, I. Cohen, S. Ochayon, R. Reich, J. Pe'er, O. Drize, M. Lotem, and R. Bar-Shavit, submitted for publication. In a physiological invading model system of placenta trophoblast implantation, we have also shown that PAR1 is part of the invasive program of trophoblast, as evaluated by their villi extension and matrix metalloproteinase synthesis. 3S. Even-Ram Cohen, S. Grisaru-Granovsky, M. Maoz, S. Zaidoun, Y.-J. Yin, and R. Bar-Shavit, submitted for publication. Here, to clarify how high levels of PAR1 may confer invasiveness, we transfected a non-invasive melanoma cell line (SB-2 cells) with PAR1 cDNA and compared the properties of the transfected cells to those of the highly invasive melanoma cell line A375SM. We used PAR1 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus viral promoter in the pCDNA3 expression vector. We selected several stable clones that expressed high levels of PAR1, as evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 a) and Northern blot analysis (data not shown). The selected clones were then tested for their ability to invade through Matrigel-coated filters. Indeed, clones expressing high levels of PAR1 had an increased ability to invade the Matrigel layer, as compared with control clones transfected with empty vectors or SB-2 cells that had not been transfected at all (Fig.1 b). In addition, we observed that, whereas highly invasive A375SM cells invaded Matrigel coated membranes more efficiently than did non-metastatic cells (Fig. 1 b, SB-2), activating the A375SM cells with PAR1 increased their ability to invade Matrigel to an even higher level (Fig. 1 b, activ. A375SM). In addition, the invasiveness of PAR1-transfected cells was further increased when they were either activated by thrombin, as shown in two separate PAR1-transfected clones (Fig. 1 b,clones 13 and Mix L), or when they were treated with the thrombin-receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) that corresponds to PAR1 internal ligand SFFLRN (data not shown). Circulating tumor cells can invade into a new metatastic site only if they can adhere to the basement membrane. We analyzed the adhesion properties of cells suspended in a serum-free medium and then incubated for 60 min on plates coated with either fibronectin, a major component of the ECM, or with Th-1, an 11-amino acid peptide, corresponding to the thrombin RGD motif (40Bar-Shavit R. Sabbah V. Lampugnani M.G. Marchisio P.C. Fenton I.I.J.W. Vlodavsky I. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Highly invasive A375 SM melanoma cells adhered strongly to both Th-1 and fibronectin; however, under the same conditions, the non-invasive SB-2 cells failed to adhere. We observed a marked increase in the adherence to both of these matrices of PAR1-transfected SB-2 cells (Fig. 2,a and b). The level of adherence of these PAR1 transfectants was directly correlated both with their level of PAR1 expression and with their ability to invade the Matrigel barrier. To assure that this increase in their adherence was actually caused by the presence of PAR1, we asked if reducing the expression of PAR1 in malignant cells would reduce the adhesion properties of these cells. To do this, we evaluated the effect of transfection by PAR1 antisense DNA on the adhesion properties of the invasive A375SM cells. We used a 462-base pair oligonucleotide fragment corresponding to the 5′ region of PAR1 that included part of the near promoter sequence and the coding region for the internal ligand. We cloned this DNA segment into pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector in an antisense orientation, selecting for stable clones expressing the plasmid bearing the PAR1 antisense DNA as compared with cells transfected by empty vectors or non-transfected control cells. Northern blot analysis (Fig.2 d) indicated that, whereas empty vector transfection (Fig.2 d, B) had no significant effect on PAR1 expression (Fig. 2 d, A), clones AS -3 (Fig.2 d, C) and AS-4 (Fig. 2 d,D), which were transfected by the PAR1 antisense DNA, did exhibit reduced PAR1 expression. When we analyzed clones AS-3 and AS-4 for their adhesion properties, we found that the cell adherence properties to fibronectin (Fig. 2 c) and to Th-1 (data not shown) of both of these clones were significantly lower than those of the A375 SM parental cells. The organization of the cytoskeleton is critically influenced by adhesion interactions. To explore the effect of PAR1 activation on cytoskeletal reorganization, we plated PAR1-transfected cells (clone 13) and control non-transfected cells (SB-2 cells) on glass coverslips and then treated them with TRAP for various periods of time (Fig.2 e). After activation by TRAP, the cells were permeabilized, fixed, and stained with FITC-labeled phalloidin to detect filamentous actin (F-actin). Cytoskeletal reorganization was observed as early as 15 min after activation by TRAP (Fig. 2 e). Thirty to 60 min after PAR1 activation, we observed a transition in the PAR1 transfectants from elongated spindle-like shapes to spreading, jellyfish-like structures. Ninety minutes to 2 h after activation, the cells became rounder and we observed the appearance of a ringlike bundle of actin filaments at the base of the cells (typical of migrating cells). These changes occurred more rapidly and were more dramatic in PAR1-overexpressing cells than they did in the non-transfected control cells. Altogether, these data show that the adhesive properties of tumor cells were affected by changes in PAR1 expression. Integrin activation typically leads to the assembly of focal adhesion contacts"

Sphingomyelin (SM) is hydrolyzed to ceramide by different sphingomyelinases. Ceramide serves as a second messenger in mediating cellular effects of cytokines and stress. In this study, we find that acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity was induced by UVA in normal JY lymphoblasts but was not detectable in MS1418 lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick type D patients who have an inherited deficiency of acid SMase. We also provide evidence that UVA can induce apoptosis by activating acid SMase in normal JY cells. In contrast, UVA-induced apoptosis was inhibited in MS1418 cells. Exogenous SMase and its product, ceramide (10–40 μm), induced apoptosis in JY and MS1418 cells, but the substrate of SMase, SM (20–80 μm), induced apoptosis only in JY cells. These results suggest that UVA-induced apoptosis by SM is dependent on acid SMase activity. We also provide evidence that induction of apoptosis by UVA may occur through activation of JNKs via the acid SMase pathway.

In recent years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the multistep regulatory mechanisms that are associated with the propensity of a cell to respond to various stimuli with apoptosis (1Saikumar P.

Hence, antitumor strategies based on modulation of the propensity of the cell to undergo apoptosis attract great interest in oncology.Sphingolipids such as SM had been previously regarded as metabolically inactive, functioning only as structural components of the membrane (17Igarashi Y.

However, besides its structural role in biomembranes, SM plays a pivotal role in signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions including growth, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (14Hannun Y.A.

A number of studies have demonstrated that extracellular cytokines and stress stimuli, such as TNFα, interleukin-1β, FAS ligand, heat shock, γ-radiation (23Santana P. Peña L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A.

To date, at least seven classes of mammalian SMases have been described, differing in subcellular location, pH optimum, cation dependence, and roles in cell regulation (11Okazaki T. Kondo T.

Most research has focused on the UVC (200–290 nm) and UVB (290–320 nm) induction of apoptosis (31Beissert S. Granstein R.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1996; 31: 381-404Google Scholar, 32Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

Here, we observe that acid SMase is activated by UVA, and we provide evidence that UVA-induced apoptosis is dependent on acid SMase activity. Exogenous sphingomyelinase and its product, ceramide, also induce apoptosis independent of activation of intracellular SMase, but induction of apoptosis by SM is dependent on the SMase activity. Our data further indicate that UVA-induced apoptosis may occur through activation of JNKs via the SMase pathway.DISCUSSIONExposure to UV radiation can cause cell cycle arrest (50Herrlich P.

In the present study, we observed that UVA, like UVB and UVC, induced apoptosis in normal lymphoblast cells (JY) but not in MS1418 lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick type D patients who have an inherited deficiency of acid SMase. UVA radiation is known to induce an array of stress proteins quite distinct from those induced by UVB or UVC (51Tyrrell R.M. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. (UV activation of mammalian stress proteins) in Stress-inducible cellular Responses.Birkäuser Verlag. 1996; : 255-271Google Scholar). UVB and UVC were clearly shown to mimic growth factor responses and stimulate signal transduction including the SMase pathway (12Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J.

Noncytotoxic exposure to UVA can also up-regulate several signal molecules (32Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol... 1997; 37: 1-17Google Scholar, 42Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem... 1995; 58: 191-198Google Scholar), but the role of the SMase pathway in UVA-induced apoptosis is not well understood.In this study, we provide evidence that UVA, UVB, and UVC can all activate acid SMase (Fig. 1) and lead to an increase in ceramide levels (Fig. 2) in normal JY cells. Analysis of DNA fragmentation laddering and morphological changes in apoptotic cells showed that sublethal doses of UVA (20–80 kJ/m2), similar to lethal doses of UVB and UVC, can also induce apoptosis in normal JY cells, but UVA-induced apoptosis is prevented in acid SMase-deficient MS1418 cells. On the other hand, the difference in UVB- or UVC-induced apoptosis was less apparent in normal and SMase-deficient cells. These results suggest that UVA-induced apoptosis occurs through activation of acid SMase, whereas UVB- or UVC-induced apoptosis occurs through SMase-independent pathways. However, additional pathways involved in mediating UVA-induced apoptosis cannot be disregarded, including neutral SMase (25Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 14617-14622Google Scholar, 26Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M.

Commun... 1998; 247: 693-696Google Scholar), because UVA-induced apoptosis is not completely blocked in acid SMase-deficient MS1418 cells.Klotz et al. (44Klotz L.-O. Pelliuex C. Briviba K. Pierlot C. Aubry J.-M. Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem... 1999; 260: 917-922Google Scholar) reported that UVA did not activate ERKs, and we found that UVA, like UVB and UVC, did not induce phosphorylation (Fig. 6) and activation (data not shown) of ERKs in SMase-normal JY cells. However, UVA strongly induced ERKs phosphorylation in SMase-deficient MS1418 cells suggesting that in the absence of SMase, UVA may stimulate alternate pathways (e.g. ERKs) that may protect against UVA-induced apoptosis in these cells. We also found that UVA, as well as UVB and UVC, induced phosphorylation and activation of p38 kinase (Fig. 7). However, UVA-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase appeared to be less in normal SMase JY cells compared with SMase-deficient MS1418 cells, whereas UVB- or UVC-induced phosphorylation was similar between the two cell lines (Fig. 7). Neither inhibition of UVA-induced ERKs activation by PD98059 (48Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 4426-4441Google Scholar) nor inhibition of p38 kinase activation by SB202190 (49Blair A.S. Hajduch E. Litherland G.J. Hundal H.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 36293-36299Google Scholar) blocked UVA-induced apoptosis in normal JY cells (Fig. 8, left panel). However, MS1418 cells pretreated with PD98059 or SB202190 now showed typical apoptosis following UVA irradiation (Fig. 8,right panel). These results further confirm that activation and phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase do not appear to be involved in UVA-induced apoptosis in normal JY cells, but in the absence of SMase, UVA irradiation may induce ERKs and p38 kinase leading to inhibition of apoptosis.Acid SMase was previously shown to be involved in UVB- and UVC-induced activation of JNKs (43Huang C. Ma W.-Y Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27753-27757Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that UVA, like UVB and UVC, induced phosphorylation of JNKs in acid SMase normal JY cells and that the phosphorylation of JNKs was markedly inhibited in SMase-deficient cells (Fig. 5). However, TPA-induced JNKs phosphorylation was not different between the two cell lines. These results suggest that UVA-, UVB-, or UVC-, but not TPA-induced phosphorylation and activation of JNKs, is acid SMase-dependent. In addition, we observed that UVA-induced apoptosis was completely blocked in jnk1−/− andjnk2−/− cells (Fig. 9 B) further indicating that JNKs are a downstream kinase family of the acid SMase pathway (45Ichijo H.

Science.. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Google Scholar). Overall, these results strongly suggest that UVA-induced apoptosis in normal SMase JY cells occurs primarily through activation of JNKs via the acid SMase pathway. Cell death is an irreversible process that culminates in cessation of biological activity (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J.

Apoptosis is an active and physiological mode of cell death and is well characterized by morphological changes including cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (2Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry.. 1997; 27: 1-20Google Scholar). In recent years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the multistep regulatory mechanisms that are associated with the propensity of a cell to respond to various stimuli with apoptosis (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Med... 1999; 107: 489-506Google Scholar, 2Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F.

These systems interact with the machinery regulating cell proliferation and DNA repair through several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes such as p53 (2Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry.. 1997; 27: 1-20Google Scholar). Hence, antitumor strategies based on modulation of the propensity of the cell to undergo apoptosis attract great interest in oncology. Sphingolipids such as SM had been previously regarded as metabolically inactive, functioning only as structural components of the membrane (17Igarashi Y. J. Biochem.

However, besides its structural role in biomembranes, SM plays a pivotal role in signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions including growth, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (14Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar, 15Levade T. Jaffrézou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1438: 1-17Google Scholar, 16Mathias S. Peña L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem.

A number of studies have demonstrated that extracellular cytokines and stress stimuli, such as TNFα, interleukin-1β, FAS ligand, heat shock, γ-radiation (23Santana P. Peña L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A.

Ceramide, a product of SMase-catalyzed hydrolysis of SM, was shown to act as a lipid second messenger or biomodulator of diverse stress-related responses including cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, and apoptosis (14Hannun Y.A.

To date, at least seven classes of mammalian SMases have been described, differing in subcellular location, pH optimum, cation dependence, and roles in cell regulation (11Okazaki T. Kondo T.

The acid SMase (pH optimum 4.5–5.0) is activated in cells exposed to ionizing radiation, FAS, CD28, interleukin-1, or TNFα (23Santana P. Peña L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D.

Analysis of DNA fragmentation laddering and morphological changes in apoptotic cells showed that sublethal doses of UVA (20–80 kJ/m2), similar to lethal doses of UVB and UVC, can also induce apoptosis in normal JY cells, but UVA-induced apoptosis is prevented in acid SMase-deficient MS1418 cells. On the other hand, the difference in UVB- or UVC-induced apoptosis was less apparent in normal and SMase-deficient cells. These results suggest that UVA-induced apoptosis occurs through activation of acid SMase, whereas UVB- or UVC-induced apoptosis occurs through SMase-independent pathways. However, additional pathways involved in mediating UVA-induced apoptosis cannot be disregarded, including neutral SMase (25Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol.

However, UVA strongly induced ERKs phosphorylation in SMase-deficient MS1418 cells suggesting that in the absence of SMase, UVA may stimulate alternate pathways (e.g. ERKs) that may protect against UVA-induced apoptosis in these cells. We also found that UVA, as well as UVB and UVC, induced phosphorylation and activation of p38 kinase (Fig. 7). However, UVA-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase appeared to be less in normal SMase JY cells compared with SMase-deficient MS1418 cells, whereas UVB- or UVC-induced phosphorylation was similar between the two cell lines (Fig. 7).

However, MS1418 cells pretreated with PD98059 or SB202190 now showed typical apoptosis following UVA irradiation (Fig. 8,right panel). These results further confirm that activation and phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase do not appear to be involved in UVA-induced apoptosis in normal JY cells, but in the absence of SMase, UVA irradiation may induce ERKs and p38 kinase leading to inhibition of apoptosis.Acid SMase was previously shown to be involved in UVB- and UVC-induced activation of JNKs (43Huang C. Ma W.-Y Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27753-27757Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that UVA, like UVB and UVC, induced phosphorylation of JNKs in acid SMase normal JY cells and that the phosphorylation of JNKs was markedly inhibited in SMase-deficient cells (Fig. 5). However, TPA-induced JNKs phosphorylation was not different between the two cell lines. These results suggest that UVA-, UVB-, or UVC-, but not TPA-induced phosphorylation and activation of JNKs, is acid SMase-dependent. In addition, we observed that UVA-induced apoptosis was completely blocked in jnk1−/− andjnk2−/− cells (Fig. 9 B) further indicating that JNKs are a downstream kinase family of the acid SMase pathway (45Ichijo H.

Variation in domain structure and more subtle structural differences control their characteristic specificity profiles for substrates from among four distinct classes (Nagase, H., and Woessner, J. F. J. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21491–21494). Exploitation of these differences may be decisive for the design of anticancer or other drugs, which should be highly selective for their particular MMP targets. Based on the 1.8-Å crystal structure of human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) in complex with an active site-directed inhibitor (RO200-1770), we identify and describe new structural determinants for substrate and inhibitor recognition in addition to the primary substrate recognition sites. RO200-1770 induces a major rearrangement at a position relevant to substrate recognition near the MMP-8 active site (Ala206–Asn218). In stromelysin (MMP-3), competing stabilizing interactions at the analogous segment hinder a similar rearrangement, consistent with kinetic profiling of several MMPs. Despite the apparent dissimilarity of the inhibitors, the central 2-hydroxypyrimidine-4,6-dione (barbiturate) ring of the inhibitor RO200-1770 mimics the interactions of the hydroxamate-derived inhibitor batimastat (Grams, F., Reinemer, P., Powers, J. C., Kleine, T., Pieper, M., Tschesche, H., Huber, R., and Bode, W. (1995)Eur. J. Biochem. 228, 830–841) for binding to MMP-8. The two additional phenyl and piperidyl ring substituents of the inhibitor bind into the S1′ and S2′ pockets of MMP-8, respectively. The crystal lattice contains a hydrogen bond between the Oγgroup of Ser209 and Nδ1 of His207 of a symmetry related molecule; this interaction suggests a model for recognition of hydroxyprolines present in physiological substrates. We also identify a collagenase-characteristic cis-peptide bond, Asn188–Tyr189, on a loop essential for collagenolytic activity. The sequence conservation pattern at this position marks this cis-peptide bond as a determinant for triple-helical collagen recognition and processing.

The “minimal” MMPs matrilysin and endometase (MMP-7 and MMP-26, respectively), have a Zn2+ and Ca2+ binding catalytic domain, and an N-terminal pro-domain. All other known MMPs possess additionally a hemopexin-like domain near the C terminus, and further domain insertions differentiate MMP subfamilies. Gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9) possess three fibronectin type II-like repeats inserted at a loop in the catalytic domain; these form an independent folding domain adjacent to the catalytic domain.

Conformational rearrangements accompanying the inhibitor binding lead to a new and highly ordered crystal packing arrangement. The high resolution structural data enables a thorough analysis of determinants of MMP selectivity toward both low molecular weight substances as well as substrate classes. A previously unreported cis-peptide bond (Asn188—Tyr189) could be unambiguously identified. The conservation patterns of the sequence at the cis-peptide bond position support the hypothesis that this cis-peptide plays a critical role in substrate recognition mechanisms specific to the collagenases I and II (MMP-1 and MMP-8). MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-8 were kindly provided by Profs. G. Murphy (University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom), H. Nagase (Imperial College, London, United Kingdom), and H. Tschesche (University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany), respectively; MMP-2 and MMP-9 were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Penzberg, Germany); MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP were provided by Prof. J. Foidart (Université de Liège, Liège, Belgium). The inhibitors RO200-1770, RO204-1924, I-COL043, RO206-0027, and RO206-0032 were synthesized as described previously (28Bosies E. Esswein A. Grams F. Krell H.W. New Barbituric Acid Derivative, Processes Forware Production, and Pharmaceutical Agents Containing these Compounds. Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN1996Google Scholar). The fluorogenic substrate M-1855 (Dnp-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-d-Arg-NH2) was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany); all other chemicals were of highest purity commercially available. All measurements were performed at 25 °C using a buffering solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2. Based on multiple measurements, all data are precise to within 5%. Depending on activity, enzymes were used at 5–50 nm concentration range with a substrate concentration of 2.55 μm. The enzyme was briefly pre-incubated with the inhibitor at a resultant Me2SO concentration of 1%. The reaction was started with the addition of the substrate M-1855. Substrate was excited at 280 nm and the substrate fluorescence was monitored at 346 nm using the FuoroMax-3 fluorometer (SPEX, Horiba Group, Grasbrunn/Munich, Germany). MMP-8 was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and then mixed with 3-fold molar excess of an aqueous solution of RO200-1770 for a final MMP-8 concentration of 6 mg/ml. 3 μl of protein-inhibitor complex was mixed with 2 μl precipitant solution containing 100 mmcacodylate pH 5.5–6.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% polyethylene glycol 6000. The hanging drop was equilibrated by vapor diffusion at room temperature against a reservoir containing 1.0–1.5 m phosphate buffer. Data were collected on a multiwire detector (X1000, Bruker AXS) to 1.8-Å resolution and processed using SAINT data reduction software (29Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L.

The space group of the crystal was determined as I222 with unit cell dimensions a = 61.02 Å, b = 69.24 Å, c = 88.47 Å. The orientation and translation of the molecule within the crystallographic unit cell was determined with Patterson search techniques (30Huber R.

Electron density calculation and model building proceeded using the program MAIN (34Turk D. Chemistry. Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany1992Google Scholar). The structure has been refined by using the program X-PLOR (35Brunger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR , Version 3.1. Yale Univeristy Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) to a crystallographic R-value of 21.1% (Rfree = 29.6%) with bond deviations of 0.009 Å and angle deviations of 1.7° from ideality (36Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar). The molecular structure was analyzed and compared using appropriate tools within the program MAIN (34Turk D. Chemistry. Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany1992Google Scholar). The inhibitor RO200-1770 is a barbituric acid derivative, doubly substituted with phenyl and 4-ethanolpiperidyl rings as depicted in Fig.1. The barbiturate ring chelates the zinc and rigidly orients the two cyclic substituents into the S1′ and S2′ substrate binding sites. Neither substituent ring system appears strained by the protein environment, although their relative orientations may be induced by protein binding. The phenyl moiety occupies the MMP-8 binding site and is perfectly planar to within the 1.8-Å resolution. The electron density observed for the piperidine ring allows an interpretation whereby two chair conformations related by a 180° rotation along the C5-pN1 bond might be superimposed; either conformation would allow favorable hydrophobic contacts in the S2′-site. Adopting an all-trans conformation, the alcohol group points toward the solvent. The relative orientations of the rings of the inhibitor may be described by considering the ring planes and the bonds linking the substituent rings to the C5 atom of the barbiturate ring. The C5–fC1 bond linking the phenyl ring is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the barbiturate ring (excluding C5). This arrangement necessarily orients the plane of the phenyl ring likewise perpendicular to the barbiturate plane. The dihedral angle C6–C5–fC1–fC2 fixes the ring orientation with an eclipsed geometry (at 1.2°, while the C4–C5–C1–fC2dihedral is staggered at 60.8°). In contrast, the C5–pN1 bond lies nearly in the plane of the barbiturate, extending the P2′-piperidyl ring away from the barbiturate; all dihedrals across the C5—pN1bond have staggered orientations. This results in an arrangement where all three rings are mutually perpendicular, as follows: the angle between (the normal vectors) of the barbiturate and phenyl rings is 91°, between the barbiturate and the piperidyl rings is 103°, and between the phenyl and piperidyl rings is 111°. The MMP-8 substrate recognition sites are shown schematically in Fig. 3 A. Comparison with the binding mode of RO200-1770 as depicted in Fig. 3 Bhighlights the inhibitor binding at the “primed” substrate recognition sites and at the Zn2+ ion. The Zn2+is coordinated by atoms N3 and O2 of the barbiturate ring. The Zn2+—N3 coordination has a favorable distance of 2.09 Å and highly symmetric Zn2+-N3-C2 and Zn2+-N3-C4 angles of 119° and 117°, respectively. Positioned where the catalytic water is expected for peptidic substrates, a partial negative charge at the hydroxyl O2 is stabilized by the adjacent Glu198, thereby strengthening its binding to Zn2+ (Figs. 2 and 3, TableII). The enol form of the barbiturate is thus favored by the protein matrix over the tautomeric keto form, which dominates in solution (37Budavari S. ONeil M.J. Smith A. Heckelman P. E The Merck Index.11th Ed. Merck % Co., Inc., Rahway,NJ1989Google Scholar). In addition, the polar H1-N1-C6=O6 atoms of the barbiturate (Fig. 3 B) mimic the P1′-S1′ antiparallel main chain interactions of a substrate (Fig. 3 A). The amide N1-H1 thereby is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl of Ala161, and the ketone C6=O6 is stabilized by the amides of Leu160 and Ala161. This latter interaction is reminiscent of the oxyanion hole binding of serine proteinases, although here there is no evidence of oxygen anion stabilization. The C4=O4 ketone seems unlikely to contribute to the binding energy for two reasons. First, unfavorable geometry (TableI) precludes a role as a third ligand in the Zn2+ chelation. More importantly, the C4=O4 ketone would collide with the carbonyl oxygen position of Pro217 at the “southern” rim of the active site as defined by other MMP-8 structures (2Grams F. Reinemer P.

Alternatively, the coordination can be described as a distorted square pyramid where O2, N3, Nε2(His201), and Nε2(His207) form the basal ligands (dihedral deviation from planarity 15°, Table I). The metal ion lies outside of the basal plane but within 0.5 Å, and the fifth ligand Nε2(His197) forms the apex of the pyramid Table I. (If considering O4 to be a sixth ligand, the geometry may be described as a pentagonal pyramid with O4 as basal ligand in addition to O2, N3, Nε2(His201), and Nε2(His207)). In contrast to the polar interactions of the barbiturate ring, the interactions mediated by the phenyl and piperidyl rings are predominantly hydrophobic and involve the S1′ and S2′ pockets, respectively. The most prominent interaction in the S1′ pocket is the ideally parallel planar stacking of the phenyl ring and His197 at a distance of 3.6 Å (Fig.4). The conserved Leu160contributes to ligand binding also with its side chain in the S1′ site. The phenyl ring does not by itself fill the S1′ site, but leaves space filled by a network of three ordered water molecules. The first of these (Sol595) is probably incompletely occupied and forms hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor, with MMP-8, and with a second water molecule. The proximity of the inhibitor phenyl fC4 atom to Sol595 (3.1 Å) indicates a O … H-C interaction (38Wahl M.C. Sundaralingam M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The carbonyl group of Leu193 forms a 2.9-Å hydrogen bond with Sol595 with, however, an unfavorable C=O193-O595 angle of 113°. The second water molecule, Sol602, is positioned deeper inside the S1′ pocket at a hydrogen bonding distance of 2.7 Å from Sol595. Sol602 in turn is hydrogen-bonded (2.8 Å) with the third solvent molecule in the S1′ pocket, Sol592. Sol592 is in a channel bounded by Arg222, which forms a link between the three water network in S1′ and, via Sol667 (2.9 Å from Sol602), water in the adjacent cavity. Mutation of Arg222 would connect the two cavities, opening a “back door” to S1′ for solvent access. The guanidinium group atoms Nη2 and Nη1 of Arg222 are fixed by hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala213 (3.3 Å) and the Oη of Tyr227 (3.3 Å), respectively. Since most MMPs lack an equivalently stabilized Arg, MMP-8 has a comparatively restricted S1′ site. The hydrophobic interactions of the piperidine ring are mediated by aliphatic surfaces from Pro217-Asn218-Tyr219 at the “southern” rim of S2′ and by the main chain Gly158-Ile159-Leu160 at the “northern” rim. The latter residue (Leu160) separates the S1′ and S2′ pockets. No ordered water molecule can be detected in the vicinity of the hydroxyl group pOH9, although the position of this solvent exposed ethanol group is well defined by electron density (Fig. 2) and is thus presumably hydrated by disordered water. Significant differences are apparent in the protein structure compared with previously determined MMP-8 structures (2Grams F. Reinemer P. Powers J.C. Kleine T. Pieper M. Tschesche H. Huber R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The catalytic Zn2+ ion of the three reference structures occupies the same position to within 0.2 Å; it is, however, shifted from that average position by 0.6 Å in the RO200-1770 complex structure. Corresponding shifts of the Zn2+ protein ligand positions are also apparent, with the respective Nε2 and Cγ values measured as follows: His197 (0.4 Å, 0.3 Å), His201 (0.3 Å, 0.3 Å), and His207 (0.6 Å, 0.7 Å). Consistent with this overall shift, the side chain of the catalytic Glu198 is translated by 0.2 Å. This displacement of the catalytic Zn2+ and its protein ligands is evidently induced by inhibitor binding, as the net effect of the optimization of barbiturate-Zn chelation geometry and the inhibitor orienting forces arising from the other inhibitor-protein interactions. Of the two partial sequences harboring the Zn2+ binding histidine residues, the loop Ala206-His207-Asn218 is more exposed to the solvent and anchored by fewer protein contacts than the internal helix L191–H197EXXH201–L203. The conformation of this loop is altered by several effects associated with the binding of RO200-1770. First, the greater inherent plasticity of this loop leads to greater compensation by the Zn ligand His207 for shear stresses induced at the catalytic site. Second, the Pro217–Asn218 peptide bond is rotated by ∼100°, evidently to prevent a repulsive interaction between the barbiturate C4=O4 keto group with the Pro217 carbonyl. Third, residues Ser209, Tyr216, Pro217, and Asn218 form crystal contacts. These effects in combination lead to a translation along the entire loop from Ala206 to Pro217, which, however, is relatively rigid, leaving most dihedral angles similar to those in the reference structures. In the “north” rim of the active site, the largest change compared with the inhibitor free MMP-8 structure is a 0.98 Å displacement and disorder of the Ile159 side chain; the electron density shows a branched but symmetric side chain interpretable as two equally populated rotamers, which “swap” Cγ1 and Cγ2 positions. Utilizing the crystal structure of the MMP8-RO200-1770 complex, several follow-up compounds were synthesized and tested against the panel of metalloenzymes shown in Table II. The lead compound RO200-1770 shows broadly nonspecific micromolar inhibition, excepting only stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) with its ∼10-fold weaker binding affinity to RO200-1770. To facilitate synthesis, the piperidine of the lead compound RO200-1770 was substituted by an essentially isosteric piperazine, RO204-1924. The almost uniform decrease in binding affinity might be rationalized by higher desolvation penalties for piperazine binding. The theoretical clogP values calculated for 1,4-dimethylpiperidine (1.9) and 1,4-dimethylpiperazine (0.8) support this hypothesis (39Ghose A.K. Viswanadhan V.N. Wendoloski J.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 3762-3772Crossref Scopus (629) Google Scholar). I-COL043 and RO206-0027 represent the results of two orthogonal approaches to optimize P1′-S1′ and P2′-S2′ binding, respectively. For each inhibitor, an ∼10-fold increase in inhibition toward MMP-8, -2, -9, and -3 was accomplished, while inhibition of MT1-MMP and MMP-1 was weakened or remained relatively unchanged. With its 4-fold weaker inhibition of MMP-1, I-COL043 showed significantly enhanced selectivity potential against the latter enzyme. The P1′ and P2′ optimizations of I-COL043 and RO206-0027 are combined in RO206-0032 and the inhibition values demonstrate, to a first approximation, additivity of the effects for MMP-8, -2, -9, and MT1-MMP. The improvement in its binding affinity to stromelysin (MMP-3) is less distinct, while fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1) binding ave"

G-protein-coupled receptor N-methyl-d-glucamine analysis of variance Chinese hamster ovary The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 constitute a large family of proteins responsible for the transduction of a wide range of signals (e.g. hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, light, etc.) via G-proteins (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). GPCRs possess a common structural motif of seven α-helical membrane-spanning domains, and it is often assumed that the functional unit (i.e. the ligand binding and G-protein interaction domains) of the GPCR is wholly contained in a single polypeptide. Indeed, most models of GPCR function assume a monomeric receptor interacting with the G-protein (see, for example, Ref. 2Samama O. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that the some GPCRs may exist in dimeric or oligomeric forms. Immunoblotting has in several cases revealed species corresponding not only to the predicted molecular weight of the receptor but also to multiples of the molecular weight. Bands corresponding to approximately twice the predicted molecular weight of the receptor have been interpreted as homodimers for several receptors including D2 dopamine (3Ng G.Y.K. O'Dowd B.F.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), who created two chimeric receptors α2/M3 and M3/α2, in which the C-terminal regions (transmembrane domains VI and VII) were exchanged between the α2C adrenergic and M3muscarinic receptors. Expression of either chimera alone did not result in any detectable binding of typical radiolabeled muscarinic or adrenergic ligands. However, cotransfection of COS7 cells with both chimeras resulted in the appearance of binding activity corresponding to both native receptors. This has lead to the proposal that some GPCRs might form domain-swapped dimers (16Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Bywater R.P. Higgs C. Reynolds C.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 1: 1181-1193Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Evidence for GPCR interaction in cells has been obtained by expressing GPCRs fused to different chromophores. Transfer of energy between the chromophores has been shown for the β2-adrenergic receptor (17Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar) and somatostatin SSTR5 receptor (10Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Patel S.C. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. Science. 2000; 288: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and provides good evidence for the close proximity of the two molecules of GPCRs. Some radioligand binding studies suggest differences in the number of binding sites labeled by different radioligands. At M2muscarinic receptors, the antagonist [3H]QNB labeled twice as many sites as did [3H]AF-DX 384 orN-[3H]methylscopolamine under certain conditions (18Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These data were interpreted in terms of a model where the receptor exists as a tetramer. The D2 dopamine receptor is of interest in this regard. Several studies suggest that the substituted benzamide radioligand [3H]nemonapride can label more D2 receptor sites in radioligand binding studies than the butyrophenone [3H]spiperone (3Ng G.Y.K.

For D2dopamine receptors expressed in recombinant cells, Seeman et al. (21Seeman P. Guan H.-C. Civelli O. van Tol H.H.M. Sunahara R.K. Niznik H.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that [3H]raclopride labeled more D2 dopamine receptor sites than did [3H]spiperone, although Malmberg et al. (23Malmberg A. Jerning E. Mohell N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 303: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were unable to replicate these findings. Interestingly, Hall et al. (24Hall H. Wedel I. Halldin C. Kopp J. Farde L. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that the number of sites labeled by [3H]raclopride in rat striatal membranes was dependent on the conditions used. [3H]Raclopride labeled more sites in the presence of sodium ions than in their absence. The number of sites labeled by [3H]spiperone was, however, unaffected by sodium ions and was similar to the number of sites labeled by [3H]raclopride in the presence of sodium ions. Theodorouet al. (25Theodorou A.E. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Life Sci. 1983; 32: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) found that another substituted benzamide, [3H]sulpiride, also detected more D2 receptor binding sites in rat striatum in the presence of sodium ions than it did in their absence, and similar observations have been made for [3H]raclopride binding to the related D3dopamine receptor expressed in recombinant cells (26Malmberg A. Jackson D.M. Eriksson A. Mohell N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 749-754PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are not consistent with the labeling by these radioligands of single populations of independent D2dopamine receptors. They are more consistent with the labeling of oligomeric arrays with different degrees of cooperativity between the monomeric units, depending on assay conditions (18Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Strange P.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 317-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of the D2 receptor in the actions of the antipsychotic drugs, we have examined this phenomenon in more detail. In this paper, therefore, we have studied the binding of two radioligands ([3H]spiperone and [3H]raclopride) to D2 dopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells and provide evidence for the formation of homodimers for this receptor. [3H]Spiperone (15–30 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [3H]raclopride (60–86 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. S-(−)-Sulpiride, haloperidol, and butaclamol were purchased from RBI (Natick, MA). All other materials were obtained from commercial sources and were of the highest available purity. CHO cells expressing the human D2(short) dopamine receptor (28Gardner B.R. Hall D.A. Strange P.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were grown as monolayers in RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 200 μg/ml active Geneticin, and 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a moist, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA (free acid) 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, with KOH), removed from the flask by gentle shaking with 2-mm diameter glass beads in 5 ml of buffer A, and homogenized with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 260 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A to ∼5–10 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed in buffer A, while 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) was included in the buffer in order to determine the effects of sodium ions or ionic strength. Total and nonspecific binding were defined in the presence of 3 μm (−)-butaclamol and 3 μm (+)-butaclamol, respectively. [3H]raclopride saturation binding experiments were performed in a total volume of 0.5 ml using 3–15 μg of membrane protein per tube and 10 concentrations of [3H]raclopride typically ranging between 20 pm and 10 nm. [3H]Spiperone saturation binding experiments were performed in total volumes of either 1 or 10 ml, both using 10–30 μg of membrane protein/tube and 10 concentrations of the radioligand, typically between 10 pm and 5 nm for 1-ml saturations, or 16 concentrations between 1 pm and 1 nm for 10-ml experiments. In experiments that included raclopride or haloperidol, the range of [3H]spiperone concentrations was varied according to the apparentKd values obtained in initial experiments. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and incubated at 25 °C for 3 h ([3H]raclopride and 1-ml [3H]spiperone experiments) or 7 h (10-ml [3H]spiperone experiments), by which time the radioligands had reached equilibrium. Experiments were terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters using a Brandel cell harvester followed with four washes of 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4). Filter discs were soaked in 2 ml each of Optiphase Hi-Safe 3 (Wallac) for at least 6 h before radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. A range of concentrations of the competing ligand were incubated with 10–30 μg of membranes and a fixed concentration of [3H]spiperone in triplicate for 3 h at 25 °C before harvesting as described above. Total and nonspecific binding were defined in the presence of 3 μm (−)-butaclamol and 3 μm (+)-butaclamol, respectively. Data were analyzed using Prizm (GraphPad, San Diego CA). In saturation experiments, specifically and nonspecifically bound [3H]spiperone were calculated from saturation data using the method of Golds et al. (30Golds P.R. Przylo F.R. Strange P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1980; 68: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which makes a correction for the depletion of the radioligand. Data were fitted to equations describing one- or two-site binding models, and the best fit was determined using an F-test. Competition experiments were fitted to four-parameter logistic equations, and the best fit between a variable Hill coefficient and a Hill coefficient fixed to unity was determined using an F-test. In the analysis of the competition data, the free radioligand concentration was taken as the added minus total bound in the absence of competitor. The amount bound will be in fact be different at the top and bottom of the competition curve. The total bound was, however, ∼12 and ∼1% of the added radioligand in the absence and presence, respectively, of saturating concentrations of competitor ([3H]spiperone, ∼0.25 nm). The total bound radioligand in the absence of competitor was <10% for the higher radioligand concentrations used. The effect of this correction on estimates of Ki is slight (∼5% at 0.25 nm radioligand). The statistical significance of difference between data was determined at the 0.05 level, using ANOVA or Student's t test, as appropriate. Ki and Kd values were first converted to the respective normally distributed negative logarithm (pKi or pKd). Mean values are quoted with the respective S.E. Saturation binding studies were performed on human D2(short) dopamine receptors expressed in membrane preparations from recombinant CHO cells. [3H]raclopride binding in the absence of sodium ions (“control” conditions) revealed a single population of binding sites with a Kd of 1.1 nm and Bmax of 0.84 pmol/mg of membrane protein (Fig. 1 and Table I). In the presence of 100 mm NaCl, the data were also best described by a single population of binding sites in which theKd for [3H]raclopride was decreased significantly to 0.23 nm and Bmaxsignificantly increased to 1.63 pmol/mg. 100 mm NMDG was used as a control for changes in ionic strength, and experiments performed under these conditions gave values for Kdof 1.2 nm and Bmax of 0.89 pmol/mg, which did not differ significantly from the control values (ANOVA,p > 0.05).Table IThe binding of [3 H]spiperone and [3 H]raclopride to D2 dopamine receptorsRadioligandControlNa+NMDGControl (1 ml spiperone)Spiperone (10 ml)pKd10.84 ± 0.11 (7)10.87 ± 0.05 (4)10.76 ± 0.13 (4)10.20 ± 0.04 (52)Kd(nm)0.0150.0130.0170.063Bmax (pmol/mg)1.21 ± 0.11 (3)1.99 ± 0.13 (4)1.61 ± 0.06 (4)1.56 ± 0.15 (3)[Receptor] (pm)3.66.04.846.8RaclopridepKd8.97 ± 0.11 (7)9.63 ± 0.06 (7)8.92 ± 0.09 (6)Kd(nm)1.10.231.2Bmax (pmol/mg)0.84 ± 0.16 (4)1.63 ± 0.27 (4)0.89 ± 0.18 (3)[Receptor] (pm)25.248.926.7The binding of [3H]spiperone and [3H]raclopride to D2(short) dopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Kd and Bmax values were determined for both radioligands, and pKd andBmax values are given as the mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments in parentheses.

[3H]Spiperone saturation assays were performed in a total volume of 10 ml in the presence of 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm NMDG or in the absence of either ion and were also performed in a total volume of 1 ml in the absence of ions. [3H]Raclopride saturation assays were performed in 0.5 ml volumes under the same ionic conditions as [3H]spiperone.Bmax determinations were all performed on the same preparation of membranes in order to allow comparisons, whereasKd values are from different preparations.

Open table in a new tab The binding of [3H]spiperone and [3H]raclopride to D2(short) dopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Kd and Bmax values were determined for both radioligands, and pKd andBmax values are given as the mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments in parentheses.

[3H]Spiperone saturation assays were performed in a total volume of 10 ml in the presence of 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm NMDG or in the absence of either ion and were also performed in a total volume of 1 ml in the absence of ions. [3H]Raclopride saturation assays were performed in 0.5 ml volumes under the same ionic conditions as [3H]spiperone.Bmax determinations were all performed on the same preparation of membranes in order to allow comparisons, whereasKd values are from different preparations. The concentration of receptor binding sites in the assays is given in pm. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]spiperone were performed under two conditions: large volume (10-ml) assays to minimize the extent of ligand depletion and, more routinely, smaller volume (1-ml) assays. In control conditions, in both assay volumes a single population of binding sites was found, with Bmaxvalues of 1.2 pmol/mg and 1.6 pmol/mg for 10-ml and 1-ml volume assays, respectively (Table I). These values are not significantly different (ANOVA, p > 0.05). The dissociation constant of [3H]spiperone, 15 pm, was significantly lower when determined in 10-ml assays, compared with the value, 63 pm, found in 1-ml assays (Table I). In [3H]spiperone saturation assays performed in a 10-ml volume, the Bmax value found in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, 2 pmol/mg, was not significantly different from that found in the presence of 100 mm NMDG, 1.6 pmol/mg (Table I) (ANOVA, p > 0.05). In the absence of monovalent cations (control conditions), theBmax value of [3H]spiperone was 1.2 pmol/mg, which, while significantly less than the value in the presence of sodium ions, was not different from the value in the presence of NMDG (ANOVA). The dissociation constant of [3H]spiperone was unaffected by either sodium ions or NMDG (Table I). Parallel [3H]spiperone saturation binding experiments (1-ml volume) were performed in the absence of sodium ions and in the absence and presence of raclopride (10 μm). In the absence of raclopride, theBmax value for [3H]spiperone was 1.7 ± 0.1 pmol/mg (n = 3). Including 10 μm raclopride in the [3H]spiperone saturation assays increased the apparent Kd value ∼116-fold and significantly reduced the Bmaxto 1.3 ± 0.1 pmol/mg (n = 3) (Fig.2 A). A range of raclopride concentrations was included in 1-ml volume [3H]spiperone saturation binding experiments. Analysis of the data according to the method of Schild gave rise to the plot in Fig. 2 b. The pA2 value for raclopride derived from these data was 7.12, corresponding to 76 nm. The pA2 value predicted from a simple competitive model, using the affinity of [3H]raclopride given in Table I, was 8.97, corresponding to 1.1 nm, a difference of 71-fold from the measured value. Similar experiments were performed, in the absence of sodium ions or NMDG, using haloperidol as the competing ligand. Fig.3 A shows that haloperidol had no significant effect on the Bmax of [3H]spiperone, while the pA2 value of 9.32 (0.48 nm) from the Schild plot (Fig. 3 B) agreed very well with the value predicted by a simple competitive model: pA2 = 9.45 (0.36 nm) (31Hoare S.R.J. Strange P.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1295-1308PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Armstrong and P. G. Strange, unpublished results. In the presence of 100 mm NaCl, no significant effect of raclopride on [3H]spiperone Bmaxwas found (Fig. 4 A). Analysis of the data according to the method of Schild (Fig. 4 B) resulted in a pA2 value for raclopride in the presence of sodium ions of 8.79 (1.6 nm). This is 6.9-fold greater than the value of 9.63 (0.23 nm) predicted by a simple competitive model. Raclopride was competed against different [3H]spiperone concentrations between 0.2 and 4.3 nm in the absence of sodium ions, and representative competition curves are shown in Fig. 5. Raclopride inhibited [3H]spiperone binding to within 5% of the level of nonspecific binding defined in the presence of 3 μm (+)-butaclamol. The data from 14 experiments (at different [3H]spiperone concentrations) were fitted well by a sigmoidal competition curve with a Hill coefficient of unity. The mean Ki of raclopride derived from all of these data was 19.5 nm (7.71 ± 0.06, pKi ± S.E., n = 14). Competition binding experiments with raclopride and 0.25 nm [3H]spiperone were also performed in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, yielding aKi of 0.95 nm (9.02 ± 0.05, pKi ± S.E., n = 3) or in the presence of 100 mm NMDG, resulting in aKi of 11.3 nm (7.95 ± 0.08, pKi ± S.E., n = 3). [3H]spiperone binding was inhibited by raclopride to the level of nonspecific binding under both of these conditions. In this study, we have examined the binding of two ligands (raclopride and spiperone) to human D2(short) dopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells. Saturation and competition experiments have been used to show that the D2 receptor functions as an oligomer and that the properties of this oligomeric receptor may be modulated by the ionic conditions. In saturation binding assays, sodium ions were found to exert allosteric effects on [3H]raclopride binding to recombinant human D2(short) dopamine receptors. The presence of sodium ions was found to increase the affinity of [3H]raclopride for the D2 receptor, and this phenomenon has been described extensively before for drugs of the substituted benzamide class (25Theodorou A.E.

In the present study, the dissociation constant decreased from 1.1 nm approximately 5-fold to 0.23 nm. The effect was specific to sodium ions, since the presence of an equal concentration (100 mm) of NMDG as a control for changes in ionic strength had no appreciable effect on the Kd of [3H]raclopride. Sodium ions also exerted a second effect on [3H]raclopride binding to D2 receptors by changing the number of binding sites that were labeled (Bmax). A 2-fold increase inBmax was found in the presence of sodium ions as compared with the absence of sodium ions. Again, there was no appreciable effect of NMDG compared with the absence of ions. This effect of sodium ions on the number of sites labeled by [3H]raclopride has been noticed before in studies of D2 dopamine receptors in the brain and in recombinant cells (24Hall H. Wedel I. Halldin C. Kopp J. Farde L. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 38Schetz J.A. Chu A. Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar) but not analyzed further. In contrast to [3H]raclopride, the Kdof [3H]spiperone for binding to D2 receptors was unaffected by the presence or absence of sodium ions, in agreement with many other reports (19Niznik H.B.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It should be noted that experimental design can be important in determining the affinity of some high affinity radioligands. Here an assay volume of 1 ml gave a value for the Kd of [3H]spiperone of ∼63 pm. When assays were performed to minimize ligand depletion via binding to receptor and nonspecifically to tissue (i.e. use of a 10-ml total volume, in which there is 10-fold more radioligand present but the same amount of receptor), this experimental protocol provided an estimate of Kd for [3H]spiperone of 15 pm. Even under these conditions, there is some depletion at the lower concentrations of radioligand, but the estimate of Kd agrees well with determinations of Kd for spiperone designed to eliminate depletion artifacts (23Malmberg A. Jerning E. Mohell N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 303: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The effects of such artifacts on determination of Kd values have been discussed in detail elsewhere (23Malmberg A. Jerning E. Mohell N. Eur. J.

The effect of sodium ions on the number of binding sites labeled by [3H]spiperone was less than for [3H]raclopride. Bmax values for [3H]spiperone were similar in the presence of sodium ions, in the presence of NMDG, and in the absence of monovalent cations (in 1-ml assays) and similar to the Bmax seen for [3H]raclopride in the presence of sodium ions. In 10-ml assays in the absence of monovalent cations, some reduction inBmax was seen for [3H]spiperone. These data suggest that the Bmax of [3H]spiperone is less sensitive to monovalent cations than the Bmax of [3H]raclopride, but from the data of Table I it appears that the binding of [3H]spiperone is not completely insensitive to the effects of sodium ions. An important comparison can be made between theBmax values for the two ra"

Platelets contain both APP and Aβ and may contribute to the perivascular amyloid deposition seen in AD. However, no data are available concerning the biochemical mechanism(s) involved in their formation and release by these cells. We found that human platelets released APP and Aβ following activation with collagen or arachidonic acid. Inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX) reduced APP but not Aβ release following those stimuli. In contrast, activation of platelets by thrombin and calcium ionophore caused release of both APP and Aβ in a COX-independent fashion. Ex vivo studies showed that, despite suppression of COX activity, administration of aspirin did not modify Aβ or APP levels in serum or plasma, suggesting that this enzyme plays only a minor role in vivo. We examined the regulation of APP cleavage and release from activated platelets and found that cleavage requires protein kinase C (PKC) activity and is regulated by the intracellular second messengers phosphatidylinositol 2-phosphate and Ca2+. Our data provide the first evidence that in human platelets COX is a minor component of APP secretion whereas PKC plays a major role in the secretory cleavage of APP. By contrast, Aβ release may represent secretion of preformed peptide and is totally independent of both COX and PKC activity.

Aβ is derived from proteolytic cleavage of the 695–770 amino acids of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) (2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Cellular APP metabolism is complex, and amyloidogenic cleavage may occur in at least three cellular organelles (3Wagner S.L. Munoz B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1329-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although a number of cell types produce Aβ from APP, the precise cellular origins of Aβ deposited in the AD brain and cerebral vessels have not been identified. Because neurons secrete substantial amounts of Aβ, intracerebral deposition of Aβ may occur locally (4Turner R.S. Suzuki N. Chyung A.S. Younkin S.G. Lee V.M-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8966-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been postulated that cerebral vascular amyloid deposits may be derived in part from circulating Aβ (5Chen M. Inestrosa N.C. Ross G.S. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 6Urmoneit B. Prikulis I. Wihl G. D'Urso D. Frank R. Heeren J. Beisiegel U. Prior R. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 157-166PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, human platelets contain high levels of membrane-associated and soluble forms of APP, which, upon stimulation with thrombin or calcium ionophore, are cleaved by an α-secretase-like activity. The cleaved APP is readily released by platelets and may contribute to more than 90% of circulating APP (7Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. Science. 1990; 248: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 8Li Q.X. Berndt M.C. Bush A.I. Rumble B. Mackenzie I. Friedhuber A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L.

The normal function of APP in the circulation is not known, however, there is evidence to support a role for APP in the acute phase of inflammation. Indeed, the secreted form of APP inhibits coagulation factor IXa and platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline or ADP in vitro (10Henry A. Li Q.X. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 103: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Platelets may also be a source of Aβ detected in whole blood (5Chen M. Inestrosa N.C. Ross G.S. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that Aβ, like APP, is also released upon platelet stimulation with agonists such as thrombin or collagen (11Li Q.X. Whyte S. Tanner J.E. Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 461-469PubMed Google Scholar, 12Smith C.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 235: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To date, however, the biochemical mechanism(s) involved in Aβ and APP formation and release from human platelets are unknown. Knowledge of these mechanisms could provide a rational basis for developing tools to modulate this phenomenon in AD and other amyloidogenic diseases. Collagen, arachidonic acid, thrombin, calcium ionophore (A23187), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The peptide aldehyde protease inhibitor MG-132 was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Wortmannin, LY294002, and BAPTA were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Calpain inhibitor I (Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) and II (Ac-Leu-Leu-methioninal) were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured enzymatically using a kit from Sigma. [3H]Serotonin (specific activity, 24.7 μCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Platelet factor 4 (PF4) was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Asserachrom-PF4). The Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) Ban50, BA27, and BC05 were generously provided by Dr. N. Suzuki and Tekeda Pharmaceutical. The Aβ mAb 6E10 was purchased from Senetek PLC (St. Louis, MO). Human platelets were isolated as previously described (13Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole venous blood was collected from healthy volunteers (all males, 22–40 years old) without stasis in a syringe containing one part of sodium citrate (3.8%) as anti-coagulant and nine parts of whole blood, using a 19-gauge needle to reduce any possible mechanical activation of cells during collection. The protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee, and a consent form to participate in this study was signed by each individual. Donors were nonsmokers and had not ingested any drug known to affect platelet function for at least 2 weeks prior to the study. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 900 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The platelet-rich plasma supernatant was carefully removed and was used to isolate platelets by stepwise centrifugation as previously described (13Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended in a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) at a final concentration of 3 × 108 platelets/ml unless otherwise specified, as previously described (13Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Four healthy volunteers (mean age 30 ± 8 years, 2 male and 2 females, all non-smokers) who had not taken any medication during the previous 2 weeks were each given 1 g of aspirin. Blood samples were taken prior to and 3 h following aspirin ingestion using the methods described above. For plasma preparation, whole venous blood was anti-coagulated with sodium citrate (3.8% v/v) prior to ultracentrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. For preparation of serum, venous blood was collected without anti-coagulant and incubated in glass tubes at 37 °C for 1 h prior to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min. Serum and plasma were analyzed for thromboxane B2 (TxB2), Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, and APP levels. Platelet aggregation was studied in a light transmission aggregometer (Chrono Log, Haverton, PA) at 37 °C in plastic cuvettes with constant stirring at 1000 rpm, as previously described (13Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Threshold concentrations of various platelet agonists were determined by measuring the lowest concentration of agonist that caused irreversible platelet aggregation with a trace amplitude of 65% to 85% of maximal light transmission. In our experiments, aggregation was induced by using threshold concentrations of collagen (5 μg/ml), arachidonic acid (50 μm), thrombin (1 IU/ml), the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm), or PMA (100 nm). Based on previous published studies, inhibitors were used at the following concentrations: indomethacin (10 μm), GF109203X (5 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), LY294002 (20 μm), BAPTA (200 μm), EGTA (2 mm), calpain inhibitor I (25 μm), calpain inhibitor II (25 μm). Platelet aggregation was continuously measured for 15 min following the addition each agonist. At the end of the incubation time, the reaction was stopped by placing samples in ice. They were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 × g to separate platelet pellet from supernatant. Supernatant samples were assayed for release of dense body [3H]serotonin and α-granule platelet factor 4 (PF4) as previously described (14Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Bonavita M.S. Gazzaniga P.P. Violi F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 364-370PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2 μCi/ml tritiated serotonin, washed twice, and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 μm imipramine to inhibit serotonin re-uptake. Platelets were treated with agonist for 15 min, and 700 μl of the samples was then transferred to a vial containing 70 μl of 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmtheophylline, 500 μm aspirin, and 0.2 μg/ml PGE1. After centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 ×g, 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to a scintillation vial and 2 ml of aqueous scintillation fluid was added. The amount of tritium released was determined by using a scintillation counter and expressed as a percentage of the total amount of tritiated serotonin accumulated by the platelets. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. PF4 release was determined by a standard ELISA kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. PF4concentration is expressed as a percentage of the total amount released from control platelets after their lysis by sonication. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Platelet thrombane (Tx) A2 formation was measured in the supernatant as its hydrolysis product TxB2 by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry assay, as previously described (13Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was measured using an enzymatic assay (14Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Bonavita M.S. Gazzaniga P.P. Violi F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 364-370PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken 15 min after the addition of the agonist, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifuging for 3 min at 12,000 × g. LDH in the supernatants was compared with total LDH released from control platelets after lysis by sonication. Sandwich-ELISA was performed as described previously using mAbs specific for different species of Aβ (15Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos L.J. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). BAN-50 (a monoclonal antibody specific for the first 10 amino acids of Aβ) was used as a capturing antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA-27 (a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ1–40) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC-05 (a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ1–42) were used as reporter antibodies. To calibrate the sensitivity of the ELISA for detecting Aβ, synthetic Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides (Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA) were used to generate standard curves. The BAN-50, BA-27, and BC-05 mAbs were prepared and characterized as described previously (17Suzuki N. Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 452-460PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet-associated APP was measured following lysis of platelet pellets in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA in TBS, pH 8.0). 10 μl of lysate was resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting with 6E10 mAb. Immunoreactivity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis following application of anti-mouse 125I secondary antibody. To measure APP released by platelets, and APP levels in serum and plasma, samples were mixed with sample buffer and loaded directly on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. APP was quantitated by immunoblotting with 6E10 as described above. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Pair-wise comparisons were made using Student's ttest where appropriate. Data are displayed as means ± S.E. Isolated human platelets incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with constant stirring did not show any significant increase in light transmission, indicating no detectable aggregation. Supernatants from these samples had undetectable levels of TxB2, serotonin, and PF4 (TableI) and contained only low levels of APP (Fig. 1 A) and Aβ (Fig.1 D). As expected, lysates of unstimulated platelets contained high levels of APP (Fig. 1 B). Because APP was detected in these lysates using both an APP ectodomain antibody (Fig.1 B) and an APP cytoplasmic-domain antibody (data not shown), the APP contained in platelets lysates must exist in a full-length, uncleaved form. The addition of collagen (5 μg/ml) or arachidonic acid (50 μm) to platelets caused irreversible platelet aggregation (Table I), with significant production of TxB2, and increased release of serotonin and PF4 (Table I), but no change in levels of LDH (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when thrombin (1 IU/ml) or calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm) were used (Table I). Platelets activated by each of these agonists released higher levels of soluble APP (sAPP) than unstimulated platelets (Fig. 1 A). Concomitantly, recovery of intracellular full-length APP was decreased by ∼50% (Fig. 1,B and C). Because these agonists decreased levels of full-length APP inside platelets and increased levels of soluble, cleaved APP in supernatants, platelet activation must result in cleavage and secretion of APP.Table IEffects of collagen, arachidonic acid (AA), thrombin, and A23187 or vehicle on platelet aggregation (light transmission), TxB2formation, serotonin, and platelet factor 4 release in the absence or presence of indomethacin (10 μm) (n = 5 experiments for each agonist)Light transmissionTxB2SerotoninPlatelet factor 4%ng/ml% of totalVehicle4 ± 2ND 1-aND, not detectable.NDNDCollagen (5 μg/ml)81 ± 1021 ± 1.584 ± 1075 ± 10Collagen + indomethacin5 ± 2ND25 ± 6 1-bp < 0.001.60 ± 12AA (50 μm)78 ± 1228 ± 1.285 ± 1180 ± 12AA + indomethacin4 ± 3ND28 ± 8 1-bp < 0.001.58 ± 8 1-bp < 0.001.Thrombin (1 IU/ml)80 ± 920 ± 1.280 ± 1078 ± 12Thrombin + indomethacin74 ± 6ND70 ± 671 ± 5A23187 (1 μm)76 ± 822 ± 281 ± 885 ± 11A23187 + indomethacin82 ± 8ND68 ± 1076 ± 10Results are means ± S.E.M.1-a ND, not detectable.1-b p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Results are means ± S.E.M. Platelet activation also resulted in increased release of Aβ1–40, as detected by sandwich-ELISA (Fig.1 D). Although both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels increased with platelet activation, Aβ1–42 levels were typically 10-fold lower than Aβ1–40 levels. These low levels of Aβ1–42precluded accurate quantitation by sandwich-ELISA and are therefore not reported. To test the correlation between platelet activation, APP, and Aβ release, we treated platelets with 0.1–20 μg/ml collagen and measured platelet aggregation, TxB2 generation, and APP and Aβ release. Increasing doses of collagen resulted in a dose-dependent increase of platelet aggregation (light transmission) and TxB2, Aβ, and APP formation and release (Fig. 2, A–D). To test the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) in the formation and release of Aβ and APP by human platelets, we utilized two different COX inhibitors, indomethacin and aspirin (18Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Dewitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of platelet COX was confirmed by blockade of TxB2 formation and the effects on platelet aggregation and activation. As expected, incubation of platelets with indomethacin inhibited TxB2 formation following stimulation with collagen, arachidonic acid, thrombin, and A23187 (Table I). Indomethacin inhibited also platelet aggregation and activation following platelet treatment with collagen or arachidonic acid. In contrast, it did not reduce platelet aggregation or serotonin or PF4 release following activation by thrombin or A23187(Table I). Similar results were obtained with 100 μmaspirin (not shown). Inhibition of platelet COX activity by indomethacin in collagen- and arachidonic acid-stimulated platelets significantly reduced secretion of APP (Fig. 3 A), which was associated with an increased recovery of full-length APP in the lysates (data not shown), suggesting that COX inhibition prevented APP cleavage and not simply APP release. In contrast, indomethacin did not inhibit release of Aβ (Fig. 3 B). Indomethacin also did not influence Aβ or APP release in thrombin- and A23187-activated platelets (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were obtained with 100 μm aspirin (not shown). These results suggest that human platelets release Aβ in a complete COX-independent manner, whereas depending on the stimulus, they can cleave and release APP in either a COX-dependent or COX-independent manner. Although threshold concentration of collagen induces a COX-dependent platelet aggregation, higher levels of collagen can restore full platelet aggregation even when COX is inhibited (19Violi F. Praticò D. Ghiselli A. Alessandri C. Iuliano L. Cordova C. Balsano F. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 82: 247-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, to further confirm that human platelets can secrete APP independently from COX activity, we asked if higher concentrations of collagen can restore cleavage and release of APP despite inhibition of COX. As predicted, higher concentration of collagen (4-fold threshold concentration) in the presence of 10 μm indomethacin induced a full aggregation response even in the absence of TxB2 generation (Fig.4 A, trace c). In the same samples serotonin release increased by ∼40% while PF4 levels did not change significantly compared with threshold concentration of collagen in the presence of indomethacin (not shown). Similar results were obtained using 100 μmaspirin (not shown). Interestingly, high concentration of collagen, in the presence of indomethacin, fully restored APP release in the supernatant (Fig. 4, B and C), confirming our hypothesis that APP cleavage and secretion can occur also via a COX-independent pathway. At baseline, plasma TxB2 levels were almost undetectable (1.5 ± 0.5 ng/ml), whereas serum levels were high (180 ± 20 ng/ml), consistent with the intense platelet activation during serum formation. Three hours after aspirin intake we found that plasma TxB2 levels were unchanged (1.2 ± 0.4 ng/ml), while serum TxB2 levels were reduced by 95% (10.1 ± 1.8 ng/ml, p < 0.001), suggesting thatex vivo platelet COX activity was effectively suppressed. Aspirin intake did not significantly affect APP levels (data not shown) supporting our previous in vitro observation that APP secretion is largely COX-independent. Similar results were observed for Aβ secretion (not shown). Although APP formation and release from a variety of cell lines is enhanced by protein kinase C (PKC) activation (20Caporaso G.L. Gandy S.E. Buxbaum J.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3055-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), to the best of our knowledge, the involvement of PKC in human platelets has not been examined. To investigate the role of this enzyme we first treated platelets with the PKC-activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). PMA activated platelets irreversibly and caused increased formation of TxB2 (TableII). The addition of the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (5 μm), fully blocked PMA-induced platelet activation (Table II). By contrast, GF109203X did not significantly reduce platelet aggregation and activation induced by collagen (TableII). Platelets activated by PMA released Aβ and APP in the supernatant, addition of GF109203X did not significantly influence the release of Aβ but significantly reduced APP secretion (Fig.5, A and C). Interestingly, even though GF109203X did not affect collagen-induced platelet activation, it prevented APP but not Aβ release in collagen-activated human platelets (Fig. 5, A andC). Similar results were observed when A23187 and thrombin were used as agonists (not shown). Furthermore, platelet preincubation with PMA, which is known to down-regulate PKC activity, and subsequent stimulation with collagen resulted in reduction of APP but not Aβ secretion (not shown). Taken together these results strongly suggest an involvement of PKC activity in APP but not Aβ formation and release from activated human platelets. LDH levels in all the samples incubated with GF109203X were not different from controls (not shown).Table IIEffect of PKC activation and inhibition on platelet aggregation (light transmission), TxB2 formation, serotonin and platelet factor 4 release (n = 4 experiments for each agonist/antagonist)Light transmissionTxB2SerotoninPlatelet factor 4%ng/ml% of total% total activityVehicle5 ± 2ND 2-aND, not detectable.NDNDPMA (100 nm)75 ± 1222 ± 1.185 ± 1085 ± 10PMA + GF (100 nm) (5 μm)12 ± 2 2-bp < 0.05.

GF was always incubated for 2 min before adding the agonist. Open table in a new tab Results are mean ± S.E.M. To elucidate further the molecular mechanisms involved in PKC activation and subsequent cleavage and release of APP and Aβ release from activated platelets, we investigated two intracellular signaling molecules, Ca2+ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We found that the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA inhibited APP secretion following platelet stimulation with A23187 or thrombin (Fig.5 B). Similar results were observed with EGTA (not shown). Furthermore, treatment of platelets with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 was sufficient to inhibit APP secretion following platelet stimulation with A23187 or thrombin (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained when PMA was used to activate platelets (not shown). Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of these two molecules did not inhibit A23187 and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, by contrast it suppressed PMA-induced platelet aggregation (not shown). Taken together these findings suggest that both Ca2+ and PI3K are important intracellular mediators of PKC-dependent APP cleavage and secretion in human platelets. BAPTA and EGTA both inhibited Aβ release from platelets activated with A23187 and thrombin, suggesting that calcium is an important intracellular mediator of Aβ secretion in these cells. In contrast, wortmannin and LY294002 did not inhibit significantly Aβ secretion from platelets activated by A23187 or thrombin (Fig.5 D). Finally, because APP processing (22Chen M. Durr J. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Aβ production (23Zhang L. Song L. Parker E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8966-8972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) can be modulated by the activation of the neutral cysteine proteases calpains, we investigated the effects of two membrane-permeable calpain inhibitors. We found that calpain inhibitors I and II were both effective in reducing APP secretion and Aβ release secondary to thrombin and A23187-induced platelet activation (Fig.6, A and B). No increase in LDH was detected in the supernatant, suggesting that these compounds did not have any toxic effect on platelets. In the present study we demonstrate that human platelets release Aβ and APP upon their activation by several agonists. We found that resting platelets contain high levels of full-length APP, which is cleaved and released into the supernatant following platelet activation. Moreover, we provide novel evidence suggesting that APP release from platelets is only partially regulated by COX activation. In contrast, we found that Aβ secretion by human platelets is totally insensitive to inhibitors of this pathway. Previous reports have shown that, in other cellular systems, arachidonic acid metabolism may play a role in regulating the secretion of APP (24Emmerling M.R. Dudley D.T. Dyer R.D. Carroll R.T. Doyle P.D. Davis R.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Kinouchi T. Ono Y. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and that prostaglandin E2, a product of this pathway, increases expression of APP by astrocytes (26Lee R.K. Knapp S. Wurtman R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 940-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because COX is the key enzyme of the arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets, we investigated its role in platelet Aβ and APP formation by a variety of in vitro and ex vivo experiments. We found that this pathway does not play a crucial role in regulating APP and Aβ release from human platelets. In vitro we observed that inhibition of platelet COX did not affect Aβ and partially reduced APP cleavage and release only when platelets were challenged with agonists that use mainly this metabolic pathway to activate them, such as collagen and arachidonic acid (14Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Bonavita M.S. Gazzaniga P.P. Violi F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 364-370PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, no difference was noted in the presence or absence of indomethacin or aspirin when platelets were challenged with agonists that do not use primarily the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, such as thrombin and calcium ionophore (Fig. 7). This was corroborated by the observation that, even in the presence of indomethacin, very high concentrations of collagen, which are known in this setting to use a COX-independent mechanism to activate platelets, fully restored APP release. Ex vivo we found that serum had higher levels of APP and Aβ than plasma. Our study supports the notion that platelets are a source of both peptides in the circulation (5Chen M. Inestrosa N.C. Ross G.S. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Li Q.X. Berndt M.C. Bush A.I. Rumble B. Mackenzie I. Friedhuber A. Beyreuther K.

However, the pharmacological suppression of platelet COX activity by aspirin, as assessed by the dramatic reduction of serum TxB2, did not interfere with platelet capacity to release APP or Aβ, confirming ourin vitro observations. The inability of COX inhibitors to modulate the formation and release of Aβ and APP by human platelets could have some clinical relevance. Epidemiological studies have suggested that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which mainly block COX activity, may delay the onset or even reduce the incidence of AD (27McGeer P.L. Schulzer M. McGeer E.G. Neurology. 1996; 47: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 28Pasinetti G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that these drugs do not likely exert their effect by altering Aβ- or APP-circulating levels derived from platelets. Rather, these compounds may act downstream of Aβ and APP production. We found that the major species of Aβ released by activated human platelets is Aβ1–40, as determined by immunoreactivity with mAb BA27 (specific for Aβ1–40). This is consistent with the fact that the major component of vascular amyloid is Aβ1–40 (29Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Our finding is in agreement with that of others (11Li Q.X. Whyte S. Tanner J.E. Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 461-469PubMed Google Scholar) who identified this peptide as the main component of Aβ from platelet releasates. The same authors were not able to detect any Aβ1–42 in platelet supernatants, perhaps due to the limit of detection of their methods. Several reports have shown that APP secretion is increased by the activation of PKC (20Caporaso G.L. Gandy S.E. Buxbaum J.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3055-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The majority of these studies to date have been conducted using cultured cells, and no data are available on the involvement of PKC in APP and Aβ formation and release by human platelets. We found that direct activation of PKC by PMA resulted in release of Aβ and APP from human platelets. On the other hand, addition of a PKC inhibitor and down-regulation of PKC activity, both decreased APP but not Aβ release. Although some caution must be taken when interpreting the action of this potentially nonspecific compound, our findings strongly suggest that PKC is involved in APP formation and secretion by human platelets. Parenthetically, we have previously shown that the same concentration of GF109203X used in these experiments is specific to prevent PKC activation and translocation in human platelets (30Praticò D. Pasin M Barry O.P. Ghiselli A. Sabatino G. Iuliano L. FitzGerald G.A. Violi F. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3118-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The effect of PKC inhibition on APP release was further confirmed when collagen was used as platelet agonist, suggesting that APP secretory cleavage induced by a more physiological agonist also requires PKC activity. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that, along with PKC activation, two other intracellular signaling molecules, Ca 2+ and phosphatidylinositol 2-phosphate, are involved in regulating APP secretory cleavage in human platelets. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of both signals coincided with selective inhibition of PMA-induced platelet aggregation and APP secretion, suggesting that these molecules are necessary for PKC activation and APP cleavage and release. This confirms our previous studies in which we have shown that PKC activation in human platelets can be in part modulated by Ca2+ and PI3K activity (31Barry O.P. Kazanietz M.G. Praticò D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7545-7556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We also investigated the effects of two membrane-permeable calpain inhibitors and found that calpain inhibitors I and II were both effective in reducing APP secretion and Aβ release. Although we did not directly examine how calpains function to increase secretion of APP and Aβ, we hypothesized that calpains act downstream of PKC and may be required at a late step of secretion, because they were required for both APP and Aβ release (Fig. 7). This hypothesis will be tested by further experiments, which will examine in detail the role of calpains in APP and Aβ release from human platelets. Because the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family members tumor necrosis factor α cleaving enzyme (TACE) and ADAM 10 have been implicated in the PKC-regulated cleavage and secretion of APP in cultured cells (32Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J. Cerretti D.P. Black R.A. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine if they are also involved in PKC-regulated APP formation in platelets. In contrast with the secretory cleavage of APP by human platelets, we hypothesize that Aβ secretion may represent calcium-dependent release of preformed Aβ rather than increased β- and γ-secretase processing of APP. In support of this hypothesis, we found that two different calcium chelators significantly reduced Aβ release from human platelets, whereas a known inhibitor of γ-secretase (MG132) did not. 2D. M. Skovronsky, V. M.-Y. Lee, and D. Praticò, personal communication. This finding was further supported by the observation that stimulation of α-secretase cleavage of APP (e.g. by PMA treatment) did not result in a corresponding decrease in Aβ production. Indeed, any stimulus of platelets, regardless of its effect on APP processing, increased Aβ secretion. For example, treatment of platelets with PMA in the presence of GF109203X resulted in a reduced platelet aggregation (Table II), but this was still sufficient to stimulate Aβ release. In summary, human platelets release Aβ and APP when activated by a wide range of agonists. This mainly occurs independent of the COX metabolic pathway and involves multiple signal transduction mechanisms that lead to differential regulation of APP and Aβ secretion. Our data suggest that PKC activation is crucially involved in human platelets, along with PI3K activity and Ca2+, in APP cleavage and secretion (Fig. 7). On the other hand, calcium plays an important role also in the release of Aβ. Finally, activation of cysteine proteases calpains I and II seems to have a relevant function in both events. Interestingly, regulatory kinases, such as PKC, can be modulated by these proteases during platelet activation (34Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Sparatore B. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 706-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, future studies investigating this modulation and interaction are warranted. Because abnormal secretion of Aβ and APP may contribute to the accumulation of amyloid peripherally in amyloidogenic diseases and in the amyloid angiopathy that occurs in AD, platelets could be a valuable tool for further exploration of these mechanisms.

We investigated regulation of phospholipase A2(PLA2) by the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that express either the wild-type receptor or a nonfunctional mutant (R796W) CaR. The PLA2activity was attributable to cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2) based on its inhibition by arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone, lack of inhibition by bromoenol lactone, and enhancement of the CaR-stimulated phospholipase activity by coexpression of a cDNA encoding the 85-kDa human cPLA2. No CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity was found in the cells that expressed the mutant CaR. Pertussis toxin treatment had a minimal effect on CaR-stimulated arachidonic acid release and the CaR-stimulated rise in intracellular Ca2+(Ca2+i), whereas inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 completely inhibited CaR-stimulated PLC and cPLA2 activities. CaR-stimulated PLC activity was inhibited by expression of RGS4, an RGS (Regulator of Gprotein Signaling) protein that inhibits Gαqactivity. CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity was inhibited 80% by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ and depletion of intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA and inhibited 90% by treatment with W7, a calmodulin inhibitor, or with KN-93, an inhibitor of Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Chemical inhibitors of the ERK activator, MEK, and a dominant negative MEK, MEKK97R, had no effect on CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity but inhibited CaR-stimulated ERK activity. These results demonstrate that the CaR activates cPLA2 via a Gαq, PLC, Ca2+-CaM, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-dependent pathway that is independent the ERK pathway.

These results demonstrate that the CaR activates cPLA2 via a Gαq, PLC, Ca2+-CaM, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-dependent pathway that is independent the ERK pathway. The extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR)1 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed in the parathyroid and kidney and senses extracellular Ca2+ in the millimolar range. This receptor acts through at least two G proteins, Gαi and Gαq, to regulate multiple intracellular enzymes that control production of second messengers including cAMP, inositol trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i), and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites (1Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1999; 39: 175-189Google Scholar). In the parathyroid, the CaR inhibits parathyroid hormone production and secretion in response to elevated extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) levels, and in the kidney, activation of the CaR inhibits NaK2Cl cotransporter activity, Ca2+ reabsorption, and the action of vasopressin leading to a Na+, Cl−, Ca2+, and H2O diuresis. CaR-stimulated production of AA metabolites, possibly products of 12- and 15-lipoxygenase, contributes to inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion in parathyroid cells (2Kifor O. Diaz R.

In cells from the thick ascending limb of Henle, activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) by the CaR results in the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a cytochrome P450 metabolite, that inhibits the apical 70-picosiemens potassium channel activity that would reduce NaK2Cl transporter activity (5Wang W.-H. Lu M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol... 1996; 271: C103-C111Google Scholar). In these tissues and others including the brain, pancreas, stomach, colon, and skin, the CaR may also sense Ca2+ extrusion by adjacent cells and function in cell-cell communication (6Thomas A.P. Nat.

Phospholipase A2, the rate-limiting enzyme in AA metabolism, hydrolyzes cellular phospholipids to form lysophospholipids that lead to the production of platelet-activating factor and liberation of polyunsaturated fatty acids including AA that are the precursors for prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and a variety of other metabolites (eicosanoids) (1Balsinde J.

Eight different groups of PLA2 enzymes have been described. The majority of these enzymes are extracellular and not hormonally regulated, whereas two groups, group IV and group VI, are intracellular and are subject to regulation by extracellular signals. The hormone-regulated enzymes are the 85-kDa Ca2+-sensitive cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2, a group IV enzyme) and the 80–88-kDa Ca2+-insensitive PLA2 (iPLA2, a group VI enzyme). Both enzymes are subject to activation by G protein-dependent signaling systems (10Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30879-30885Google Scholar, 11Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 16069-16072Google Scholar). cPLA2 is expressed in most tissues and is activated by many G protein-coupled receptors including those for angiotensin II, ATP, bradykinin, endothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin (1Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1999; 39: 175-189Google Scholar). The AA products of cPLA2 appear to be involved primarily in signaling functions. cPLA2 activity is inhibited by the substrate analogue arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) but not bromoenol lactone (BEL) (12Ackerman E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 445-450Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of activation of cPLA2 is variable and depends on the receptor. Activation of cPLA2 requires a rise in Ca2+i which leads to translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. In different cell types, pathways that involve pertussis toxin-sensitive or -insensitive G proteins, phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), MAP kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK), calmodulin (CaM), and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) have been described (13Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30149-30157Google Scholar). cPLA2 is a substrate for ERKs in many cell types, and phosphorylation of cPLA2 by ERK appears to be required for activation of the enzyme (14Lin L.-L. Wartman M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell.. 1993; 72: 269-278Google Scholar). iPLA2 also appears to be ubiquitously expressed and is activated by receptors for ATP, α2 agonists, vasopressin, and Fas (15Pages C. Rey A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blanche S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 265: 572-576Google Scholar, 16Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turck J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

The proposed functions of iPLA2 include cellular lipid remodeling, generation of substrates for leukotriene biosynthesis, and generation of second messengers that regulate ion channel activity (11Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 16069-16072Google Scholar, 18Ma Z. Wang X. Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 9607-9616Google Scholar). iPLA2 activity is inhibited by both AACOCF3 and BEL (12Ackerman E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 445-450Google Scholar). iPLA2 is activated by Ca2+ store depletion and PKC and is inactivated by association with calmodulin (16Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turck J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 1522-1526Google Scholar). The form of PLA2 that is activated by the CaR and the mechanism by which the CaR stimulates PLA2 activity have not been defined in any cell type. To determine which PLA2, cPLA2 or iPLA2, is activated by the CaR and which G protein, second messenger, and kinase pathway(s) are involved, we expressed the CaR in HEK-293 cells and defined the early components of the signaling pathway that lead to activation of PLA2. We find that the CaR activates cPLA2 via a Gαq, PLC, Ca2+i, CaM, and CaMK-dependent but ERK-independent signaling pathway.

Bai in the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. To add the HA epitope tag to the C termini of CaR, we synthesized a 57-bp oligonucleotide coding for the last 6 amino acids of CaR followed by 9 amino acids of the HA epitope, a stop codon, anXbaI restriction site, and a 3-bp tail (5′ CGC TCT AGA CTA AGC GTA GTC TGG GAC GTC GTA TGG GTA TGA ATT CAC TAC GTT TTC 3′). The cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using an oligonucleotide that is 5′ to a unique BamHI site in the C-terminal region of receptor (5′ ACC TTT ACC TGT CCC CTG AA 3′) and the 57-bp oligonucleotide coding for C terminus of receptor and the HA epitope. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested withBamHI and XbaI, purified, and ligated into the expression vector (pcDNA3) that contained the remainder of the cDNA for the CaR. The human cPLA2 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Harry Nick, University of Florida, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (19Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L.

The HEK-293 cells that stably express RGS4 were described previously (20Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 6159-6163Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The cDNAs, pcDNA3, CaR-HApcDNA3, or CaR(R796W)-HApcDNA3 and cPLA2-pcDNA3 were introduced into cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Studies using transiently transfected cells were performed 48 h after transfection. In these transfections, the total amount of DNA transfected was held constant by addition of pBluescript so that the total amount used was 3 μg. For stable expression of cDNAs, the cells from each individual well were plated in 100- or 150-mm dishes or 96-well plates and cultured in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 24 h after transfection. G418-resistant clones were isolated after 3–4 weeks and screened by immunoblotting for the expressed protein. Cells were used for experiments between passages 5 and 15. Similar results were obtained with multiple clones. To verify expression of proteins, membranes were immunoblotted with the anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (CaR), the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Myc-RGS4) (both antisera were from the UF hybridoma core), and anti-human cPLA2 (Santa Cruz BioTechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and to measure ERK activity, anti-phospho-ERK (Promega, Madison, WI) and anti-ERK (Promega). HEK-293 cell membranes were prepared by homogenization in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors and brought to a final concentration of 30 mm NaCl and 2 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 250 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 10 min; the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, and the protein concentration was measured. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting. The immunoreaction signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were released from dishes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm EDTA and rinsed twice with calcium measurement solution (CaMS) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 2 mg/ml glucose. The cells were resuspended and incubated in 2 ml of uptake medium containing 2.5 μm Fura-2-AM in CaMS for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with CaMS, and diluted to a concentration of ∼106 cells in 2 ml of CaMS. Ca2+i was measured fluorometrically in Fura-2-loaded cells in suspension by a dual excitation microfluorometer (SLM Fluoromax) at 37 °C with constant stirring. Excitation was at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was at 510 nm. Experiments were started when a steady fluorescent base line was obtained. Each tracing was calibrated by lysing the cells with digitonin (75 μg/ml) in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+o to determineFmax, and then 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.6) was added to obtain Fmin. The Ca2+i concentration was calculated from the expression [Ca2+]i =Kd{(F −Fmin)/(Fmax −F)} where Kd = 224 nm (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). The HEK-293 cells were grown in collagen-coated 24-well plates and were prelabeled with 0.1 μCi/well [3H]AA in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 6 h. After removal of the labeling medium, the cells were rinsed with 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and incubated with buffer A containing 2 mg/ml BSA for 30 min in the presence or absence of inhibitor. In the PKC down-regulation experiments, cells were incubated with or without 100 nm PMA for 20–24 h and prelabeled with [3H]AA for the 6 h preceding the experiment. For pertussis toxin treatment, cells were pretreated with or without 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 12–15 h and labeled with [3H]AA during the last 6 h. After equilibration, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.5 ml of the same buffer in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2or 0.5 mm neomycin. LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated [3H]AA release was measured in RAW 264.7 cells in a similar manner except that the cells were grown and labeled in DMEM (high glucose) with 10% FCS in 24-well trays without collagen coating. The BEL (10 μm) was added 15 min before the LPS in buffer A without BSA, and the cells were exposed to LPS (5 μg/ml) for 1 h with BSA present (22Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem... 1998; 253: 357-370Google Scholar). Equal volumes of medium were removed from the wells and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The radioactivity in the cell-free medium was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry and normalized for total radioactivity incorporated into cellular phospholipids that were solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH, 0.2% SDS. [3H]AA release was linear for 60 min. Cells at 65% confluence in 12-well plates were prelabeled with 5–10 μCi/mlmyo-[3H] inositol in 0.5 ml of inositol-free DMEM containing 10% calf serum for 48–50 h. For pertussis toxin treatment, cells were incubated with pertussis toxin 100 ng/ml or vehicle for the last 12–15 h of the prelabeling period. Before experiments, cells were equilibrated for 30 min in inositol-free DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 20 mm LiCl with or without 10 μmU73122. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 0.4 ml of equilibration medium with or without 5 mm CaCl2. The reactions were terminated by adding 0.4 ml of 10% perchloric acid to each well, and the plates were stored at 4 °C for 3–5 h. The samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, neutralized by the addition of 0.32 ml of a solution containing 2 m KOH, 1 mm EDTA, and 1m Hepes (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants were applied to AG1-X8 anion exchange columns, and tritiated inositol-containing compounds were separated as described (20Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 6159-6163Google Scholar). Concentration-response relationships (EC50 and Hill coefficient values) were determined using GraphPad prism software, and significance was calculated using the Instat two-tailed, unpaired t test statistics program. To study regulation of PLA2 by the CaR, we expressed an HA-tagged wild-type and an HA-tagged nonfunctional mutant receptor (R796W) in HEK-293 cells (23Handlogten M.E. Shiraishi N. Awata H. Huang C. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol... 2000; 279: F1083-F1091Google Scholar). The expressed proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (Fig.1). Blots with both the transiently and stably transfected cells revealed bands of the appropriate molecular mass, ∼125 and 140 kDa, and demonstrated similar levels of CaR protein expression. The two bands of the CaR result from differential glycosylation (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M.

Bands were not present in membranes from the G418-resistant cells. Extracellular Ca2+ and neomycin, both ligands for the CaR, stimulated [3H]AA release from cells that express the CaR in a dose-dependent manner but not from cells that express the nonfunctional mutant CaR R796W (Fig. 2). The EC50 for Ca2+ was 4.2 mm, and the EC50 for neomycin was 0.15 mm. To determine which form of PLA2, cPLA2 or iPLA2, is activated by the CaR, we treated cells with AACOCF3, an inhibitor of both enzymes, and BEL, a specific inhibitor of iPLA2 (1Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1999; 39: 175-189Google Scholar, 12Ackerman E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 445-450Google Scholar). The CaR was activated with neomycin to avoid a possible increase in Ca2+ entry as a result in increased extracellular calcium. As shown in Fig.3 A, AACOCF3inhibited the CaR-stimulated [3H]AA release (IC50 25 μm), but BEL had no effect up to a concentration of 10 μm, a concentration that inhibits iPLA2 in other systems (26Gross R.W. Rudolph A.E. Wang J. Sommers C.D. Wolf M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 14855-14858Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, 10 μm BEL inhibited LPS-stimulated [3H]AA release in RAW 264.7 cells, an iPLA2-dependent response, by 92% (26Gross R.W. Rudolph A.E. Wang J. Sommers C.D. Wolf M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 14855-14858Google Scholar). To confirm that the CaR activates cPLA2, we transiently coexpressed cDNAs coding for the CaR and cPLA2, and we measured [3H]AA release (19Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell.. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that coexpression of increasing amounts of the cPLA2 cDNA with the CaR resulted in increased CaR-stimulated [3H]AA release without an increase in basal [3H]AA release. Inhibitor studies and increasing CaR-stimulated PLA2 activity with increasing levels of expression of cPLA2 demonstrate that the CaR activates cPLA2.Figure 3Identification of cPLA2 as the CaR-stimulated PLA2 activity using chemical phospholipase inhibitors (A) and expression of cPLA2 (B). A, cells that stably express the CaR were pretreated with AACOCF3 (0–200 μm) for 20 min or BEL (0–10 μm) for 15 min and stimulated with 0.5 mm neomycin for 15 min. [3H]AA release was measured and is expressed as percent of maximum neomycin-stimulated activity. B, HEK-293 cells were transiently cotransfected with cDNAs coding for the CaR and vector (pcDNA3) or increasing amounts of cDNA coding for human cPLA2. The cells were labeled with [3H]AA, and CaR-stimulated PLA2 activity was measured as described. Results are expressed as percentage of [3H]AA released normalized for the amount released in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+. Equal amounts of extracts of cells transfected with different amounts of cDNA coding for cPLA2 were immunoblotted with an antibody to cPLA2, and a representative blot is shown belowthe bar diagram in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tested the role of PLC-β in activation of cPLA2 by first demonstrating inhibition of CaR-stimulated [3H]AA release by U73122, an inhibitor of PLC-β. Pretreatment of cells that express the CaR with U73122eliminated the CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity demonstrating that the CaR activates cPLA2 via PLC-β (Fig.4 A). To confirm that U73122inhibits PLC-β activity, we measured CaR-stimulated IP3production with and without U73122 (Fig. 4 B), and we found that it was completely inhibited by U73122. PLC-β can be activated by pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gαi-dependent) or pertussis toxin-insensitive (presumably Gαq-dependent) signaling systems. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin had a minimal inhibitory effect on [3H]AA release (Fig. 4 A), and IP3production (Fig. 4 B) indicating that G proteins of the αi family have a minimal role in stimulation of cPLA2 and PLC-β by the CaR. To test specifically for a role for a Gαq family member in the activation of PLC-β and consequently cPLA2, we transiently expressed the CaR in HEK-293 cells that stably express RGS4, an RGS protein that interacts preferentially with members of the Gαq family, accelerates their GTPase activity, and reduces their activation (20Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 6159-6163Google Scholar,27Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 428-432Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows that RGS4 eliminated CaR-stimulated PLC-β activity. These results indicate that the CaR acts through a pertussis toxin-insensitive, Gαq-dependent pathway to activate PLC, the products of which stimulate cPLA2. PLC-β produces both DAG, which activates PKC, and IP3, which raises Ca2+i, by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. A rise in Ca2+i could activate cPLA2 by mechanisms involving calmodulin, Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinases, PKC in cooperation with DAG, or the ERK pathway. To document and characterize the CaR-stimulated rise in Ca2+i in the cells that express the CaR, we measured Ca2+i in cells that express the wild-type and mutant CaR (CaRR796W) using Fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 5). In the cells that express the wild-type CaR, activation of the CaR with 4 mm extracellular Ca2+(Ca2+o) leads to a rapid rise in Ca2+i followed by a slow fall to a plateau level above base line. This type of Ca2+ signal has two components, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Subsequent stimulation of purinergic receptors in these cells with ATP (100 μm) also leads to a rapid rise in Ca2+i and a plateau phase. Cells that express the CaR R796W do not respond to 4 mm extracellular Ca2+ but do respond to ATP. Fig. 5 B shows that the effect of pertussis toxin on the CaR-stimulated Ca2+i signal, like its effect on cPLA2and PLC activity, is minimal. Incubation of the cells with EGTA to chelate Ca2+o and deplete Ca2+i(Fig. 5 C) reduced CaR-stimulated [3H]AA release by ∼80% when the CaR was activated with neomycin, indicating that Ca2+o and a rise in Ca2+iare required for activation of cPLA2 by the CaR (28Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol... 1998; 53: 221-227Google Scholar). In studies similar to those shown in Fig. 5, A andB, preincubation of cells with 2 mm EGTA for 20 min in nominally Ca2+-free medium prevented bradykinin and ATP-stimulated rises in Ca2+i (data not shown). Many receptors act through the ERK pathway to activate cPLA2 (14Lin L.-L. Wartman M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell.. 1993; 72: 269-278Google Scholar). We assessed the role of ERK in the activation of cPLA2 using chemical inhibitors of MEK, the activator of the ERKs, and a dominant negative form of MEK (MEKK97R). Preincubation of the cells with either PD98059 or U0126 had no effect on the ability of the CaR to activate cPLA2 (Fig. 6 A) but inhibited activation of the ERKs by the CaR (Fig. 6 B). Treatment of the cells with the inactive U0126 analogue, U0124, did not affect cPLA2 or ERK activation. Similarly, coexpression of the CaR with the dominant negative MEK, MEKK97R, and HA-tagged ERK-1 did not inhibit activation of cPLA2 (Fig.6 C) but resulted in inhibition of ERK activation by the CaR (Fig. 6 D). These results indicate that activation of the ERK pathway and presumably phosphorylation of cPLA2 by p42/44 ERK is not required for activation of cPLA2 by the CaR. The PLC product, DAG, activates PKC in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To test for a role of the conventional forms of PKC (those that are both DAG- and Ca2+-dependent), we treated cells with calphostin, a PKC inhibitor, and down-regulated PKC by overnight treatment of the cells with 100 nm PMA and then measured CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity. As shown in Fig.7, both calphostin and down-regulation of PKC with PMA pretreatment reduced CaR-stimulated cPLA2activity by ∼50% but did not eliminate it. In control experiments, 15 min of exposure of the HEK-293 cells that express the wild-type and mutant forms of the CaR to 100 nm PMA stimulated [3H]AA release to a similar degree as treatment of the cells that express the wild-type CaR with 5.0 mmCa2+. However, pretreatment of the cells overnight with 100 nm PMA prevented significant stimulation of [3H]AA release by 15 min of exposure to 100 nm PMA, demonstrating that our protocol for down-regulation of PMA inhibits activation of the conventional forms of PKC. These results indicate that the conventional PKC isoforms (DAG- and Ca2+-dependent) contribute to activation of cPLA2 but that PKC-dependent mechanisms cannot account for the majority of its activation by the CaR. Another mechanism by which a rise in Ca2+i could activate cPLA2 is via calmodulin (13Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30149-30157Google Scholar). To test for a role for calmodulin in CaR-dependent activation of cPLA2, we pretreated cells with W7, a calmodulin antagonist that competitively inhibits interaction of Ca2+-calmodulin with its target proteins. Pretreatment of the cells with W-7 for 45 min before activation of the CaR eliminated ∼90% of the CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity (IC50 7 μm), indicating that activation of calmodulin is an essential step in activation of cPLA2 by the CaR (Fig.8 A). The effects of calmodulin could be mediated by Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), or other proteins. To test for a role for CaMK, we pretreated cells with KN-93, a specific inhibitor of the CaMK enzymes at the concentrations used (29Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol... 2000; 14: 4-13Google Scholar, 30Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1991; 181: 968-975Google Scholar). We found that over a concentration range up to 25 μm, KN-93 inhibited ∼90% of the CaR-stimulated cPLA2 activity with an IC50 of ∼6.3 μm (Fig. 8 B). These results demonstrate that in contrast to other G protein-coupled receptors, the CaR stimulates cPLA2 via a CaM/CaMK-dependent pathway that is independent of the ERK pathway. Although different G protein-coupled receptors may act by similar mechanisms such as activation of PLC, raising Ca2+i, and activation of PKC, each receptor has unique properties that include its location in the cell, its cycling and processing by the cell, and the set of proteins with which it interacts.

In order to elucidate the effect of HCV core protein on the NF-κB signaling in HeLa and HepG2 cells, a reporter assay was utilized. HCV core protein significantly activated NF-κB signaling in a dose-dependent manner not only in HeLa and HepG2 cells transiently transfected with core protein expression plasmid, but also in HeLa cells induced to express core protein under the control of doxycycline. HCV core protein increased the DNA binding affinity of NF-κB in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Acetyl salicylic acid, an IKK%-specific inhibitor, and dominant negative form of IKK% significantly blocked NF-κB activation by HCV core protein, suggesting HCV core protein activates the NF-κB pathway mainly through IKK%. Moreover, the dominant negative forms of TRAF2/6 significantly blocked activation of the pathway by HCV core protein, suggesting HCV core protein mimics proinflammatory cytokine activation of the NF-κB pathway through TRAF2/6. In fact, HCV core protein activated interleukin-1% promoter mainly through NF-κB pathway. Therefore, this function of HCV core protein may play an important role in the inflammatory reaction induced by this hepatotropic virus.

Its genome consists of a linear, positive-strand RNA molecule of ∼9,500 nucleotides (nt) encoding a single polyprotein precursor of ∼3,000 amino acids (aa) that is processed into three to four structural proteins at the amino terminus (Core, E1, and E2/p7) and six nonstructural proteins at the carboxyl terminus (nonstructural proteins 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b) (2Hijikata M.

The core protein, relatively conserved among all identified HCV isolates (4Bukh J. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, previous studies suggested that HCV core protein has various biological properties, one of which is its effect on the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (5Shrivastava A. Manna S.K. Ray R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9722-9728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zhu N. Khoshnan A. Schneider R. Matsumoto M. Dennert G. Ware C. Lai M.M.C. J.

NF-κB belongs to a highly conserved Rel-related protein family, which includes RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p105/p50), and NF-κB2 (p100/p52). Of these, the p50/p65 heterodimer, commonly referred to as NF-κB, is the most abundant and ubiquitous. One of the most intensively studied signals to the NF-κB is induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine associated with inflammation, immune response, and apoptosis. Currently, this signal transduction pathway is understood as follows (10Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar, 11Hsu H. Xiong J.

Subsequently NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) are activated. Activated NIK and/or MEKK1 phosphorylate and activate both IκB kinase (IKK) α and IKK%. Activated IKKα/% phosphorylate IκBα, which associates with and sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylated IκBα is ubiquitinated and degraded, and then NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and binds to DNA to initiate the transcription of various genes associated with inflammation, the immune response, cell growth, and survival. There have, however, been conflicting reports up until now about the effect of HCV core protein on this NF-κB pathway. Recently, it was shown that HCV core protein activated the NF-κB pathway (7Marusawa H. Hijikata M. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8You L.R.

Manna S.K. Ray R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9722-9728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zhu N. Khoshnan A. Schneider R. Matsumoto M. Dennert G. Ware C. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3679-3691Google Scholar). At present, the mechanism for core protein's effect on the NF-κB pathway remains unclear; therefore, we focused our attention on the effect HCV core protein has on the NF-κB pathway and tried to determine how core protein affects NF-κB signaling. Human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), human hepatoma cells (HepG2), and monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan). HeLa Tet-Off cells, which constitutively express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator, were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Type 1b HCV core region (nt 1–575 and aa 1–191 of the prototype HCV type 1b, HCV-J; Ref. 16Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa N. Ohkoshi S. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described (17Kato N. Yokosuka O. Omata M. Hosoda K. Ohto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1764-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using the following primers having an XhoI restriction site (underlined) (the nucleotide positions in HCV-J are shown in parentheses): F1 (a sense primer, nt 1–20), 5′-CCGCTCGAGACCATGAGCACGAATCCTAAACC-3′, and R573 (an antisense primer, nt 555–573), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAAGCGGAAGCTGGGATGGTC-3′. The amplified product was digested with XhoI and then cloned into theXhoI site of pCXN2 (kindly provided by J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), a mammalian expression vector having a %-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer (18Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4562) Google Scholar), to generate pCXN2-core. In addition to the plasmid expressing full-length core protein (aa 1–191), we constructed three more plasmids expressing deletion mutant forms of HCV core protein, aa 1–173 (pCXN2-core173), aa 1–151 (pCXN2-HAcore151), and aa 92–191 (pCXN2-HAcore92–191). The core fragments were amplified by PCR using pCXN2-core as a template and then cloned into pCXN2 or pCXN2-HA for the expression of hemagglutinin (HA; YPYDVPDYA)-tagged core protein. For construction of pCXN2-core173, the region of HCV core aa 1–173 was amplified with primers F1 and R519 (an antisense primer, nt 501–519), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAAGCGGAAGCTGGGATGGTC-3′, and then cloned into pCXN2. For construction of pCXN2-HAcore151, the region of HCV core aa 1–151 was amplified with F1 and R453 (an antisense primer, nt 438–453), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACAGGGCCCTGGCAGCG-3′, and then cloned into pCXN2-HA. Similarly, pCXN2-HAcore92–191, which encodes N-terminal 91-aa deleted core protein, was constructed by using F276 (a sense primer, nt 276–292), 5′-CCGCTCGAGACCATGGGGTGGGCAGGATGGCT-3′, and R573. To generate a tetracycline-regulated HCV core expression plasmid (pTRE2-core), full-length HCV core cDNA was prepared by digesting pCXN2-core with XhoI and then subcloned into theSalI site of pTRE2 (CLONTECH). This construct allowed for the expression of HCV core protein under the transcriptional control of a tetracycline-controlled transactivator-dependent promoter. A series of core expression plasmids were sequenced using a cycle DNA sequencing system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as described previously (19Togo G. Toda N. Kanai F. Kato N. Shiratori Y. Kishi K. Imazeki F. Makuuchi M. Omata M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5620-5623PubMed Google Scholar), to confirm the integration of core genes. Expression of core proteins was examined by the ECL-plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), using extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with core expression plasmids and mouse anti-HCV core antigen IgG fraction (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) or anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To examine the effect of HCV core protein on the NF-κB pathway, NF-κB-inducible reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-Luc) containing the Photinus pyralis(firefly) luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) plus five repeats of κB cis-enhancer element (TGGGGACTTTCCGC) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was utilized. pFC-MEKK (Stratagene), which expresses constitutively active MEKK1 (amino acids 360–672) driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as a positive control plasmid to activate the NF-κB pathway. pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), a control plasmid that expresses Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, was used to monitor the efficiency of transfection. To elucidate the mechanism of how core protein affects the NF-κB pathway, the expression vectors for catalytically inactive IKKα (pIKKα(K44A)), containing an alanine substitution of a conserved lysine residue in its kinase domain (13Regnier C.H.

In addition, the expression vectors for the dominant negative form of TRAF2 (pTRAF2-(87–501)), lacking the RING finger motif (21Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), and TRAF6 (pTRAF6-(289–522)), lacking either the entire zinc-binding region or zinc fingers 3–5 (22Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Goeddel DV and utilized. Moreover, pCMV-TAK1 (K63W) (kindly provided by K. Matsumoto, University of Tokyo, Tokya, Japan), which expresses catalytically inactive TAK1, was utilized with pCMV-TAB1 (kindly provided by K.

In addition to the reporter plasmid having synthetic κB cis enhancer element, luciferase reporter plasmids having IL-1% or TNFα promoter containing NF-κB binding sites, were constructed. A fragment of 691 base pairs (positions −585 to +106) of the TNFα gene was amplified by PCR using a primer set of 5′-ggggtaccgcttgtcctgctacccc-3′ and 5′-cccaagcttgtcaggggatgtggcgt-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with KpnI andHindIII, and then cloned into pGL3 basic vector (Promega) (pTNFα-Luc). Similarly, a fragment of 1125 base pairs (−1110 to +15) of IL-1% gene was amplified by PCR using primer set of 5′-ggggtacccctgtagtcccagctg-3′ and 5′-ctagctagctcgaagaggtttggtatct-3′. Those fragments were digested with KpnI and NheI, and then cloned into pGL3 basic vector (pIL-1%-Luc). All cloned plasmids were purified using the Endfree plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nucleotide sequencing of constructed plasmids was performed using an autosequencer (PE Applied Biosystems) and the dye termination method as described previously (19Togo G. Toda N. Kanai F. Kato N. Shiratori Y. Kishi K. Imazeki F. Makuuchi M. Omata M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5620-5623PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm gene expression. HeLa cells induced to express HCV core protein were generated with use of a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system (Tet-Off gene expression system, CLONTECH). HeLa Tet-Off cells were cotransfected with pTRE2-core and pTK-Hyg (CLONTECH), a selection vector that confers hygromycin resistance, followed by selection in culture medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin (CLONTECH) and 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma). Hygromycin-resistant clones, termed HeTOC, were examined for expression of the core protein upon withdrawal of doxycycline by Western blotting using mouse anti-HCV core antigen IgG fraction, as described previously. Positive clones were expanded and rescreened by Western blotting of cells grown in the presence and absence of doxycycline. We used the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) for all transfection experiments. Approximately 4 × 105 HeLa cells were plated into the well of a six-well tissue culture plate (Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan) 24 h before transfection. To examine the effect of HCV core protein on the NF-κB pathway, HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 0.4 μg of plasmids consisting of 0.19 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, 0.01 μg of pRL-TK, and 0.2 μg of pCXN2 or pCXN2-core. As a positive control, pFC-MEKK was added to the transfection complexes containing pCXN2, or human TNFα (Strathmann Biotech GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) was added to the medium of transfected HeLa cells at a concentration of 20 ng/ml 6 h before harvest. The effect of HCV core protein on the NF-κB pathway in HeLa cells was examined using HepG2 cells with the same protocol as that used for HeLa cells. To examine the dose-dependent effect of core protein on the NF-κB pathway, HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1.2 μg of plasmids consisting of 0.38 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, 0.02 μg of pRL-TK, 0–0.8 μg of pCXN2-core, and 0–0.8 μg of pCXN2 adjusted to total 1.2 μg. In addition to the HeLa cells, which express core protein transiently, HeTOC cells, which can be induced to express core protein under the control of doxycycline, were used to examine the effect of HCV core protein on the NF-κB pathway. Approximately 4 × 105HeTOC cells were plated into the well of a six-well tissue culture plate containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.39 μg of pNF-κB-Luc and 0.01 μg of pRL-TK and cultured in medium with or without doxycycline. To elucidate how HCV core protein affects the NF-κB pathway, dominant negative forms of IKKα/%, TRAF2/6, and TAK1, and an IKK%-specific inhibitor were used. To initially examine the effect of the dominant negative form of components of the NF-κB pathway, HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1.2 μg of plasmids consisting of 0.38 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, 0.02 μg of pRL-TK, 0.4 μg of pCXN2-core, and 0.4 μg of one of the following pIKKα(K44A), pIKK%(K44A), pTRAF2-(87–501), or pTRAF6-(289–522). Similarly, HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1.6 μg of plasmids consisting of 0.38 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, 0.02 μg of pRL-TK, 0.4 μg of pCXN2-core, 0.4 μg of pCMV-TAK1(K63W), and 0.4 μg of pCMV-TAB1. Second, we added 5 mm acetyl salicylic acid (Sigma), which inhibits cyclooxygenase (24Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and IKK% (25Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar), to the medium of HeLa cells transfected with 0.19 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, 0.01 μg of pRL-TK, and 0.2 μg of pCXN2 or pCXN2-core. Acetyl salicylic acid was added 1 h after the transfection of plasmids. Instead of acetyl salicylic acid, 25 μm indomethacin (Sigma), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which inhibits cyclooxygenase but not IKK% (24Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 25Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar), was added to the medium as a control. The entire cell lysate was collected 36 h after transfection. A luciferase assay was performed with the PikkaGene dual sea pansy system (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) using a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Assays were conducted at least in triplicate. Firefly luciferase activity and sea pansy luciferase activity were measured as a relative light unit. Firefly luciferase activity was then normalized for transfection efficiency based on sea pansy luciferase activity. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described (26Ide Y. Zhang L. Chen M. Inchauspe G. Bahl C. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 182: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); COS-7 cells were transfected with pCXN2-core, pCXN2-core173, or pCXN2-HAcore151. Forty-eight hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then blocked with PBS containing 2% normal rabbit serum for 1 h and incubated with mouse anti-core antigen IgG fraction (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:40) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, coated with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako), covered with glass, and observed by microscope using an epifluorescent attachment (AX80, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Approximately 2 × 106 HeTOC-22 cells were plated into a 10-cm dish (Iwaki Glass) and cultured in medium with or without 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested and their nuclear extracts were prepared according to mini-nuclear extraction methods (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3913) Google Scholar). The concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by a Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and was adjusted to give equal concentrations. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using a Gel shift assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide having a κB site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) was end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. For competition, an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or an unlabeled noncompetitor oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′) was added to the reaction mixture in 100-fold osmolar excess over the labeled probe to examine the binding specificity. Reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel and then separated by electrophoresis in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer (0.045 m Tris borate and 0.001m EDTA). Data were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using the t test. Ap value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Expression of full-length and three deleted core proteins was examined in the soluble protein cell extracts of transiently transfected COS-7 cells by Western blotting (Fig.1, A and B). Full-length (pCXN2-core) and aa 1–173 core (pCXN2-core173) were detected by mouse anti-HCV core antigen IgG fraction (Fig.1 A). HA-tagged core aa 1–151 (pCXN2-HAcore151) and aa 92–191 (pCXN2-HAcore92–191) were detected by anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1 B). The size of each core protein was consistent with the expected size. Expression of HCV core protein was detected by Western blotting in HeTOC cells, a clone termed HeTOC-22, which can be induced to express core protein under the control of doxycycline, 48 h after the removal of doxycycline. The induction ratio was greater than 1,000 when the relative amount of expressed HCV core protein with or without doxycycline was analyzed using a LAS-1000 image analyzer (photo film from Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) (data not shown). In HeLa cells, HCV core protein (0.2 μg of pCXN2-core) significantly activated the NF-κB pathway at a value 6.2 ± 3.4 (mean ± S.D.) times higher than that of the control, whereas TNF-α (20 ng/ml) activated the pathway at a value 8.6 ± 2.0 times higher (Fig.2 A). Activation of the NF-κB pathway increased in relation to the amount of plasmid utilized for pCNX2-core (Fig. 3). In HepG2 cells, HCV core protein activated the pathway at a value 4.3 ± 0.9 times higher than the control, whereas TNF-α activated the pathway at a value 4.5 ± 2.5 (Fig. 2 A).Figure 3Dose-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway by HCV core protein. HeLa cells were transfected with various amounts of pCXN2 or pCXN2-core. Luciferase activities were measured and expressed as described in the legend for Fig. 2. pFC-MEKK, expressing constitutively active MEKK1, served as a positive control for the NF-κB pathway.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HeTOC cells, which can be induced to express core protein under the control of doxycycline, were used to examine activation of the NF-κB pathway. Core-expressing HeTOC-22 cells cultured in a medium without doxycycline showed a pathway activation value 5.2 ± 1.5 times higher than that found with HeTOC-22 cells cultured in a medium with doxycycline. Addition of TNFα to core-expressing HeTOC-22 cells did not affect significantly the activation of NF-κB pathway by core protein (Fig. 2 B). To examine whether core protein enhances NF-κB-DNA binding, EMSA was performed using the nuclear extracts of HeTOC-22 cells, which were induced to express core protein. As shown in Fig. 4, NF-κB-DNA binding activity was enhanced in HeTOC-22 cells expressing core protein (about 2.9 times) as compared with that in HeTOC-22 cells without expressing core protein under the existence of doxycycline. This NF-κB-DNA binding activity observed in these assays was ablated by an excess of unlabeled competitor but not by an excess of unlabeled noncompetitor (Fig. 4). Addition of an antibody directed against p65 or p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) generated a supershifted band, suggesting that this NF-κB-DNA complex was containing p65 and p50 (data not shown). To determine the region of HCV core protein responsible for activation of the NF-κB pathway, we constructed three plasmids, which expressed deletion mutant forms of core protein: pCXN2-core173, pCXN2-HAcore151, and pCXN2-HAcore92–191. HeLa cells were transfected with full-length or each deletion mutant form of HCV core expressing plasmids in combination with pNF-κB-Luc (Fig. 5). None of the deletion mutant forms of core protein activated the NF-κB pathway, whereas full-length HCV core protein did activate the pathway. These results suggest that both the N terminus (aa 1–91) and C terminus (aa 174 to 191) of the core protein may play an important role in activation of the NF-κB pathway. We then examined subcellular localization of full-length and two deletion mutants of HCV core protein by indirect immunofluorescence assay. As shown in Fig. 6, full-length core protein (aa 1–191) was located diffusely in the cytoplasm, in contrast to the perinuclear localization of the C-terminal 18 aa-deleted core protein (aa 1–173) and the nuclear localization of the C-terminal 40 aa-deleted core protein (aa 1–151). To examine whether activation of the NF-κB pathway by HCV core protein is transduced through IKKα or IKK%, HeLa cells were cotransfected with pCXN2/pCXN2-core, pNF-κB-Luc, and pIKKα(K44A)/pIKK%(K44A). Expression of IKK%(K44A), catalytically inactive IKK%, significantly reduced HCV core induced NF-κB activation to about one-tenth, whereas expression of IKKα(K44A), catalytically inactive IKKα, reduced the activation to about two-fifths (Fig.7). To confirm the participation of IKK% in activation of the NF-κB pathway by HCV core protein, we added 5 mm acetyl salicylic acid, an IKK%-specific inhibitor (28Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), to the HeLa cells transfected with pCXN2/pCXN2-core and pNF-κB-Luc. Activation of the pathway by core protein was significantly inhibited by acetyl salicylic acid but not by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (Fig.8). These results suggest that HCV core protein activates the NF-κB pathway through IKK, especially IKK%.Figure 8Acetyl salicylic acid reduced NF-κB activation by HCV core protein.Acetyl salicylic acid, an IKK%-specific inhibitor, was added to the medium of HeLa cells transfected with pCXN2/pCXN2-core and pNF-kB-Luc at a concentration of 5 mm.

https://openalex.org/W1983794537,"For the widely distributed P2Y receptors for nucleotides, the transductional and functional responses downstream of their coupling to G proteins are poorly characterized. Here we describe apoptotic induction and the associated differential stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members by the human P2Y1 receptor. The potent P2Y1receptor agonist, 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP), stimulated the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) (EC50 ∼5 nm) as well as several, but not all isoforms detected, of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) family. Phospho-isoforms of p38 were unaffected. The induced kinase activity was blocked by the P2Y1 receptor-selective antagonist, adenosine-2′-phosphate-5′-phosphate, but unaffected by pertussis toxin. In addition, the endogenous ligand ADP, and significantly also 2-MeSATP, induced concentration-dependent phosphorylation changes in the same MAP kinase family members. The sustained activation of ERK1/2 was associated with Elk-1 phosphorylation that was abolished by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD 98059. However, the concomitant transient activation of the SAPKs was not sufficient to induce c-Jun or ATF-2 phosphorylation. The transient phase of the ERK activity was partially inhibited either by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY 294002, or the PKC inhibitor, Gö 6976. In addition, the Src inhibitor, PP1, or expression of dominant negative Ras also attenuated the transient phase of ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibition of Ras or Src had no effect on the sustained ERK activity, which was critically dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The transient SAPK activity was suppressed by expression of a dominant negative form of MKK4. Furthermore, this kinase-deficient mutant inhibited 2-MeSADP-induced caspase-3 stimulation and the associated decrease in cell number. In conclusion, adenosine di- and triphosphate stimulation of the human P2Y1 receptor can transiently activate the Ras-ERK cascade via the cooperative effects of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src and PKC. The sustained ERK stimulation, via a Ras-insensitive pathway, culminates in Elk-1 activation without inducing a proliferation effect. The transient SAPK activity did not evoke transcription factor phosphorylation but was required for the P2Y1 receptor-mediated apoptotic function.

The P2 family is divided into two main types as follows: the P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, and the P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 2Barnard E.A. Simon J. Webb T.E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 103-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Part of the present study describes the signaling pathways of the P2Y1 receptor, the first member of the P2Y family to be identified (3Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The P2Y1 receptor is widely distributed and has been described in mammalian heart, vascular, liver, kidney, prostate, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, connective, and immune tissues (4Tokuyama Y. Hara M. Jones E.M.C. Fan Z. Bell G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Ayyanathan K. Webb T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has also been identified in skeletal muscle and appears to be the most abundant P2 receptor in the nervous system (5Ayyanathan K. Webb T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Webb T.E. Simon J. Barnard E.A.

Neurobiol. 2000; 421: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ADP and more potently 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP)1 are agonists at the P2Y1 receptor, but its activation by ATP and 2-MeSATP has been controversial. Due to the ready conversion of triphosphates by ectonucleotidases to the aforementioned agonistic diphosphates, some earlier findings are in doubt. Thus, it is important to maintain totally the triphosphate integrity by a constant regenerating system (8Valeins H. Merle M. Labouesse J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1033-1041PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hechler B. Vigne P. Leon C. Breittmayer J.-P. Gachet C. Frelin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which has been included in the experimental design of the present study. With such precautions in place, the recombinant P2Y1 receptor can be activated by ATP and 2-MeSATP (10Palmer R.K. Boyer J.L. Schachter J.B. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,11Filippov A. Brown D.A. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas others (9Hechler B. Vigne P. Leon C. Breittmayer J.-P. Gachet C. Frelin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have found these ligands to be antagonists in other cell systems. This difference has been proposed to depend critically on the degree of P2Y1 receptor reserve (10Palmer R.K. Boyer J.L. Schachter J.B. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,11Filippov A. Brown D.A. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The second messengers generated by the P2Y1 receptor are due to the activation of phospholipase C% leading to the formation of diacylglycerol as well as inositol trisphosphate (12Simon J. Webb T.E. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (9Hechler B. Vigne P. Leon C. Breittmayer J.-P. Gachet C. Frelin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Palmer R.K. Boyer J.L. Schachter J.B. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that the subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is likely. These responses are insensitive to pertussis toxin, and the G protein involved has been identified as G11 in the case of the turkey erythrocyte (14Maurice D.H. Waldo G.L. Morris A.J. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but Gq can also act at the P2Y1 receptor in some systems including the human platelet (15Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a primary signaling action of the P2Y1receptor in neurons is the closing of an N-type Ca2+channel (11Filippov A. Brown D.A. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and in platelets there is some suggestion that the P2Y1 receptor is coupled to the RhoA-ROCK pathway (16Paul B.Z.S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is known that activation of PKC isoforms by G protein-coupled receptors can stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which are members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family (17Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). For the P2Y receptors, activation of the ERK cascade has been shown in several cell types including astrocytes (18Neary J.T. Kang Y. Bu Y., Yu, E. Akong K. Peters C.M. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lenz G. Gottfried C. Luo Z. Avruch J. Rodnight R. Nie W.J. Kang Y. Neary J.T. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and renal mesangial cells (23Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, since the cells studied co-express several types of P2Y receptors or have an unknown complement of purinoceptors, the downstream events observed have not identified those associated with a single, molecularly defined, P2Y receptor. The MAP kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that have been classified into at least four subfamilies as follows: ERKs, stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), p38 kinases, and BMK1/ERK5 (17Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). Whereas ERKs are implicated in cell growth as well as differentiation, SAPKs and p38 appear to play a role in regulating the cell death machinery (24Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Whereas the pathway linking cell surface receptors to ERKs has been partially elucidated, the mechanism of activation of p38 and SAPKs is poorly understood. This is particularly so for members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, which have only recently been shown to utilize these alternative MAP kinase cascades for transduction purposes. Activation of p38 and SAPKs has been demonstrated following stimulation of the Gq/G11-coupled m1 and Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (25Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). More recent studies have also shown p38 activation in rat glomerular mesangial cells following stimulation with UTP and ATP, possibly mediated through the P2Y2 receptor (27Huwiler A. Wartmann M. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation of P2Y2 receptors in C6 glioma cells (28Tu M.-T. Luo S.-F. Wang C.-C. Chien C.-S. Chiu C.-T. Lin C.-C. Yang C.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and/or P2Y4 receptors in rat glomerular mesangial cells can induce proliferation (29Harada H. Chan C.M. Loesch A. Unwin R. Burnstock G. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 949-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At present apoptosis initiated by nucleotides is known only for a P2X receptor, being a prominent consequence of P2X7 receptor activation in human macrophages and leukocytes as well as in mesangial, dendritic, and microglial cells (30Zheng L.M. Zychlinsky A. Liu C.C. Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 31Coutinho-Silva R. Persechini P.M. Bisaggio R.D. Perfettini J.L. Neto A.C. Kanellopoulos J.M. Motta-Ly I. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1139-C1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with most examples of apoptosis, the P2X7 receptor-initiated cascade, which includes the coupling of the ion channel to the SAPK-signaling cascade (32Humphreys B.D. Rice J. Kertesy S.B. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26792-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), involves a defined sequence of phenotypic changes that culminate in death only several hours after the exposure to ATP. The goal of this study was to examine the ability of the human recombinant P2Y1 receptor, heterologously expressed in human astrocytoma cells (1321N1, containing no endogenous P2Y receptors) to stimulate the MAP kinase transduction cascades. A specific antagonist of the P2Y1 receptor was applied to confirm the authenticity of the responses observed. In addition, the time course of the MAP kinase activity was also determined. There is much evidence to suggest that the duration of ERK activity is critically important for determining functional outcome (33Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar, 34Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Lauder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16423-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and in every case examined thus far, only sustained ERK activation induces cytoplasmic nuclear migration (35Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Prolonged stimulation of ERK will therefore have very different consequences for gene expression compared with that of transient activation. Part of this study was thus to determine if the duration of the other MAP kinase cascades is similarly important for controlling transcriptional events. In addition, it was determined whether the P2Y1receptor-mediated MAP kinase activities could be correlated with either a proliferative or an apoptotic functional response. The 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line heterologously expressing the human P2Y1 receptor (5Ayyanathan K. Webb T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. S. P. Kunapuli (Temple University, Philadelphia). All tissue culturing media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and plasticware was from Costar. Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), creatine phosphokinase, creatine phosphate, 2-MeSADP, 2-MeSATP, and adenosine-2′-phosphate-5′-phosphate (A2P5P) were purchased from Sigma. ADP and hexokinase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies specific to ERK1 and ERK2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies specific for the dually phosphorylated and hence active forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (at Thr202 and Tyr204), α, %, and δ isoforms of p38 (at Thr180 and Tyr182), and SAPK family members (at Thr183 and Tyr185), together with antibodies to p38 and SAPKs with a specificity for the kinases independent of their phosphorylation state, were all obtained from New England Biolabs. Antibodies to the transcription factors c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF-2 as well as those to the phosphorylated forms of these proteins were also supplied by New England Biolabs. The PKC inhibitors, Gö 6976 and Ro 32–1432, as well as Bordetella pertussis toxin, the MEK1 inhibitor, PD 98059, the Src inhibitor, PP1, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) inhibitor, LY 294002, were all from Calbiochem. Antibodies to the G protein α subunits were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An anti-MKK4 (SEK1) antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. Antibodies specific for Ras (L2 region) and human Ha-RAS cDNA (dominant negative S17N mutant) in pUSEamp, together with the empty vector, were supplied by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Staurosporin, FITC-conjugated annexin V, and a caspase-3 substrate that is cleaved to release a colorimetric product were all from CLONTECH. ATP and ADP analogues are metabolically unstable and can be degraded by various ectonucleotidases present on cells. In addition, commercially available nucleotides often contain other nucleotides as by-products. Therefore, enzymatic systems that regenerate degraded nucleotides were routinely used in all experimental procedures carried out in this study. To eliminate the diphosphate contamination of 2-MeSATP, the creatine phosphokinase-regenerating system was used according to a method described previously (9Hechler B. Vigne P. Leon C. Breittmayer J.-P. Gachet C. Frelin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, 1 mm stock solutions of 2-MeSATP were treated with 20 units ml−1 creatine phosphokinase in the presence of 10 mm creatine phosphate for 90 min at 37 °C. In order to ensure the purity of ADP and 2-MeSADP, 1 mm stock solutions were treated with 10 units ml−1hexokinase, 0.1 m glucose for 60 min at room temperature to convert the triphosphate contamination to diphosphates (37Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20402-20407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The appropriate enzymes (with their substrates) were also included (at 1 unit ml−1) in the culture medium during all experiments. Human astrocytoma cells (1321N1) stably expressing the human recombinant P2Y1 receptor were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F-12 medium (1:1) containing Glutamax I, pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 600 μg ml−1geneticin sulfate (G-418). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO2) and passaged by trypsinization every 4–5 days. For MAP kinase activity experiments, cells were plated in 6-well plates at an original seeding density of 200,000 cells per well and cultured to 80% confluence. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h before incubation with incomplete media containing various drug treatments for the appropriate times at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by removing the media and adding 150 μl of 3× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer. Following solubilization, the well contents were transferred to Eppendorf vials, and the wells were rinsed with 100 μl of distilled H2O. Equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoretically resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose (0.22 μm) using a semi-dry blotter, the membrane was washed briefly in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and saturated overnight in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk. For detection of the phosphorylated forms of the kinases, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with a 1:800 dilution of the anti-phosphospecific antibodies. Primary incubations were for 1 h at 22 °C in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) followed by washing five times for 10 min each in TBST. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with a 1:3,000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST containing 5% dried milk. Excess antibody was removed by washing as above, and immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to substantiate the consistency of protein content between treatment groups, the membranes were re-probed with phosphorylation state independent antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2 (1:1,000 dilution) or SAPK/p38 (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at 22 °C and processed as above. The Western blots shown are representative of three separate experiments, and each panel is taken from a single immunoblot. Samples obtained from the 2-MeSADP time course experiments were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane as described above. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of the transcription factors ATF-2, Elk-1, and c-Jun (1:400 dilution) for 1 h at 22 °C. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser63 and Ser73 by SAPKs. Antibodies specific to both these phosphorylation sites were used. Elk-1 is phosphorylated by ERK1 and ERK2 at a cluster of Ser/Thr motifs at its COOH terminus, and phosphorylation of Ser383 (to which the antibody was raised) has been shown to be critical for transcriptional activation. Activation of ATF-2 requires phosphorylation of Thr69 and Thr71, and these sites are both substrates for the p38 kinase as well as for the SAPKs. The antibody used was raised to a synthetic phospho-Thr71 peptide. For detection of total protein, phospho-independent antibodies to the transcription factors were used at a 1:500 dilution. The Western blots shown are representative of three separate experiments, and each panel is taken from a single immunoblot. Whole cell extracts from 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells expressing the human P2Y1 receptor were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with serial dilutions of an antibody that specifically recognizes the COOH-terminal of the human P2Y1 receptor (peptide sequence CTLNILPEFKQNGDTSL) or with antibodies recognizing different G protein α subunits (1:250 dilution). All primary incubations were for 1 h at 22 °C and immunoreactivity was detected as described above. Astrocytoma cells (1321N1) stably expressing the recombinant P2Y1 receptor were grown on poly-l-lysine (100 μmml−1)-treated glass coverslips in 12-well plates until they reached ∼70% confluence. The media were removed from the wells, and the coverslips were rinsed for 5 min (times three) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and washed as above. The cells were incubated for 30 min in 500 μl of blocking solution (PBS containing 3% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibody recognizing the P2Y1 receptor (1:200 dilution in blocking solution). Control coverslips were incubated with blocking solution alone. After three washes for 5 min each in PBS, the cells were incubated with 500 μl of the secondary antibody conjugated to cyanine 3 (at 1:1,000 dilution, Sigma) in blocking solution for 1 h at 22 °C. After three washes for 5 min each in PBS, the coverslips were removed from the wells, dipped in distilled water, and dried before being mounted onto slides using an antifade agent (DAKO). The fluorescence was visualized using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope. Dominant negative human MKK4 (K95R) was constructed as described previously (38Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the full-length cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCMV. Human Ha-RAS (S17N) cDNA was inserted as an EcoRI fragment into pUSEamp also under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINETM reagent according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, astrocytoma cells (1321N1) stably expressing the recombinant P2Y1receptor at 50% confluence were transfected in serum-free media with 2 μg of DNA following complex formation with LipofectAMINETM reagent. The DNA-containing media were removed following incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, and the cells were incubated with complete medium. Gene expression using immunoblot analysis as described above was determined immediately prior to drug additions, ∼48 h post-transfection using a primary antibody concentration of 1:1,000. In normal, non-apoptotic cells, phosphatidylserine is segregated to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. During early stages of apoptosis, this asymmetry collapses, and phosphatidylserine becomes exposed on the outer surface of cells (39Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin V is a protein that preferentially binds to phosphatidylserine in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Binding of annexin V in conjunction with propidium iodide exclusion to establish membrane integrity was used to identify apoptotic cells. Astrocytoma cells heterologously expressing the recombinant P2Y1 receptor were grown on poly-l-lysine (100 μm ml−1)-treated glass coverslips in 12-well plates until ∼40% confluence was reached. The cells were serum-starved for 1 h before a 5-h incubation in the presence of various agents. The media were removed from the wells, and the coverslips were rinsed in ice-cold PBS. The coverslips were incubated for 15 min in the dark at 22 °C with 200 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.5 μg ml−1 annexin V-FITC and 10 μg ml−1 propidium iodide. The coverslips were washed twice in binding buffer, dried, and mounted onto microscope slides as described above. Annexin V-FITC binding and propidium iodide incorporation were detected using either a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope or a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) with FITC excitation at 488 nm, emission 505–550 nm, and propidium iodide excitation at 543 nm, emission >560 nm. Maximum projection images of z series are shown. Cytosolic aspartate-specific proteases, called caspases, are responsible for the deliberate disassembly of a cell into apoptotic bodies. Caspases are present as inactive pro-enzymes, most of which are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 can activate caspase-3 by proteolytic cleavage, which can in turn cleave vital cellular proteins leading to apoptosis (40Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined caspase-3 activity as an indicator of apoptotic induction. After challenge with appropriate agonists, 1 × 106cells (including those that had dislodged from the adherent monolayer) were harvested by centrifugation for 30 s at 100 ×g, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. To assess supernatant caspase-3-like activity, 0.3 ml of lysate was combined with buffer (100 mm NaHEPES, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and colorimetric caspase-3 substrate (IETD-pNA) to a final concentration of 20 μm. Samples were incubated in the dark at 37 °C, and absorbance was measured at 400 nm at 10-min intervals using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrophotometer. Data were plotted and slopes calculated along the linear portion of the curve (at least three separate measurements). Data are presented as slope in arbitrary units and are expressed as the arithmetic means ± S.E. of the mean (n = 3). Statistical analysis was by Student'st test. Cells were harvested following incubation for the appropriate period by washing the monolayers in PBS and adding 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA soluti"
https://openalex.org/W2009411683,"Glyceroneogenesis,i.e. the synthesis of the glycerol moiety of triacylglycerol from pyruvate, has been suggested to be quantitatively important in both the liver and adipose tissue during fasting. However, the actual contribution of glyceroneogenesis to triacylglycerol synthesis has not been quantified in vivo in human studies. In the present study we have measured the contribution of glycerol and pyruvate to in vivo synthesis of hepatic triacylglycerol in nonpregnant and pregnant women after an overnight fast. Five nonpregnant women were administered [13C3]glycerol tracer as prime constant rate infusion, and the appearance of tracer in plasma glucose and triacylglycerol was quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The contribution of pyruvate to hepatic triacylglycerol was quantified in nonpregnant and pregnant women using the deuterium labeling of body water method. The appearance of [2H] in hydrogens on C1 and C3 of triacylglycerol was measured following periodate oxidation of the glycerol isolated from hydrolyzed triacylglycerol. After a 16-h fast, ∼6.1% of the plasma triacylglycerol pool was derived from plasma glycerol, whereas 10 to 60% was derived from pyruvate in nonpregnant women and pregnant women early in gestation. Our data suggest that glyceroneogenesis from pyruvate is quantitatively a major contributor to plasma triacylglycerol synthesis and may be important for the regulation of very low density lipoprotein triacylglycerol production. Our data also suggest that 3-glycerol phosphate is in rapid equilibrium with the triosephosphate pool, resulting in rapid labeling of the triose pool by the administered tracer glycerol. Because the rate of flux of triosephosphate to glucose during fasting far exceeds that to triacylglycerol, more glycerol ends up in glucose than in triacylglycerol. Alternatively, there may be two distinct pools of 3-glycerol phosphate in the liver, one involved in generating triosephosphate from glycerol and the other involved in glyceride-glycerol synthesis.

The synthesis of triacylglycerol in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle following a meal is an important metabolic pathway for the deposition of fat and in the maintenance of energy homeostasis in all vertebrates. Even after an overnight fast in adult humans, and following a brief fast in newborn infants, a substantial re-esterification of fatty acids has been documented using isotopic tracer methods (1Elia M.

During fasting, the source of 3-glycerol phosphate can either be plasma glucose via glycolysis or glycerol released from the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol. In the adipose tissue in particular, the glycerol released from the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol cannot be re-utilized for the esterification of fatty acids because of absence of glycerol kinase. It has been proposed that during fasting adipose tissue generates the 3-glycerol phosphate required for triacylglycerol synthesis, either from glucose via glycolysis or, alternatively, from pyruvate via an abbreviated or truncated version of gluconeogenesis, termed glyceroneogenesis (4Vaughan M.

In addition, hepatic glyceroneogenesis has been shown to account for ∼89% of glyceride-glycerol in the triacylglycerol synthesized by rats fed a high protein diet (11Botion L.M. Brito M.N. Brito N.A.

In the present study we have quantified the relative contribution of plasma glycerol and pyruvate (plus lactate, alanine, etc.) to glyceride-glycerol in nonpregnant and pregnant women during fasting. Pregnant women were studied because of the higher concentration of plasma triacylglycerol during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Our data show that the source of glyceride-glycerol following a brief fast is predominantly pyruvate.

Lipid phosphate phosphatases (1, 1a, 2, and 3) are a group of enzymes that catalyze de-phosphorylation of these lipid agonists. It has been proposed that the lipid phosphate phosphatases exhibit ecto activity that may function to limit bioavailability of these lipid agonists at their receptors. In this study, we show that the stimulation of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by sphingosine 1-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and phosphatidic acid, all of which bind to Gi/o-coupled receptors, is substantially reduced in human embyronic kidney 293 cells transfected with lipid phosphate phosphatases 1, 1a, and 2 but not 3. This was correlated with reduced basal intracellular phosphatidic acid and not ecto lipid phosphate phosphatase activity. These findings were supported by results showing that lipid phosphate phosphatases 1, 1a, and 2 also abrogate the stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase by thrombin, a peptide Gi/o-coupled receptor agonist whose bioavailability at its receptor is not subject to regulation by the phosphatases. Furthermore, the lipid phosphate phosphatases have no effect on the stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase by other agents that do not use G-proteins to signal, such as serum factors and phorbol ester. Therefore, these findings show that the lipid phosphate phosphatases 1, 1a, and 2 may function to perturb G-protein-coupled receptor signaling per se rather than limiting bioavailability of lipid agonists at their respective receptors.

Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 was originally identified as a plasma membrane enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the putative second messenger, phosphatidic acid (PA)1 to diacylglycerol (DG) (1Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, multiple isoforms of phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 were cloned (2Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

It was found that these enzymes dephosphorylate a number of lipid phosphates in vitro other than PA, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), ceramide 1-phosphate, and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate. Therefore, they have been renamed lipid phosphate phosphatases. Currently, there are four members of this family called LPP1, LPP1a, LPP2, and LPP3 (6Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The LPP isoforms are integral membrane proteins with six transmembrane domains. These phosphatases contain a motif (KXXXXXXRP(X12–54)PSGH(X31–54)SRXXXXXHXXXD), which is found in a super family of phosphatases (7Stukey J. Carmen G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to establish that the conserved residues K, R, P, S, G, H, R, and H in the catalytic domain of LPP1 are obligatory for activity (8Zhang Q.-X Pilquil C.S. Dewald J. Berthiaume L.G. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).There are also alternative routes through which S1P and LPA can be dephosphorylated in cells. This involves recently identified S1P- and LPA-specific phosphatases (9Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The S1P-specific phosphatase has 8–10 transmembrane domains and contains the same phosphatase motif as the LPP isoforms, whereas the LPA-specific phosphatase has an acid phosphatase motif (LXXVXXVXRHGXRXP).It has been predicted that the LPP isoforms have an extracellular outward-facing catalytic site, raising the possibility that these enzymes may dephosphorylate phosphorylated lipid agonists such as S1P and LPA. Both are polar lysophospholipid metabolites that act as extracellular mediators by binding to plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To date, five closely related GPCRs of the EDG (endothelial differentiation gene) family (EDG1, EDG3, EDG5/AGR16/H218, EDG6, and EDG8/nrg-1) have been identified as high affinity S1P receptors (11Hla T.

The EDG receptors are coupled to multiple effectors via different G-proteins, such as Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Gq, G12, and G13 (17Windh R.T. Lee M.-J Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and Rho-GEF. Examples include inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, stimulation of phospholipase C, calcium mobilization, and p42/p44 MAPK activation (18Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T.

Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tiygi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PA has been shown to stimulate cell migration via a novel receptor-mediated mechanism in breast cancer cells (21Sliva D. Mason R. Xiao H. English D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Recent studies by Xu et al. (22Xu J. Love L.M. Singh I. Zhang Q.-X Dewald J. Wang D.-A Fischer D.J. Tigyi G. Berthiaume L.G. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27520-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the net association of LPA with EDG2 receptors is reduced in Rat2 fibroblasts transfected with LPP1. This leads to a decrease in the LPA-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK, inhibition of adenylate cyclase, calcium mobilization, phospholipase D activation, and DNA synthesis. Such findings support the possibility that LPP1 limits bioavailability of LPA at its receptor. In contrast, Hookset al. (23Hooks S.B. Santos W.L. Im D.-S Heise C.E. MacDonald T.L. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4611-4621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) find that although ecto-LPP1 degrades ∼90% of the LPA in the medium over a 24-h period in HEK 293 cells, this was insufficient to account for the decrease in LPA potency in mitogenic assays, suggesting an alternative unidentified mechanism. One possibility is that the LPP isoforms might dephosphorylate intracellular PA, which is a putative second messenger molecule that may have a role in growth factor and GPCR signaling. For instance, PA is involved in the membrane recruitment of Raf-1 (24Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which contains a specific PA binding region (amino acids 390–426) (25Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Indeed, transfection of HIRcB fibroblasts with a PA binding region construct blocked subsequent insulin-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK and prevented Raf-1 translocation by sequestering PA (24Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The LPP-catalyzed reduction in PA might also increase Ras-GTPase-activating protein (26Tsai M.H., Yu, C.L. Wei F.S. Stacy D.W. Science. 1989; 243: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the half-life of GTP-bound Ras. Alternatively, the LPP isoforms may modulate the membrane dynamic governing GPCR signaling. For instance, PA and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (the formation of which is in a positive feedback loop with PA (27Arneson L.S. Kunz J. Anderson R.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17794-17805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) play a role in membrane trafficking (28Roth M.G. Sternweis P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), where they initiate clathrin coat assembly and facilitate vesicle formation for endocytosis (29Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Schereri P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). In this regard, specialized areas of the plasma membrane, termed caveolae (30Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5107) Google Scholar), provide platforms for pre-assembled clusters of signaling molecules, including Gi, the localization of which is essential for GPCR signaling (31Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, the LPP-catalyzed dephosphorylation of PA may have a role in the endocytic signaling process.Recent studies show that intracellular S1P may also function as an intracellular second messenger. For instance, Rani et al.(32Rani C.S. Berger A. Wu J. Sturgill T.W. Beitner-Johnson D. Le Roth D. Varticovski L. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar) show that platelet-derived growth factor stimulates an increase in intracellular S1P in fibroblasts and that this may activate the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. In this regard, the LPP isoforms may dephosphorylate intracellular S1P, thereby preventing its potential second messenger action.In this study, we have shown that LPP1, LPP1a, and LPP2 but not LPP3 abrogate the activation of p42/p44 MAPK in response to LPA, S1P, PA, and thrombin. Significantly, thrombin is a peptide GiPCR agonist whose bioavailability at its receptor is not regulated by the LPP isoforms. We have also shown that the abrogation of p42/p44 MAPK activation by the LPP isoforms can be correlated with a reduction in basal intracellular PA and not ecto-LPP activity. Therefore, our findings suggest a model in which LPP1, LPP1a, and LPP2 may act on a basal intracellular PA pool to alter the membrane dynamic governing GPCR signaling to p42/p44 MAPK per se.DISCUSSIONThe first major finding of this study is that the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by LPA, S1P, and PA is substantially reduced in LPP1-, LPP1a-, and LPP2- but not LPP3-transfected HEK 293 cells. To date, only LPP1 has been shown to abrogate LPA-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK and mitogenesis in Rat2 fibroblasts and HEK 293 cells, respectively (22Xu J. Love L.M. Singh I. Zhang Q.-X Dewald J. Wang D.-A Fischer D.J. Tigyi G. Berthiaume L.G. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27520-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Hooks S.B. Santos W.L. Im D.-S Heise C.E. MacDonald T.L. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4611-4621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current study is not only the first to extend this to other LPP isoforms but, significantly, is also the first to report that the LPP isoforms can attenuate the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by S1P and PA. The inability of LPP3 to abrogate activation of p42/p44 MAPK by the lipids may be due to the fact that its expression in HEK 293 cells is considerably less than the other LPP isoforms.Some of the LPP isoforms exhibited Vmax values that were considerably larger than any other previously reported for these enzymes in transfected cells (2Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22059-22067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 5Tate R.J. Tolan D. Pyne S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These values simply reflect particularly good expression of the enzymes in the stable-transfected HEK 293 cells. The estimated Kmvalues for dioctanoyl-PA were ∼200–290 μm for all the enzymes, whereas those for oleoyl-LPA were 14–60 μm for LPP1/LPP1a and ∼190–250 μm for LPP2/LPP3. These values are very similar to those obtained by Hooks et al. (43Hooks S.B. Ragan S.P. Lynch K.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), who determined Km values for dioleoyl-PA of 98, 150, and 100 μm and for oleoyl-LPA of 170, 340, and 110 μm for LPP1, LPP2, and LPP3, respectively, in transfected HEK 293 cells. In addition, we report for the first time that LPP2 has both intracellular and extracellular activity and have provided evidence of its localization in transfected HEK 293 cells.The second major finding of this study is that the abrogation of p42/p44 MAPK activation by LPP1, LPP1a, and LPP2 is not due to limitation of the bioavailability of the lipid agonists at their respective receptors. This was based upon two lines of evidence. First, there was no correlation between ecto-LPP activity against LPA, S1P, and PA and the abrogation of p42/p44 MAPK activation. Second, LPP1, LPP1a, and LPP2 also abrogated the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by thrombin, a peptide Gi/o-coupled receptor agonist whose bioavailability at its receptor is not subject to regulation by the LPP isoforms.These findings contrast with studies by Xu et al. (22Xu J. Love L.M. Singh I. Zhang Q.-X Dewald J. Wang D.-A Fischer D.J. Tigyi G. Berthiaume L.G. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27520-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), where ecto activity has been suggested to account for the effect of LPP1 on LPA-stimulated signaling in Rat2 fibroblasts. However, it is important to note that the study by Xu et al. (22Xu J. Love L.M. Singh I. Zhang Q.-X Dewald J. Wang D.-A Fischer D.J. Tigyi G. Berthiaume L.G. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27520-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) did not investigate the effect of LPP1 on other GPCR agonists and so the specificity of its action, and therefore the mechanism was not fully defined. Our findings do agree to some extent with those of Hookset al. (23Hooks S.B. Santos W.L. Im D.-S Heise C.E. MacDonald T.L. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4611-4621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These authors found that although ecto-LPP1 degrades ∼90% of the LPA in the medium over a 24-h period in HEK 293 cells, this was insufficient to account for the decrease in LPA potency in mitogenic assays, suggesting an alternative unidentified mechanism. Moreover, these authors reported, using degradation-resistant phosphonate analogs of LPA and stereoselective agonists of the EDG receptors, that the mitogenic response of LPA was independent of EDG2, -4, and -7. These authors therefore suggest that the responses to LPA may be mediated via a distinct GPCR, possibly PSP24, an LPA receptor that is not a member of the EDG family (20Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tiygi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In our studies, we found that LPA activates p42/p44 MAPK via a GPCR that is sensitive to pertussis toxin and suramin, although we do not know as yet whether this receptor is a member of the EDG family. We have also found that exogenous PA stimulates p42/p44 MAPK via a Gi/o-coupled receptor that appears to exhibit a much higher affinity for PA compared with LPA at its receptor. Therefore, it is possible that PA binds to a distinct receptor from that which binds LPA.The LPP isoforms have no effect on the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by other agents that do not use G-proteins to signal, such as serum factors and phorbol ester. Taken together, these findings represent a major advance as they clearly show that LPP1, LPP1a, and LPP2 may function to abrogate GPCR signaling per se.Basal intracellular PA levels were decreased, whereas DG levels were increased in LPP1-, LPP1a-, and LPP2-transfected but not LPP3-transfected cells. This is in line with studies by Leung et al. (4Leung D.W. Tompkins C.K. White T. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using HEK 293 cells transfected with LPP1 or LPP1a. Agonist-stimulated PA has been implicated in the activation of Raf and the inhibition of Ras-GTPase-activating protein (25Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 26Tsai M.H., Yu, C.L. Wei F.S. Stacy D.W. Science. 1989; 243: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), both of which are up-stream components in the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. However, neither S1P nor LPA increase PA in HEK 293 cells. We propose that the LPP isoforms act on a basal pool of PA, which may have a distinct function from agonist-stimulated PA. One possibility is that basal PA contributes to the structural integrity of lipid micro domains within the plasma membrane, in which signal complexes are assembled. Alternatively, PA may regulate the formation of endocytic vesicles required for GPCR signaling.The magnitude of the increase in DG levels in LPP1-, LPP1a-, and LPP2-transfected cells did not equate with the reduction in PA. Identical reciprocal changes in the amounts of DG and PA might be expected if DG production was exclusively via the action of the LPP isoforms. This suggests additional routes of DG synthesis in these cells. However, it is unlikely that there is a role for increased basal intracellular DG in abrogating p42/p44 MAPK activation, even though the chronic increase in intracellular DG levels does raise the possibility of down-regulation of protein kinase C, an enzyme that has been shown to regulate p42/p44 MAPK activation. This would have the effect of attenuating the action of agonists that use protein kinase C to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK activation, such as LPA and S1P. However, we suggest that functional changes in protein kinase C expression are unlikely given that the activation of p42/p44 MAPK by acute treatment of cells with PMA, which stimulates the same DG-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms that would be down-regulated by chronic DG, was unaffected by the LPP isoforms.We speculate here that the LPP isoforms may act on a small pool of basal intracellular PA that specifically regulates the membrane dynamic for signaling via G-protein-coupled receptors. There are good reasons to believe that this may be the case. First, the attenuation of p42/p44 MAPK activation by the LPP isoforms is common to several GPCR agonists used in this study, including thrombin. Second, LPP isoforms may localize to caveolin-enriched lipid rafts, where the enzyme could function to maintain structural integrity by precisely regulating the PA concentration. This is important because Giα is also localized in lipid rafts containing caveolin (31Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is required for GPCR signaling. Third, the LPP isoforms may dephosphorylate a pool of PA that plays a role in clathrin coat assembly and vesicle formation for endocytosis (29Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Schereri P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). This is important because the endocytosis of G-protein-coupled receptor signal complexes is required for efficient phosphorylation of MEK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1) by Ras-Raf (45Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 46Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J.

Chem. 1999; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ratio of LPA/PA at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is important for vesicular budding (48Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This involves endophilin I, an enzyme that exhibits lysophosphatidic acyltransferase activity and generates PA, which is required for endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, endophilin interacts with dynamin II (44Ringstad N. Gad H. Low P. Di Paolo G. Brodin L. Shupliakov O. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1999; 24: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and GPCRs (42Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. De Camilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This proposal is currently under investigation in our laboratory. Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 was originally identified as a plasma membrane enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the putative second messenger, phosphatidic acid (PA)1 to diacylglycerol (DG) (1Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, multiple isoforms of phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 were cloned (2Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

It was found that these enzymes dephosphorylate a number of lipid phosphates in vitro other than PA, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), ceramide 1-phosphate, and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate. Therefore, they have been renamed lipid phosphate phosphatases. Currently, there are four members of this family called LPP1, LPP1a, LPP2, and LPP3 (6Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The LPP isoforms are integral membrane proteins with six transmembrane domains. These phosphatases contain a motif (KXXXXXXRP(X12–54)PSGH(X31–54)SRXXXXXHXXXD), which is found in a super family of phosphatases (7Stukey J. Carmen G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to establish that the conserved residues K, R, P, S, G, H, R, and H in the catalytic domain of LPP1 are obligatory for activity (8Zhang Q.-X Pilquil C.S. Dewald J. Berthiaume L.G. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). There are also alternative routes through which S1P and LPA can be dephosphorylated in cells. This involves recently identified S1P- and LPA-specific phosphatases (9Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The S1P-specific phosphatase has 8–10 transmembrane domains and contains the same phosphatase motif as the LPP isoforms, whereas the LPA-specific phosphatase has an acid phosphatase motif (LXXVXXVXRHGXRXP). It has been predicted that the LPP isoforms have an extracellular outward-facing catalytic site, raising the possibility that these enzymes may dephosphorylate phosphorylated lipid agonists such as S1P and LPA. Both are polar lysophospholipid metabolites that act as extracellular mediators by binding to plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To date, five closely related GPCRs of the EDG (endothelial differentiation gene) family (EDG1, EDG3, EDG5/AGR16/H218, EDG6, and EDG8/nrg-1) have been identified as high affinity S1P receptors (11Hla T.

Signal transduction by these ligands is initiated by their association with a type-II receptor serine-threonine kinase, which then recruits and transphosphorylates a type-I receptor, also a transmembrane serine-threonine kinase (2Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transphosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor takes place on several residues in a glycine-serine-rich juxtamembrane domain and leads to activation of the receptor and downstream signaling events (3Wrana J.L.

In a recently described direct signaling pathway, the activated type-I receptor associates with and phosphorylates a family of receptor-activated Smad proteins, which then dissociate from the receptor, hetero-oligomerize with a common partner Smad4, and translocate to the nucleus, where they take part in transcriptional activation of target genes (4ten Dijke I Miyazono I.

Of these, SARA, which has been shown to facilitate Smad2/3 recruitment to the activated TβRI (14Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), is the only protein directly shown to modulate the Smad signaling pathway. Recently, a novel protein called TRAP1 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for a protein interacting with a mutationally activated TβRI (23Charng M.J. Zhang D. Kinnunen P. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9365-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, the C-terminal portion of TRAP1 (ΔTRAP1) was shown to interact specifically with mutationally or ligand-activated TβRI but not with the quiescent receptor, suggesting that it might participate in signal transduction from the TβRI. In functional assays, ΔTRAP1 acted as an inhibitor of TGF-β-mediated effects, suggesting that it might play a role in modulating this signal transduction pathway. To better understand the biological role of TRAP1, we have now expressed the full-length molecule, and used biochemical and functional assays to show that TRAP1 differs in its binding characteristics from the previously published ΔTRAP1 in that it predominantly associates with receptor complexes that are signaling deficient. Moreover, we show that TRAP1 specifically interacts with Smad4 and provide data suggesting that it functions as a chaperone for Smad4 in TGF-β signal transduction. COS-1, HepG2, and NMuMg cells were maintained in high glucose-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Cells were transfected with the constructs indicated using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies), Superfect (Quiagen), or FUGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection protocols were generated using Cellputer Software. 2J. U. Wurthner, manuscript in preparation. Epitope-tagged TRAP1 and TRAP1 deletion constructs were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pCDNA3-TRAP1 using the Roche Molecular Biochemical ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR System and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEFcx (gift from Dr. C. Hill), a derivative of pEF-BOS with a modified multiple cloning site, as well as into pEGFP (CLONTECH). For bacterial expression of GST-tagged fusion proteins, ΔTRAP1 was subcloned into the pGEX4T3 vector. Smad4-MH2 was cloned into pCDNA4HisMax (InVitrogen) for in vitro translation. All constructs were sequence confirmed. COS-1 cells were plated in 100-mm plates at 1.5 × 106 cells/plate and grown overnight. Cells were then transiently transfected with epitope-tagged receptors (HA), TRAP1 (Flag, Myc, or EGFP), and/or Smad4 (Myc) and/or Smad2 (Flag) as indicated and incubated for 24 h in maintenance medium as described above, followed by another incubation period of 12–16 h in low serum medium (0.2% fetal calf serum). Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with the protease inhibitors pepstatin (1 μg/ml), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (500 μg/ml), phosphatase inhibitors NaF (50 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (CA12–5), monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) antibody, or polyclonal anti-Myc (Santa-Cruz A14) antibody, followed by adsorption to protein G-Sepharose. Protein-G beads were then washed in lysis buffer for 5 times, boiled with sample buffer (NOVEX, containing 5% mercaptoethanol), and loaded onto precast SDS gels (NOVEX). Blotting was done utilizing ImmobilonTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were subsequently blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk in TBS-T buffer. Proteins were visualized by Western blotting with anti-HA, anti-Flag (M2), anti-Myc, and anti-GFP (Zymed Laboratories Inc. mouse monoclonal) antibodies. In vitrotranscription/translation was carried out using commercially available reticulocyte lysates (InVitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In short, Smad4 constructs under the control of T7 promoters were incubated with the reticulocyte lysates in the presence of 20 mCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min at 30 °C and subsequently incubated with GST-tagged ΔTRAP1 bound to glutathione-agarose. Following washes in a buffer described for the immunoprecipitation studies, beads were boiled with sample buffer (NOVEX, containing 5% mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto precast SDS gels (NOVEX). Visualization was done by autoradiography. COS-1 cells were plated onto sterilized glass coverslips (Corning) on day 0, transiently transfected on day 1, serum-starved overnight on day 2, and processed on day 3. Following treatment, cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with either of the following primary antibodies: 12CA5 anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000, own production) or M2 anti-Flag mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma). Cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline prior to incubation with another primary antibody and then incubated for 30 min with the following secondary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry, 1:1000) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmonoResearch, 1:1000). Cells were mounted with medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and then visualized with a Zeiss confocal microscope. HepG2 cells or COS-1 cells (3.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transfected using Superfect (Quiagen) or Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions with the indicated amounts of DNA. Cells were co-transfected with either with a 3TP-Luciferase reporter (gift from J. Massaguè) or a SBE driven Luciferase reporter (gift from S. Kern). 24 h later, cells were shifted into low serum with or without TGF-β (5 ng/ml). Where indicated, luciferase activity was measured following 12–18 h of incubation using a commercially available kit (Pharmingen) and normalized to β-galactosidase expression. To investigate interactions of TRAP1 with TGF-β receptors, we have expressed the full-length molecule together with combinations of wild type and kinase-deficient TβRI and TβRII in vivo. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with epitope-tagged receptor (HA) and TRAP1 (Flag) constructs, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In cells that overexpress only TβRI, a weak interaction of full-length TRAP1 can be demonstrated with the kinase-deficient mutant but not the wild type receptor (Figs. 1 A and2 A). In cells overexpressing only TβRII, TRAP1 interacts with either wild type or kinase-deficient receptors, showing a stronger association with the kinase-deficient TβRII (Figs. 1 A and2 B). When both TβRI and TβRII are overexpressed simultaneously, in various combinations of wild type and kinase-deficient forms, TRAP1 binds most strongly to those complexes in which at least one of the receptors has been mutationally inactivated (Fig. 1 B), making the complex incapable of signaling. A direct effect of TGF-β on association of TRAP1 with wild type receptor combinations could not be demonstrated (Fig. 1 B), most likely due to a ligand-independent activation of the receptor complex in the context of overexpression of wild type receptors (20Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,24Pastorcic M. Sarkar D.K. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a phenomenon which we have confirmed in functional assays (Fig.3 C, and data not shown).Figure 2TRAP1 associates with distinct type II and type I receptors of the TGF-β superfamily of ligands. Using the same experimental conditions as in the legend to Fig. 1, A and B, TRAP1 was co-transfected with various KD type I (A) or wild type and KD type II (B) receptors with HA or Flag tags and coimmunoprecipitated with Flag- or Myc-tagged TRAP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3The apparent binding of TRAP1 to TβRII and ActRIIB is signal-dependent. A, GFP-tagged TRAP1 was co-transfected either with the wild type (wt) or kinase-deficient (KD) forms of TβRII (HA-tagged,lanes 1 and 2) or ActRIIB (flag-tagged,lanes 3–7) with or without either kinase-deficient (KD,lane 6) or activated (a*, lane 7) ALK4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA (lanes 1 and 2) or anti-Flag antibody (lanes 3–7), and co-precipitating TRAP1 was probed with anti-GFP. The expression levels of TRAP1 and the receptor constructs are shown as loading controls. Note that in contrast to the apparently stronger binding of TRAP1 to the kinase-deficient form of Tβ RII, its binding to ActRIIB is independent of this inactivating mutation. B, TβRII but not ActRIIB activates the transcription of the TGF-β/activin-responsive 3TP-Lux reporter. The ability of transfected wild type and kinase-deficient forms of TβRII and ActRIIB to trigger the corresponding signaling pathways was assessed by activation of the 3TP-Lux reporter, under the experimental conditions described inpanel A. Note that TβRII significantly activates transcriptional responses with the same order of potency of activated ALK4. In contrast ActRIIB elicits transcriptional responses only modestly higher than that of negative control and kinase-deficient ActRIIB and TβRII. Results are expressed as ratio of luciferase activity (relative light units) to β-galactosidase activity and are representative of three independent experiments.Error bars represent standard deviation; where no error bars are visible, the error is too small to be shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the intracellular localization of TRAP1 and TGF-β receptors using epitope-tagged proteins and indirect immunofluorescence to confirm the above observations. In order to avoid ligand-independent activation of the signaling cascade, we again utilized mutationally activated and kinase-deficient forms of TβRI to simulate the presence and absence of TGF-β signal, as described for the immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 1 C, TRAP1 co-localizes with TGF-β receptors when the receptors are mutationally inactivated, displaying the same patchy distribution pattern previously reported for the receptor complex (14Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 25Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the presence of constitutively activated receptors, however, the intracellular distribution of TRAP1 changes from the patchy pattern to a more diffuse pattern (Fig.1 D). This correlates with a reduction in the degree of TRAP1-receptor association consistent with that observed in immunoprecipitation/Western blotting. Taken together, these data suggest that TRAP1 associates with the TGF-β receptor complex and that the type II receptor is the primary binding partner. The fact that associations are strongest in the presence of kinase-deficient receptors suggests that activation of signaling through the TGF-β receptor complex results in dissociation of TRAP1 from this complex, in striking distinction to previously published data for the C-terminal fragment of TRAP1, ΔTRAP1 (23Charng M.J. Zhang D. Kinnunen P. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9365-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interactions of TRAP1 were specific to the TGF-β receptors TβRI and TβRII, we next examined the ability of TRAP1 to bind to other members of the TGF-β superfamily of receptors. As shown in Fig.2 A, TRAP1 associates also with several kinase-deficient type I receptors, specifically with ALK1, BMPR-IA (ALK3), ActRI (ALK4), and the TβRI (ALK5), but not with the ALK2 receptor and only minimally with BMPR-IB (ALK6). With the exception of the binding of TRAP1 to ALK3, these data suggest that TRAP1 is likely to be involved in both TGF-β and activin but less likely in BMP signaling. Since the primary binding partner for TRAP1 is the type II receptor, we tested the association of TRAP1 with various other type II receptors. Interestingly, only TβRII and the activin type IIB receptor associate with TRAP1, whereas the BMP type II receptor does not (Fig.2 B). To explore the binding of TRAP1 to the activin receptors more fully, we examined the pattern of binding of TRAP1 to both wild type and kinase-deficient forms of ActRIIB. In contrast to the pattern observed with TβRII, where the binding of TRAP1 was clearly stronger to the kinase-deficient form of the receptor (Fig.1 A and Fig. 3 A), we observed equal binding of TRAP1 to either active or inactive forms of ActRIIB (Fig. 3 A). Similar to that observed with the TGF-β receptor complex, activation of the complex by overexpression of the constitutively activated form of ALK4 led to nearly complete dissociation of TRAP1 from the receptor complex. In an attempt to understand the basis of the difference in the comparative binding of TRAP1 to the wild type and kinase-deficient forms of TβRII and ActRIIB, we examined the effect of overexpression of each of these receptor constructs on the activity of the TGF-β/activin responsive 3TP-Lux reporter (28Wrana J.L. Attisano L.C. Arcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). The ability of wild type TβRII but not ActRIIB to activate signaling when overexpressed in this cellular context mirrors the apparent differential binding of TRAP1 to the wild type- and kinase-deficient forms of these two receptors and suggests that partial dissociation of TRAP1 from wild type TβRII underlies its apparently stronger binding to inactive TβRII. Whether the selective ability of TβRII to activate signaling in COS-1 cells results from an autocrine loop or from differential expression of ALK5 compared with ALK4 is not known. To establish the domains of TRAP1 involved in its binding to TβRII, C- and N-terminal deletion constructs and a middle region construct (Fig.4 A) were used in immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 4 B, full-length TRAP1, ΔMC-TRAP1 (amino acids 1–215), ΔNM-TRAP1 (amino acids 651–860), ΔNC-TRAP1 (amino acids 238–536), and ΔTRAP1 (amino acids 474–860) co-immunoprecipitate with TβRII. It is noteworthy that binding of each of the deletion constructs is severalfold stronger than that of the wild type molecule, suggesting a complex conformational regulation of these binding domains. Even under stringent washing conditions (500 mm NaCl buffer), strong binding of all regions to TβRII(KD) was detectable (data not shown). Since both the C-terminal deleted construct ΔMC-TRAP1 and the N-terminal deleted construct ΔNM-TRAP1 as well as the middle region ΔNC-TRAP1 all bind strongly to TβRII, there are at least three binding sites for interaction of TRAP1 with the receptor. Since the association data for the full-length TRAP1 described in the legend to Fig. 1 differ from those previously described for the C-terminal ΔTRAP1, we also investigated the interaction pattern of this truncated protein with TβRI and TβRII. In our hands, ΔTRAP1 neither showed any preferential binding to activated, wild type, or inactivated TGF-β receptors nor did it discriminate between TβRI and TβRII, as shown in Fig. 4 C, in striking distinction from the pattern shown for the full-length molecule. Since overexpression of either TβRII or the activated form of TβRI are sufficient to induce signaling, these data demonstrate that ΔTRAP1, unlike full-length TRAP1, does not dissociate from the active signaling receptor complex. Initial functional studies of ΔTRAP1 by Charnget al. (23Charng M.J. Zhang D. Kinnunen P. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9365-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed an inhibitory effect on TGF-β induced activity of the 3TP-Lux reporter, suggesting a functional role of the molecule in TGF-β signaling. Based on the different interaction patterns of full-length TRAP1 and ΔTRAP1 molecules with the TGF-β receptors, we investigated whether their functional roles might also differ, and specifically whether ΔTRAP1 might function as a dominant negative mutant of the full-length molecule. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated TRAP1 constructs and the SBE luciferase reporter, consisting of 4 tandem repeats of the Smad-binding element CAGA (29Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) or the 3TP-Lux reporter (data not shown). Stimulation with TGF-β resulted in activation of luciferase activity with either promoter (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Addition of TRAP1 slightly enhanced luciferase activity, whereas ΔTRAP1 consistently inhibited luciferase activity, as shown previously (23Charng M.J. Zhang D. Kinnunen P. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9365-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed in NMuMg cells with the 3TP-Lux reporter (data not shown). These results distinguish functionally the full-length TRAP1 molecule and its N-terminal deletion mutant ΔTRAP1. We propose that the relatively minor effect of the full-length molecule might be due to its abundance within the cell, making it a non-limiting component in the signal transduction pathway. In this respect, TRAP1 behaves like SARA, which was shown to have little effect on reporter gene activity (3TP-Lux and ARE-Lux) as a full-length molecule, but which was inhibitory in its truncated and functionally inactive forms (14Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that ΔTRAP1 has an inhibitory effect on TGF-β signaling and fails to dissociate from active receptor complexes in contrast to full-length TRAP1, we hypothesized that TRAP1 might play a fundamental role in signaling from the TGF-β and activin receptors, and possibly other receptors of the TGF-β superfamily. Smad4 was a potential target for TRAP1 action, since it is an obligatory signaling intermediate in Smad-mediated signaling from all TGF-β superfamily receptors. We therefore investigated whether TRAP1 might interact with Smad4 in vivo, and whether such an interaction might be signal-dependent. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with TRAP1 and Smad4 and with or without activated TβRI. As shown in Fig. 6 A, TRAP1 binds only weakly to Smad4 in the absence of a TGF-β signal. However, upon activation of the signaling cascade, a strong interaction can be demonstrated between TRAP1 and Smad4. This interaction most likely occurs off the receptor, as the activated receptor interacts only weakly with TRAP1, as shown above. These data are also consistent with the fact that a direct association of Smad4 with the activated receptor complex has not thus far been demonstrated (30Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 31Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To address the question whether TRAP1 might also interact with other Smad proteins, we transfected Flag- and Myc-tagged Smad 1–8 constructs and utilized a GFP-tagged TRAP1 construct as a potential binding partner (Fig.6 B). The data show that Smad4 is the only Smad binding partner of TRAP1. In order to determine whether the interaction of TRAP1 with Smad4 is direct or dependent on bridging molecules, we performed in vitro pull-down assays. Since full-length TRAP1 could not be expressed in our bacterial strains (DH5α and BL21, data not shown), we utilized bacterially expressed GST-ΔTRAP1 bound to glutathione-agarose and various in vitrotranscribed/translated Smad4 constructs. The Smad4 constructs were labeled with [35S]methionine and incubated with GST-agarose and GST-ΔTRAP1-agarose beads, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 6 C, ΔTRAP1 pulls down Smad4 full-length protein weakly and almost no Linker + MH2 and MH2 constructs. However, the MH1 domain, a MH1 + Linker construct, as well as a SAD + MH2 construct bind strongly to ΔTRAP1. This suggests that there are at least two binding sites in Smad4 that facilitate a direct TRAP1-Smad4 interaction, and that these binding sites are conformationally restricted and regulated in the full-length Smad4in vivo (as shown above). Together, these results demonstrate a signal dependent, direct TRAP1-Smad4 interaction. The association of TRAP1 with Smad4 in the presence of an activated receptor led us to investigate whether TRAP1, Smad4, and Smad2 are part of a common complex and whether the observed association of Trap1 with Smad4 results from the artificial state generated by overexpression of Smad4 in the absence of"

Contraction of the smooth muscle defines the lumen in blood vessels, airways, uterus, and bladder. An abnormal increase in smooth muscle tone has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, cardiogenic shock, and other motility-related disorders (1Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V.

Relaxation of the smooth muscle can result from the increase of intracellular cAMP and cGMP generated by the activation of adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases, respectively (3Madison J.M.

The mechanism by which cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) could relax the smooth muscle is believed to involve the inhibition of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration as a result of activating cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (9Hedlund P. Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Alm P. Hofmann F. Ahmad M. Fassler R. Andersson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the molecular target for the action of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (PKA1 and PKG) in regulating intracellular Ca2+ signaling is unclear. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) is a family of key enzymes in the generation and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling, in cell growth, and differentiation (10Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has identified 10 mammalian PLC isozymes that can be grouped into three subfamilies (PLC-β, PLC-γ, and PLC-δ) on the basis of their size, amino acid sequences, domain structure, and activation mechanisms (11Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar, 12Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The various PLC enzymes appear to be activated by different receptors and mechanisms. The PLC-γ subfamily (γ1 and γ2) is directly phosphorylated and activated by tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways (12Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The four isozymes of PLC-β are activated to various extents by the Gαq subfamily of G-proteins that couple seven transmembrane receptors to intracellular signaling pathways (13Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R.

Specific activation of PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 by the G-protein βγ subunits of the Gαi/o family of G-proteins has also been reported (19Katz A. Wu D. Simon M, I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25952-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, functionally distinct G-proteins could selectively couple different receptors to PI hydrolysis and intracellular calcium release in the same cell. There is a wide range of interactions, both between homologous signaling pathways and between heterologous systems (22Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These interactions provide a mechanism that allows G-protein-coupled pathways to influence each other's function and to modulate multiple receptor signaling pathways. For example, there is increasing evidence for a physiological interaction between the PI and cAMP signaling pathways. Both IP3 and diacylglycerol, products of PLC activation, affect cAMP formation. Calcium mobilized from intracellular stores by IP3 forms a complex with calmodulin. Ca2+-calmodulin can directly bind to certain forms of adenylyl cyclases to activate them (26Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 27Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol can also activate protein kinase C that attenuates or potentiates hormone-induced cAMP accumulation in different cell types. On the other hand, there are also numerous reports that the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (PIP2) is regulated by cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The effects of cAMP on agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositide production range from stimulation to inhibition. cAMP or agents that stimulate production of cAMP (forskolin, prostaglandins E1 and E2, theophylline, prostacyclin, and β-adrenergic agents), inhibit phosphatidylinositide breakdown and intracellular Ca2+mobilization in a number of cells and tissues (3Madison J.M.

However, the molecular mechanism by which the cAMP pathway regulates the PIP2 metabolism and intracellular Ca2+mobilization is poorly understood. Our recent work (22Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 39Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol.

Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) work together in the control of cell homeostasis. NO has been recognized to account for the activities of the endothelial-derived relaxing factor by increasing intracellular cGMP concentration. In a number of cells, nitric oxide and atrial natriuretic factor inhibited the release of intracellular Ca2+ from internal storage sites. The inhibitory effects of these agents appear to be mediated by increasing intracellular cGMP and by activating cGMP-dependent protein kinases (6Hirata M. Kohse K.P. Chang C.H. Ikebe T. Murad F. J.

Potential PKG phosphorylation targets of intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathway include phospholipase C, G-proteins, Ca2+-ATPase, phospholamban, IP3 receptor ion channels, and myosin phosphatase (47Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of PKG phosphorylation in mediating intracellular Ca2+release has not been defined. In most cases, the physiological targets of PKG phosphorylation remain to be identified, and their function needs to be clarified. Knowledge of the molecules involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ by cGMP-dependent protein kinase could be of great importance in pharmacology (48Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13729-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). For example, the effect of the popular drug, Viagra (sildenafil), is to increase intracellular cGMP concentration and lower intracellular Ca2+ levels via inhibiting a specific phosphodiesterase in the vascular smooth muscle. In other words, Viagra achieves its pharmacological effects of relaxing the vascular smooth muscle through the increase of intracellular cGMP and possibly cGMP-dependent protein kinase (9Hedlund P. Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Alm P. Hofmann F. Ahmad M. Fassler R. Andersson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism on how an increase in cGMP affects intracellular Ca2+ and, consequently, the relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle is still under active investigation. In this report, we demonstrate that G-protein-activated PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 are directly phosphorylated by PKG in vitro with purified proteins andin vivo with metabolic labeling. Phosphorylation of PLC blocks the activation of the proteins by G-protein subunits. Furthermore, we identified two serine residues (Ser26 and Ser1105) as the PKG phosphorylation sites in PLC-β3. Mutation of these two sites completely abolished the phosphorylation of the protein by PKG and the inhibitory effect of PKG on the activation of PLC-β3 by G-protein subunits. Therefore, these data define a potential cross-talk mechanism between G-protein-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release and the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway.

Lohmann at the University of Würzburg, Germany. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by addition of 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of PLC-β3 phosphorylated by PKG or PKA in vitro was carried out with a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system (CBS Scientific Company, Del Mar, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the phosphorylated PLC proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. PLC proteins were washed and digested with trypsin for 24 h at 35 °C. The phosphopeptides were separated by two-dimensional chromatography. Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the aorta of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (50Guibert C. Marthan R. Savineau J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L637-L642PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the aorta was incubated in collagenase (1.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C before removing the adventitia. The smooth muscle cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 mm glutamine. The cells were grown to confluence and used until the third passage to prevent the loss of endogenous PKGs. Nearly confluent smooth muscle cells (10-cm dish) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.33 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 6 h. After stimulation with the membrane-permeable cGMP analogue, 8-pCPT-cGMP (100–200 μm), cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (37Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins immunoprecipitated with specific anti-PLC-β3 antibody were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The amount of PLC-β3 protein was normalized for sample loading by Western blot. COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (22Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells (1 × 105 cells per well) were seeded in 12-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum a day before transfection. The total amount of DNA in all transfections was 1–1.2 μg per well. The cytomegalovirus vector, pCIS, encoding β-galactosidase was used to maintain the amount of DNA constant and the amount of a particular cDNA in each set of experiments equal. cDNAs were mixed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were transfected for about 5 h. 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in 0.5 ml of inositol-free DMEM medium containing 10 μCi ml−1 ofmyo-[2-3H] inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. 24 h later, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in inositol-free medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min at 37 °C. For activation cGMP-dependent protein kinases, 100 μm8-pCPT-cGMP was added to the inositol-free LiCl medium. The cells were lysed by adding ice-cold 10 mm formic acid and incubated on ice for 30 min. Then the lysate was neutralized with 15 mmNH4OH. Total inositol phosphates were separated by an anion exchange column (AG 1-X8, Bio-Rad) as described. The eluted inositol phosphates was mixed with 10 ml of scintillation mixture (BCS; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. We have shown previously that PKA can directly phosphorylate PLC-β2 and PLC-β3, blocking the activation of the enzymes by G-protein subunits (22Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (39Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, direct phosphorylation of PLC-β isozymes by cGMP-dependent protein kinases has not been reported, although it has been known that an increase in intracellular cGMP can inhibit the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositide and the release of intracellular Ca2+. In order to understand the regulation of G-protein-mediated PLC-Ca2+ signaling by pathway coupled to intracellular cGMP, we extended our studies on the phosphorylation of PLC-β isozymes by PKG both in vitro and in the smooth muscle cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, incubation of purified PLC-β isozymes with purified PKG demonstrated that both PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 are good substrates for PKG, whereas PLC-β1 was not phosphorylated by the kinase under the same conditions. To quantify PKG-stimulated PLC-β3 phosphorylation, purified PLC-β3 was phosphorylated by PKG in vitro. Fig. 1 B shows the time-dependent incorporation of 32P into PLC-β3 protein catalyzed by PKA and PKG. Compared with the phosphorylation of PLC-β3 by PKA (Fig. 1 B, top), PKG phosphorylation is slower and approached a plateau in about 60 min. Estimation of the Km value for PKA is about 1 μm, whereas the Km value for PKG is somewhat higher, ∼12 μm when assayed with different concentrations of purified PLC-β3 protein. A maximum ratio of 1.3 mol of phosphate/mol of PLC-β3 was determined by a filter binding assay at the 60-min incubation point, suggesting two possible phosphorylation sites in PLC-β3 protein. There are three different isoforms of PKG that differ in their sequences, distribution, and membrane association (51Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To examine whether all three isozymes of PKG can phosphorylate PLC-β proteins, we phosphorylated overexpressed PLC-β3 in the presence of PKGIα, PLGIβ, and PKGII, and we then immunoprecipitated PLC-β3 using specific anti-PLC-β3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 C, PLC-β3 was phosphorylated by all three isozymes of PKG in ourin vitro phosphorylation assays. To test the notion that PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 are physiological targets of cGMP-dependent protein kinases in the cell, we further analyzed whether activation of PKG can directly phosphorylate PLC-β isoforms in cells expressing these proteins. Cell extracts from cultured smooth muscle cells were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.2 A, stimulation with selective PKG agonist, 8-Br-cGMP, greatly increased the phosphorylation intensities of 130–140-kDa proteins. Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 indicated that both proteins are phosphorylated by the stimulation of 8-Br-cGMP (Fig.2 B). Together these data suggested that PLC-β proteins could be one of the physiological targets upon stimulation of smooth muscle cell extracts by intracellular cGMP. To confirm that PLC-β3 is phosphorylated upon stimulation of increased cGMP in the cell, cultured smooth muscle cells before passage level 5 were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The expression of PKG in VSMCs before passage level 8 was confirmed by Western blot using specific anti-PKG antibodies. PLC-β3 protein was immunoprecipitated by a specific anti-PLC-β3 antibody after labeling of the cell. Stimulation of PKG by the selective activator, 8-pCPT-cGMP, substantially increased the 32P incorporation into PLC-β3 protein (Fig.2 C), indicating that PLC-β3 is a potential physiological target of cGMP-dependent protein kinases in the cell. To test whether cGMP and PKG are involved in the agonist-stimulated and G-protein-mediated PLC signaling pathway, we constructed mammalian expression plasmids that encode the three different PKG isoforms. Then we reconstituted the G-protein-activated PLC-Ca2+ signaling pathway in COS-7 cells by introducing cDNAs encoding G-protein subunits, PLC-β, and PKGs into the cells. Specific activation of PLC-β3 by G-protein βγ subunits was measured by the release of inositol phosphates (IP3) (Fig.3 A). In the presence of PKG isozymes, the activation of PLC-β3 by G-protein βγ subunits was substantially reduced upon stimulation of PKGs by the membrane-permeable cGMP analogue, 8-pCPT-cGMP (Fig. 3 A). Since PLC-β3 is also activated by Gαq, we examined the PI turnover in COS-7 cells transfected with PLC-β3 and Gαq protein in the presence or absence of PKG. As shown in Fig. 3 B, transfection of empty vector, Gαq, PLC-β3, or PKG alone had little effect on basal PI turnover. Cotransfection of Gαq with PLC-β3 increased the production of inositol phosphates by approximately 5-fold. On the other hand, cotransfection and activation of PKG inhibited more than 60% of the activation of PLC-β3 by Gαq. To examine whether the agonist-induced IP3 synthesis is indeed inhibited by the activation of PKG, we measured the production of IP3 induced by activation of the M1 muscarinic receptor in COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of overexpressed PKG. COS-7 cells were transfected with the M1 muscarinic receptors coupled to PLC-β through Gαq protein. As shown in Fig.3 C, when the M1 receptor was transfected in COS-7 cells and stimulated with its ligand, carbachol, the production of [3H]IP3 was increased about 5–6-fold. Cotransfection and activation of the PKG isoforms inhibited the agonist-stimulated IP3 release by 30–40% in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 C). Since COS-7 cells contain multiple PLC-β isoforms (β1, β2, and β3), the observed inhibitory effects may underestimate the effects of PKG on the regulation of receptor-stimulated G-protein-coupled IP3 signaling in the cell. Together, these data suggest that activation of PKG could phosphorylate PLC and inhibit the agonist-induced IP3production in the cell. To examine whether PKG phosphorylates PLC-β3 at the same sites as PKA phosphorylation, we phosphorylated purified PLC-β3 protein with sequential addition of the two kinases (PKA and PKG) in the presence of non-radioactive ATP first and then of [γ-32P]ATP. Initial phosphorylation of PLC-β3 by PKA in the presence of non-radioactive ATP has limited effect on the subsequent phosphorylation of the protein by PKG (Fig.4 A). However, initial phosphorylation of PLC-β3 by PKG in the presence of non-radioactive ATP prevents subsequent phosphorylation of the protein by PKA (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that PKG not only shares one or more phosphorylation"

Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase results in phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Thr-35, converting it into a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1. Here we report that inhibitor-1 is phosphorylated in vitro at Ser-67 by the proline-directed kinases, Cdk1, Cdk5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. By using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies and selective protein kinase inhibitors, Cdk5 was found to be the only kinase that phosphorylates inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 in intact striatal brain tissue. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases-2A and -2B. The state of phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 was dynamically regulated in striatal tissue by glutamate-dependent regulation ofN-methyl-d-aspartic acid-type channels. Phosphorylation of Ser-67 did not convert inhibitor-1 into an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1. However, inhibitor-1 phosphorylated at Ser-67 was a less efficient substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

The NH2-terminal residues 9–50 of inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 display 60% identity (31Williams K.R. Hemmings Jr., H.C. LoPresti M.B. Konigsberg W.H. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Greengard P. Tung H.Y.L. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The activity of DARPP-32 is regulated through phosphorylation at other sites. Phosphorylation of Ser-102 by casein kinase 2 and Ser-137 by casein kinase 1 potentiates PKA phosphorylation and attenuates PP-2B dephosphorylation of Thr-34, respectively (32Greengard P. Allen P.B.

Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Thr-75 prevents DARPP-32 from serving as a PKA substrate and converts DARPP-32 into a competitive inhibitor of PKA (35Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.-H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. Huganir R.L. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nature. 1999; 402: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Following residue 50, very little primary sequence homology exists between inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32, and inhibitor-1 does not contain phosphorylation sites homologous to those found in DARPP-32 other than Thr-35. Therefore, it seemed possible that the activity of inhibitor-1 is differentially regulated by phosphorylation of other putative sites.In this report we show that inhibitor-1 is phosphorylated on Ser-67 by MAP kinase and by two members of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family in vitro but serves as a substrate only for Cdk5 in striatal neurons. We demonstrate that this site of phosphorylation is predominantly dephosphorylated by PP-2A and PP-2B. Kinetic analyses indicate that phosphorylation at Ser-67 reduces the ability of inhibitor-1 to serve as a substrate for PKA but has no effect on PP-1 inhibition.DISCUSSIONWe report here that protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 is efficiently phosphorylated at Ser-67 by three different proline-directed kinasesin vitro, Cdk1, Cdk5, and MAP kinase. The apparentKm values for these phosphorylation reactions were similar to the concentration of inhibitor-1 estimated to occur in striatal medium spiny neurons (29Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C.

Treatment of striatal slices with selective protein kinase inhibitors indicated that Cdk5 phosphorylates Ser-67 inhibitor-1 in the striatum but that MAP kinase does not. These studies using striatal slices were consistent with our biochemical results and indicate that Cdk5 is the predominant kinase responsible for phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 in intact striatal tissue.

Cdk5 may also play a role in muscle development (61Lazaro J.B. Kitzmann M. Poul M.A. Vandromme M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A substantial level of basal phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 was also detected in adult rat hippocampus, and in skeletal muscle and kidney tissue. 3J. Bibb, unpublished results. These observations suggest that Cdk1 and/or MAP kinase could also be responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser-67 in peripheral tissue.Phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 was found to be a substrate for protein phosphatases PP-2A and PP-2B in vitro. In other in vitro protein phosphatase assays using purified protein phosphatase catalytic subunits and standard substrates as controls, PP-2B was found to be more efficient than PP-2A and PP-2C at dephosphorylating phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1. PP-1 could not dephosphorylate phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 at all (data not shown). Both phospho-Thr-35 of inhibitor-1 and phospho-Thr-34 of DARPP-32 have been shown to be very efficient substrates for PP-2B (62King M.M. Huang C.Y. Chock P.B. Nairn A.C. Hemmings Jr., H.C.

Treatment of slices with NMDA, which activates PP-2B by increasing intracellular Ca2+, caused an almost complete loss of phospho-Ser-67 levels. Conversely, cyclosporin A, a PP-2B inhibitor, increased phospho-Ser-67 levels. Basal phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 levels were increased in striatal slices from PP-2Bα−/−mice. The residual effects of NMDA on Ser-67 in PP-2Bα−/− may be attributed to the activity of the β-isoform of PP-2B (56Zhang B.W. Zimmer G. Chen J. Ladd D. Li E. Alt F.W. Wiederrecht G. Cryan J. O'Neill E.A. Seidman C.E. Abbas A.K. Seidman J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, a variety of data suggest that both PP-2A and PP-2B may dephosphorylate phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 under basal conditions, but PP-2B may function as the predominant phosphatase in the presence of elevated Ca2+ levels.Phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 by Cdk5 had no effect on PP-1 inhibitory activity. These results are also in complete agreement with numerous previous reports that used inhibitor-1 purified from rabbit muscle. It has been demonstrated that inhibitor-1, as well as its homolog, DARPP-32, only become potent inhibitors of PP-1 after phosphorylation by PKA and that the Thr-35 nonphosphorylated form of inhibitor-1 is devoid of PP-1 inhibitory activity (1Huang F.L.

In early studies, inhibitor-1 isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle was found, by direct amino acid sequence analysis, to be phosphorylated at Ser-67 with a stoichiometry of 0.5–0.7 mol/mol (50Aitken A. Bilham T. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). That preparation was found to inhibit PP-1 with a Ki of 1.6 nm only when phosphorylated at Thr-35 by PKA. Without phosphorylation by PKA, the endogenous protein could not inhibit PP-1 at detectable levels even at a concentration 1,000-fold above theKi. Peptide fragments lacking the sequence surrounding phospho-Ser-67 were fully active when phosphorylated by PKA, and a phosphopeptide containing residues 61–71 was inactive (5Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 522-5228Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar,6Aitken A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All these findings are in contradiction to a recent report by Huang and Paudel (65Huang K.-X. Paudel H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5824-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that suggested that phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 converted it into a potent inhibitor of recombinant PP-1 purified from bacteria.The present studies are also completely consistent with extensive studies that have established that PP-1 is inhibited by a common conserved region at the NH2 terminus of inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 (5Endo S.

In addition to the region surrounding the phosphorylated Thr-35 residue (Thr-34 in DARPP-32), which interacts with the active site of PP-1, a short docking motif (RKIXF, residues 8–12) in the two proteins is required for potent inhibition and interacts with a defined region that is removed from the active site on PP-1 (5Endo S.

The stoichiometry of phosphorylation in striatal tissue under basal conditions was determined to be 0.34 mol/mol, allowing an estimate of the concentration of phospho-Ser-67 in the striatum of about 1.7 μm. By increasing theKm for PKA phosphorylation from 1.7 to 9.5 μm, phospho-Ser-67 may serve as a fine control mechanism for regulating the degree to which the effects of PKA activation are amplified. Recently, additional PP-1 inhibitor proteins have been identified, some of which demonstrate selective inhibitory activity only when PP-1 occurs in association with other regulatory factors (68Eto M.

Similarly, phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 may serve a regulatory function only in the context of a protein complex. Phospho-Ser-67 inhibitor-1 could also facilitate subcellular localization or be involved in the regulation of some unknown function of inhibitor-1. It will also be interesting to see if phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser-67 is involved in the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity in the brain and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues. Control of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation occurs through regulation of protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities and is an integral component of intracellular signal transduction. Inhibitor-1 was the first endogenous molecule found to regulate protein phosphatase activity (1Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 1976: 419-426Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar).

Thus, it has become clear that multiple pathways are involved in PDT-mediated apoptosis. This offers exciting opportunities to take advantage of these pathways in improving PDT treatment protocol. The understanding of the mechanism(s) of triggering event(s) of PDT-mediated apoptosis is far from complete. Mitochondrial damage has been suggested as an early event in PDT-mediated apoptosis, which could result in the release of apoptotic factors like cytochromec, which in turn, activates the downstream targets in the apoptotic pathway (21Kessel D. Luo Y. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1998; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Members of Bcl-2 family of proteins are critical regulators of the apoptotic pathway. Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family inhibits the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria whereas Bax and Bid proteins, pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family has been shown to release cytochromec from the mitochondria thereby enhancing apoptotic response (22Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 23Reed J.C. Curr. Opin.

In the present study, employing two cell lines differing in their response to Pc 4-PDT-induced apoptosis and antisense treatment and overexpression approaches we show that Bcl-2 plays an important role in PDT-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, the ratio of Bax (pro-apoptotic) and Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic) proteins appears to determine the response to PDT-induced apoptosis. Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF 1) and human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and kept in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 in a 37 °C humidified incubator. In all experiments, 70–80% confluent cells were used. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against the coding region of Bcl-2 protein were custom-synthesized from Operon Biotechnologies Inc. (Alameda, CA). Phosphorothiote-modified 20-mer antisense (ATTCCTCCCCCAGTTCACCC) and scrambled mismatched control oligo (CTCATTCCTACCGACACCCC) were used in this study. Oligonucleotides were diluted with HEPES-buffered saline to a final concentration of 5.0 μg/ml or unless otherwise mentioned. Lipofectin reagent (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was mixed with diluted DNA (at a concentration of 10 μg/ml/μg of DNA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. This mixture was further diluted in 5 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium and added to cells in 100-mm plates followed by incubation at 37 °C for 12 h. The A431 cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector (pSFFV/neo) containing anEcoRI fragment of human Bcl-2 cDNA. The cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells in 100-mm plates and were allowed to attach overnight. On the following day, cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of vector using Lipofectin transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma Chemical Co.). The transfectants were selected on neomycin-containing media and were allowed to grow on the selection media for 48 h and then subjected to PDT as described below. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and were treated with Pc 4 (0.5 μm in complete media) overnight in 100-mm disposable culture plates. Next morning, the cells were washed with HBSS, irradiated with 15 kJ/m2 light, as measured by a digital photometer (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR), using a 300-watt halogen lamp. The light was filtered through a Lee primary red filter (no. 106, Vincent Lighting, Cleveland, OH) to remove light with wavelengths of <600 nm. Following irradiation, the cells were incubated in darkness for selected time in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Appropriate controls, as specified at appropriate places, were also included. After the specified times, the medium was aspirated, the cells were washed with cold PBS (10 mm, pH 7.4), and processed as desired. Following the treatments, cells were washed with PBS (10 mm, pH 7.4) and incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 100 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. The plates were scrapped, and cell lysates were collected in a centrifuge tube and passed through a 21-gauge needle to break the cell aggregates. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants (total cell lysate) were collected and stored at −80 °C. The protein of cell lysate was determined by DC Bio-Rad assay using manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). 50–100 μg of protein was resolved over SDS/12% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 1% Tween-20; in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with appropriate monoclonal or polyclonal primary antibody (Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xs, Bcl-xL and Bak from Oncogene Research Products Cambridge, MA; PARP and DNA fragmentation factor from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; Bad from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA; Bid from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in blocking buffer for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected by chemiluminescence and autoradiography using ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Piscataway, NJ). After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and suspended in cytoplasm extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl/5 mm MgCl2/0.5% Triton-X), left over ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was incubated with RNase H (0.2 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and then with Proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h. DNA was extracted by treatment of the supernatant with phenol:chloroform (1:1) and then precipitated with 95% ethanol for 2 h at −80 °C. The DNA precipitate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The DNA pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 40 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0/1 mm EDTA). Total DNA was resolved on 1.5% agarose gel, containing 0.3 μg of ethidium bromide in Tris borate EDTA (1× TBE). Bands were visualized under a UV transilluminator followed by Polaroid photography. The quantification of apoptosis was performed using an APODIRECT flow cytometry kit (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Caspase activity was measured by DEVDase assay. In brief, the cell lysates were collected at different time points and protein was estimated. Then, 50 μg of protein was mixed with the substrate solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. At the end of the incubation time, 940 μl water was added to the tubes and placed on ice. Samples were analyzed for AFC florescence spectrofluorometrically using 460-nm excitation and 505-nm emission wavelengths. The cytotoxic effect of antisense oligonucleotide was assessed by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105cells/well in a 96-well microtiter plate and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were grown to 70% confluency and then treated with different concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide (1–5 μg of DNA) overnight. Scrambled oligonucleotide was used as positive control. Next day, the media containing DNA was aspirated and washed with HBSS and then subjected to Pc 4-PDT. Cells were incubated for 6 h in complete media and then the incubation media was aspirated the cells were incubated with 50 μl of MTT (1.0 mg/ml) reagent at 37 °C for 6 h. MTT reagent was aspirated and washed with PBS, 150 μl of Me2SO was added, and the mixture was placed on a shaker for 10 min. Optical density was read at 540 nm in ELISA plate reader, and the data was expressed as percent viable cells. Each assay was performed in triplicate. The level of Bcl-2 was estimated by a Bcl-2 ELISA kit obtained from Endogen Inc. (Woburn, MA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The radiation-induced fibrosarcoma cells (RIF 1) are resistant to photodynamic therapy (PDT)-mediated apoptosis (12Gupta S. Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1785-1788PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether treatment of antisense oligonucleotide, directed against the coding region of Bcl-2 protein, induces cell death in RIF 1 cells following PDT, we treated the cells with different concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of cells in a concentration-dependent manner as compared with cells treated with scrambled nucleotide. Cells treated with scrambled control oligonucleotide did not show any significant reduction in the cell survival. Because our data showed that the antisense oligonucleotide treatment resulted in oligonucleotide concentration-dependent decrease in cell survival in RIF 1 cells, we investigated whether this decreased cell survival is due to apoptosis. As shown by DNA ladder assay (Fig. 1 B), treatment of PDT apoptosis-resistant RIF 1 cells with antisense Bcl-2 oligonucleotide resulted in a significant induction of apoptosis, 6 h following PDT. Next, we quantified the extent of apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis of the cells labeled with dUTP and propidium iodide. The PDT of the RIF 1 cells treated with antisense resulted in 39.2% TUNEL-positive cells at 6 h post-PDT compared with only 3.0% TUNEL-positive cells for similarly treated cells without antisense. Consistent with our previous observation, the untreated control cells or cells treated with light alone or Pc 4 alone did not result in any appreciable apoptosis (Fig. 1 C). These data clearly establish that the effects are photodynamic treatment-mediated. Caspase activation is an important event in the apoptotic pathway and can be used as a marker of apoptosis. Therefore, to further substantiate our findings, we measured the effect of antisense treatment on PDT-mediated apoptosis by caspase activity assay (DEVDase assay). As shown by the data in Fig. 1 D, the antisense treatment was found to result in enhanced caspase activity following PDT as compared with the cells treated with PDT alone. The increase in caspase activity was maximum at 3 h post-PDT and was found to declined at 6 h post-PDT. Activation of apoptotic pathway leads to a cleavage of poly(A)DP ribose polymerase (PARP) that is involved in DNA repair and is extensively used as a marker of apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of antisense oligonucleotide on PDT-mediated modulation in PARP. As shown in Fig. 1 E, the antisense treatment resulted in a significant PARP cleavage at 6 h post-PDT. To assess the effect of antisense Bcl-2 oligonucleotide on the protein expression of Bcl-2, we performed immunoblot analysis. As shown by Fig.2 A, the immunoblot analysis revealed a down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein in RIF 1 cells treated with antisense oligonucleotide followed by PDT whereas the level of Bcl-2 remains unaltered in cells without antisense treatment. Treatment of cells with scrambled control oligonucleotide showed no effect on the Bcl-2 level in RIF 1 cells after PDT (data not shown). The densitometric analysis showed almost 2-fold decrease in the protein expression of Bcl-2 in cells treated with antisense followed by PDT (Fig. 2 B). This observation suggested that constitutively high levels of Bcl-2 might be a reason for the known PDT apoptosis-resistant property of RIF 1 cells. To further establish the role of Bcl-2 in PDT-mediated apoptosis, we assessed the level of Bcl-2 by ELISA and compared it with the extent of apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL assay, in the cells treated with antisense followed by PDT. The estimation of Bcl-2 by ELISA demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in the level of Bcl-2 with a concomitant increase in the extent of apoptosis, as evident from flow cytometric determination of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, our data demonstrated that the decrease in Bcl-2 levels is correlated with the increased the sensitivity of RIF 1 cells toward PDT apoptosis, following antisense oligonucleotide treatment (Fig. 3 A). We also assessed the effect of antisense oligonucleotide treatment on PDT-mediated modulation in the relative ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 proteins by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 B). The antisense oligonucleotide treatment of RIF 1 cells followed by PDT resulted in a down-modulation of Bcl-2 protein whereas the levels of Bax protein remained unaltered (Fig. 3 B). However, the densitometric analysis showed that with the increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio there is increase in the apoptotic response (Fig. 3 C). Human epidermoid carcinoma cells are sensitive to PDT-mediated apoptosis (10Ahmad N. Feyes D.K. Agarwal R. Mukhtar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6977-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in evaluating the effect of Bcl-2 during PDT-mediated apoptosis in these cells. We assessed the levels of Bcl-2 protein following PDT in these cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PDT of these cells resulted in a significant time-dependent down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein. The data in RIF 1 cells suggested that the down-regulation of Bcl-2 induces apoptosis in PDT apoptosis-resistant cells. In another approach, to investigate the role of Bcl-2 in PDT-mediated apoptosis, we overexpressed the Bcl-2 protein in the A431 cells. In these Bcl-2-transfected A431 cells, as expected, the Bcl-2 protein was overexpressed (Fig. 4 B) and PDT resulted in a down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein levels (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, as shown by TUNEL assay (Fig.5 A), the Bcl-2 overexpression resulted in an increase in apoptosis by PDT as compared with normal wild type A431 cells. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of Bcl-2 on caspase activity, we performed DEVDase assay in both wild type and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. As shown by data in Fig. 5 B, the overexpression of Bcl-2 was found to enhance the PDT-mediated caspase activity indicative of increased apoptosis. The increase in caspase activity was highest at 3 h post-PDT and declined thereafter. Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. The relative amounts or equilibrium between the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins influences the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis. Therefore, in the next set of experiments, we assessed the effect of PDT on the status of Bax protein in Bcl-2-overexpressing A431 cells. The immunoblot analysis showed that PDT resulted in an increased level of Bax protein in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells as compared with normal A431 cells (Fig. 6 A). The densitometric analysis demonstrated that Bcl-2-overexpressing cells have high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig. 6 B). The Bcl-2 family of proteins consists of apoptosis regulators with both anti- and pro-apoptotic effect. The anti-apoptotic group includes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, whereas the pro-apoptotic group includes Bax, Bad, Bid, Bik, Bak, and Bcl-xS. Therefore, we assessed the effect of PDT on these family members in both the systems, viz. RIF 1 cells (without and with antisense Bcl-2 oligonucleotide treatment) and A431 cells (wild type and transiently transfected with Bcl-2). As shown by data in Fig. 7, PDT was found to result in an increase in Bcl-xs protein levels in RIF 1 cells subjected to oligonucleotide antisense treatment at all the time points studied, as compared with untreated cells. An increasing trend in the protein levels of Bid was also observed in the cells treated with oligonucleotide. Another pro-apoptotic protein Bak was not affected at early times (1 h and 3 h) following PDT, but its level was found to be elevated at 6 h following PDT. On the other hand, the protein expression of Bad was found to be up-regulated at all the time points following PDT (Fig. 7). The interesting observation of this experiment, however, was the observed increasing trend in the protein expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in cells treated with oligonucleotide, compared with the cells without oligonucleotide treatment (Fig. 7). We also assessed the effect of PDT on modulations in other Bcl-2 family members in A431 cells overexpressing Bcl-2. As shown by data in Fig. 7, in Bcl-2-overexpressing A431 cells, PDT was found to result in a significant increase in the levels of Bcl-xS at 1 h post-PDT and was found to diminish at later time points. The level of Bid was not found to be significantly affected following PDT. PDT was also found to result in significant up-regulation of Bak (at 1 h) and Bad (at 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h post-PDT) in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig. 7). PDT, a new treatment modality for many cancer types and for certain non-malignant diseases, has been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro during tumor cell killing andin vivo during tumor ablation. Understanding of the mechanisms involved in PDT-mediated apoptosis is far from complete. This study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that the Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a critical role in PDT-mediated apoptosis. TheBcl-2gene, initially recognized as a proto-oncogene in human follicular B-cell lymphoma, is the prototype of a novel class of oncogenes that contribute to neoplastic progression by enhancing tumor cell survival through inhibition of apoptotic cell death (22Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar,23Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The product of Bcl-2 is known to play a role in promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis following variety of stimuli, including γ-radiation, glucocorticoid, hypothermia, growth factor withdrawal, and chemotherapeutic agents (23Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 29Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 30Nunez G. London L. Hockenbery D. Alexander M. McKearn J.P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3602-3610PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated the role of Bcl-2 protein in PDT-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells. For this reason, we employed two independent unique approaches. First, we used radiation-induced fibrosarcoma cells (RIF 1), which are resistant to PDT-mediated apoptosis under the conditions employed in this study. As assessed by multiple methods, the treatment of RIF 1 cells with antisense oligonucleotides directed against the coding region of Bcl-2 protein was found to sensitize these PDT apoptosis-resistant cells to PDT apoptosis. Because Pc 4 alone, light alone, or scrambled nucleotide alone had no effect on apoptotic response, the observed effects are photodynamic treatment-mediated. Bcl-2 is an upstream effector molecule in the apoptotic pathway and is identified as a potent suppressor of apoptosis. Bcl-2 is found at inappropriately high levels in more than half of all human tumors (23Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms are proposed for the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 might act as a regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis (31Murphy A.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 893: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or as an antioxidants (32Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 has been show to form a heterodimer with the pro-apoptotic member Bax and might thereby neutralize its pro-apoptotic effects (33Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 34Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 is also known to prevent the release of potent mitochondrial activators of the cytosolic death effector proteases, the caspase family, which mediates the intracellular proteolysis characteristics of apoptosis (35Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The antisense treatment of RIF 1 cells followed by PDT resulted in down-regulation of Bcl-2 in RIF 1 cells, which might initiate the apoptotic pathway sensitizing the RIF 1 cells to PDT-mediated apoptosis. Caspases are known to cleave many proteins, including the inhibitor of nuclear DNase, the DNA fragmentation factor, the ICAD, the DNA repair enzyme poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and DNA-dependent protein kinase subunit and structural proteins such as α-fodrin. These proteins are required by cells for protection against apoptosis (36Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6180) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate high caspase activity and cleavage of PARP with antisense treatment of RIF 1 cells followed by PDT. Our study also showed unaltered levels of Bax (a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family) with the antisense treatment. Antisense treatment resulted in decreased levels of Bcl-2 protein in RIF 1 cells, thus shifting the ratio in favor of Bax protein that initiates the apoptotic pathway sensitizing the RIF 1 cells to PDT-mediated apoptosis. To further substantiate our findings, in the second approach, we overexpressed Bcl-2 in A431, which readily undergoes apoptosis with PDT (10Ahmad N. Feyes D.K. Agarwal R. Mukhtar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6977-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed a decrease in Bcl-2 levels following PDT in a time-dependent manner in A431 cells. Interestingly, the overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in an increased apoptotic response in A431 cells compared with their normal wild type cells as evident by TUNEL assay and caspase activity assay. Immunoblot analysis revealed the high level of Bax (a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family) in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Earlier reports have suggested that the overexpression of Bcl-2 may stabilize Bax protein (28Kim H.R. Luo Y. Li G. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, may promote apoptosis by triggering the pore-forming activity in the mitochondrial membrane (38Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) and can promote release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (35Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that caspases mediated conversion of Bcl-2 in a Bax-like molecule can also increase the apoptotic response (39Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 40Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). High Bax level (stabilization effects of Bcl-2) shifting the ratio between Bax/Bcl-2 toward Bax, and high caspase activity may be responsible for the enhanced PDT-mediated apoptotic response in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Earlier reports have revealed a dual identity for Bcl-2 protein in PDT-mediated cell death. The first report on PDT-mediated apoptosis (8Agarwal M.L. Larkin H.E. Zaidi S.I. Mukhtar H. Oleinick N.L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5897-5902PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that mitochondrial damage could result in degradation of Bcl-2 and related proteins that normally function as apoptotic suppressors. He et al. (25He J. Agarwal M.L. Larkin H.E. Friedman L.R. Xue L.Y. Oleinick N.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported that Bcl-2 transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to partial resistance to PDT-mediated apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, Granvilleet al. (26Granville D.J. Jiang H. An M.T. Levy J.G. McManus B.M. Hunt D.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have reported that overexpression of Bcl-2 protein blocks the activation of caspases and downstream events instigated by PDT. Meanwhile using antisense retroviral vector-mediated reduction of Bcl-2, Zhang et al. (27Zhang W.G. Ma L.P. Wang S.W. Zhang Z.Y. Cao G.D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 69: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown increased phototoxicity and sensitivity to apoptosis induced by 2-BA-2-DMHA PDT in human gastric adenocarcinoma, further supporting the role of Bcl-2 in PDT-mediated apoptosis. However, in a recent report Kim et al. (28Kim H.R. Luo Y. Li G. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar) have reported contradictory findings. In this study, the overexpression of Bcl-2 in a human breast cell line resulted in enhanced apoptosis by PDT. Based on our findings, the controversy regarding the role of Bcl-2 protein in PDT-mediated apoptosis can be put in proper context. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 with antisense oligonucleotide resulted in sensitization of PDT apoptosis-resistant cells to apoptosis; however, the overexpression of Bcl-2 in a PDT apoptosis-sensitive cell line further enhances the response. This study clearly suggested that the shift in the ratio of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) in favor of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) is an important factor in determining the response toward PDT. Our data also demonstrated that PDT results in modulation of other Bcl-2 family members in a way that the overall ratio of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic member proteins remains in favor of pro-apoptotic proteins. We found that PDT of RIF 1 cells (treated with Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide) caused an up-regulation of Bcl-xs, Bid, Bak, and Bad, the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. The up-regulation of these pro-apoptotic proteins by PDT in RIF 1 cells (treated with Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide) was found to be an early response for Bcl-xs and Bad (occurring as early as 1 h post-PDT), whereas it was a late response for Bak (occurring at 6 h post-PDT). An interesting observation of this experiment was the observed increasing trend in the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL as a result of PDT in RIF 1 cells treated with Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide. It is likely that, despite this increasing trend in the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein, the high levels of pro-apoptotic members were able to overcome its anti-apoptotic activity that ultimately results in apoptotic death of RIF 1 cells following PDT. Like RIF 1 cells treated with Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide, we also found that PDT of Bcl-2-overexpressing A431 cells caused an up-regulation of protein expression in pro-apoptotic members,viz. Bcl-xs, Bak, and Bad, but not of Bid. The protein expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was found to decrease as a result of PDT in these cells. Thus, it seems that in these cells PDT results in a general up-regulation in the protein expression of the pro-apoptotic members while down-modulating the anti-apoptotic proteins, shifting the balance in favor of apoptosis. Another interesting observation was the decreased protein expression of some of the molecules studied as a result of antisense or overexpression treatments. The reason for this decrease is not clear at present, however, it is clear that alterations of Bcl-2 levels in our experimental setup modulates many Bcl-2 family members. This interesting observation could also be explained by the fact that the members of Bcl-2 family proteins have the ability to form hetero- or homodimers (41Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). In fact, when the apoptotic pathway is activated or altered, these proteins either form homodimers or heterodimers or undergo post-translational modifications. For example, upon activation of the apoptotic pathway, Bid protein undergoes cleavage and the cleaved fragment moves to the mitochondrial membrane and/or form heterodimers with either Bax or Bcl-2, resulting in apoptotic cell death (42Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 43Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Similar behavior has been reported for Bax (44Gao G. Dou Q.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 53-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, because the Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment causes an activation of apoptotic pathway in RIF 1 cells, the levels of these proteins are decreased as compared with the control, which have high levels of these proteins possibly because of the absence of apoptotic signal. We plan to direct our future efforts to investigate these queries in detail. Extensive experimental evidences suggest that antisense Bcl-2 oligonucleotides induce apoptotic cell death in various types of malignant cell lines in vitro, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, small cell lung carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. Furthermore, combined use of antisense Bcl-2 oligonucleotide with chemotherapeutic agents resulted in additive inhibition of small cell lung cancer cells in vitro and melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo (45Miayake H. Tolcher A. Gleave M.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Bcl-2 plays an important role in PDT-mediated apoptosis and the shift of balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family in favor of pro-apoptotic proteins decides the susceptibility of cells to PDT-mediated apoptosis."

To elucidate this signaling mechanism, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of AChR-associated proteins, particularly addressing whether agrin activates Src family kinases bound to the AChR. In C2 myotubes, agrin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these kinases, of AChR-bound MuSK, and of the AChR β and δ subunits, as observed in phosphotyrosine immunoblotting experiments. Kinase assays revealed that the activity of AChR-associated Src kinases was increased by agrin, whereas phosphorylation of the total cellular kinase pool was unaffected. In both rapsyn-deficient myotubes and staurosporine-treated C2 myotubes, where AChRs are not clustered, agrin activated MuSK but did not cause either Src family or AChR phosphorylation. In S27 mutant myotubes, which fail to aggregate AChRs, no agrin-induced phosphorylation of AChR-bound Src kinases, MuSK, or AChRs was observed. These results demonstrate first that agrin leads to phosphorylation and activation of AChR-associated Src-related kinases, which requires rapsyn, occurs downstream of MuSK, and causes AChR phosphorylation. Second, this activation intimately correlates with AChR clustering, suggesting that these kinases may play a role in agrin-induced AChR aggregation by forming an AChR-bound signaling cascade. During neuromuscular synaptogenesis, neurally released agrin induces aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) by acting through both the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) and the AChR-associated protein, rapsyn.

Second, this activation intimately correlates with AChR clustering, suggesting that these kinases may play a role in agrin-induced AChR aggregation by forming an AChR-bound signaling cascade. A common feature of most synapses is the local accumulation of proteins regulating synaptic responses in the postsynaptic membrane. At the neuromuscular junction, a model system for synaptogenesis, aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs)1 is an early sign of postsynaptic differentiation during development and occurs at sites of nerve-muscle contact (1Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Clusters of AChRs and further synaptic components are induced by neurally released agrin, an essential factor for synaptogenesis (3McMahan U.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mice deficient for agrin lack differentiated synapses and nerve-associated clusters of postsynaptic proteins (4Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Neurons or recombinant agrin induce aggregation of AChRs and other muscle components when added to cultured myotubes (5Wallace B.G. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a process that mimics events at developing endplates, as it is blocked by antibodies specific for nerve-released agrin (7Reist N.E. Werle M.J. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Little is known about the signaling pathway of agrin, although a muscle-specific kinase, MuSK, is part of the agrin receptor (8Jennings C.G. Dyer S.M. Burden S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2895-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and proteoglycans are thought to play an accessory role in presenting agrin to its receptor (10Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Agrin causes tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK, and this kinase is essential for postsynaptic specialization, as shown in MuSK-deficient mice, in which the phenotype is similar to agrin−/− animals (11DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueymirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Park J.S. Smith C. DiStefano P.S. Glass D.J. Burden S.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Furthermore, myotubes lacking MuSK fail to respond to agrin (9Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D.

Agrin also causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit of the AChR, which may play a role in AChR clustering because, among other observations, the kinase inhibitors herbimycin and staurosporine block both AChR β phosphorylation and AChR clustering (12Ferns M. Deiner M. Hall Z. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, mutant AChRs, lacking cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in their β subunits, can still be recruited into clusters upon expression in myotubes, which also express wild-type AChRs (14Meyer G. Wallace B.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that AChR tyrosine phosphorylation is accompanied by a change in receptor desensitization by cholinergic ligands (15Hopfield J.F. Tank D.W. Greengard P. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1988; 336: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One protein involved in agrin signaling downstream of MuSK is rapsyn, a 43-kDa protein closely associated with AChRs (16Burden S.J. DePalma R.L. Gottesman G.S. Cell. 1983; 35: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17LaRochelle W.J. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5270-5274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapsyn−/− mice lack aggregates of AChRs and other postsynaptic proteins, and their cultured myotubes fail to form agrin-induced AChR clusters, illustrating the importance of rapsyn for postsynaptic organization (18Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rapsyn causes aggregation of AChRs upon expression in fibroblasts and is necessary for agrin-induced AChR β phosphorylation in myotubes (19Phillips W.D. Kopta C. Blount P. Gardner P.D. Steinbach J.H. Merlie J.P. Science. 1991; 251: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). MuSK, however, is still activated by agrin and localized at mutant endplates of rapsyn-deficient animals, suggesting that MuSK forms a primary synaptic scaffold to which rapsyn recruits AChRs and further components of the postsynaptic apparatus (20Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The individual steps of this postsynaptic assembly, in particular, the agrin signaling events downstream of MuSK, still remain largely unknown. Myotubes contain preassembled AChR protein complexes in which, independently of agrin, AChRs are associated with several muscle proteins, including rapsyn, MuSK, and Src-related kinases (21Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agrin selectively increases, in a rapsyn-dependent way, the association between AChRs and MuSK, suggesting that agrin causes a link of these preassembled AChR protein complexes with the MuSK primary synaptic scaffold, thereby driving postsynaptic assembly. Proteins that bind to MuSK or the AChR are likely to regulate this mechanism. Activated MuSK contains several phosphorylated tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail, which may act as docking sites for signal transducing molecules (22Watty A. Neubauer G. Dreger M. Zimmer M. Wilm M. Burden S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4585-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One of these residues, a juxtamembrane tyrosine within an NPXY consensus, is indeed required for agrin-induced AChR phosphorylation and clustering, suggesting the involvement of a PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain adaptor protein (23Zhou H. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Herbst R. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Another critical step in agrin's signaling pathway are calcium fluxes, as the fast chelator, BAPTA-AM, inhibits agrin-induced AChR clustering (25Megeath L.J. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 672-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of this calcium-dependent step is unknown. Moreover, several observations indicate the existence of a critical kinase downstream of MuSK. Thus, staurosporine does not affect agrin-induced activation of MuSK but inhibits AChR β phosphorylation and AChR clustering, strongly suggesting that a staurosporine-sensitive intermediate kinase downstream of MuSK causes AChR phosphorylation and aggregation (26Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such a kinase(s) may be one or several members of the Src family, because Fyn and Fyk associate with AChRs in theTorpedo electric organ (27Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Src (c-Src) and Fyn are bound to AChRs in mammalian muscle (28Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Src can phosphorylate AChR β subunit fusion proteins (28Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and Src members are regulated by rapsyn when expressed in fibroblasts, causing AChR phosphorylation in this heterologous system (29Mohamed A.S. Swope S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20529-29539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In several signaling pathways, the functional roles of Src kinases are indicated by an increase in their kinase activities following extracellular stimulation (30Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Similarly to muscle, Src family kinases associate with ionotropic neurotransmittor receptors in the central nervous system, e.g. Src with NMDA receptors and Lyn with AMPA receptors (31Hayashi T. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1999; 397: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The associated kinases regulate receptor channel properties and form receptor-bound signaling cascades, as shown for Lyn, which is activated by AMPA stimulation of cerebellar neurons, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and possibly synaptic plasticity (31Hayashi T. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1999; 397: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the role of the Src family in postsynaptic differentiation in muscle and in agrin-induced signaling events downstream of MuSK, we examined the effect of agrin on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with the AChR, in particular the Src family members. We demonstrate that agrin causes activation and phosphorylation of AChR-bound Src class kinases, which requires rapsyn and correlates with AChR phosphorylation and aggregation. Src-related kinases thus cause AChR phosphorylation induced by agrin and may play a role in AChR clustering, suggesting that the Src family not only regulates ionotropic receptors channel properties but also contributes to the synaptic localization of these receptors. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. C2 (C2C12) and S27 mouse muscle cells were maintained at 37 °C in 8% CO2 and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/literd-glucose containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% chick embryo extract, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. After reaching 90–100% confluence, cells were shifted to fusion medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine and fed daily. C2 myotubes were used for experiments after 2 days in this medium, while S27 cells were used after 2–3 days, by which time myotubes similar to C2 had formed. We noticed that the morphology of the S27 myotubes varied between different experiments, in that myotubes were occasionally wider than in C2 (see Fig. 8, S27 cells treated with 50 nm agrin). Furthermore, the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes was less efficient in the case of S27, such that most cultures had more unfused cells than C2. Nevertheless, these morphological variations did not affect the outcome of our experiments, because agrin-induced clustering of AChRs and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, as well as phosphorylation of MuSK and AChR-bound Src family kinases, were consistently absent in S27 cells irrespective of their morphology. Rapsyn−/− and the corresponding wild-type myoblasts were grown at 33 °C, 5% CO2 in the same medium as C2 cells with an additional 4 units/ml γ-interferon, as described previously (21Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were fed with C2 fusion medium every second day and used for experiments after 3–4 days. To detect AChR-associated phosphotyrosine proteins by immunoblotting, we used a mixture of two commercially available mouse monoclonal antibodies, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The mouse monoclonal antiserum 88B, reactive with the AChR γ and δ subunits, was provided by Dr. S. C. Froehner (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Rat monoclonal antibodies 124 against the AChR β subunit were a gift from Dr. J. Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). To detect Src-related kinases, we used src-CT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of Src (c-Src), which is highly conserved in several Src-related kinases. Src-CT reacts with Src, Fyn, Yes (28Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and possibly further kinases of the Src family. Fyn was detected by a rabbit polyclonal Fyn-specific antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antiserum against MuSK was as described previously (26Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To express soluble C-terminal agrin forms, COS cells were grown at 37 °C in 8% CO2 using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with neural (4,8) or muscle (0,0) agrin expression vectors (C-Ag12,4,8 and C-Ag12,0,0, respectively), and the medium, containing soluble agrin, was collected for 3 days as described previously (26Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Myotubes were lysed in a mild extraction buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and an abundance of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and AChRs were precipitated with α-bungarotoxin (α-BT) coupled to Sepharose beads (α-BT-Sepharose beads) as described previously (21Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, AChRs were isolated using 200 nm soluble biotin-conjugated α-BT followed by streptavidin-coupled agarose beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which gave identical results. As controls, an excess (10 μm) of free α-BT was added, or unconjugated Sepharose was used. To immunoprecipitate Src members representing the total cellular Src family pool, myotube extracts were incubated with 1 μg of src-CT antibodies followed by protein A-Sepharose. Cellular MuSK was isolated accordingly using polyclonal anti-MuSK antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. To identify the 60-kDa AChR-associated phosphoprotein, AChR protein complexes were precipitated as described above. Complexes were dissociated by an incubation at 80 °C for 10 min in dissociation buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 3 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm phenylarsine oxide, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After harsh vortexing and centrifugation, the proteins released into the supernatant were reprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) covalently coupled to agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). These precipitates were washed three times with wash buffer (0.4% Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 50 μmphenylarsine oxide, 50 mm NaF) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and src-CT immunoblotting. The kinase activity of AChR-associated Src family kinases was assayed by incubating α-BT-Sepharose-precipitated AChR complexes for 10 min at 25 °C under phosphorylating conditions (kinase assay buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were stopped by the addition of kinase wash buffer on ice (10 mmTris, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and beads were washed twice in this buffer. Complexes were dissociated by an incubation for 10 min at 80 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Src class kinases were precipitated from supernatants using src-CT antibodies and protein A-Sepharose followed by washing in dissociation buffer, elution into SDS-PAGE sample buffer, SDS-gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. For both methods, the quantitation of signals on films was performed by scanning with a computerized densitometer (Nikon Scantouch 210) and using the NIH Image J 1.04b software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Background signals, originating from control precipitations including excess of free α-BT, were subtracted from α-BT AChR precipitations. Values from untreated cells were set to 100%, and signals after agrin treatment were calculated accordingly. Statistical evaluation was performed by ANOVA followed by pairwise Bonferroni's t tests. To examine the effects of kinase inhibitors on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins bound to the AChR, C2 myotubes were incubated for 5 to 6 h with 1–20 nmstaurosporine (Sigma), 1 μm herbimycin A (Life Technologies, Inc.), or carrier controls. After stimulation with agrin, cells were extracted and analyzed by α-BT AChR precipitation followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Quantitation of signals was carried out as described previously (26Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To detect proteins in AChR, src-CT, or MuSK precipitations, proteins were eluted into SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with the appropriate antibodies, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing, blots were stripped by incubating them for 20 min in 200 mm glycine, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 2.5. To visualize the distribution of AChRs and phosphotyrosine proteins in C2 and S27 myotubes, cells were grown and fused on chamber slides (Nunc, Life Technologies, Inc.) and treated for 15 h with agrin concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 nm. Cells were incubated with 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) in fusion medium for 1 h at 37 °C followed by fixation in methanol for 7 min at −20 °C and permeabilization (5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Phosphotyrosine proteins were detected by PY20 antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antisera (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, La Roche, Switzerland) in the presence of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were mounted in glycerol containing p-phenylenediamine and examined with a microscope (Axioskop 2, Carl Zeiss) equipped with the appropriate fluorescence filters. Images were processed with a computer-supported cooled 3CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu-City, Japan). In our initial experiments, we analyzed agrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with the AChR by preparing extracts from agrin-treated and untreated C2 myotubes; AChRs were precipitated with α-bungarotoxin (α-BT) covalently coupled to Sepharose beads, or using biotinylated α-BT in combination with streptavidin-agarose, followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. To assess nonspecific protein binding to the beads, free α-BT was added prior to the precipitation, or unconjugated Sepharose was used. Using this procedure allows the specific isolation of AChRs in association with several postsynaptic proteins (21Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We stimulated C2 myotubes for increasing times with either recombinant neural agrin (agrin 4,8) or the predominant agrin isoform of muscle (agrin 0,0), which is much less effective in aggregating AChRs (6Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 33Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W. Horton S.E. Kroger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). α-BT precipitation and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed a consistent pattern of AChR-associated phosphotyrosine bands induced by neural but not muscle agrin (Fig. 1). In addition to AChR-bound MuSK and the AChR β subunit (26Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we detected a band at about 70 kDa. This protein appears to represent the AChR δ subunit, based on the cross-reactivity with δ-specific antibodies in stripping and reprobing experiments (Fig. 1). In addition, an AChR-associated protein of about 60 kDa, i.e. the molecular mass of Src family kinases, consistently became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to neural agrin. Its increase in phosphorylation occurred in parallel with that of AChR-bound MuSK and the AChR β and δ subunits, as it was first detected after a 15 min treatment with 0.1 nm neural agrin and reached a peak after 40 min (Fig. 1). Dephosphorylation of this 60-kDa band strictly paralleled that of the AChR subunits, as all three proteins were still phosphorylated to an intermediate degree after a 15-h treatment with neural agrin. MuSK, however, was no longer phosphorylated after this time. In these assays, agrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events were observed only for proteins associated with the AChR and not when total cellular lysates were analyzed without precipitation (Fig. 1,L lanes). This selectivity indicates local, AChR-bound signaling, which does not involve changes in phosphorylation on the level of a whole myotube. To determine whether this AChR-associated 60-kDa phosphotyrosine protein represents one or several members of the Src family, immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with pan-Src antibodies (src-CT) that recognize Src, Fyn, and Yes in muscle cells (28Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These assays revealed that the protein indeed comigrates precisely with AChR-bound Src members and that the protein amounts of these associated kinases are not affected by agrin (Fig.2 A). We have previously reported that two members of the Src family, Src and Fyn, are associated with AChRs and that they migrate with identical mobility in gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting experiments (28Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Further reprobing studies using Fyn-specific antibodies confirmed that the observed 60-kDa phosphotyrosine band indeed comigrates with AChR-bound Fyn (Fig. 2 B). The amounts of AChR-bound Src and Fyn are unchanged by agrin (26Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a finding similar to the results using src-CT antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, both kinases are associated constitutively with the AChR independently of agrin, and either one or both of them may become phosphorylated strictly in response to agrin. To confirm that the 60-kDa AChR-associated phosphoprotein indeed represents one or several members of the Src family bound to the AChR, we isolated large amounts of AChR protein complexes from agrin-treated and untreated C2 myotubes using α-BT-Sepharose. Complexes were dissociated by an incubation at 80 °C in a buffer containing deoxycholate and SDS. The proteins released were then reprecipitated with phosphotyrosine antibody beads, immunoblotted, and probed with src-CT antibodies. This assay specifically monitors the overall levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Src class kinases bound to the AChR. We indeed found a significant increase in the phosphotyrosine content of these kinases in response to neural agrin (Fig. 3 A). As Src members undergo autophosphorylation when activated, we additionally used kinase assays to examine the effect of neural agrin on phosphate incorporation into and thus activation of AChR-associated Src kinases. To this end, α-BT-precipitated AChR complexes, isolated from agrin-treated or untreated cells, were subjected first to in vitrophosphorylation, using [γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C. The complexes were then dissociated at 80 °C and released Src members immunoprecipitated with src-CT antibodies followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In these assays, neural agrin significantly increased the phosphate incorporation into Src-related kinases by ∼3-fold, indicative of their activation (Fig.3 B). Together, these results show that one or several AChR-associated kinases of the Src family are activated by neural agrin and that the AChR-bound phosphotyrosine band at 60 kDa, as seen on immunoblots, indeed originates, at least in part, from Src members. Interestingly, when Src members were isolated from agrin-treated myotubes by a direct immunoprecipitation with src-CT antibodies, their phosphotyrosine content was unaffected in comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 3 C). Thus, agrin specifically activates those Src-related kinases that are associated with AChRs without affecting the total cellular kinase pool. We asked how activation of AChR-associated Src members correlates with phosphor"

The chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and 1β (MIP-1α and MIP-1β) now have been shown to be secreted from activated human monocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) as a heterodimer. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis revealed that antibodies to either MIP-1α or MIP-1β precipitated a protein complex containing both MIP-1α and MIP-1β under normal conditions from culture supernatants and lysates of these cells. Mass spectrometry of the complexes, precipitated from the culture supernatants of monocytes and PBLs, revealed the presence of NH2-terminal truncated MIP-1α (residues 5–70) together with either intact MIP-1β or NH2-terminal truncated MIP-1β (residues 3–69), respectively. The secreted MIP-1α/β heterodimers were dissociated into their component monomers under acidic conditions. Exposure of monocytes or PBLs to monensin induced the accumulation of heterodimers composed of NH2-terminal truncated MIP-1α and full-length MIP-1β in the Golgi complex. The mixing of recombinant chemokines in vitro demonstrated that heterodimerization of MIP-1α and MIP-1β is specific and that it occurs at physiological conditions, pH 7.4, and in the range of nanomolar concentrations. The data presented here provide the first biochemical evidence for the existence of chemokine heterodimers under natural conditions.

Formation of heterodimers of MIP-1α/β may have an impact on intracellular signaling events that contribute to CCR5 and possibly to other chemokine receptor functions. Chemokines constitute a family of small secreted proteins that were initially characterized on the basis of their chemotactic effects on a variety of leukocytes (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B.

They are produced locally in tissues and interact with selective G protein-coupled receptors expressed on the leukocyte surface. Chemokines also regulate leukocyte maturation, the trafficking and homing of lymphocytes, and the development of lymphoid tissues. Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)1 also targets chemokine receptors during entry into cells, and certain chemokines act as HIV-1 suppressive factors (3Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A.

Despite its large size, the chemokine family is remarkably homogeneous. Chemokines are divided into two subfamilies, α(CXC) and β(CC), on the basis of conserved cysteine residues. Four conserved cysteines form two essential disulfide bonds, Cys1-Cys3 and Cys2-Cys4, in all chemokines. The three-dimensional structures of three α chemokines (interleukin (IL)-8, growth-related oncogene-α, and platelet factor 4) and four β chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) have been determined either by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by x-ray crystallography (6Skelton N.J.

These studies have revealed that chemokines possess a short NH2-terminal domain preceding the first cysteine, a backbone that comprises three antiparallel β strands and a COOH-terminal α-helix. Whereas the backbone exhibits a well ordered structure, the structure of the NH2 terminus is disordered. The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of the chemokine monomers is consistent with the marked sequence homology of these proteins. The quaternary structures of α and β chemokines, however, differ markedly from each other, and the dimer interfaces are formed by distinct sets of residues. Whereas the IL-8 dimer is globular, the homodimers formed by MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES are cylindrical (6Skelton N.J. Aspiras F. Ogez J. Schall T.J.

Calculation of the solvation-free energies of dimerization and analysis of hydrophobic clusters of amino acids suggest that the formation and stabilization of the two different types of dimers result from the burial of hydrophobic residues and that the distinct quaternary structures of α and β chemokine dimers are preserved throughout the two subfamilies. The biological existence and significance of dimeric forms of chemokines, especially that of chemokine heterodimers, have remained unclear. Human T lymphocytes and monocytes release anti-HIV-1 chemokines, predominantly the β chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (3Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 5763-5769PubMed Google Scholar), in response to stimulation with mitogens, cytokines, or bacterial pathogens. We now show that human monocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) stimulated by cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12), or phytohemagglutinin produce a chemokine heterodimer containing MIP-1α and MIP-1β. Recombinant human MIP-1α (full-length), RANTES, MDC, MCP-1, and IP-10 were obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ); recombinant human MIP-1β was from Sigma; and recombinant human (−4)MIP-1α and antigen affinity purified antibodies to chemokines were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human PBLs and monocytes were isolated by elutriation from normal blood donors and cultured as described previously (13Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquez G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5763-5769PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7642-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBLs were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 150 units/ml IL-2 (R&D Systems), and 10 ng/ml IL-12 (kindly provided by Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) or 2 μg/mo PHA (sigma). Monocytes were cultured in macrophage serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates. Cell culture supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with antibodies to anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β, and then for an additional 2 h, they were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100, after which proteins were eluted with 25 mm Tris-glycine, pH 3.0, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions on a 4–20% gradient gel in the presence of Tricine, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then exposed to either anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP1β. Immune complexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G, alkaline phosphatase substrate, and Lumi-Phos TM 530 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Culture supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β. The molecular size of precipitated proteins was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Boston, MA). α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) and recombinant MIP-1α or MIP-1β were used as matrix and internal standards, respectively. For some experiments, cells were cultured in the presence of monensin (GolgiStop, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 10 h. They were then washed and lysed for 1 h on ice at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml E64, and 40 μg/ml bestatin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation of lysates at 6700 × g for 15 min, the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β for mass spectrometric analysis. Supernatants were collected from cultures of either LPS-stimulated monocytes or PBLs stimulated with IL-2 and IL-12 after incubation for 1 or 6 days, respectively, times that correspond to peak chemokine secretion (data not shown). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the culture supernatants contained large amounts of MIP-1α and MIP-1β but only a low concentration of RANTES (data not shown) (13Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquez G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5763-5769PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of culture supernatants from both cell types with either anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β followed by immunoblot analysis with each of these antibodies revealed that each immunoprecipitate contained both MIP-1α and MIP-1β (Fig.1 A). The antigen affinity purified antibodies to each MIP-1 protein were specific and did not cross-react with the other isoform on Western blot analysis (Fig.1 B) or with immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Mass spectrometric analysis of MIP-1α/β complexes secreted by monocytes and PBLs. A, culture supernatants of either PBLs stimulated with IL-2 and IL-12 for 6 days (left panels) or monocytes stimulated with LPS for 1 day (right panels) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MIP-1α (upper panels) or anti-MIP-1β (lower panels).

B, mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitation of recombinant MIP-1α and recombinant MIP-1β with anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the molecular size of the chemokines precipitated by anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β, we analyzed the precipitated proteins by mass spectrometry. The two antibodies precipitated identical complexes from the culture supernatant of LPS-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 2). These complexes consisted predominantly of two polypeptides with molecular masses of 7459 and 7826 Da, which correspond to MIP-1α lacking the four NH2-terminal residues ((−4)MIP-1α) and intact MIP-1β, respectively. The complexes immunoprecipitated by each of the two antibodies from the culture supernatant of IL-2- and IL-12-stimulated PBLs contained (−4)MIP-1α and a protein with a molecular mass of 7658 Da, which corresponds to MIP-1β lacking the two NH2-terminal residues ((−2)MIP-1β). Similar results were obtained with culture supernatants of PBLs stimulated with IL-2 and phytohemagglutinin (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates prepared from the monocyte and PBL culture supernatants with anti-RANTES or anti-MDC were also analyzed by mass spectrometry. However, this approach failed to detect either RANTES or MDC in the supernatants (data not shown). Thus, these data demonstrate that LPS-treated monocytes and PBLs stimulated with IL-2 and IL-12 release a MIP-1α/β heterodimer into the culture supernatant. We next examined whether secreted MIP-1α and MIP-1β were present in the culture supernatant of LPS-stimulated monocytes predominantly as a heterodimer, or whether they were also present as monomers. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation first with anti-MIP-1α and then either with anti-MIP-1β or again with anti-MIP-1α. The various immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β (Fig. 3). Only a small amount of residual MIP-1α was detected in the second precipitate prepared with anti-MIP-1α, indicating that the first immunoprecipitation with this antibody efficiently removed most of the target antigen. The observation that the second precipitate prepared with anti-MIP-1β contained little MIP-1β indicated that most of this protein had been previously precipitated as a heterodimer with MIP-1α. We next investigated the kinetics and site of MIP-1α/β dimerization. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of the MIP-1α/β heterodimer in the culture supernatants of monocytes or PBLs as early as 7–10 h after exposure to LPS or to IL-2 and IL-12, respectively (data not shown). To determine whether the heterodimerization of MIP-1α and MIP-1β occurs intracellularly in the Golgi complex, we treated cells with monensin to prevent intracellular protein transport by inducing retention of proteins in the Golgi complex (15Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 16Korimilli A. Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8672-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PBLs and monocytes were incubated with IL-2 and phytohemagluttinin A or with LPS, respectively, for 20 h, the last 10 h of which they were also exposed to monensin. Under these conditions, chemokines were produced primarily during the last 10 h of culture. The cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The immunoprecipitates prepared from both PBLs (Fig.4 A) and monocytes (Fig.4 B) with either antibody consisting predominantly of heterodimers of (−4)MIP-1α and full-length MIP-1β. The results revealed that MIP-1β was processed from the intact form (7826 Da) detected in the Golgi complex and in the culture supernatant that was obtained after 1 day (data not shown) to a mixture of both the full-length protein and (−2)MIP-1β (7658 Da) in the supernatant obtained after 3 days. After incubation of PBLs for 6 days, almost all of the MIP-1β had been converted to the NH2-terminal truncated form. In contrast, analysis of the culture supernatants of monocytes obtained after 1 day (Fig. 4 B) or 3 days (data not shown) did not reveal proteolytic processing of MIP-1β. Given that monensin only blocks protein transport to the post-Golgi compartment from the trans-Golgi network, these data indicate that MIP-1α/β heterodimers probably form in the endoplasmic reticulum orcis-Golgi. Other experiments using brefeldin A to disrupt the Golgi complex also revealed the presence of heterodimers in cell lysates (data not shown) and suggest that heterodimers are formed in a pre-Golgi compartment. They also suggest that the proteolytic processing of MIP-1β released by PBLs may occur at a late or post-Golgi step during secretion. The MIP-1α/β heterodimer was also detected in immunoprecipitates prepared from both PBL and monocyte lysates without monensin treatment (Fig. 4 C), indicating that MIP-1α/β dimerization occurs under normal conditions. To investigate the nature of the interaction between MIP-1α and MIP-1β, we adjusted the culture supernatants of stimulated PBLs or monocytes to pH 4.0 before immunoprecipitation with anti-MIP-1α or anti-MIP-1β. Under these low pH conditions, each antibody precipitated only the corresponding antigen (Fig.5). These results suggest that acidic conditions induce the dissociation of the MIP-1α/β heterodimer and that electrostatic interactions among charged amino acids therefore are likely to contribute to formation of the dimer interface. Direct measurements of monomer-dimer equilibrium by NMR or sedimentation analysis have revealed that α chemokines (IL-8, growth-related oncogene-α, neutrophil-activating protein-2, low affinity platelet factor 4, and PF4) and β chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, and I-309) (6Skelton N.J.

To examine the specificity of MIP-1α/β heterodimerization at physiological concentrations, we mixed various combinations of recombinant chemokines in vitro at a 1:1 ratio and concentrations of 25–50 nmat physiological pH. We paired MIP-1α with MIP-1β, RANTES, MDC, MCP-1, or IP-10. In parallel, we mixed RANTES with MIP-1β, MDC, MCP-1, or IP-10; IP-10 was also tested for pairing with MCP-1. The various mixtures were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with corresponding specific antibodies, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Heterodimerization was detected only between MIP-1α and MIP-1β and not with RANTES (Fig.6) or with the other chemokines tested (data not shown), thus indicating that this interaction is highly specific. The antigen affinity purified antibodies to each MIP-1 protein were specific and did not cross-react with the other isoform (Fig. 6). The possible existence and activity of native chemokine dimers have been controversial (21Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The β chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES tend to self-associate and thereby form homodimers, tetramers, or larger aggregates in vitro. This process is dynamic and reversible, but it has been thought that chemokine concentrations in vivo may be too low for the formation of such multimers to occur. However, high local concentrations of chemokines may occur in vivo under certain conditions, such as during platelet degranulation, inflammatory disease, and local accumulation of chemokines on cell membranes mediated by receptors or by glycosaminoglycans. We have now identified a naturally occurring MIP-1α/β heterodimer produced by activated monocytes and PBLs. Our data demonstrate that the MIP-1α/β heterodimer forms in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex, and that these two chemokines are secreted in the form of the heterodimer. Furthermore, the combination of MIP-1α with MIP-1βin vitro showed that these two chemokines indeed form heterodimers at physiological (nanomolar) concentrations. Most studies on chemokine homodimerization have been performed in vitro, and the natural formation of either homodimers or heterodimers of chemokines has not been described previously. Native MIP-1 purified from LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a doublet composed of peptides with similar physical characteristics. The NH2-terminal sequences of the two peptides identified them as MIP-1α and MIP-1β (22Sherry B. Tekamp-Olson P. Gallegos C. Bauer D. Davatelis G. Wolpe S.D. Masiarz F. Coit D. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although it was not shown that the co-purified mouse chemokines originally existed as a heterodimer, our data now suggest that these previous results might be explained by the formation of a native mouse MIP-1α/β heterodimer. The three-dimensional structures of both α and β chemokines have been determined mostly with the molecules in the form of crystallized homodimers. Whereas the monomeric structures of both α and β chemokines are highly similar, the dimeric structures of members of these two subfamilies, as typified by IL-8 (12Covell D.G. Smythers G.W.

Whereas the IL-8 dimer is globular, the MIP-1β dimer is cylindrical. The three-dimensional structure of the α chemokine PF4 revealed it to be a tetramer composed of two dimers of the IL-8 type (18Mayo K.H. Chen M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24St. Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR revealed MIP-1β as an end-on-end dimer with the dimer interface showing a large number of contacts between the two monomers. Other β chemokines, including RANTES, MIP-1α, MCP-1, and MCP-2, exhibit a similar homodimeric structure (6Skelton N.J. Aspiras F. Ogez J. Schall T.J.

MCP-3 remains monomeric at concentrations of up to 20 mg/ml (7Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas I-309, another β chemokine, was also shown to exist as a monomer at high concentrations during sedimentation (17Paolini J.F. Willard D. Consler T. Luther M. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2704-2717PubMed Google Scholar). A truncation mutant of MIP-1β lacking the NH2-terminal five residues forms a dimer similar to that formed by the wild-type protein, whereas a mutant lacking the NH2-terminal eight residues exists only as a folded monomer (11Laurence J.S. LiWang A.C. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An MCP-1 mutant lacking the NH2-terminal eight amino acids exists predominantly as a monomer (7Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). IL-8 and melanocyte growth stimulating activity each dimerize by the formation of a central six-stranded β sheet, three strands of which are contributed by each subunit (26Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The calculation of the solvation-free energies of dimerization and analysis of clusters of hydrophobic amino acids indicates that the formation and stabilization of the two main types of chemokine homodimers result from the burial of hydrophobic residues and that the distinct quaternary structures are preserved throughout the two subfamilies (12Covell D.G. Smythers G.W. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2064-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such a scenario would explain the lack of receptor cross-binding and cross-reactivity, which is apparent between the α and β chemokine subfamilies. Most three-dimensional structural determinations have been performed at high concentrations (>1 mm) of chemokines with thermodynamics further strongly favoring dimerization. In contrast, physical data indicate that chemokines are fully dissociated into monomers at their normal physiological (nanomolar) concentrations. Dimer dissociation constants have been determined as 35 μm for RANTES, 33 μm for MCP-1, 58 μm for MCP-2, 40 nm for MIP-1β, 18 μm for IL-8, 73 μm for melanocyte growth stimulating activity/growth-related oncogene-α, and 100 μm for neutrophil-activating protein-2. MIP-1α also tends to aggregate, but this process is reversible, and MIP-1α exists as a monomer under physiological conditions (6Skelton N.J. Aspiras F. Ogez J. Schall T.J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Comparison of our present data with those of previous studies of chemokine homodimers indicates that substantial differences exist between MIP-1α/β heterodimers and chemokine homodimers in terms of physical properties: (i) the formation of homodimers requires high concentrations of chemokines, whereas the MIP-1α/β heterodimer forms at physiological concentrations of monomers; (ii) the dissociation of homodimers occurs under physiological conditions, whereas dissociation of MIP-1α/β heterodimers is apparent only at low pH; (iii) homodimers have been detected only in solution underin vitro conditions, whereas MIP-1α/β heterodimers are secreted from primary monocytes and PBLs; and (iv) the formation of the MIP-1α/β heterodimer appears to be mediated by electrostatic interactions, whereas the formation of chemokine homodimers is thought to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions. The existence of native chemokine homodimers remains to be demonstrated with the data having been obtained that are consistent or inconsistent with homodimers being the functionally active form of these proteins (12Covell D.G. Smythers G.W. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2064-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and cross-linking studies indicate that the active form of MCP-1 is a dimer (31Zhang Y. Rollins B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that IL-8 and MIP-1β derivatives that do not dimerize are fully active (32Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 33Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. Burgner J.W. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). With regard to the functional role of MIP-1α/β heterodimerization, it is possible that the formation of stable heterodimers protects these chemokines from enzymatic digestion and, thus, increases or stabilizes their activity. Preliminary data indicate that MIP-1α/β heterodimer-containing mixtures have potent activity in inducing down-regulation of the CCR5 receptor. 2E. Guan, J. Wang, M. A. Norcross, unpublished observations. The formation of the MIP-1α/β heterodimer under natural conditions may induce (possibly heterologous) receptor dimerization that may have an impact on intracellular signaling events, which contribute to CCR5 and possibly other chemokine receptor functions. Production of pure homogeneous preparations of heterodimers is required for further characterization of heterodimer activities and receptor binding properties. We thank K. Fields and V.

Understanding the substrate specificity of granzyme B will help to identify natural targets and develop better inhibitors or substrates. Here we have used the interaction of human granzyme B with a cognate serpin, proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9), to examine its substrate sequence requirements. Cleavage and sequencing experiments demonstrated that Glu340 is the P1 residue in the PI-9 RCL, consistent with the preference of granzyme B for acidic P1 residues. Ala-scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that the P4-P4′ region of the PI-9 RCL is important for interaction with granzyme B, and that the P4′ residue (Glu344) is required for efficient serpin-proteinase binding. Peptide substrates based on the P4-P4′ PI-9 RCL sequence and containing either P1 Glu or P1 Asp were cleaved by granzyme B (kcat/Km9.5 × 103 and 1.2 × 105s−1m−1, respectively) but were not recognized by caspases. A substrate containing P1 Asp but lacking P4′ Glu was cleaved less efficiently (kcat/Km 5.3 × 104 s−1m−1). An idealized substrate comprising the previously described optimal P4-P1 sequence (Ile-Glu-Pro-Asp) fused to the PI-9 P1′-P4′ sequence was efficiently cleaved by granzyme B (kcat/Km 7.5 × 105 s−1m−1) and was also recognized by caspases. This contrasts with the literature value for a tetrapeptide comprising the same P4-P1 sequence (kcat/Km 6.7 × 104 s−1m−1) and confirms that P′ residues promote efficient interaction of granzyme B with substrates. Finally, molecular modeling predicted that PI-9 Glu344 forms a salt bridge with Lys27 of granzyme B, and we showed that a K27A mutant of granzyme B binds less efficiently to PI-9 and to substrates containing a P4′ Glu. We conclude that granzyme B requires an extended substrate sequence for specific and efficient binding and propose that an acidic P4′ substrate residue allows discrimination between early (high affinity) and late (lower affinity) targets during the induction of apoptosis.

Bird P.I. Sitkovsky M.V. Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells: Basic Mechanisms and Medical Applications. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 179-196Google Scholar). Contact between a CL and a target cell leads to the release of cytotoxins such perforin, serine proteinases (granzymes), and death ligands (FasL and TRAIL) from specialized CL secretory granules into the intercellular space. Target cell death then proceeds by the induction of apoptosis using either of two pathways: activation of death receptors on the target cell surface coupled to caspase activation within the cell or uptake of granzymes in a perforin-dependent manner that leads to caspase activation and intracellular proteolysis (reviewed in Refs. 1Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Sitkovsky M.V. Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells: Basic Mechanisms and Medical Applications. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 179-196Google Scholar and 2Darmon A.J. Bleackley R.C. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 255-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of granzyme-induced cell death is not fully understood. The current model is that perforin and granzymes are endocytosed by the target cell and that perforin eventually disrupts the endocytic vesicle, thus releasing granzymes into the cytoplasm (3Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottleib R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar,4Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, proteolysis of key housekeeping proteins, DNA degradation, and the disintegration of cellular structures follows rapidly. A key granule cytotoxin in this process is the serine proteinase, granzyme B. It is an unusual proteinase with a preference for cleaving after Asp, a property that it shares with caspases. On entering the cytoplasm of a cell, granzyme B induces death by at least two pathways. One pathway is caspase dependent and results in rapid DNA degradation and death. The other pathway is caspase independent and may involve direct degradation of essential proteins such as DNA-PKcs, NuMA, and PARP (5Andrade F. Roy S. Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Both pathways involve loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The pivotal role of granzyme B in granule-mediated cell death is illustrated by mice lacking granzyme B. These animals produce CLs that are unable to induce rapid DNA degradation and death of target cells, although slower killing occurs, possibly mediated by other granzymes (6Heussel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Because caspases themselves are activated by cleavage after Asp, granzyme B is able to proteolytically activate several caspasesin vitro (7Talanian R.V. Yang X. Turbov J. Seth P. Ghayur T. Casiano C.A. Orth K. Froelich C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that this also occurs in cells killed by CLs (8Atkinson E.A.

Of the other known granzyme B substrates within cells, most appear to be cleaved after Asp but not necessarily at sites recognized by caspases. Granzyme B has also been implicated in the cleavage of the BCL-2 family member BID (10Barry M. Heibein J.A. Pinkoski M.J. Lee S.F. Moyer R.W. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), in components of the DNA repair machinery, and in the generation of autoimmune antigens (11Casciola-Rosen L. Andrade F. Ulanet D. Bang W.ong W. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of noncaspase substrates and elucidation of the cleavage specificity of granzyme B is attracting increasing interest. Screening of combinatorial tetra-peptide substrate libraries has indicated that granzyme B has an optimal P4-P1 recognition motif of Ile-Glu-Pro-Asp (12Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar), resembling the activation sites of procaspase 3 and procaspase 7, both of which are activated by granzyme B (7Talanian R.V. Yang X. Turbov J. Seth P. Ghayur T. Casiano C.A. Orth K. Froelich C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It also resembles the optimal recognition motif of the group III or initiator caspases, implying that granzyme B functions as an initiator of the caspase proteolytic cascade. This motif has recently been confirmed using combinatorial methods and extended using phage display to suggest that the preferred P2′ residue is Gly and that the consensus recognition motif for granzyme B is Ile-Glu-Xaa-(Asp/Xaa)-Gly (13Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, synthesis of a peptide comprising an optimized P4-P2′ sequence resulted in a molecule that was not cleaved efficiently by granzyme B (13Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that residues outside this motif contribute to substrate binding. A different approach to understanding the interaction of granzyme B with substrates is to study its interaction with a natural inhibitor, such as a serpin. Serpins belong to a large metazoan and virus protein superfamily (14Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have a common structure and mode of action; each contains a variable C-terminal reactive center loop (RCL) resembling the substrate of its cognate proteinase that is flanked by two highly conserved hinge domains. On proteinase binding, the serpin is cleaved and undergoes a conformational change leading to the irreversible locking of the serpin-proteinase complex. Cleavage of the serpin by the proteinase occurs between two residues in the loop designated P1 and P1′. The P1 residue is crucial and largely dictates the specificity of the serpin-proteinase interaction, whereas residues surrounding the cleavage site contribute to the affinity of the interaction (15Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The human serpin, proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9), is an efficient inhibitor of granzyme B that prevents granzyme B-mediated apoptosis in certain cell types and is thought to protect CLs from autolysis (16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It follows that the PI-9 RCL resembles a natural substrate of granzyme B and that residues within the RCL important for inhibitory function interact with the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme. Here we show by directed mutagenesis that residues within the P4-P4′ sequence of the PI-9 RCL are crucial for inhibitory function. In particular, we demonstrate that the P3′ and P4′ residues are important for binding and that the P4′ Glu probably forms a salt bridge with 27Lys of granzyme B, which indicates that, unlike many other serine proteinases, granzyme B has extended substrate specificity. Synthesis and analysis of peptides based on the PI-9 RCL sequence and incorporating P1′-P4′ residues confirms this finding and has enabled the development of specific and sensitive granzyme B substrates. Recombinant PI-9 was produced using a Pichia pastoris expression system and purified as described (16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Recombinant human granzyme B zymogen was produced and purified using a similar system and then activated by recombinant bovine enterokinase cleavage (17Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant human caspases were produced as described (16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R.

Site-directed mutagenesis of both PI-9 and granzyme B followed the Deng and Nickoloff method (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell.

Sequences of the mutagenic and selection primers will be supplied by the corresponding author on request. 50 μg of the PI-9 T327R mutant was incubated with 5 μg of recombinant granzyme B in 125 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl for 30 min at 37 °C. 0.5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol was added, the incubation was continued for 1 h, and then 0.5 μl of 4-vinyl pyridine was added for 1 h. The alkylated protein sample was subjected to HPLC analysis on a Hewlett Packard HP 1090 liquid chromatograph fitted with a C-18 ODS poly LC column (1 × 100 mm), and data analysis was performed on a HP 79994A HPLC work station. Diode array detection allowed spectral analysis of the column effluent at 214, 254, and 280 nm. Buffer A comprised 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), and buffer B comprised 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 70% CH3CN (v/v). The column was eluted with a gradient of 0–100% buffer B over 60 min at 50 μl/min. UV absorbing peaks were collected and subjected to 11 cycles of N-terminal amino acid sequencing on a PE-ABI Procise automated peptide sequencer. The interaction of granzyme B with PI-9 and derivatives was analyzed using procedures described in Ref. 19Hopkins P.C.R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 3: 15872-15879Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay, and as active site titrants of granzyme B were not available, protease activity was routinely determined by assessing complex formation with a 2-fold excess of highly purified wild type PI-9. Only batches of granzyme B in which greater than 95% of protease showed complex forming activity with PI-9 were used in the kinetic experiments. Briefly, under pseudo-first order conditions a constant amount of enzyme (0.2 nm) was mixed with different concentrations of inhibitor and excess substrate (100 μm substrate 2) in 500 μl. Progress curves were monitored at 37 °C for 2 h in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter (excitation, 320 nm; emission, 420 nm). The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) and rate constant (kass) for the interaction of granzyme B with PI-9 and each mutant were derived as described (19Hopkins P.C.R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 3: 15872-15879Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at least three times, and the weighted means of the determinations are reported. Cleavage of quenched fluorescence and spectrophotometric granzyme B substrates and derivation of kcat values was as described (17Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The substrate IETD-pNA was purchased from Calbiochem. Caspase cleavage of commercial substrates was performed as previously (16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol containing 50 μm of the appropriate substrate for 1 h at 37 °C. An arbitrary activity ratio was used to compare caspase activity on the various substrates and is defined as maximal fluorescence in the presence of caspase divided by maximal fluorescence in the absence of caspase. The various internally quenched substrates were prepared on a 25-μmol scale on a Rink AM amide polystyrene-based resin (resin particles are functionalized with 4-[2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl]-phenoxy linker), using standard solid phase Fmoc protocols (21Walker B. Wisdom G.B. Peptide Antigens: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 27-81Google Scholar) on a Perkin Elmer Biosciences Synergy instrument. The ε-dinitrophenyl (dnp) lysine residue was introduced into the sequence as its N-α-Fmoc derivative, employing 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and 1-hydroxybenotriazole activation, in the presence of di-isopropylethylamine, essentially according to the method of Knorr et al. (22Knorr R. Trzecaik A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In contrast, the aminobenzoyl (abz) residue was introduced as its t-butoxycarbonyl-protected pentafluorophenyl ester (23Meldal M. Breddam K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On completion of the synthesis, the peptides were obtained as their C-terminal amides by cleavage from the support by treatment with a solution of trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) dichloromethane containing a carbocation scavenger mixture (ethanedithiol, water, thioanisole 1:1:2). When samples of the P1 Asp-containing peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, two major components were detected in every instance. This is probably due to the formation of β-aspartyl-linked sequences arising out of a transpeptidation reaction of the Asp-Ser peptide bond, which is a common problem in the synthesis of such peptides (24Bodansky M. Kwei J.Z. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 12: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the reaction can be reversed by treatment with dilute ammonia. When applied to our peptides, this protocol resulted in the generation of products containing one major component. The purity and identity of each peptide were confirmed using capillary electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. Human granzyme B is 69% identical to rat granzyme B. The x-ray crystal structure of rat granzyme B complexed to a variant of the small serine proteinase inhibitor ecotin (Ref. 25Waugh S.M. Harris J.L. Fletterick R. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank identifier 1FI8) was used as a template to model human granzyme B using the program MODELLER (26Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar). The structure of rat granzyme B in complex with ecotin enabled us to model the P7-P1 region of PI-9 into the active site of human granzyme B using using techniques similar to those previously described (27Whisstock J. Lesk A.M. Carrell R. Proteins. 1996; 26: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Specifically, we superposed our model of human granzyme B onto the x-ray crystal structure of rat granzyme B-ecotin using a program by Arthur Lesk (28Lesk A.M. Saccone C. Biosequences: Perspectives and User Services in Europe. European Economic Community, Bruxelles1986: 23-28Google Scholar). We then removed the structure of rat granzyme B and residues 6–77 of ecotin (residues 77–84 representing the P7-P1 region) to leave the model of human granzyme B with the P7-P1 region of ecotin. We converted the P7-P1 sequence SSPIEPD of ecotin to that of PI-9 (SCFVVAE) using the “mutate” facility in the program Quanta (MSI Inc., San Diego, CA). Because the P′ region of the inhibitor is missing in the structure of the rat granzyme B-ecotin complex, we used the structure of trypsin bound to ecotin ((29); Protein Data Bank identifier 1SLU) as a template to build the P1′-P5′ of the RCL of PI-9 into our model of human granzyme B. Trypsin and rat granzyme B share 36.5% sequence identity and superpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.95 Angstroms/atom over 210 Cα atoms (93% of the structure). Superposition of the rat granzyme B-ecotin complex reveals that the backbone atoms of the P1-P4 residues of ecotin in each structure overlay almost exactly (within experimental error), consistent with the canonical structure of the P4-P4′ region of the inhibitory loop of small serine proteinase inhibitors (30Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, the trypsin-ecotin structure is a suitable template for modeling the P′ region of the PI-9 RCL in the active site of human granzyme B. We superposed our model of human granzyme B in complex with the P7-P1 region of PI-9 onto the trypsin-ecotin complex using a program by Arthur Lesk (28Lesk A.M. Saccone C. Biosequences: Perspectives and User Services in Europe. European Economic Community, Bruxelles1986: 23-28Google Scholar). We removed the structure of trypsin and the ecotin molecule with the exception of the P1′-P5′ region. We then converted the P1′-P5′ sequence of ecotin (MHCPD) to that of PI-9 (CCMES). We created a peptide bond between the P1-P1′ residues and then subjected the entire model of human granzyme B in complex with the P7-P5′ residues of human PI-9 to CHARMm minimization, first with the backbone atoms of the RCL peptide constrained and later with no constraints. In each case CHARMm minimization was performed to convergence. The identity of the PI-9 P1 residue as Glu340 has been inferred previously by serpin sequence comparisons and by the established preference of granzyme B for acidic P1 residues (31Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 32Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon N.H. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assignment is supported by mutagenesis experiments substituting Glu340 with Ala or Asp, which resulted in serpins with insignificant or very low inhibitory activity against granzyme B (16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, sequence comparisons are unreliable for identifying P1 residues because the RCL length varies from serpin to serpin, and different residues may be utilized in interactions with different proteinases. The latter point is illustrated by the PI-9-related serpin, PI-6, which uses different P1 residues for interactions with chymotrypsin and thrombin (33Riewald M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14526-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of PI-9, there is another acidic residue (Glu344) in the RCL, and granzyme B also cleaves after Met (32Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon N.H. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it is formally possible that either Glu344 or Met343 acts as the P1 residue and that Glu340 contributes only to initial inhibitor binding. To confirm the assignment of Glu340 as the P1 residue, cleavage and peptide sequencing experiments were undertaken. To avoid rapid inhibition of the enzyme by PI-9 and promote cleavage of the serpin by granzyme B, a variant of PI-9 was used. This carries a mutation in the proximal hinge (Thr326 to Arg) previously shown to abrogate inhibitory activity and convert the serpin into a granzyme B substrate (16Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The recombinant serpin was incubated with native granzyme B, the resulting 38- and 4-kDa cleavage products were alkylated and separated by HPLC (Fig. 1), and then the smaller fragment was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis (data not shown). Because of low level sequence contamination, the residues in the first and fifth positions were equivocal, but the sequence amino terminus-Xaa-Cys-Met-Glu-Xaa-Gly-Pro-Arg was otherwise unambiguous and corresponded to the PI-9 RCL sequence from Cys341 to Arg348. This indicated that granzyme B cleavage had occurred between Glu340 and Cys341, proving that for this protease Glu340is the P1 residue in the PI-9 RCL. The serpin-proteinase interaction involves the reversible formation of an initial complex, followed by conversion to a locked complex by cleavage of the serpin between the P1 and P1′ residues, which triggers rapid insertion of the RCL into the serpin A β-sheet before deacylation is completed (15Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,34Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Schapira M. Semin. Thromb.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Distortion, inactivation, and translocation of the trapped proteinase to the opposite pole of the serpin results from RCL insertion (36Huntington J.A. Read R.A. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Alternatively, catalysis is completed before RCL insertion, the proteinase escapes, and the complex dissociates, releasing cleaved serpin and active enzyme (34Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Schapira M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1994; 20: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In other words, following initial complex formation the pathway bifurcates and can follow an inhibitory or substrate route depending on the rate of RCL insertion. Kinetic analysis of the interaction can indicate whether formation of the locked complex is favored (the inhibitory pathway) or whether cleavage and dissociation is favored (the substrate pathway). For example, if the SI is unitary the inhibitory pathway is favored, whereas higher SI values indicate that the serpin is seen more as a substrate by the enzyme. The second order association constant (kass) is a measure of the rate of RCL insertion and complex formation. The higher the kass, the faster the reaction and the less likely it is to follow the substrate pathway. Multiplication of the kass by the SI yields a value for the rate of formation of the nonreversible intermediate that precedes the inhibitory/substrate pathway branch point (37Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Patston P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4569-4573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the specificity and affinity of the serpin-proteinase interaction is dictated primarily by the P1 residue (39Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the inhibition of degradative proteinases that have a broad substrate range and high catalytic rate (pancreatic, neutrophil, and lysosomal proteinases) and do not have stringent sequence motifs around the P1 that influence substrate binding. It is also classically illustrated by the Pittsburgh mutation of α1-antitrypsin, which retargets the serpin from elastase to thrombin by conversion of its P1 residue from Met to Arg (39Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 40Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, granzyme B differs from the degradative proteinases in that its catalytic and biological properties suggest that it is a regulatory enzyme that acts on a limited set of proteins. In other words, it is highly selective, and it therefore follows that substrate specificity is also likely to be influenced by residues around the P1. This is supported by work showing that the P4 and P3 residues are important in granzyme B substrates (12Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasp"

Three cysteine residues in the C terminus of caveolin-1 are subject to palmitoylation, which is not necessary for caveolar targeting of caveolin-1. Protein palmitoylation is a post-translational and reversible modification that may be regulated and that in turn may regulate conformation, membrane association, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular localization of the target protein. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of [3H]palmitate incorporation into caveolin-1 in aortic endothelial cells. The linkage of palmitate to caveolin-1 was hydroxylamine-sensitive and thus presumably a thioester bond. However, contrary to expectations, palmitate incorporation was blocked completely by the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin. In parallel experiments to show specificity, palmitoylation of aortic endothelial cell-specific nitric-oxide synthase was unaffected by these reagents. Inhibitors of protein trafficking, brefeldin A and monensin, blocked caveolin-1 palmitoylation, indicating that the modification was not cotranslational but rather required caveolin-1 transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to the plasma membrane. In addition, immunophilin chaperones that form complexes with caveolin-1, i.e. FK506-binding protein 52, cyclophilin A, and cyclophilin 40, were not necessary for caveolin-1 palmitoylation because agents that bind immunophilins did not inhibit palmitoylation. Pulse-chase experiments showed that caveolin-1 palmitoylation is essentially irreversible because the release of [3H]palmitate was not significant even after 24 h. These results show that [3H]palmitate incorporation is limited to newly synthesized caveolin-1, not because incorporation only occurs during synthesis but because the continuous presence of palmitate on caveolin-1 prevents subsequent repalmitoylation.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Lipid modification, including palmitoylation, is an important mechanism targeting signaling proteins to caveolae. Among the palmitoylated proteins in caveolae are heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunits (e.g. αs, αi, αo, and αq), G-protein linked receptors, regulator of G-protein signaling proteins, p21ras, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and EC-specific nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (5Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of several of these proteins has been shown to be a post-translational and reversible modification that is also subject to regulation (6Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The post-translational nature of palmitoylation has been shown by cell culture experiments in which palmitate labeling occurs even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (7Magee A.I. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These experiments clearly distinguish protein palmitoylation from protein myristoylation, which is cotranslational and blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. The reversibility of protein-palmitate bonds has been demonstrated by the rapid turnover of the palmitoyl group and may be caused by the relative lability of the thioester linkage (8Paige L.A.

Regulation of the protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation cycle is thought to be important in regulating protein localization, conformation, protein-protein interaction, and activity (16Robinson L.J.

Caveolin-1, the most abundant caveolin family member in EC, is a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein with a hairpin-like structure and with both N and C termini facing the cytoplasm (19Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is palmitoylated on three cysteine residues located near the C terminus of the protein (20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Two isoforms, the slower migrating caveolin-1α and the faster migrating caveolin-1β, differ by 31 N-terminal amino acids because of alternate translation initiation sites (21Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Their C termini are identical and it is likely that both isoforms are palmitoylated similarly. The function of caveolin-1 palmitate chains is not well understood. They may increase the stability of the oligomers and therefore the scaffold structure of caveolae (22Monier S. Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. Kurzchalia T.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-1 palmitate residues may regulate its interaction with other proteins. A palmitate-deficient mutant of caveolin-1 exhibits normal caveolar localization (20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar); however, its interaction with Gαi1 is diminished greatly (23Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that at least two palmitate chains on caveolin-1 are required for binding and transport of cholesterol (24Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We here report results from a kinetic analysis that shows that caveolin-1 exhibits unique characteristics of palmitate incorporation. Caveolin-1 palmitoylation is essentially irreversible and completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Nonetheless it is a post-translational event that requires protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This distinguishes caveolin-1 from other caveolar palmitoylated proteins and suggests that caveolin-1 may be subject to unique regulatory mechanisms of palmitoylation and/or depalmitoylation that account for its distinctive palmitoylation characteristics.

EC in 10-cm dishes were washed with serum-free DME medium and then incubated for 2 h in the same medium. For measurement of incorporation of palmitate into caveolin-1 and other proteins, EC were incubated for 15–30 min with 250 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in serum-free medium containing 3.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. For pulse-chase experiments, the medium was removed and the cells were rinsed three times with serum-free DME medium. The radiolabel was chased by the addition of DME medium containing cycloheximide (28 μg/ml) and either unlabeled palmitate (15 μg/ml) bound to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin or 5% fetal bovine serum as indicated. To measure protein synthesis, EC were incubated for 15–30 min with 60 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in cysteine- and methionine-free medium. EC were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in 0.6 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 90 min. Cells were scraped, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. An aliquot of the lysate was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The remainder of the lysate was added to SDS (0.1% final concentration). Anti-caveolin-1 antibody was added for 90 min followed by protein A-Sepharose for 60 min. A control cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with rabbit nonimmune IgG. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, the lysates were subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with anti-eNOS antibody or mouse nonimmune IgG as described above except that the antibody was added for 15 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide). Gels were analyzed by fluorography. To verify that the radiolabeled fatty acid incorporated into caveolin-1 was linked by a thioester bond, susceptibility to hydroxylamine treatment was examined (20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). EC were incubated with 250 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate for 30 min. The cells were lysed, and caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated material were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Gel lanes were separated and soaked in either 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.0, or 1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.0 for 4 h and then subjected to fluorography. The specific fatty acid esterified to caveolin-1 was identified by reverse-phase thin layer chromatography essentially as described (26Tao N. Wagner S.J. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). EC were incubated with 250 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate for 30 min. The cells were lysed, and caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 IgG and separated by SDS-PAGE. The caveolin-1 band was excised and subjected to in-gel alkaline hydrolysis by treatment with 0.1 m KOH for 30 min. After acidification of the extract to pH 4.5, the free fatty acids were extracted with hexane, dried under N2, and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The extracted lipids were fractionated by reverse-phase thin layer chromatography (RP-18, Whatman) in a resolving solvent system of acetonitrile/acetic acid (1:1, v/v). Standards containing [3H]palmitate and [3H]myristate were fractionated in parallel lanes. The lanes were scraped at 1-cm intervals, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The identity of the proteins immunoprecipitated by the caveolin-1 antibody was verified by mass spectrometric analysis. Lysates were prepared from EC in 2–4 10-cm dishes and subjected to immunoprecipitation using 10 μl of polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 IgG and SDS-PAGE. The protein was excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and trypsin-digested in situ. The digest was analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometer, and peptide sequences were determined by collision-activated dissociation using a liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometer (Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap with a Protana nanospray ion source interfaced to a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 reversed-phase capillary column). Sequences were determined by manual interpretation of collision-activated dissociation spectra. Protein palmitoylation is considered generally to be a post-translational modification independent of de novoprotein synthesis (7Magee A.I. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Paige L.A. Nadler M.J. Harrison M.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This characteristic differentiates palmitoylation from myristoylation, a cotranslational modification that is blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors (27Wilcox C. Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Science. 1987; 238: 1275-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular mechanism of caveolin-1 palmitoylation, bovine aortic EC were pretreated with cycloheximide for 60 min before incubation with [3H]palmitate for 20 min. Caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated from EC lysates using polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 IgG, and [3H]palmitate-labeled protein was detected by fluorography. Surprisingly, cycloheximide treatment blocked essentially all incorporation of [3H]palmitate into caveolin-1 (Fig.1 A, upper panel). This inhibition was also seen after longer labeling periods in the presence of cycloheximide up to 6 h (data not shown). Previous results by Baker et al. (28Baker T.L. Booden M.A. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22037-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed substantial labeling of caveolin-1 by [3H]palmitate in cycloheximide-treated NIH 3T3 cells (28Baker T.L. Booden M.A. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22037-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We found that the complete inhibition of palmitoylation of caveolin-1 in either EC (Fig. 1 A, upper panel) or mouse NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown) was observed only in cells pretreated with cycloheximide. When cycloheximide was added only during the labeling period, substantial incorporation of [3H]palmitate into caveolin-1 was observed, which agreed with the previous report (28Baker T.L. Booden M.A. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22037-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In parallel dishes to determine the effectiveness of the inhibitor, cycloheximide completely blockedde novo synthesis of caveolin-1 in EC metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). Interestingly, cycloheximide added without pretreatment inhibited caveolin-1 synthesis completely but inhibited its palmitoylation only partially. These findings suggest the existence of a newly synthesized pool of caveolin-1 lacking palmitate chains and that incorporation of palmitate into caveolin-1 in this pool is post-translational but limited to a period 60 min or less after synthesis. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel served as a loading control and showed that the total amount of cellular caveolin-1 was not changed by cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). The identity of the [3H]palmitate-labeled protein was confirmed by mass spectrometric sequence analysis of proteolytic fragments of the eluates. The sequence of fragments in the upper band in Fig. 1 A (upper panel) was identical to that of bovine caveolin-1α (data not shown). The lower band contained sequences found in bovine caveolin-1β and also a protein with a sequence consistent with human caveolin-2 (the bovine sequence has not been reported). It is likely that the observed [3H]palmitate in the lower band is due to caveolin-1β because caveolin-2 does not contain the C-terminal Cys residues that are palmitoylated in other caveolin types (and palmitate linked to caveolin-2 has not been reported). Because inhibition of protein acylation by cycloheximide is considered generally to be evidence for cotranslational myristoylation rather than post-translational palmitoylation, we investigated the identity of the radiolabeled fatty acid and the nature of the linkage to caveolin-1. Protein palmitoylation occurs on Cys residues through a thioester bond sensitive to treatment with hydroxylamine (20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). EC were incubated with [3H]palmitate, and caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates using polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 IgG and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Incubation of the gel in neutral hydroxylamine removed all radioactivity, consistent with a palmitate thioester bond (Fig.1 B). A chromatographic method was used to identify more precisely the fatty acid linked to caveolin-1 (26Tao N. Wagner S.J. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated from [3H]palmitate-labeled EC and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The fatty acids released by alkaline hydrolysis were extracted and subjected to reverse-phase thin layer chromatography. The mobility of the fatty acid released from caveolin-1 was the same as that of [3H]palmitate (Fig.1 C). To examine the target specificity of cycloheximide we determined its effect on incorporation of [3H]palmitate into a second palmitoylated EC protein, eNOS. Palmitoylation of eNOS was not decreased by cycloheximide (Fig. 1 D). To evaluate the effect of cycloheximide on an array of EC proteins, lysates not subjected to immunoprecipitation were examined. Palmitate incorporation into multiple proteins was diminished by cycloheximide but not inhibited completely. Interestingly, modification of proteins with molecular mass greater than 65 kDa was not decreased (Fig. 1 E,left). The effectiveness of the cycloheximide treatment was shown by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine (Fig.1 E, right). Puromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor with a mechanism different from cycloheximide, also blocked palmitoylation of caveolin-1 (Fig. 1 F) but did not inhibit palmitoylation of eNOS and only partially inhibited palmitoylation of most visible cellular proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that the process of palmitoylation of caveolin-1 differs from that of most proteins studied so far in that it requires de novoprotein synthesis. Several mechanisms may be responsible for this requirement, namely (i) caveolin-1 palmitoylation is cotranslational, (ii) caveolin-1 palmitoylation occurs during trafficking to the plasma membrane, (iii) caveolin-1 palmitoylation requires the synthesis of accessory proteins, e.g. chaperones, or (iv) caveolin-1 palmitoylation occurs after synthesis and delivery to the plasma membrane but is irreversible, and therefore incorporation of [3H]palmitate is found only on newly synthesized protein. To examine whether incorporation of palmitate into caveolin-1 is cotranslational, we examined the effects of inhibitors of protein transport between endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. A lack of an effect would be consistent with palmitate incorporation proximal to the inhibited trafficking step and with cotranslational modification. Newly synthesized caveolin-1 travels from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus, where it is incorporated into detergent-resistant membranes (29Lisanti M.P. Tang Z.L. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and then to the cell surface (31Machleidt T. Li W.P. Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A (BFA) reversibly blocks the exit of secretory and membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum by disassembling the Golgi apparatus and mixing it into the endoplasmic reticulum (32Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Incubation of EC with BFA dramatically reduced [3H]palmitate labeling of caveolin-1 (Fig. 2 A,upper panel). The much smaller decrease in [35S]methionine labeling indicates that the effect of BFA was not caused by decreased neosynthesis of caveolin-1 (Fig.2 A, lower panel). The BFA-induced retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum is prevented by the addition of nocodazole, which depolymerizes microtubules; thus in combination with BFA, nocodazole can distinguish the effects of inhibition of anterograde and retrograde transport (33Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nocodazole did not prevent the inhibition of caveolin-1 palmitoylation by BFA, indicating that anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi is necessary for palmitate incorporation (Fig.2 A). The inhibition of palmitoylation of caveolin-1 by BFA was highly specific as shown by [3H]palmitate labeling in cell lysates; palmitoylation of most visible proteins was not inhibited, whereas palmitoylation of two proteins of ∼60 and 70–75 kDa was increased markedly (Fig. 2 B). To evaluate the role of more distal trafficking in palmitate incorporation into caveolin-1, we incubated EC with monensin. Monensin equilibrates the monovalent cations Na+, K+, and H+ across biological membranes, which perturbs protein transport from medial- to trans-Golgi compartments (34Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and also increases intralysosomal pH. Pretreatment of EC with monensin substantially reduced [3H]palmitate labeling of caveolin-1 (Fig. 2 C, upper panel) without affecting caveolin-1 neosynthesis (Fig. 2 C, lower panel). The inhibition was not due to the lysosomotropic property of monensin because chloroquine, which also increases intralysosomal pH, did not inhibit caveolin-1 palmitoylation (data not shown). Together these results show that an intact trafficking pathway is necessary for caveolin-1 palmitoylation. Protein synthesis inhibitors may block palmitoylation of caveolin-1 by an indirect mechanism, e.g.by inhibition of chaperones or other accessory proteins required for caveolin-1 trafficking rather than by a direct effect on caveolin-1 itself. Caveolin-1 is present in the cytoplasm as a complex with the immunophilins FK506-binding protein 52, cyclophilin A, and cyclophilin 40 (35). These chaperones could be the target of cycloheximide either because their neosynthesis is necessary for caveolin-1 trafficking or because cycloheximide competitively binds immunophilins that may disrupt complex formation with caveolin-1 (35Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Christner C. Wyrwa R. Marsch S. Kullertz G. Thiericke R. Grabley S. Schumann D. Fischer G. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3615-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test this mechanism, we examined the effect of agents that specifically bind immunophilins on [3H]palmitate labeling of caveolin-1. Cyclosporin A and rapamycin were used to bind cyclophilins and FK506-binding protein 52, respectively, at concentrations known to disrupt the caveolin-chaperone complex (35Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Immunophilin binding did not diminish caveolin-1 palmitoylation, suggesting that the synthesis and activity of these chaperones are not critical for palmitoylation of newly synthesized caveolin-1 (Fig.3). An alternative explanation for our observations is that the modification of caveolin-1 by palmitate is essentially irreversible. If this is the case, the apparent dependence of palmitoylation on new protein synthesis would be due to the fact that [3H]palmitate cannot be incorporated into caveolin-1 that has been palmitoylated already but instead is incorporated preferentially into newly synthesized, and thus nonpalmitoylated, caveolin-1. To test this mechanism, the rate of caveolin-1 depalmitoylation was measured in a pulse-chase experiment. EC were incubated with [3H]palmitate or [35S]methionine for 30 min, and the radiolabel was chased for up to 24 h with medium in the presence of cycloheximide and excess unlabeled palmitate. The release of [3H]palmitate from caveolin-1 was negligible during the 24-h chase period (Fig.4 A, upper panel), as was turnover of the caveolin-1 polypeptide chain (Fig.4 A, lower panel). This result was in marked contrast to the rapid release of [3H]palmitate from eNOS, which was essentially complete after 3 h (Fig. 4 B,upper panel); the high rate of palmitate turnover was not caused by eNOS protein turnover, which had a half-life of about 9 h (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Analysis of total [3H]palmitate-labeled proteins in cell lysates shows that the rate of release of [3H]palmitate from EC proteins is rapid with apparent half-lives of less than 6 h for most detectable proteins (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that the process of palmitoylation of caveolin-1 is essentially irreversible in EC and that this characteristic distinguishes it from most other palmitoylated EC proteins. Our results show that incorporation of [3H]palmitate into caveolin-1 requires de novo synthesis of the protein. This requirement is not due to cotranslational modification but rather results from the absence of a detectable palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle. Our data also show that palmitate incorporation occurs within 60 min of caveolin-1 synthesis and that an intact trafficking pathway is required, indicating that palmitoylation occurs distal to the Golgi apparatus, most likely in the caveolae or plasma membrane compartments. These findings are not limited to cells of a single type or from a single species because similar results were obtained using murine NIH 3T3 fibroblastic cells (data not shown). The observed low rate of depalmitoylation does not imply that the palmitate linkage to caveolin-1, or its pathway of formation, is unique but rather that the enzymatic or nonenzymatic depalmitoylation reaction is extremely slow. The in vitro sensitivity to neutral hydroxylamine (our results and Ref. 20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) indicates that palmitate is linked to caveolin-1 by a transesterification-labile thioester bond. The resistance to cleavage of the palmitate linkage in caveolin-1 in EC may be caused by the inaccessibility of caveolin-1 to the depalmitoylating enzyme(s) or to the possibility that caveolin-1 is a weak substrate for these enzymes. Little is known about the substrate specificities of the palmitoyl protein thioesterases. Palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 and its homologue, palmitoyl protein thioesterase-2, are localized in the lysosomes and are thus unlikely to be responsible for caveolin-1 deacylation. However, acyl protein thioesterase-1, which is located primarily in the cytoplasm and increases the turnover rate of palmitate on Gαs and eNOS, is a candidate for regulation of caveolin-1 deacylation (14Yeh D.C. Duncan J.A. Yamashita S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33148-33154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, Yehet al. (14Yeh D.C. Duncan J.A. Yamashita S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33148-33154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) recently showed that caveolin-1 is not a substrate for acyl protein thioesterase-1. It is not known whether caveolin-1 lacks a specific sequence required for thioesterase recognition or whether the orientation of the palmitate groups within the membrane renders them inaccessible to the active site of the enzyme. An alternate possibility is that our findings on caveolin-1 palmitoylation are restricted to cells under basal conditions, and the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle is activated by agonists. However, in preliminary studies using thrombin, bradykinin, and several cholinergic and adrenergic ligands, we have not observed agonist-dependent caveolin-1 increases in the rate of palmitoylation (data not shown). Our results show that [3H]palmitate labeling of newly synthesized caveolin-1 requires an intact trafficking pathway as shown by inhibition by BFA and monensin. Other investigators have reported that palmitoylation of SNAP-25 and GAP-43 is also inhibited by brefeldin A (33Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both proteins are modified by palmitate but not by other acyl groups (SNAP-25 and GAP-43 are modified by four and two palmitate groups, respectively). In contrast, palmitoylation of several proteins that are both myristoylated and palmitoylated, e.g. Gαo, Gαi, and p59fyn, is insensitive to brefeldin A (33Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the specific acyl modifications define not just susceptibility to acylation-deacylation cycling but also specific intracellular trafficking pathways. Because there are not other reports of proteins with similar palmitoylation kinetics, we can only speculate on the cellular consequences of the essentially irreversible nature of the palmitate linkage on caveolin-1. The fact that caveolin-1 remains in a continuous palmitoylated state suggests a tight and possibly irreversible interaction with membranes. The “two-signal model” for membrane binding (6Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 38Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 39Wedegaertner P.B. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) proposes that the first signal (e.g.lipid modification, poly-basic stretch of amino acids, interaction with a membrane-bound protein) permits transient interaction of a protein with membranes, whereas the second signal (often a palmitate chain) provides a more persistent association with a specific membrane. According to this model, the presence in caveolin-1 of a 33-amino acid hydrophobic domain as well as three palmitate chains may constitute the equivalent of four membrane-binding signals and promote essential irreversibility of the membrane interaction. Thus the persistent palmitate chains may be important for a structural role of caveolin-1 rather than a kinetic role. Indeed, this idea is consistent with the finding (using palmitoylation-deficient mutants of caveolin-1) that palmitate modification is required for optimal stability of the caveolin-1 oligomers (22Monier S. Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. Kurzchalia T.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the rigid structure of caveolae (40Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Likewise, caveolin-1 palmitate residues are required for efficient binding and sequestration of signaling molecules in caveolae (23Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus unlike most caveolar proteins that require cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation for normal function,e.g. translocation between cellular compartments (17Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and regulation of protein interaction (41Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), caveolin-1 function may require persistent palmitate linkages. In contrast to its potentially static role in caveolar structure and in protein-protein interactions, caveolin-1 and caveolae have been implicated in dynamic cellular processes including transcytotic and potocytotic endothelial transport (42Milici A.J. Watrous N.E. Stukenbrok H. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), polarized vesicular trafficking in epithelial cells (43Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and two-way transport of cholesterol (and other lipids) between the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi system and the plasma membrane (44Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (. S.): 29427-29435YAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 45Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These transport processes suggest that caveolar structures are dynamic and also that caveolin-1 traverses intracellular compartments (47Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, cycling of caveolin-1 between the plasma membrane caveolae and the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi system has been shown (45Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), as well as redistribution in several situations including phosphatase inhibition (48Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), heat shock (49Kang Y.S. Ko Y.G. Seo J.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and after formation of cell-cell contacts (50Volonte D. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An important role of caveolin-1 palmitate residues in these dynamic processes is just becoming clear. The presence of palmitate on at least two of the three Cys residues is necessary for cholesterol binding, chaperone complex formation, and cholesterol transport to caveolae (24Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although palmitoylation and depalmitoylation cycling may be required for intercompartmental translocation of multiple proteins (6Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 17Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 38Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in the absence of a detectable palmitate cycle it is unlikely that this process regulates caveolin-1 translocation. An intriguing alternate mechanism for regulation of caveolin-1 movement is suggested by recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the release of Cdc42 from membranes by its regulator, rhoGDI (51Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic pocket in rhoGDI surrounds the membrane-binding geranylgeranyl moiety of Cdc42, thus leading to membrane release. The identification of caveolin-1 in cytosolic complexes in association with chaperones is consistent with this mechanism (24Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 35Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a two-spanning integral membrane region in caveolin-1, in addition to the palmitate residues, may introduce steric and energetic obstacles to this potential releasing mechanism. The requirement for palmitate for cholesterol binding is consistent with a direct interaction of the fatty acids with membrane lipids, and cytosolic caveolin-1 complexes may contain bound lipids. Additional structural and biochemical studies will be necessary to determine whether palmitate is involved directly or indirectly in binding either cholesterol or chaperones. In either case, palmitate cycling is unlikely to be required for regulation of caveolin-1 activity, but rather the absolute presence of palmitate residues may be critical for normal caveolin-1 function in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032236417,"Lefty polypeptides, novel members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, are involved in the formation of embryonic lateral patterning. Members of the TGF-beta superfamily require processing for their activation, suggesting cleavage to be an essential step for lefty activation. Transfection of different cell lines with lefty resulted in expression of a 42-kDa protein, which was proteolytically processed to release two polypeptides of 34 and 28 kDa. Since members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family cleave different TGF-beta factors and are involved in the establishment of embryonic laterality, we studied their role in lefty processing. Cotransfection analysis showed that PC5A processed the lefty precursor to the 34-kDa form in vivo, whereas furin, PACE4, PC5B, and PC7 had a limited activity. None of these PCs showed activity in the processing of the lefty polypeptide to the 28-kDa lefty form. The mutation of the consensus sequences for PC cleavage in the lefty protein allowed the lefty cleavage sites to be identified. Mutations of the sequence RGKR to GGKG (amino acids 74-77) and of RHGR to GHGR (amino acids 132-135) prevented the proteolytic processing of the lefty precursor to the 34- and 28-kDa forms, respectively. To identify the biologically active form of lefty, we studied the effect of lefty treatment on pluripotent P19 cells. Lefty did not induce Smad2 or Smad5 phosphorylation, Smad2/Smad4 heterodimerization, or nuclear translocation of Smad2 or Smad4, but activated the MAPK pathway in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Further analysis showed the 28-kDa (but not the 34-kDa) polypeptide to induce MAPK activity. Surprisingly, the 42-kDa lefty protein was also capable of inducing MAPK activity, indicating that the lefty precursor is biologically active. The data support a molecular model of processing as a mechanism for regulation of lefty signaling."

Each enzyme released thrombin from prothrombin in a dose- and time-dependent manner with the former enzyme, containing adhesion domains, being 17-fold more efficient than the single chain RgpB. A close correlation between the generation of fibrinogen clotting activity and amidolytic activity indicated that α-thrombin was produced by gingipains R, and this was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thrombin active site labeling, and amino-terminal sequence analysis of prothrombin digestion fragments. Significantly, the catalytic efficiency of HRgpA to generate thrombin (k cat /K m = 1.2 × 106m−1s−1) was 100-fold higher than that of RgpB (k cat /K m = 1.2 × 104m−1s−1). The superior prothrombinase activity of HRgpA over RgpB correlates with the fact that only the former enzyme was able to clot plasma, and kinetic data indicate that prothrombin activation can occur in vivo. At P. gingivalis-infected periodontitis sites HRgpA may be involved in the direct production of thrombin and, therefore, in the generation of prostaglandins and interleukin-1, both have been found to be associated with the development and progression of the disease. Furthermore, by taking into account that the P. gingivalis bacterium has been immunolocalized in carotid atherosclerotic plaques at thrombus formation sites (Chiu, B. (1999) Am.

The process is initiated by the binding of factor VII to tissue factor (1Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 71: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), present in tissues surrounding vessels (2Drake T.E. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar), followed by proteolytic activation of plasma coagulation factors in a cascade pathway (3Colman R.W.

Sci. 1986; 485: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), thus plugging damaged vessels. Besides its central role in hemostasis, thrombin also enhances vascular permeability (9DeMichele M.A.A. Moon D.G. Fenton J.W., II Minnear F.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 69: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), induces leukocyte chemotaxis (10Bizios R. Lai L. Fenton J.W., II Malik A.B. J. Cell.

Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar). These data, and the fact that prothrombin activation in vivo is known to be associated with inflammatory conditions, implicate thrombin as a major player in inflammation. The deposition of fibrin is a common feature at the site of bacterial infection (13Menkin V. Physiol. Rev. 1938; 18: 366-418Crossref Google Scholar). Endotoxin can induce fibrin accumulation in vivo through the Shwartzman reaction (14Lipinski B. Nowak A. Gurewich V. Br. J. Haematol. 1974; 28: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), presumably by activating monocytes to express tissue factor (15Rivers R.P. Hathaway W.E. Weston W.L. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 30: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For this reason it is recognized as the component primarily responsible for blood coagulation associated with bacterial infections. Proteinases from such foreign sources are also thought to be virulence factors involved in various inflammatory events occurring at infected sites (16Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, many of these enzymes present in snake venoms are known to activate prothrombin (17Speijer H.

A close relationship between Porphyromonas gingivalis(formerly Bacteroides gingivalis) and adult periodontitis has been reported (19Slots J. Genco R.J. Mergenhagen S.E.

From the culture medium of P. gingivalis HG66 we have purified previously two major forms of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases, HRgpA1 and RgpB, formerly referred to as high molecular mass gingipain R (95-kDa gingipain R1 or HRGP) and 50-kDa gingipain R2 (RGP-2), respectively (24Marsh P.D.

Both of these enzymes are products of two distinct but related genes (27Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).rgpA encodes a polyprotein which, after post-translational processing/modifications, yields three different forms of the enzyme (28Pavloff N.

Microbiol. 1987; 23: 955-965Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar); the major one is a non-covalent complex containing separate catalytic and adhesion/hemagglutinin domains (HRgpA). In contrast, the fragment encoding the latter domain(s) is missing in thergpB gene structure, and its translation product is a single protein with a primary structure essentially identical to the catalytic domain of HRgpA (30Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J.

Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite both a structural similarity and a specificity restricted to Arg-Xaa peptide bonds, HRgpA and RgpB show considerable differences in catalytic potency (26Potempa J. Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J.

Tanase S. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16062-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and protein C (33Hosotaki K. Imamura T. Potempa J. Travis J. Hiraoka T. Kitamura N. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to activation of these members of the coagulation cascade pathway, it was also shown that RgpB was capable of generating kallikrein from plasma prekallikrein (16Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be anticipated that gingipains R could activate other coagulation cascade proenzymes in this pathway, since each of these processes requires cleavage of peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal side of specific arginine residues (34Halkier T. Mechanisms in Blood Coagulation, Fibrinolysis and the Complement System. Cambridge University Press, UK1991Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the results of experiments designed to investigate the ability of two forms of gingipains R to convert prothrombin to thrombin, an enzyme known to have multiple functions in both coagulation and pro-inflammatory processes. Benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl-ketone (TLCK), leupeptin, and fibrinogen were purchased from Sigma. Factor X-deficient plasma was obtained from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS).

(Tokyo, Japan). The purified human factor X was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Factor X-, IX-, and XI-deficient plasmas and Platelin® (rabbit brain phospholipids) were obtained from George King Biomedical (Overland Park, KS), and from Organon Teknika (Durham, NC), respectively. Normal human plasma was prepared by centrifugation of a mixture of 9 volumes of freshly drawn blood from healthy volunteers and 1 volume of 3.8% (w/v) sodium citrate. RgpB and HRgpA were isolated according to the method described by Potempa et al. (26Potempa J. Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J. Brassell D. Nelson D. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21648-21657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The amount of active enzyme in each purified proteinase was determined by active site titration using Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (35Potempa J. Pike R. Travis J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), with the concentration of active gingipain R being calculated from the amount of inhibitor needed for complete inactivation of the proteinase. Each P. gingivalisproteinase was activated with 10 mm cysteine in 0.2m HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 10 min. The activated proteinase (2 μm) was diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS) and 5 mmCaCl2 prior to use. The molar concentration of purified prothrombin was calculated using A280nm1%= 13.8 and a molecular mass of 72 kDa (36Kisiel W. Hanahan D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 304: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fibrinogen clotting activity of released thrombin was measured by incubating 90 μl of prothrombin (90 μg/ml) with 10 μl of a given proteinase at 37 °C for 3 min. One hundred μl of fibrinogen (3 mg/ml), prewarmed to 37 °C, was then added to the mixture, and the clotting time was measured with a Coagulometer KC 1A (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). For plasma clotting time assays, 90 μl of factor X-deficient plasma supplemented with 4 μmfactor X-specific inhibitor (DX-9065a) or the same plasma reconstituted with 10 μl of factor X (100 μg/ml) in the absence of DX-9065a were prewarmed to 37 °C, and then 10 μl of a proteinase was added and the clotting time measured. For activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay, 90 μl of citrated plasma was mixed with 90 μl of PTT-LT® (cephalin 1.2 mg/ml, silica 1 mg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and preheated to 37 °C in a plastic cell for 1 min. Then, 20 μl of HRgpA was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. After adding 100 μl of 25 mmCaCl2, the clotting time was measured with a Coagulometer KC 1A (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). Prothrombin, dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2, was incubated with the same volume of either gingipain R (0.1 nm HRgpA or 0.4 nm RgpB final concentration) dissolved in the same buffer supplemented with 80 μg/ml phospholipids at 37 °C for 30, 60, 90, or 120 s. Then, 50 μl of 6 μm leupeptin in the same buffer was added, to inhibit completely the cysteine proteinase activity. At this concentration leupeptin does not affect the amidolytic activity of thrombin. To this mixture 50 μl of a thrombin-specific substrate, Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA (0.4 mm), in the same buffer was added. Substrate cleavage and the release of AMC by thrombin was monitored by the relative fluorescence increase at 440 ± 20 nm after excitation at 380 ± 20 nm, using a microplate fluorescence spectrophotometer (CytoFluor Series 4000, Perspective Biosystems). To calculate concentrations of thrombin produced by either gingipain R, the amidolytic activity of purified α-thrombin, which had been titrated withp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (37Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), was used as a standard. The initial velocity of thrombin production at various prothrombin concentrations (final concentrations: 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 600, and 1000 nm for HRgpA and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 μm for RgpB) was determined by the best fit line after incubation for various periods. The values forK m and V max were extracted by direct fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to experimental data using non-linear curve fitting employing the method of least squares with Taylor expansion (38Sakoda M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the values generated in this way were very similar to the ones obtained by three transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation ([S]0/v versus [S]0, 1/v versus1/[S]0 and v versus v/[S]0, where v and [S]0 denote the catalytic rate and the initial substrate concentration, respectively), the means ± S.D. derived from four independent experiments and four different transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation were calculated and presented in Table IV.Table IVKinetic constants for the activation of prothrombinEnzymesK mk catk cat/K mms−1m−1s−1HRgpA2.6 ± 0.1 × 10−73.2 ± 0.2 × 10−11.2 × 106(9.8 × 10−8) aData in parentheses for factor X activation were taken from Ref. 34.

Open table in a new tab The mean ± S.D. of the K m andk cat values for prothrombin activation by gingipains were calculated from data obtained in four independent experiments. For details see under “Experimental Procedures.” Eighteen microliters of activated HRgpA or RgpB (3.6 pmol) were added to 162 μl of prothrombin (3.68 nmol in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm benzamidine), and the mixture (20 nm and 20 μm final concentration of HRgpA or RgpB and prothrombin, respectively) was incubated at 37 °C. At 0.5 mm concentration, benzamidine inhibits thrombin activity but not that of gingipains, and it was included into the assay buffer to avoid autocatalytic cleavage. At specific time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn, and 1.5 μl of d-Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (10 mm) was added to terminate the reaction. Samples were boiled in reducing treatment buffer and applied for SDS-PAGE with 10% slab gels, according to the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis 2-μl aliquots of the prothrombin/gingipain incubation mixture were transferred to 8 μl of HEPES, pH 7.6, containing 10 μm biotinylated Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and boiled in reducing treatment buffer. After SDS-PAGE the separated protein fragments were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P membrane from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and bands were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Automatic sequence analysis was performed with a pulse liquid-phase sequencer (model 477A Protein Sequencer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems Inc.). To determine the amino-terminal sequence of prothrombin-derived fragments, the mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to ImmobilonTM polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore Co., Ltd., Bedford, MA). The transferred proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Excised bands were placed on a Polybrene-treated glass filter prior to sequence analysis. In order to determine whether gingipains R activate prothrombin, each bacterial proteinase was incubated with the human zymogen, and the release of thrombin activity was measured. Both proteinases caused prothrombin activation in a dose- and incubation time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B), with HRgpA being nearly 17 times more potent. At conditions used for SDS-PAGE analysis of the prothrombin degradation pattern (Fig. 3), the thrombin activity released from 20 μm prothrombin by 20 nm of either gingipain transiently reached a peak after 10 min of incubation and then slowly disappeared during prolonged enzyme exposure (Fig. 2). Significantly, no generation of thrombin activity was observed if prothrombin was incubated with TLCK-treated gingipains R (Fig. 1).Figure 3Cleavage of prothrombin by gingipains R. A, prothrombin (20 μm) and gingipains R (20 nm) were incubated together as described in Fig. 2 legend in the buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm benzamidine. At specific time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn, and 1.5 μl ofd-Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (10 mm) was added to terminate the reaction. Samples were boiled in sample treatment buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Lane a, prothrombin alone (3.5 μl loaded); lanes b–f, prothrombin incubated with HRgpA for 1, 2, 5, 15, and 60 min, respectively;lanes g and n, α-thrombin (1.3 μg loaded);lanes h–m, prothrombin incubated with RgpB for 0, 1, 2, 5, 15, and 60 min, respectively; lanes o–r, α-thrombin (20 μm) incubated with RgpB (20 μm) for 0, 5, 15, and 60 min, respectively (2 μg loaded); lanes s andt, pure μ- and γ-thrombin, respectively (1.3 μg loaded). The positions of molecular mass standard markers are indicated to the right of the gel. The major fragments of prothrombin indicated by arrows were subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis and identified as follows: 1, prethrombin 1; 2, fragment 1·2; 3, prethrombin 2;4, B-chain of α-thrombin; 5, fragment 1;6, B-2-chain of μ-thrombin; and 7, fragment 2.B, schematic diagram of prothrombin fragmentation with major cleavage sites for HRgpA and RgpB. The size of arrowheadsindicates the relative efficiency of cleavage of specific peptide bonds in the prothrombin polypeptide chain by the two proteinases tested. μ-Thrombin is generated by cleavage at the Arg70–Tyr71 or Arg73–Asn74 peptide bonds in the α-thrombin B-chain, giving rise to the B1 and B2 peptides. An additional cleavage at Lys154–Gly155 of the B2-chain generates γ-thrombin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Time course of thrombin generation and degradation by gingipains R. Eighteen microliters of activated HRgpA (3.6 pmol) was added to 162 μl of prothrombin (3.68 nmol), and the mixture (20 nm and 20 μm final concentration of HRgpA and prothrombin, respectively) was incubated at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6, containing 1 mmcysteine. At the given time intervals 10-μl aliquots were removed to 985 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 2 mmantipain, and thrombin activity released by HRgpA (○) and RgpB (▵) was measured using H-d-Phe-Pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Due to autoproteolytic cleavage or fragmentation by other proteolytic enzymes, thrombin in vitro can occur in three major forms referred to as α-, β-, and γ-thrombin. All of these enzymes have amidolytic activity, but only α-thrombin is capable of clotting fibrinogen. Therefore, to determine if amidolytic activity released by gingipains from the zymogen is at least partially due to the presence of α-thrombin, which is the more important form of this proteinase, the samples of prothrombin incubated with gingipains were examined for clotting activity. As summarized in TableI both gingipains induced fibrinogen clotting activity from prothrombin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. However, due to the apparent progressive cleavage of the α-thrombin B-chain and the creation of β- and/or γ-thrombin, a correlation between clotting and amidolytic activity was observed only at short preincubation times. Indeed, after prolonged incubation the former activity decreased much faster than the latter activity (data not shown). The same process of excessive α-thrombin cleavage in the presence of increased concentrations of gingipains most likely skewed a concentration-dependent release of fibrinogen clotting activity from prothrombin. This is particularly apparent in the case of RgpB where the doubling of enzyme concentration resulted only in the moderate shortening of the fibrinogen clotting time (Table I). In comparison to HRgpA, an ∼5-fold higher concentration of RgpB was necessary to induce clotting activity from prothrombin, and significantly, clotting times determined after the same preincubation time were 3–4 times longer. Taken together, these results indicate that HRgpA is about 20 times more efficient than RgpB in α-thrombin generation. This is in keeping with zymogen activation as measured with an amidolytic substrate in which HRgpA was shown to be 17-fold more efficient than RgpB (Fig. 1).Table IFibrinogen clotting by prothrombin incubated with gingipains RGingipain RConcentrationClotting time1 min 1-bPreincubation time of gingipain with prothrombin.2 min 1-bPreincubation time of gingipain with prothrombin.3 min 1-bPreincubation time of gingipain with prothrombin.nm 1-aConcentration during incubation with prothrombin.sssHRgpA5ND 1-cNot determined.41.1 ± 1.5ND1042.3 ± 1.225.7 ± 1.422.4 ± 1.415ND20.5 ± 1.1NDHRgpA-TLCK 1-dTreated with TLCK.15NDND>300 1-eNot clotted after a 300-s incubation.RgpB25NDND116.3 ± 6.150137.5 ± 8.1111.3 ± 8.493.7 ± 5.2RgpB-TLCK 1-dTreated with TLCK.50NDND>300 1-eNot clotted after a 300-s incubation.Ninety μl of prothrombin (90 μg/ml) was preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min before it was supplemented with 10 μl of a proteinase.

The prothrombin activation assays in vitro based on generation of amidolytic and/or fibrinogen clotting activities do not reflect the complexity of reactions in blood plasma where a multitude of other proteins could hinder the interaction of gingipains R with prothrombin. Therefore, to determine if gingipains R can produce a significant amount of α-thrombin in plasma, we measured the clotting time of factor X-deficient plasma incubated with gingipains. In order to evaluate interference from any residual factor X, which may still exist in deficient plasma, the assay was performed in the presence of a factor Xa-specific inhibitor in c"

Phosphoamino acid analysis of the radiolabeled NSF indicates a role for a serine/threonine-specific kinase.

Indeed, NSF is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro at Ser-237 of the catalytic D1 domain. Mutation of this residue to glutamic acid or to alanine eliminates in vitrophosphorylation. Molecular modeling studies suggest that Ser-237 is adjacent to an inter-subunit interface at a position where its phosphorylation could affect NSF activity.

The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and the soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs, not to be confused with SNAP-25) affect the composition and structure of the SNARE complex.

Studies of the comatose mutant in Drosophila indicate that active NSF is not required for initial neurotransmitter release but is instead required for sustained release upon subsequent stimulations (21Siddiqi O.

These data are consistent with a role for NSF in maintaining a “ready-release” pool of synaptic vesicles, which is competent for fast response to calcium influx. Consistently, SNAPs, when injected into crayfish axons, increase the probability of neurotransmitter release but not the rate (24He P. Southard R.C. Chen D. Whiteheart S.W. Cooper R.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3406-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On a molecular level, these data support the model that NSF functions prior to neurotransmitter release to activate SNAREs for membrane fusion and perhaps after fusion to recycle spent SNAREs (25Littleton J.T. Chapman E.R. Kreber R. Garment M.B. Carlson S.D. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 1998; 21: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). NSF is a homo-hexameric ATPase whose subunits can be divided into three domains (N, D1, and D2) (11Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J.

ATP binding and hydrolysis by D1 is essential for NSF activity. Mutants in the D1 domain that fail to bind ATP also fail to interact with SNAP-SNARE complex (27Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). D1 mutants that fail to hydrolyze ATP are dominant negative inhibitors because they fail to disassemble 7 S SNARE complexes (11Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R.

Although this domain has high affinity for ATP and low ATPase activity, neither function is essential for NSF activity (11Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E.

In a current model of NSF structure, the hexameric D2 domain anchors the catalytically active D1 domains and SNAP/SNARE-binding N domains. Much work has focused on the role of phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) in the control of neurotransmission (reviewed in Ref. 30Vaughan P.F. Walker J.H. Peers C. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 125-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In particular, it has clearly been shown that activation of PKC by phorbol esters can lead to an enhancement of l-glutamate release (31Terrian D.M. Ways D.K. Gannon R.L. Hippocampus. 1991; 1: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Terrian D.M. Ways D.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Malenka R.C. Ayoub G.S.

Neurochem. 1987; 48: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that PKC translocation from cytosol to membrane is associated with both PKC activation and enhancedl-glutamate release (32Terrian D.M. Ways D.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Son H. Madelian V. Carpenter D.O. Brain Res. 1996; 739: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Di Luca M.

Moreover, phosphorylation of PKC substrates that are selectively localized in nerve terminals, such as B-50/GAP-43 and myristoylated alanine-rich PKC substrate, has been related to neurotransmitter release (37Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N. De Wit M. Hens J.J. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1645-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N. Versteeg D.H. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J.

Among candidate protein targets for PKC that have received scrutiny are those involved in the docking/fusion process. In one such study, activation of PKC by phorbol esters induced phosphorylation of SNAP-25 and increased depolarization-dependent norepinephrine release from PC12 cells (40Shimazaki Y. Nishiki T. Omori A. Sekiguchi M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). That study and others (30Vaughan P.F. Walker J.H. Peers C. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 125-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a potential role for PKC in neuroendocrine secretion but have yielded little molecular insight into the precise effects of phosphorylation. Several studies have attempted to fill this gap by focusing on the components of the membrane fusion machinery (e.g. SNARE, SNAPs, and NSF). Those studies have demonstrated that various machinery elements can be phosphorylated in vitro with purified kinases (e.g. PKA, PKC, and CaMKII) and that the phosphorylation does affect their protein-protein interactions (30Vaughan P.F. Walker J.H. Peers C. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 125-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide the first demonstration of depolarization-induced, calcium-dependent phosphorylation of NSF in rat synaptosomes. Staurosporine, chelerythrine, bisindolylmaleimide I, calphostin C, and Ro31-8220, but not Kn-93, inhibit phosphorylation of NSF. Conversely, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment enhances phosphorylation, thus pointing to a role for PKC. In vitro, NSF is specifically phosphorylated on Ser-237 by PKC. Mutation of Ser-237 to glutamic acid or alanine yields a form of NSF that cannot be phosphorylated by PKC; however, only the S237E mutant fails to bind SNAP-SNARE complexes. From a regulatory standpoint, control of NSF activity via phosphorylation offers a unique mode to modulate trafficking fluxes. ATP and AMP-PNP were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

The composition of all buffers has been described (43Jarvie P.A. Logan T.C. Geula C. Slevin J.T. Brain Res. 1990; 508: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were resuspended in Krebs/sucrose buffer without phosphate and incubated with 32Pi (7,000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 37 °C under 95% O2, 5% CO2.32Pi-loaded synaptosomes were then placed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with either 1.5 mmCa2+ or 10 mm Mg2+. Samples were depolarized by addition of K+ (25 mm final concentration), and the process was stopped at 30 s by the addition of SDS/orthovanadate (8Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). l-Glutamate release was measured in parallel samples using an enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay (44Sihra T.S. Bogonez E. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were depolarized on addition of 25 mm KCl to an incubation mixture containing NADP (1 mm), glutamate dehydrogenase (50 units/ml), and either CaCl2 (1.5 mm) or MgCl2 (10 mm). NADPH fluorescence was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Data were accumulated at 1-s intervals using a Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences LS5B spectrofluorometer fitted with stirred, thermostated cuvettes at 37 °C. Prior to immunoprecipitation (IP), Triton X-100 was added to the solubilized samples to neutralize the SDS. Samples were then diluted in IP buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium o-vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and protein G-Sepharose beads with covalently coupled anti-NSF antibody were added (1Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). NSF was immunoprecipitated by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were harvested and washed 5 times in 0.5 ml of IP buffer; the protein-antibody complexes were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Recombinant NSF or NSF mutants (6 μg) were treated for 1 h at 25 °C with PKC (0.5 milliunits) or CaM kinase II (0.05 milliunits) and 1 mm ATP plus 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (4, 500 Ci/mmol) in PKC buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmDTT, 200 μg/ml l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, and 10 μg/ml diolein) or CaM kinase II buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 μm calmodulin) in a total reaction volume of 40 μl. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by addition of 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. The radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 40% methanol, and 10% acetic acid, washed overnight, and dried. The levels of phosphorylation were assessed by analysis with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with ImagQuant software. IP samples orin vitro phosphorylated NSF were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF (47Harrington M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The position of NSF was detected by enhanced chemifluorescence with the anti-NSF antibodies noted above using the Attophos detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).32P labeling and chemifluorescence immunodetection were quantified using PhosphorImager analysis as noted above. Radiolabeled NSF samples from in situ and in vitro labeling experiments were recovered from the PVDF membranes after Western blotting. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis after acid hydrolysis of the PVDF-blotted material as described by Duclos et al. (48Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide analysis was done on NSF that had been phosphorylated with PKC in vitro (see above). After incubation, the radiolabeled NSF was recovered by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and the pellets were washed extensively to remove unincorporated label. The protein was denatured in 4 m urea, 4m guanidine HCl, 7 mm DTT, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, then cysteine thiols derivatized by addition of 2 m acrylamide for 2 h at 37 °C. The protein was desalted by acetone precipitation and digested overnight at 37 °C in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1% (v/v) hydrogenated Triton X-100 (Calbiochem), and 10% (v/v) acetonitrile with either 1 μg of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or 0.1 μg of endoproteinase Lys C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digestion reactions were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptides were fractionated by C18 reverse phase HPLC and monitored by both UV absorbance and liquid scintillation counting. Radiolabeled peptides, thus purified, were covalently attached to acrylamide-derivatized discs (Sequelon-AA discs, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and subjected to chemical sequencing in an Applied Biosystems 494 Peptide/Protein sequencer (Foster City, CA). A portion (40%) from each cycle was analyzed directly by online HPLC to identify and quantify released phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized amino acids. The remainder was collected and monitored for 32P by Cherenkov counting using the preset 3H windows. The complex formation procedure was modified from our method described previously (29Matveeva E.A. He P. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26413-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GST-syntaxin 1 (cytosolic domain) was incubated with pre-swollen, glutathione-agarose beads (100 μg of protein per 100 μl of beads) at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EDTA. After 1 h of incubation, the beads were washed four times in the same buffer, and then equal volumes of the beads were aliquoted into the reaction tubes. Particle formation reactions were performed in a final volume of 500 μl containing 15 μl of beads with GST-syntaxin 1 in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mmimidazole, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm AMP-PNP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 10% (w/v) ovalbumin) and saturating amounts of α-SNAP and wild-type or mutant NSF. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotation, the beads were washed five times in binding buffer without ovalbumin. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using the 2E5 monoclonal antibody, which equally detects both mutant and wild-type NSF. In all cases NSF binding was SNAP-dependent. The use of purified synaptosomes, metabolically labeled with high specific activity32P-inorganic phosphate, permits direct correlation of Ca2+- and depolarization-dependent neurotransmitter release with specific protein phosphorylation events. Fig. 1 A shows PhosphorImager and enhanced chemifluorescence immunoblot analyses of SDS-PAGE resolved and blotted NSF isolated by immunoprecipitation with immobilized antibody from pre-labeled synaptosomes after various treatments. Incubation for 30 s following depolarization with 25 mm KCl in the presence of 1.5 mmCa2+ (Fig. 1 B, Ca Rel) led to substantial 32P labeling of NSF. Little 32P incorporation was observed either on depolarization in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 1 B, Mg Rel) to block calcium entry through synaptic plasma membrane calcium channels or without KCl addition to induce depolarization (Fig.1 B, Ca Pre and Mg Pre). Indeed, 32P incorporation for all controls was less than 10% that obtained with Ca2+ + K+ depolarization as judged by quantifying the relative extents of labeling under these conditions as shown in Fig. 1 B (hatched bars). It should be noted that equal amounts of NSF were recovered from the lysed rat brain synaptosomes by immunoprecipitation with either the rabbit polyclonal anti-NSF antibody used for the samples shown in Fig. 1 A or with a mouse monoclonal antibody (2E5, data not shown). In addition, no NSF protein or radiolabel was recovered with protein G-Sepharose alone. In a related experiment, no radiolabeled α-SNAP from either resting or stimulated synaptosomes was detected in immunoprecipitates using anti-α-SNAP antibodies (data not shown). The relative extents of NSF 32P labeling correlated exactly with the extents of glutamate release from synaptosomes measured under the same conditions at 30 s of incubation in the release solution (Fig. 1 B, solid bars). Depolarization in the presence of Ca2+ gave 6-fold greater glutamate release than depolarization in the presence of Mg2+, whereas release without depolarization was negligible. These data are derived from continuous release assays using the coupled glutamate dehydrogenase spectrophotometric assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Release reached a plateau value after ∼2 min in every case. The results for both phosphorylation index and glutamate release assays were highly reproducible as shown in the figure. To characterize further the nature of the Ca2+- and depolarization-dependent phosphorylation of NSF and the possible identity of the responsible protein kinase(s),32P-labeled NSF was prepared from synaptosomes treated exactly as shown in Fig. 1 A (Ca Rel) and subjected to two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis phosphoamino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis (48Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but not phosphotyrosine, were detected from thisin situ labeled NSF (Fig.2 A). This suggests the involvement of one of the many neuronal Ser/Thr protein kinases (i.e. PKC, PKA, and CaMKII). NSF contains potential kinase recognition sites for PKC, CaMKII, and casein kinase II but does not have consensus PKA sites. When recombinant NSF was labeled in vitro with purified PKC, phosphoamino acid analyses showed the presence of only phosphoserine (Fig. 2 B). Experiments have shown that CaMKII but not PKA or casein kinase II can modify NSFin vitro ((49) see Fig. 3). Protein kinase inhibitors were used to further examine the kinase(s) responsible for NSF phosphorylation in synaptosomes. Fig. 2 Cshows that the depolarization-dependent phosphorylation of NSF was inhibited by the inclus"

In search of factors that might associate with ARF to control its activity or its specificity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen.

We also show that ectopic expression of spinophilin/neurabin II inhibits the formation of G418-resistant colonies when transfected into human and mouse cell lines, regardless of p53 and ARF status. Moreover, spinophilin/ARF coexpression in Saos-2 cells, where ARF ectopic expression is ineffective, somehow results in a synergic effect. These data demonstrate a role for spinophilin in cell growth and suggest that ARF and spinophilin could act in partially overlapping pathways.

Cell. 1997; 91: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Each transcript has a specific 5′-exon, E1α or E1β, and two common exons E2 and E3. The E1α-containing transcript encodes p16INK4a, which acts as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 or 6 and prevents the phosphorylation of pRb (5Serrano M. Lee H. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), thereby maintaining an active pRb and blocking the exit from the G1 phase. The E1β-containing transcript encodes ARF (a 14-kDa polypeptide in humans, 19 kDa in mouse). Mouse and human ARF1 proteins are 45% identical through their exon 1β segments and 50% identical overall (6Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8292-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), which is a multifunctional protein that negatively regulates p53 in several ways. First, its binding interferes with p53's ability to transactivate target genes (11Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). Second, MDM2 has an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity that most likely contributes to p53 degradation (12Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). At least in vitro, ARF can interfere with this reaction (13Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), but whether this is central to ARF actions in vivo is unknown. Third, MDM2 relocalizes p53 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm where it undergoes proteosomal degradation (14Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Both mouse and human ARF are nucleolar proteins. When coexpressed with MDM2 or induced by conditional Myc expression, ARF relocalizes MDM2 to the nucleolus, preventing MDM2 shuttling and stabilizing p53 in the nucleoplasm, thereby prompting cell cycle arrest (15Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Mol.

On the other hand, the antagonism of MDM2 by ARF could potentially affect functions of proteins other than p53, such as E2F-1 (18Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. LaThangue N.B.

PP1 is one of the major serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases in eukaryotic cells (32Stralfors P. Hiraga A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) involved in controlling diverse cellular functions, including the exit from mitosis and splicing of mRNAs (33Shenolikar S.

PP1 has been implicated in the mitotic dephosphorylation of pRb (35Rubin E. Tamrakar S. Ludlow J.W. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: D1209-D1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in the dephosphorylation of specific residues of p53 (35Rubin E. Tamrakar S. Ludlow J.W.

These data suggest a role for spinophilin in cell growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidsYeast Two-hybrid ScreeningTheEcoRI/SalI fragment encoding the entire ARF (132 amino acids) was excised by p19 plasmid (3Calabro V.

The insert EcoRI/PstI was cloned in pBTM digested with the same enzymes. pBTM-ARF-(39–132) was obtained by cutting with NarI/HindIII pBTM-ARF and cloning the 436-bp fragment in pUC19 cut withAccI/HindIII (pUC19-ARF-(39–132)).

The amplification from a human cDNA brain library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) of the N-terminal region was done using two oligonucleotides ATGSP (5′-GCTCCAAGCTTCATGATGAAGACGGAG-3′) and RSPBAM (5′-ACCAGGAGATCGTTCACTTGGATCCT-3′), designed on the published sequence of the rat spinophilin (GenBank™ accession number AF016252). The 1650-bp-amplified fragment was digested withHindIII/BamHI, releasing aHindIII/BamHI fragment (1450 bp containing the spinophilin ATG) and a BamHI/BamHI fragment (200 bp, located downstream the 1450-bp fragment). The 1450-bp fragment was cloned in pGEM-B2 cut by HindIII/BamHI (pGEM-N-spino-BamHI-C-spino). The 200-bp fragment was cloned in the plasmid PGEM-N-spino-BamHI-C-spino cut byBamHI (pGEM-Spinophilin, 2500 bp). The plasmid pGEM-Spinophilin was used for coupled transcription/translationin vitro using the TnT T7 Quick-Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). pGEM-Spinophilin was sequenced, and the sequence was submitted to the Nucleotide Sequence Data base at EMBL (EMBL accession numbers AJ401189 and HSA401189).Spinophilin Deletion MutantsAll the C-terminal mutants were obtained by inverse PCR using as template pGAD10-SpinoC (encoding aa 605–813) and the common GAD10c primer (5′-CGTCTAGATATGAATCGTAGATACTGAAAAACCCCGCAAGTTC-3′). The GAD10c primer was used together with the NH-AB primer (5′-CGTCTAGATTACTCCGACTCCTCCAGAACCCGACGCTG-3′) to obtain pGAD-nH-AB (encoding aa 605–787); with the NH-A primer (5′-CGTCTAGATTAACCCCAGTAGCCTTCCAGTTTCTCCATGCG-3′) to obtain pGAD-nH-A (encoding aa 605–728); with the NH primer (5′-CGTCTAGATTACAGCTTCTCGGGCTCCATGTCCACAGG-3′) to obtain pGAD-nH (encoding aa 605–668). Inverse PCR was performed using the Long Range PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the condition suggested by the manufacturer. Amplified mutants cut byXbaI were purified, ligated, and electroporated as described previously (35Rubin E. Tamrakar S. Ludlow J.W.

An estimated 107transformants were screened. Yeasts containing interacting proteins were identified by growth on selective media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and confirmed by β-galactosidase activity. Isolated plasmids were retransformed into L40 with the negative control plasmid pBTM-galactin (a gift of L. Chiariotti) and with pBTM-ARF and tested again for growing on the selection media. Those that were negative for interaction with galactin were sequenced and DNA sequences were used to search the non-redundant GenBank™ data base using the BLAST search algorithm (37Satoh A.

The protein was further purified by gel-filtration on S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-ARF polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit using purified MBP::ARF fusion protein. Antibodies were purified by caprilic acid precipitation (38Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). To remove anti-MBP antibodies, the antibodies were subsequently loaded on MBP coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-ARF antibodies were finally purified and concentrated on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the procedure suggested by the manufacturer. Anti-ARF antibodies show a detection limit of 5 and 50 ng, respectively, for ARF and MBP (data not shown).ARF, Spinophilin, and PP1c in Vitro InteractionThe GST::SpinoC fusion protein was obtained by expression in TG1 E. coli strain transformed with pGEX-SpinoC plasmid and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by gel filtration, in PBS buffer, on Superdex 200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MBP and MBP::ARF were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on amylose-agarose (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Great Britain) followed by gel filtration, in PBS buffer, on S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 3 μg of purified MBP or MBP::ARF were mixed with the same amount of GST or GST::SpinoC in TENN buffer (50 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8, 10% NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% bovine serum albumin) and (25 μl of gel volume) amylose-agarose (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Great Britain) was added (20 min at 4 °C). The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with TENN buffer containing 1 m urea and twice with TENN buffer. Samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with anti-GST antibody (1:2000; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-goat immunoglobulin G (1:1000; Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK).His6::Xpress::PP1c was obtained by expression in TOP10 E. coli strain (Invitrogen) transformed with pBAD-PP1c plasmid. Induction and purification on nickel chelating resin (Invitrogen) was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. PP1c and MBP::ARF coprecipitation experiment was performed essentially as described above.Far WesternTwo aliquots of purified MBP::ARF were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked in PBS containing 3% dried skimmed milk (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. Filters were separately incubated with GST::SpinoC and GST (50 μg/ml, 18 h, 4 °C), followed by anti-GST polyclonal antibody (1:2000, 2 h, 37 °C) and by HRP-anti-goat immunoglobulin G (1:1000, 2 h, 37 °C). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Cell Culture, Transfection, Coimmunoprecipitation, and Cell ImagingAll cells were cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin 100 units/ml each and 10% fetal bovine serum except for NIH3T3 cultured in the same medium supplemented with 10% calf serum.For coimmunoprecipitation assay, COS-7 cells were seeded into a 6-well multiplate (2.5 × 105 cells per well) and transfected using the Superfect reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed into Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor). The lysate was passed through a 21-gauge needle, debris were removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the total amount of proteins was quantified (Bio-Rad protein assay). Equal amounts of lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen, UK; 8 h at 4 °C) and subsequently incubated with anti-ARF antibody (dilution 1:100, 2 h at 4 °C) followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl). Beads were collected by centrifugation, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer (4 °C), solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Xpress antibody (1:2000, 3 h, at room temperature; Invitrogen) followed by incubation with the HRP-anti mouse antibody (1:1000, 1 h, at room temperature; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.For imaging analysis NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells were grown on a sterilized glass coverslip (5 × 104 cells per slip) into 6-well multiplates and transfected using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde in PBS (30 min). Glass coverslips were subsequently washed twice with PBS and mounted on microscope slides with 50% glycerol in PBS. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Axiovert 100M Zeiss). A krypton-argon gas laser provided excitation at 488 nm with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence.For the CFE assay (colony formation efficiency assay) U2OS, Saos-2 (1 × 105 per well), and NIH3T3 (2 × 104 per well) cells were seeded into 6-well multiplates and transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid DNA using the standard calcium phosphate method (39Stephens D.J. Banting G. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were replated in a 100-mm dish and selected with the appropriate concentration of Geneticin (G418, Calbiochem) for 2 weeks. Saos-2 and NIH3T3 cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 and U2OS cells with 600 μg/ml G418. Medium was replenished every 3 days. Cells were fixed with 10% methanol/10% acetic acid and stained with crystal violet 15 days post-transfection. The colonies were counted. Each experiment was repeated at least four times.RESULTSIdentification of Spinophilin as an ARF-binding ProteinIn an attempt to identify human proteins that interact with ARF, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system (36Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The entire ARF cDNA was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD). As detailed under “Experimental Procedures” this construct was used as bait to screen a human brain cDNA library. From a screen of ∼107 yeast transformants, 30 colonies were scored as positive for reporter gene activity (His+LacZ+). Among 19 clones scored positive in secondary screening assays, 18 encoded a 212-amino acid polypeptide (pGAD-SpinoC), which was identified in a data base search as the human homologue of the C-terminal portion of rat spinophilin/neurabin II (31Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 37Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The last clone (pGAD-B2) differed in length only by 177 bp at the 5′-end (Fig.1 A). The full-length cDNA (EMBL accession numbers AJ401189 and HSA401189), reconstructed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” encodes a 813-amino acid long polypeptide showing 95% amino acids identity (Fig. 1 B) with the rat spinophilin/neurabin II (GenBank™ accession numberAAB72005). Performing a BLAST search on the GenBank™ data base we have also identified a cosmid derived from the human chromosome 17 (GenBank™ accession number AC002401) containing the gene sequence of human spinophilin, which consists of 12 exons spanning over a region of 15 kb. The so-called spinophilin was first identified in rat as a cellular partner of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), which is one of the main eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatases involved in the control of cell cycle progression. Rat spinophilin is characterized by an N-terminal domain (aa 1–295), in which are present various putative Src homology 3 binding motifs, and by a C-terminal domain being a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c)-negative regulator (295). Spinophilin sequence contains various protein-protein interaction signals spread throughout the whole sequence (Fig. 1 A): an F-actin binding domain (ABD), a PP1c binding site (R/K)(V/I)XF (gray triangle), a PDZ domain, and a myosin-like left handed α-helix. Both pGAD-SpinoC and pGAD-B2 encode the predicted coiled-coil region (Fig. 1 A) observed in rat spinophilin (31Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and pGAD-B2 encodes also a portion of the PDZ domain (Fig. 1 A). Both clones showed interaction with ARF in our yeast two-hybrid system, leading us to draw the conclusion that the coiled-coil region of spinophilin is the binding domain for ARF.In Vitro Binding Assays and CoimmunoprecipitationTo confirm the ARF/spinophilin interaction we performed coprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. We expressed ARF as MBP fusion (MBP::ARF) using the pMal-c2 system and the 212-amino acid C-terminal region of spinophilin (SpinoC) as glutathionS-transferase fusion (GST::SpinoC) using the pGEX system. Purified MBP::ARF or MBP were incubated with either purified GST::SpinoC or GST, and amylose-agarose beads were added. After extensive washing the bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and analyzed using anti-GST polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GST::SpinoC coprecipitated with MBP::ARF (lane 1), but not with GST (lane 2), and MBP did not bind to GST::SpinoC (lane 3). The GST::SpinoC interaction with MBP::ARF was further confirmed by far-Western blotting. Two aliquots of purified MBP::ARF were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Ponceau S staining (data not shown) confirmed the presence of an equal amount of proteins on the blots. The blots were probed, respectively, with an equal amount of GST::SpinoC and GST followed by incubation with anti-GST antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 B the anti-GST antibody only binds to the filter probed with GST::SpinoC (lane 1).Figure 2In vitro/in vivointeraction between ARF and spinophilin. A, coprecipitation experiments were performed using purified proteins. Approximately 3 μg of MBP::ARF or MBP were mixed with the same amount of GST::SpinoC or GST, and amylose-agarose was added. The beads were washed, and the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. MBP::ARF co-precipitates efficiently GST::SpinoC (lane 1) but not GST (lane 2). Furthermore, MBP does not coprecipitate GST::SpinoC (lane 3). The correct size of GST::SpinoC fusion protein is defined by an aliquot of GST::SpinoC-purified protein (lane 4).B, far-Western blotting: Two aliquots of MBP::ARF were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose paper, and separately probed with either GST::SpinoC or GST protein. Filters were subsequently incubated with anti-GST antibody. MBP::ARF binds only to GST::SpinoC (lane 1), whereas no interaction was observed using as tracer GST (lane 2). C, co-immunoprecipitation of full-length spinophilin with ARF: COS-7 cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding Xpress-tagged spinophilin or Xpress-tagged human MDM2, and/or ARF.

https://openalex.org/W2050394333,"gamma-Secretase is a membrane-associated endoprotease that catalyzes the final step in the processing of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in the release of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). The molecular identity of gamma-secretase remains in question, although recent studies have implicated the presenilins, which are membrane-spanning proteins localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Based on these observations, we have tested the hypothesis that gamma-secretase cleavage of the membrane-anchored C-terminal stump of APP (i.e. C99) occurs in the ER compartment. When recombinant C99 was expressed in 293 cells, it was localized mainly in the Golgi apparatus and gave rise to abundant amounts of Abeta. Co-expression of C99 with mutant forms of presenilin-1 (PS1) found in familial Alzheimer's disease resulted in a characteristic elevation of the Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio, indicating that the N-terminal exodomain of APP is not required for mutant PS1 to influence the site of gamma-secretase cleavage. Biogenesis of both Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) was almost completely eliminated when C99 was prevented from leaving the ER by addition of a di-lysine retention motif (KKQN) or by co-expression with a dominant-negative mutant of the Rab1B GTPase. These findings indicate that the ER is not a major intracellular site for gamma-secretase cleavage of C99. Thus, by inference, PS1 localized in this compartment does not appear to be active as gamma-secretase. The results suggest that presenilins may acquire the characteristics of gamma-secretase after leaving the ER, possibly by assembling with other proteins in peripheral membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1990290617,"Prion protein (PrP) is synthesized at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in three different topological forms as follows: a fully translocated one (secPrP) and two with opposite orientations in the membrane (NtmPrP and CtmPrP). We asked whether other signal sequences exist in the PrP, other than the N-terminal signal sequence, that contribute to its topological diversity. In vitro translocation assays showed that PrP lacking its N-terminal signal sequence could still translocate into ER microsomes, although at reduced efficiency. Deletion of each of the two hydrophobic regions in PrP revealed that the C-terminally located hydrophobic region (TM2) can function as second signal sequence in PrP. Translocation mediated by the TM2 alone can occur post-translationally and yields mainly CtmPrP, which is implicated in some forms of neurodegeneration in prion diseases. We conclude that, in vitro, PrP can insert into ER membranes co- and post-translationally and can use two different signal sequences. We propose that the unusually complex topology of PrP results from the differential utilization of two signal sequences in PrP.

Prion diseases such as scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease in man are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that can have an infectious, sporadic, or familial origin. They are characterized by the intracerebellar accumulation of PrPSc,1 an abnormally folded, aggregated version of the normal, host-encoded cellular prion protein, PrPc (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R.

Trends Cell Biol... 1994; 4: 10-14Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms leading to the structural changes in PrP are still unclear.At steady state in normal brain the 35-kDa glycoprotein PrP is anchored in the plasma membrane by a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety exposing the polypeptide to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane (4Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell.. 1987; 51: 229-240Google Scholar, 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). During early stages of biogenesis at the ER membrane, PrP can adopt more than one topological form (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar, 6Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Pruisner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature.. 1990; 343: 669-672Google Scholar). By using a cell-free translation system containing ER-derived microsomal membranes, three different topological forms have been identified (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). In addition to the fully translocated version (secPrP), which eventually gives rise to the GPI-anchored form at the plasma membrane, PrP exists in two transmembrane forms. These span the membrane with the same hydrophobic region, TM1, but in opposite orientations. The transmembrane form with the N terminus in the ER lumen has been designated NtmPrP (N-transmembrane), and the PrP form integrated in the opposite orientation has been designated theCtmPrP form (C-transmembrane). The mechanism by which the two transmembrane forms are generated is not yet known.NtmPrP is thought to form when translocation is initiated by the SS and subsequently is stopped by the TM1 segment (6Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Pruisner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature.. 1990; 343: 669-672Google Scholar). HowCtmPrP is generated is not known. It has been proposed that different components at the translocation site mediate insertion ofCtmPrP as opposed to secPrP andNtmPrP (7Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 85-91Google Scholar).In in vitro translocation assays the three topological PrP forms were produced in different amounts, with the secPrP and NtmPrP forms being about equally abundant (40–50%), and the CtmPrP form representing about 10% of translocated PrP (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). Disease-associated mutants within PrP affected the proportion of the three topological forms in vitro but also in transgenic animals expressing these mutant forms of PrP (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). These findings suggest that early stages in the biogenesis of PrP may be important for understanding the generation of some variant forms of PrP that lead to neurodegeneration.Formation of the different topological forms of PrP could involve different signal sequences in PrP. The N-terminal SS obviously mediates translocation of the N-terminal region in secPrP andNtmPrP. For generating CtmPrP the SS may not be engaged, and the TM1 or TM2 may then function as internal topogenic sequences. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether in the absence of SS other hydrophobic regions in PrP can target the protein to the ER membrane and mediate membrane insertion. We deleted the SS alone or in combination with the other hydrophobic regions and tested the resulting PrP mutants for membrane insertion and translocation in a cell-free assay.We have found that PrP contains, in addition to the SS, a second potential targeting signal at its C terminus, TM2. Targeting by TM2 occurs post-translationally and leads to the preferential formation of the CtmPrP form.DISCUSSIONThe generation of different topological forms of PrP in the ER suggests the presence of different signal sequences in PrP and the alternative use of these signals. To identify additional signal sequences in PrP, we have deleted the N-terminal signal sequence and analyzed the resulting mutant protein for the presence of a second signal sequence. We have identified the C-terminal hydrophobic region, TM2, as a signal sequence that can mediate post-translational membrane insertion. Membrane insertion mainly occurred in the Ctm orientation. When the TM2 was deleted from PrP the amount of CtmPrP was drastically reduced. We conclude from our data that the TM2 of PrP contributes significantly to the formation of the Ctm form of PrP.CtmPrP exposes the N terminus on the cytoplasmic side and spans the membrane at the internal hydrophobic region, TM1. During biosynthesis, the C-terminal TM2 region is inserted into the membrane and then cleaved and replaced by a glycolipid membrane anchor (19Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1995; 64: 563-591Google Scholar). A C-terminal hydrophobic region is also found in the so-called “tail-anchored proteins.” However, in this case the entire N-terminal part of these proteins is exposed to the cytoplasmic side, and only the small C-terminal tail is inserted into the membrane (20Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Google Scholar,21De Silvestris M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett... 1995; 370: 69-74Google Scholar). It remains to be seen what sequence characteristics determine the orientation of proteins that are inserted into the membrane by C-terminal hydrophobic regions.TM2 can mediate post-translational translocation of PrP, and this is dependent on ATP. ATP requirement has also been demonstrated for the membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins (Vamp1, Vamp2, and Vamp8) (22Kim P.K. Hollerbach C. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 36876-36882Google Scholar), and for post-translational translocation of secretory proteins inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (23Hansen W. Garcia P.D. Walter P.

Sci... 1996; 21: 122-126Google Scholar, 28Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell.. 1999; 97: 553-564Google Scholar). Binding of cytosolic Hsp70 may prevent premature folding of post-translational substrates, whereas lumenal BiP may facilitate the actual translocation process (29Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 151: 167-178Google Scholar, 30Rapoport T.A. Matlack K.E. Plath K. Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Biol. Chem... 1999; 380: 1143-1150Google Scholar).How could an N- and C-terminal signal sequence cooperate in the generation of alternative topologies? Our data suggest that the N-terminal (cotranslational) signal sequence of PrP is “inefficient,” allowing some molecules to be fully synthesized and then post-translationally translocated by using the TM2 as signal sequence. Cotranslational translocation requires that a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle, the signal recognition particle (SRP), efficiently interacts with the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide resulting in an arrest of translation. Subsequently, the complex of ribosome, nascent polypeptide and SRP contacts the SRP receptor at the ER membrane leading to the insertion of the nascent polypeptide into the membrane (31Lütcke H. Eur. J. Biochem... 1995; 228: 531-550Google Scholar, 32Rapoport T. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1996; 65: 271-303Google Scholar, 33Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol... 1994; 10: 87-119Google Scholar). We propose that multiple topologies of PrP are generated by the differential use of the two PrP signal sequences. Inefficient use of a signal sequence has been demonstrated previously for both membrane as well as secretory proteins. Functional consequence is the expression of topologically different proteins produced from the same mRNA. In the case of polytopic membrane proteins, the facultative insertion of a transmembrane region can lead to the formation of alternative membrane topologies of a single protein. One such example is the large envelope protein (L protein) of duck hepatitis B virus. Its transmembrane region I is inserted into the membrane with an efficiency of about 50% (34Swameye I. Schaller H. J. Virol... 1997; 71: 9434-9441Google Scholar). This results in cytosolically or lumenally located preS domain. On the cytosolic side preS has a role in capsid binding during virus budding, whereas in the opposite orientation it is required for receptor binding during virus infection. Another example is the generation of a secreted and a cytosolic form of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. In this case, the signal sequence functions inefficiently at two steps as follows: SRP-mediated targeting to the ER membrane and the subsequent formation of a committed translocation complex (35Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.-D. Strub K. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 468-478Google Scholar). In contrast to these proteins, where the differential utilization of a single signal sequence leads to the formation of two different topologies, we propose a model for PrP translocation where not only the N-terminal signal sequence is facultatively used but, in addition, another signal sequence at the C terminus is used post-translationally.In pPrP, about 80% of polypeptides are targeted cotranslationally by the N-terminal SS yielding secPrP andNtmPrP. According to our model, the 5% polypeptides integrated in the CtmPrP orientation would be derived from the 20% of chains not translocated cotranslationally. This implies that the translocation efficiency of TM2 in pPrP is about 25%, being 5-fold higher than in PrP-ΔSS where only 5% translocation efficiency by TM2 was achieved. Efficient post-translational translocation by TM2 therefore seems to be promoted by the presence of the N-terminal SS. Following successful SRP-mediated targeting to the ER, a proportion of PrP nascent chains may not engage in productive cotranslational translocation due to inefficient recognition of the SS by components of the translocon. PrP polypeptides that failed to translocate cotranslationally would then be a substrate for post-translational translocation by TM2.It is very likely that the synthesis of the different topological forms of PrP varies in different cell types. In addition to regulation at the level of SRP binding to SS, changes of the translocation machinery, either by expression of different regulatory factors (36Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Trends Cell Biol... 1999; 9: 132-137Google Scholar, 37Johnson A.E. Trends Cell Biol... 1997; 7: 90-95Google Scholar) or by differential modification of certain translocon components (38Gruss O.J. Feick P. Frank R. Dobberstein B. Eur. J. Biochem... 1999; 260: 785-793Google Scholar), could influence the ratio of the different PrP forms. As this could be a mechanism for the functional regulation of PrP in different cell types or under varying physiological conditions, it is possible that incorrect regulation of the translocation machinery leading to the perturbance of the delicate balance of the different forms of PrP could lead to disease. Indeed, it has already been shown that a shift of the relative ratios toward increased expression of CtmPrP resulting from changes in the PrP sequence itself can lead to neurodegenerative disease (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar, 39Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature.. 1999; 402: 822-826Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing mutant forms of PrP showed increased levels of CtmPrP, the levels of which could be correlated with the propensity of each mutant form to induce neurodegeneration (39Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature.. 1999; 402: 822-826Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear what proportion of the CtmPrP production occurred co- or post-translationally.The mechanism by which increased expression of CtmPrP leads to neurodegeneration is not yet known. In analogy to processing of the amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (40Haass C. De Strooper B. Science.. 1999; 286: 916-919Google Scholar, 41Sinha S. Lieberburg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 11049-11053Google Scholar), different cleavage products of PrP, either destroying or leaving intact the amyloidogenic region in TM1, have been identified (42Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 19173-19180Google Scholar). Very likely, if PrP is processed by potential secretases located at the ER membrane, then cleavage products could vary with different PrP topologies.It will be interesting to see if a perturbation of the balance between SS- and TM2-mediated membrane insertion of PrP is related to neurodegeneration in certain forms of prion disease. Prion diseases such as scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease in man are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that can have an infectious, sporadic, or familial origin. They are characterized by the intracerebellar accumulation of PrPSc,1 an abnormally folded, aggregated version of the normal, host-encoded cellular prion protein, PrPc (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell.. 1998; 93: 337-348Google Scholar, 2Caughey B. Chesebro B. Trends Cell Biol... 1997; 7: 56-62Google Scholar, 3Weissmann C. Trends Cell Biol... 1994; 4: 10-14Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms leading to the structural changes in PrP are still unclear. At steady state in normal brain the 35-kDa glycoprotein PrP is anchored in the plasma membrane by a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety exposing the polypeptide to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane (4Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell.. 1987; 51: 229-240Google Scholar, 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). During early stages of biogenesis at the ER membrane, PrP can adopt more than one topological form (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar, 6Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Pruisner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature.. 1990; 343: 669-672Google Scholar). By using a cell-free translation system containing ER-derived microsomal membranes, three different topological forms have been identified (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). In addition to the fully translocated version (secPrP), which eventually gives rise to the GPI-anchored form at the plasma membrane, PrP exists in two transmembrane forms. These span the membrane with the same hydrophobic region, TM1, but in opposite orientations. The transmembrane form with the N terminus in the ER lumen has been designated NtmPrP (N-transmembrane), and the PrP form integrated in the opposite orientation has been designated theCtmPrP form (C-transmembrane). The mechanism by which the two transmembrane forms are generated is not yet known.NtmPrP is thought to form when translocation is initiated by the SS and subsequently is stopped by the TM1 segment (6Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Pruisner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature.. 1990; 343: 669-672Google Scholar). HowCtmPrP is generated is not known. It has been proposed that different components at the translocation site mediate insertion ofCtmPrP as opposed to secPrP andNtmPrP (7Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 85-91Google Scholar). In in vitro translocation assays the three topological PrP forms were produced in different amounts, with the secPrP and NtmPrP forms being about equally abundant (40–50%), and the CtmPrP form representing about 10% of translocated PrP (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). Disease-associated mutants within PrP affected the proportion of the three topological forms in vitro but also in transgenic animals expressing these mutant forms of PrP (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science.. 1998; 279: 827-834Google Scholar). These findings suggest that early stages in the biogenesis of PrP may be important for understanding the generation of some variant forms of PrP that lead to neurodegeneration. Formation of the different topological forms of PrP could involve different signal sequences in PrP. The N-terminal SS obviously mediates translocation of the N-terminal region in secPrP andNtmPrP. For generating CtmPrP the SS may not be engaged, and the TM1 or TM2 may then function as internal topogenic sequences. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether in the absence of SS other hydrophobic regions in PrP can target the protein to the ER membrane and mediate membrane insertion. We deleted the SS alone or in combination with the other hydrophobic regions and tested the resulting PrP mutants for membrane insertion and translocation in a cell-free assay. We have found that PrP contains, in addition to the SS, a second potential targeting signal at its C terminus, TM2. Targeting by TM2 occurs post-translationally and leads to the preferential formation of the CtmPrP form. DISCUSSIONThe generation of different topological forms of PrP in the ER suggests the presence of different signal sequences in PrP and the alternative use of these signals. To identify additional signal sequences in PrP, we have deleted the N-terminal signal sequence and analyzed the resulting mutant protein for the presence of a second signal sequence. We have identified the C-terminal hydrophobic region, TM2, as a signal sequence that can mediate post-translational membrane insertion. Membrane insertion mainly occurred in the Ctm orientation. When the TM2 was deleted from PrP the amount of CtmPrP was drastically reduced. We conclude from our data that the TM2 of PrP contributes significantly to the formation of the Ctm form of PrP.CtmPrP exposes the N terminus on the cytoplasmic side and spans the membrane at the internal hydrophobic region, TM1. During biosynthesis, the C-terminal TM2 region is inserted into the membrane and then cleaved and replaced by a glycolipid membrane anchor (19Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1995; 64: 563-591Google Scholar). A C-terminal hydrophobic region is also found in the so-called “tail-anchored proteins.” However, in this case the entire N-terminal part of these proteins is exposed to the cytoplasmic side, and only the small C-terminal tail is inserted into the membrane (20Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Google Scholar,21De Silvestris M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett... 1995; 370: 69-74Google Scholar). It remains to be seen what sequence characteristics determine the orientation of proteins that are inserted into the membrane by C-terminal hydrophobic regions.TM2 can mediate post-translational translocation of PrP, and this is dependent on ATP. ATP requirement has also been demonstrated for the membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins (Vamp1, Vamp2, and Vamp8) (22Kim P.K. Hollerbach C. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 36876-36882Google Scholar), and for post-translational translocation of secretory proteins inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (23Hansen W. Garcia P.D. Walter P.

For some proteins it has been shown that members of the Hsp70 family of ATPases are required for membrane insertion (27Brodsky J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1996; 21: 122-126Google Scholar, 28Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell.. 1999; 97: 553-564Google Scholar). Binding of cytosolic Hsp70 may prevent premature folding of post-translational substrates, whereas lumenal BiP may facilitate the actual translocation process (29Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 151: 167-178Google Scholar, 30Rapoport T.A. Matlack K.E. Plath K. Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Biol. Chem... 1999; 380: 1143-1150Google Scholar).How could an N- and C-terminal signal sequence cooperate in the generation of alternative topologies? Our data suggest that the N-terminal (cotranslational) signal sequence of PrP is “inefficient,” allowing some molecules to be fully synthesized and then post-translationally translocated by using the TM2 as signal sequence. Cotranslational translocation requires that a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle, the signal recognition particle (SRP), efficiently interacts with the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide resulting in an arrest of translation. Subsequently, the complex of ribosome, nascent polypeptide and SRP contacts the SRP receptor at the ER membrane leading to the insertion of the nascent polypeptide into the membrane (31Lütcke H.

However, it remains unclear what proportion of the CtmPrP production occurred co- or post-translationally. The mechanism by which increased expression of CtmPrP leads to neurodegeneration is not yet known. In analogy to processing of the amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (40Haass C. De Strooper B. Science.. 1999; 286: 916-919Google Scholar, 41Sinha S. Lieberburg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 11049-11053Google Scholar), different cleavage products of PrP, either destroying or leaving intact the amyloidogenic region in TM1, have been identified (42Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 19173-19180Google Scholar). Very likely, if PrP is processed by potential secretases located at the ER membrane, then cleavage products could vary with different PrP topologies. It will be interesting to see if a perturbation of the balance between SS- and TM2-mediated membrane insertion of PrP is related to neurodegeneration in certain forms of prion disease. We thank K.

https://openalex.org/W2043827833,"The hgl5 gene of Entamoeba histolytica is negatively regulated through the upstream regulatory element 3 (URE3) DNA motif TATTCTATT. This motif is also present and significant in the function of the E. histolytica fdx gene promoter. A yeast one-hybrid screen was used to identify an E. histolytica cDNA encoding a protein (URE3-BP) that recognized this DNA motif. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence demonstrated the presence of two EF-hand motifs but identified no canonical DNA binding motifs. URE3-BP, expressed in bacteria, demonstrated Ca2+-dependent and sequence-specific recognition of the URE3 DNA sequence as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Antibodies raised against URE3-BP blocked the formation of the URE3 DNA-protein complex by native nuclear extracts. The URE3-BP protein was present in theE. histolytica nucleus and cytoplasm with an apparent molecular mass of 22.6 kDa. Our results represent the first use of a yeast genetic screen to identify, on the basis of function, a DNA-binding protein of an early branching eukaryote. Since the URE3 DNA can modulate gene expression in both a positive and negative manner, this protein may have more than one mechanism of interaction with transcriptional machinery. Characterization of URE3-BP should provide insight into transcription regulation and virulence control in this parasite.

Since the URE3 DNA can modulate gene expression in both a positive and negative manner, this protein may have more than one mechanism of interaction with transcriptional machinery. Characterization of URE3-BP should provide insight into transcription regulation and virulence control in this parasite. The eukaryotic parasite Entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are an estimated 50 million cases of invasive amebiasis annually, with an estimated 40,000–110,000 deaths each year (1Petri Jr., W.A. Vines R.R. Lyerly D. Haque R. Parasitol. Today.. 2000; 16: 320-321Google Scholar). The most common illness from E. histolytica infection is amebic dysentery, but amebic abscesses in liver, lung, and brain also occur. Disease occurs in only a minority of infections and requires parasite invasion of the intestinal epithelium. The factors responsible for the E. histolytica trophozoite invasion of the host gut cell wall, subsequent entry into the blood stream, and the formation of life-threatening tissue abscesses are not well understood. Changes inE. histolytica virulence could be mediated by changes in the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in the pathogenicity of the organism. A well characterized virulence factor of E. histolytica, the galactose- andN-acetyl-d-galactosamine-inhibitable lectin (Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin), is essential for parasite adherence and contact-mediated cytolysis. One of the genes encoding the lectin heavy subunit (hgl5), contains five major regulatory regions (upstream regulatory elements 1–5 (URE1–5))1 upstream of the core promoter (2Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol... 1996; 78: 91-103Google Scholar). Mutation of the URE3 sequence TATTCTATT (−80 to −89 base pairs upstream of the site of transcription initiation) within the 5′ hgl5 DNA results in an increase in relative promoter activity (2Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol... 1996; 78: 91-103Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of this sequence (−60 to −51 base pairs relative to site of transcription initiation) in theE. histolytica ferredoxin (fdx) promoter results in a decrease in promoter activity (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar), indicating that this sequence can mediate both positive and negative control depending on the promoter context. We have previously shown that E. histolytica nuclear protein(s) exhibit sequence-specific binding to the URE3 motif in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Amebic nuclear proteins had a higher affinity for oligonucleotides containing the URE3 motif, TATTCTATT, than oligonucleotides of identical base composition but in which this sequence had been altered (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar). Identification of the protein(s) that bind to the URE3 DNA is important not only for the elucidation of the mechanism of regulation of virulence but also for the insight this may provide into transcriptional regulation in an early branching eukaryote. TheE. histolytica core promoter for protein-encoding genes is unusual in that it consists of a novel “GAAC” element in addition to a TATA and INR (2Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol... 1996; 78: 91-103Google Scholar, 4Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 8812-8817Google Scholar, 5Singh U. Rogers J.B. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 21663-21668Google Scholar). E. histolytica UREs differ in whether they regulate transcription via the TATA or the GAAC elements; URE3 appears to utilize GAAC. 2C. A. Gilchrist, U. Singh, and W. A. Petri, Jr., unpublished results. The protein(s) binding to URE3 therefore may be particularly interesting due to potential interaction with the most divergent portion of the amebic core promoter. Here we present the first application of a yeast one-hybrid screen to identify E. histolytica sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. The URE3 DNA sequence was used as the “bait” to identify amebic cDNAs encoding proteins capable of binding to this DNA motif. Validation of the screen was accomplished by characterization of the binding specificity of the recombinantly expressed cDNA. The novel structure of the URE3-binding protein is discussed. E. histolytica strain HM1:IMSS trophozoites were grown at 37 °C in TYI-S-33 medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies) (6Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg... 1978; 72: 431-432Google Scholar). Amebas in logarithmic phase growth (∼6 × 104 trophozoites/ml) were used for nuclear extract preparation. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared by the method previously described (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the protease inhibitors 2 mm(2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane and 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride, HCl were added to both cell and nuclear lysis buffers, and dithiothreitol was omitted from the nuclear lysis buffer. Yeast one-hybrid screening for DNA sequence-specific binding proteins was used to identify proteins recognizing the URE3 motif, as previously described (7Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature.. 1993; 364: 121-126Google Scholar). In brief, three URE3 DNA motifs (underlined) AGCTTATATTCTATTGATATATTCTATTGATATATTCTATTGA were cloned between the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites of pHIS-1 (CLONTECH), placing them upstream of the yeast HIS3 gene minimal promoter to generate the plasmid p3×URE3. This vector was linearized and integrated into the yeast strain YM4271 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, leu2–3, 112, trp1–903, tyr1–501, gal4-Δ512, gal80−Δ538, ade5::hisG) (CLONTECH) by homologous recombination with the yeast genomic copy of the mutant HIS3gene to generate the URE3-bait yeast strain 1.4. A Gal4-cDNA fusion expression library was generated from E. histolyticacDNA. The cDNA was synthesized by the ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) from E. histolytica mRNA isolated using the PolyATtract® 1000 system (Promega). The cDNA was then ligated via EcoRI and XhoI linkers into the HybriZAP-2.1 vector, placing it in frame with and downstream of the Gal4 activation domain in this construct. The primary λ library was then amplified and converted by in vivo mass excision into a pAD-GAL4–2.1 library according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene). This plasmid expression library of Gal4 activation domain-E. histolytica fusion proteins was transformed into the yeast bait strain 1.4 by the methods of Agatep et al. (8Agatep R. Kirkpatrick R.D. Parchaliuk D.L. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Technical Tips Online. 1998; Google Scholar). The transformed yeast were plated on his−, leu−, ura− minimal selective medium (Difco) supplemented with 10 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) (Sigma). Transformation efficiency was determined by plating an aliquot of transformed yeast on the his−, leu−, ura− minimal selective plates in the absence of 3-AT. Approximately 1.5 × 105 cDNA clones (three E. histolytica genome equivalents) were screened. Plasmid DNA was isolated by the “smash-n-grab” method (9Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ).. 1987; 57: 267-272Google Scholar) from positive colonies, amplified via transformation of plasmid (10Seidman C.E. Struhl K. Sheen J. Jessen T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Kirkpatrick R.D. Parchaliuk D.L. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Technical Tips Online. 1998; Google Scholar). Clones that conferred the ability to grow on 10 mm 3-AT in the bait strain and not in the parent strain that lacked the p3×URE3 construct were further analyzed. The His6-tagged fusion protein expression vectors were constructed by subcloning the insert of pGAD-E. histolyticacDNA into the pRSETA vector (Invitrogen) via the linker restriction sites BamHI and XhoI. Synthesis of the recombinant His-tagged URE3-BP (URE3-binding protein) was induced inE. coli BL21(DE3) (F − ompT gal [dcm] [lon] hsdSB, (rB-mB-)) cells grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 100 μm isopropyl-thio-β-galactopyranose. The recombinant protein was affinity-purified by use of nickel-chelate resin according to the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen) and then dialyzed against DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol). The GST fusion protein was generated by subcloning the E. histolytica fragment via the linker EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites into a modified version of the vector pGEX-4X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector pGst-Parallel 1 (11Sheffield P.J. Derewenda U. Taylor J. Parsons T.J. Derewenda Z.S. Acta Crystallogr... 1999; 55: 356-359Google Scholar). This vector contains a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site between the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag and the inserted protein. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced using 10 μm isopropyl-thio-β-galactopyranose and purified from E. coli MC1061 cultures by glutathione-conjugated agarose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For mouse immunizations, the GST-URE3-BP fusion protein was allowed to remain bound to glutathione-conjugated beads in the final purification step, and URE3-BP was released by overnight incubation with 100 units of polyhistidine-tagged TEV protease (Life Technologies). Protease was removed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with 50 μl of nickel-chelate affinity resin (Qiagen). The oligonucleotideshgl5-URE3, hgl5-MUT, and Olig-1 have all been previously described (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar) and are listed in TableI. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar). In brief, to create the radiolabeled probe, complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and then labeled with the large DNA polymerase I subunit (Klenow) and [α-32P]dATP. Reactions contained 0.003 pmol of radiolabeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 2 μg of protein fromE. histolytica crude nuclear extract (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar) or 1 μg of protein purified from bacterial lysates (Qiagen). The protein-DNA interactions occurred in band shift buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% nonfat milk powder (Carnation), 3% glycerol, 0.05 mg of bromphenol blue). The reaction was incubated at room temperature (20 °C) for 20 min prior to electrophoresis on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel for 2–3 h. The gel was then fixed, dried, and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).Table IOligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift analysisOligonucleotideSequencehgl5-URE3TGTTCCAAAAAGATATATTCTATT GAAAATAAAAGAAGACAAGGTTTTTCTATATAAGATAA CTTTTATTTTCTTC1-aThe underlined nucleotides were radioactive in the labeled oligonucleotide.hgl5-MUTTGTTCCAAAAAGATTAGAATTCAA GAAAATAAAAGAAGACAAGGTTTTTCTAATCTTAAGTT CTTTTATTTTCTTCOlig-1AGAAAGCGTAATAGCTCATCTTTCGCATTATCGAGT1-a The underlined nucleotides were radioactive in the labeled oligonucleotide.

Ten micrograms of RNA was separated on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel (12Brown T. Mackey K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strhl K. Albright L.M.

Prehybridization, hybridization, and washes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA probes were labeled using random primers, [α−32P]dATP, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies). Message levels were determined by PhosphorImager exposure. A female BALB/c-strain mouse was immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg of TEV protease-cleaved URE3-BP emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Two weeks and 4 weeks later, the mouse was boosted with 100 μg of TEV-cleaved URE3-BP in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. One week after the last boost, ∼0.2 ml of blood was obtained by retro-orbital puncture. Nonimmune serum was obtained from a BALB/c mouse that had not been immunized. Immunoblots were performed by first electrophoresing 5 ng of recombinant protein or 60 μg of amebic nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp.), incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in blot wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The blot was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mouse antiserum diluted 1:750 in 2% nonfat dry milk in blot wash buffer. After three 5-min washes, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:1000. The secondary antibody was detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was visualized by exposure of the blot to BioMax MR-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy were performed onE. histolytica trophozoites by the methods of Voigt et al. (13Voigt H. Olivo J.C. Sansonetti P. Guillen N. J. Cell Sci... 1999; 112: 1191-1201Google Scholar) and Vines et al. (14Vines R.R. Ramakrishnan G. Rogers J.B. Lockhart L.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1998; 9: 2069-2079Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 105 amebas/sample were washed in M199S medium (M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 25 mmHEPES, pH 6.8, 5 mml-cysteine, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and allowed to adhere onto acetone-washed coverslips for 15 min at 37 °C. Amebas were washed with warmed phosphate-buffered saline once, fixed in 3.75% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 60 s at room temperature. Samples were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with 50 mm ammonium chloride. Amebas were incubated with blocking agent (5% bovine serum albumin with 20% goat serum (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline) for 60 min. Mouse anti-URE3-BP serum was used at a dilution of 1:100 and incubated for 60 min. Bound antibody was detected using a 1:64 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). Nonimmune serum used as a negative control was also used at a 1:100 dilution. As a positive control, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the E. histolytica Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin were diluted 1:100 and detected by CyTM3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Amebas were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using Gel/MountTM (BioMeda). Amebas were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 410 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser. To generate final images, four averages at 4 s each were compiled using a Zeiss × 63 plan-apochromat objective (numeric aperture, 1.40) with laser excitation at 488 nm appropriate for fluorescein isothiocyanate and 568 nm appropriate for CyTM3. The sequence was compared with the GenBankTM sequence library using the FASTA program on the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) (15Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1994; 19: 258-260Google Scholar) and the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol... 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Sequences were otherwise analyzed using the Wisconsin Package, version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software. To use the yeast one-hybrid system to identify a URE3-binding protein, we first inserted an oligonucleotide containing three copies of the URE3 DNA motif upstream of the yeast minimal promoter that controls the expression of the HIS3 gene in the plasmid pHis-1. The oligonucleotide containing the trimer had been shown to compete for URE3-specific binding in crude E. histolytica nuclear extracts with an affinity at least equal to the URE3 monomer (data not shown). We integrated the new construct into the genome of the histidine (His) auxotrophic strain YM4271 to create the bait yeast strain 1.4. An increase in minimal promoter activity due to binding of a protein to the 5′ URE3 sequences that contains the Gal4 activation domain was monitored on plates containing the competitive inhibitor (3-AT) of the product of the HIS3 gene His3p. The yeast Gal4 activation domain-E. histolytica cDNA fusion proteins were introduced into strain 1.4, and approximately three genome equivalents of E. histolytica (1.5 × 105 fusion constructs) were screened for proteins that can bind to the URE3 DNA trimer. In the first screen, 281 positive clones were identified, but only four were capable of reconferring the selectable phenotype (growth on his−, leu−, ura− minimal selective medium supplemented with 10 mm 3-AT) upon retransformation of the bait strain. Only one of the four candidates (pGAL4-URE3-BP; Fig.1) was independently positive for URE3 binding in other assays (see below). The plasmid pGAL4-URE3-BP required the URE3 DNA “bait” to confer growth on 3-AT, since the parental yeast strain YM4271 transfected with pGAL-URE3-BP did not grow on leu− minimal selective medium supplemented with 10 mm 3-AT (data not shown). The complete sequence of the 0.7-kilobase insert contained in pGAL4-URE3-BP is shown in Fig. 2. We found considerable identity (98%) between 512 base pairs of URE3-BP and an E. histolytica expressed sequence tag entry AB002727 (Fig. 2,underlined region), previously identified by Tanaka et al. (17Tanaka T. Tanaka M. Mitsui Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1997; 236: 611-615Google Scholar) during analysis of E. histolytica cDNA. An open reading frame of 670 base pairs encoded a protein with a calculated mass of 25.8 kDa. The presence of EF-hand motifs (Fig. 2,boldface type) was identified by use of the ExPASy ScanProsite Program (15Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1994; 19: 258-260Google Scholar). The presence of this motif has been strongly correlated with calcium binding activity (18Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile.. 1995; 2: 297-490Google Scholar). A potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (19Patschinsky T. Hunter T. Esch F.S. Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1982; 79: 973-977Google Scholar, 20Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem... 1984; 259: 7835-7841Google Scholar, 21Woodgett J.R. Gould K.L. Hunter T. Eur. J.

Chem... 1985; 260: 12492-12499Google Scholar, 23Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1990; 1054: 267-284Google Scholar) were also recognized by this program (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis of E. histolytica total RNA with URE3-BP probes identified a unique message of 0.67 kilobases in size (Fig. 3 A). The close agreement between the observed mRNA size and the size predicted from the E. histolytica URE3-BP cDNA clone (0.7 kilobases) were consistent with the cDNA clone being full-length. The short 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the URE3-BP mRNA are a characteristic of E. histolytica mRNAs (2Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol... 1996; 78: 91-103Google Scholar, 24Bruchhaus I. Leippe M. Lioutas C. Tannich E. DNA Cell Biol... 1993; 12: 925-933Google Scholar). The URE3-binding protein (URE3-BP) was synthesized in E. coli with an amino-terminal GST fusion protein. TEV cleavage of the purified protein removed the GST domain; the remaining 1.49 kDa of linker peptide increased the calculated protein mass to 27.2 kDa. The observed molecular mass of this protein in both Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown) and Western blots was 24.3 kDa (L-URE3-BP, Fig. 3 B). Serum raised against this URE3-BP fusion protein identified a protein of ∼22.6 kDa in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts ofE. histolytica proteins (Fig. 3 B). A comparison of band intensities of a known amount of synthesized URE3-BP protein with those that resulted after loading a known quantity of nuclear extract permitted the rough estimation that URE3-BP constituted 0.01% of the protein present in nuclear extracts. Since the method used to prepare the nuclear extracts does not completely exclude cytoplasmic protein contamination, immunofluorescence techniques were used to confirm the location of URE3-BP within the cell. The Gal/GalNac-inhibitable lectin, which is located on both the cell surface and the cytoplasm but not in the trophozoite nucleus (14Vines R.R. Ramakrishnan G. Rogers J.B. Lockhart L.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1998; 9: 2069-2079Google Scholar), was used as a positive control (Fig.4 B). The URE3-BP (Fig.4 A) was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. URE3-BP also appeared to be membrane-associated (Fig.4 D). EMSA was used to determine whether the E. coli-expressed URE3-BP could bind in vitro to DNA containing the URE3 sequence (Fig. 5). The URE3-BP protein was incubated with a double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the DNA sequence spanning the URE3 binding motif present within the hgl5 promoter. Increasing concentrations (10× and 60×) of unlabeled hgl5-URE3, hgl5-MUT, or a nonspecific oligonucleotide (Olig-1) were added as competitors to the binding reactions as indicated. Competition with unlabeled self was demonstrated at a 10-fold excess of radiolabeled oligonucleotide (Fig.5, lane 3). The URE3-mutated oligonucleotides, in which the sequence TTAGAATTC replaced the URE3 motif TTATCTTAT, competed less well and had to be added at higher concentrations to interfere with the formation of the specific protein complex (lane 6). The amount of DNA-protein complex formed was dependent on the concentration of recombinant URE3-BP added to the assay (data not shown). The addition of an irrelevant oligonucleotide control (Olig-1) (Fig. 5,lanes 7 and 8) did not affect the formation of the DNA-protein complex. Control extracts identically prepared from bacteria transformed with either pRSET-Eh1 (an irrelevant pRSETA-E. histolytica cDNA construct) or vector alone had no gel shift ability (data not shown). The results from these experiments indicated that URE3-BP exhibited sequence-specific binding to the URE3 DNA motif. Since analysis of the URE3-BP protein had revealed the presence of two EF-hand domains (Fig. 2), we next examined the effect of Ca2+ on the ability of URE3-BP to form DNA-protein complexes. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis performed in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA showed that the addition of Ca2+markedly decreased the formation of the recombinant DNA-protein complex (Fig. 6). To determine whether URE3-BP was a component of the gel shift complex of URE3 DNA with native E. histolytica nuclear protein(s), antibodies raised against URE3-BP were incubated with the hgl5-URE3 DNA-E. histolytica nuclear extract complex. An antibody binding to the transcription factor may form a larger antibody-protein-DNA complex and hence a more highly retarded “supershift” in the EMSA, or it may prevent or destabilize the DNA/protein interaction, resulting in an inhibition EMSA. The addition of increasing concentrations (0.25 and 1 μl) of antiserum from mice immunized with URE3-BP but not with nonimmune serum interfered with the formation of URE3-DNA-E. histolytica nuclear protein complexes (Fig.7). (For these gel shifts, dithiothreitol was excluded from the gel shift buffer, so as not to reduce and denature the antibodies. This resulted in two DNA-protein complexes on EMSA as opposed to the single complex seen in previous work (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar). The main conclusion of this paper is that URE3-BP, an E. histolytica protein, binds specifically to the TATTCTATT (URE3) DNA motif. This sequence is important in the regulation of at least twoE. histolytica genes, the hgl5 encoding the heavy subunit of the Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin (2Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol... 1996; 78: 91-103Google Scholar) and the fdxgene encoding ferredoxin (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar). We have tested and validated the use of a genetic approach to identify the E. histolytica proteins that bind to a target sequence. We have also confirmed that URE3-BP is present in the trophozoite nucleus, and therefore its sequence-specific DNA binding activity is of biological significance. Proof that URE3-BP bound to the URE3 sequence was determined by 1) the ability of the Gal4-URE3-BP fusion protein to reconfer the selectable phenotype (growth on 3-AT-containing media in the yeast bait strain); 2) the ability of recombinant URE3-BP to bind to URE3 DNA in vitro in electrophoretic mobility shift assays; and 3) the ability of antibodies raised against URE3-BP to block the electrophoretic mobility shift of native protein. Recent examples of antibody-inhibited DNA-protein complex formation include the effect of anti-GABP antibodies (25Li X.R. Chong A.S.-F. Wu J. Roebuck K.A. Kumar A. Parrillo J.E. Rapp U.R. Kimberly R.P. Williams J.W. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35203-35210Google Scholar), anti-YY antibodies (26Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Terenius L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1997; 231: 135-139Google Scholar) and anti-dioxin receptor antibodies (27Mason G.G. Witte A.M. Whitelaw M.L. Antonsson C. McGuire J. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 4438-44349Google Scholar) on their respective DNA-protein complexes. The URE3-BP antibody interference result is therefore consistent with URE3-BP being the major nuclear protein recognizing URE3. The amino acid sequence deduced for URE3-BP has little similarity to other known DNA-binding proteins. It has potential phosphorylation sites that may be important in its function. The EF-hand protein motifs that occur in URE3-BP are present in the calcium-binding human transcription factor, downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) (28Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature.. 1999; 398: 80-84Google Scholar). DREAM, like URE3-BP, is a DNA-binding protein that does not contain an easily recognized consensus DNA binding motif. There are, however, no other significant regions of similarity between the two proteins that might suggest the location of a new DNA binding motif in EF-hand-containing proteins. Fluxes in the amount of intracellular ions are important signals and determinants of gene expression in later branching eukaryotes. DNA binding of the DREAM transcription factor is blocked by calcium. Calcium also decreased the affinity of recombinant URE3-BP for DNA as measured by EMSA. Relatively high concentrations of Ca2+were required to block the binding of DNA by URE3-BP in comparison with DREAM (100–500 μm versus 5–10 μm). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of native nuclear extracts showed that ∼500 μm Ca2+was also required to block binding of the nuclear protein to URE3 DNA (data not shown), consistent with the recombinant His-tagged URE3-BP protein behaving in a manner similar to the nuclear URE3 binding complex. Calcium fluxes have been observed in E. histolytica(29Carbajal M.E. Manning-Cela R. Pina A. Franco E. Meza I. Exp. Parasitol... 1996; 82: 11-20Google Scholar) and therefore could regulate URE3-BP possibly via direct binding to the EF-hand motifs or, as in later branching eukaryotes, by calcium-dependent phosphorylation of the URE3-BP protein (30Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 31102-31107Google Scholar, 31Cowley D.O. Graves B.J. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 366-376Google Scholar). The in situ localization of URE3-BP indicated that this protein was located not only in the nucleus and cytoplasm but also associated with the trophozoite membrane (indicated by the colocalization of the lectin and URE3-BP staining (Fig.4 D)). The presence of URE3-BP in the cytoplasm and cell membrane may enable it to act as an intracellular messenger and transcription factor. Examples of transcription factors with this dual function include the estrogen receptor transcription factor ERF, membrane-associated transcription factor ςK (32Stragier P. Losick R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 241-297Crossref Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (33Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell.. 1997; 89: 331-340Google Scholar). Cytoplasm to nuclear translocation of transcription factors can be regulated by several different mechanisms, such as proteolytic processing (ςK and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (32Stragier P. Losick R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 241-297Crossref Scopus (514) Google Scholar,33Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell.. 1997; 89: 331-340Google Scholar)), phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (NF-AT4 (34Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell.. 1998; 93: 851-861Google Scholar)), and association with cofactors (NF-κB (35Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 1014-1019Google Scholar)). Because transcriptional activation mediated through the URE3 DNA motif in the fdxpromoter is modulated by serum deprivation (3Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun... 1998; 66: 2383-2386Google Scholar), it is possible that the activity of the URE3-BP may be controlled by environmental and intracellular factors. It is tempting to speculate that URE3-BP activity may be regulated in part by its location within the cell. The elucidation of URE3-BP regulation promises to provide some of the first insights into the transcriptional regulation of virulence in this early branching eukaryote.

https://openalex.org/W2059209288,"SAP-1 (stomach cancer-associated protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1) is a transmembrane-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase that is abundant in the brain and certain cancer cell lines. With the use of a “substrate-trapping” approach, p130cas, a major focal adhesion-associated phosphotyrosyl protein, has now been identified as a likely physiological substrate of SAP-1. Expression of recombinant SAP-1 induced the dephosphorylation of p130cas as well as that of two other components of the integrin-signaling pathway (focal adhesion kinase and p62dok) in intact cells. In contrast, expression of a substrate-trapping mutant of SAP-1 induced the hyperphosphorylation of these proteins, indicating a dominant negative effect of this mutant. Overexpression of SAP-1 induced disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton as well as inhibited various cellular responses promoted by integrin-mediated cell adhesion, including cell spreading on fibronectin, growth factor-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, and colony formation. Finally, the enzymatic activity of SAP-1, measured with an immunocomplex phosphatase assay, was substantially increased by cell-cell adhesion. These results suggest that SAP-1, by mediating the dephosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated substrates, negatively regulates integrin-promoted signaling processes and, thus, may contribute to contact inhibition of cell growth and motility.

Tyrosine phosphorylation is tightly controlled by coordination of the activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made in our understanding of the structure, function, and regulation of protein-tyrosine kinases, PTPs are less well characterized. Similar to protein-tyrosine kinases, PTPs can be divided into two structurally distinct subgroups: cytoplasmic PTPs and transmembrane-type (receptor-like) PTPs (RPTPs) (2Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Despite their marked diversity in overall structure, all PTPs possess a core sequence (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G that contains conserved cysteine and arginine residues critical for enzymatic activity (3Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 12: 1043-1053Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The cellular functions of PTPs are thought to be determined by their substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and interaction with other signaling molecules. Although initial observations of the effects of overexpression of PTPs suggested that these enzymes might simply counteract the signaling events elicited by protein-tyrosine kinases, more recent genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that PTPs play more complex roles in a wide range of cellular activities (4Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). For example, SHP-1 and SHP-2, two Src homology 2 domain-containing cytoplasmic PTPs play negative and positive regulatory roles, respectively, in protein-tyrosine kinase signaling (6Adachi M. Fischer E.H. Ihle J. Imai K. Jirik F. Neel B. Pawson T. Shen S.H. Thomas M. Ullrich A. Zhao Z. Cell. 1996; 85: 15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Members of the band 4.1 family of cytoplasmic PTPs, including PTPH1 and PTPMEG, are thought to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization (7Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8Gu M.X. York J.D. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5867-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, the RPTP PTPα affects cell-substratum adhesion and cellular transformation by regulating the activity of the protein-tyrosine kinase Src (9Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Finally, members of the LAR family of RPTPs, including PTPς (10Wallace M.J. Batt J. Fladd C.A. Henderson J.T. Skarnes W. Rotin D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and PTPδ (11Sommer L. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as well as Drosophila DLAR and the related DPTP69D (12Desai C.J. Gindhart Jr., J.G. Goldstein L.S. Zinn K.

Cell. 1996; 84: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), are essential for axon guidance or neuronal differentiation in the developing nervous system. We have previously cloned a human RPTP termed SAP-1 (stomach cancer-associated PTP-1) (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme contains a single catalytic domain in the cytoplasmic region, a single transmembrane domain, and eight fibronectin type III-like domains in the extracellular region. SAP-1 belongs to the class 2 subfamily of RPTPs (15Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which includes HPTPβ (15Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), DEP-1 (16Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), PTP-U2 (17Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar), and DrosophilaDPTP10D (18Yang X.H. Seow K.T. Bahri S.M. Oon S.H. Chia W. Cell. 1991; 67: 661-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Tian S.S. Tsoulfas P. Zinn K. Cell. 1991; 67: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The observations that the fibronectin type III-like domain is present in many neural cell adhesion molecules and that SAP-1 is abundant in the brain suggest that this PTP plays a role in neural cell-cell adhesion signaling (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SAP-1 is also abundant in a subset of pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines and tissues but not in their normal counterparts (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Seo Y. Matozaki T. Tsuda M. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SAP-1 gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 19, at position q13.4, which is close to the locus of the gene for carcinoembryonic antigen at 19q13.2 (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of SAP-1 may thus also be associated with cancer development. However, the biological roles of this PTP remain unknown. The identification of physiological substrates of PTPs provides important insight into the functions of these enzymes. However, substrate identification for this class of enzymes has proved problematic because of the low affinity and transient nature of the interaction of PTPs with their substrates. A recently developed substrate-trapping strategy has overcome this limitation and greatly facilitated isolation of specific substrates of PTPs (21Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17806-17812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). With the use of this strategy, we have now identified p130cas, a major phosphotyrosyl protein that is localized to focal adhesions (FAs), as a potential substrate of SAP-1. We also provide evidence that SAP-1 negatively regulates various integrin-promoted cellular responses and that the enzymatic activity of this PTP is up-regulated by cell-cell adhesion. The cDNAs encoding a catalytically inactive mutant of SAP-1 (SAP-1C/S), in which Cys1022 is replaced by Ser, and a substrate-trapping mutant of SAP-1 (SAP-1D/A), in which Asp988 is replaced by Ala, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with human SAP-1 cDNA as a template and a transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The full-length wild-type and mutant SAP-1 cDNAs were then inserted separately into theHindIII site of the pRc/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen). The pSRα vector encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged p130caswas kindly provided by H. Hirai (University of Tokyo), the pBabe vector encoding Myc-tagged paxillin-α was provided by H. Sabe (Osaka Bioscience Institute), the pRc/CMV vector encoding HA-tagged focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was provided by S. K. Hanks (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), and the pcDNA3 vector encoding HA-tagged extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was provided by J. S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The pRc/CMV vector encoding HA-tagged mouse p62dok was generated as described (25Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing wild-type SAP-1 (SAP-1WT) or SAP-1C/S were generated as described previously (26Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and the expression level of each SAP-1 protein was determined by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies to SAP-1 as described below. CHO-K1 cells and the established cell lines were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293 human embryonic kidney cells, Panc-1 cells, WiDr cells, Swiss 3T3 cells, and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of CHO-K1 cells or 293 cells (∼2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) was performed with the use of a CellPhect Transfection Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SAP-1 (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3G5 to SAP-1 were generated in response to a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1 in our laboratory. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p62dok were described previously (25Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mAb 12CA5 to the HA epitope tag and the mAb 9E10 to the Myc tag were purified from the culture supernatants of mouse hybridoma cells. Mouse mAbs to p130cas, to paxillin, and to β-catenin were obtained from Transduction Laboratories; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p130cas or to FAK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit polyclonal antibodies that react specifically with tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK or with total ERK protein were from New England BioLabs; a mouse mAb to vinculin was from Sigma; fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep polyclonal antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin and Texas red-conjugated donkey polyclonal antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells were thawed on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 5 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of beads) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of WG buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis with various antibodies was performed with the use of the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cytoplasmic regions of SAP-1WT, SAP-1C/S, and SAP-1D/A were produced as GST fusion proteins. The polymerase chain reaction was performed with wild-type or mutant SAP-1 cDNA as template and with 5′-TAGGATCCCCAGGGGACATCCCAGCTGAAG (nucleotides 2436–2457 of SAP-1 cDNA) and 5′-TCGAATTCGGGCTGCCGACCCAGCCCCCTCG (nucleotides 3400–3422) as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The amplification products were digested with BamHI andEcoRI and inserted in-frame into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The encoded GST fusion proteins were then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with the use of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant full-length SHP-2 was prepared as described previously (26Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Panc-1 cells in one 100-mm dish were treated with 100 μm pervanadate for 30 min and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm leupeptin, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 5 mm iodoacetic acid. After incubation of the lysate for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mmto inactivate any unreacted iodoacetic acid. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads conjugated with 10 μg of recombinant SAP-1 protein. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, and bound material was subjected to immunoblot analysis. In some experiments, 1 mm orthovanadate was included during the incubation of beads with lysate. Lysates from pervanadate-treated Panc-1 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation; the resultant precipitates containing tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The dephosphorylation reaction was performed by incubating the filter in the absence or presence of recombinant SAP-1 or SHP-2 for 20 min at 30 °C in a solution containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.1), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA. The filter was then washed for 5 min at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of each protein was determined by immunoblot analysis with mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine. Cells were detached from the culture dish by treatment with 0.025% trypsin, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. The cells were replated in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml on 60-mm culture dishes coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) or poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) (Sigma). The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2, after which they were examined under a light microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (model IX 70; Olympus), and random fields were photographed at a total magnification of 200×. The cDNAs encoding SAP-1WT or SAP-1C/S were cloned separately into the SwaI site of pAxCAwt (27Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), which contains the CAG promoter, and the resulting constructs were introduced together with DNA-terminal protein complex by transfection into 293 cells. The resulting recombinant adenoviruses were screened by immunoblot analysis and cloned by limiting dilution. Adenoviral vectors were propagated by a standard procedure, purified by two rounds of CsCl density gradient centrifugation, and then titrated with a limiting dilution assay in 293 cells. Swiss 3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips in a 6-well plate were infected with viruses at 37 °C for 1 h, with brief agitation every 20 min, and were then exposed to normal growth medium. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated for 2 h with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mAb 3G5 to SAP-1 (1 μg/ml) or with polyclonal antibodies to SAP-1 (1 μg/ml), together with either rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (0.1 μg/ml) (Sigma) or a mAb to vinculin (20 μg/ml). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were examined under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (model MRC-1024; Bio-Rad), and built-up images were constructed. Transfected 293 cells (60-mm dishes) were deprived of serum for 12 h and then incubated for 5 min with 10 μm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Sigma) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (100 ng/ml) (Calbiochem) or for 10 min with 1 μm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma). Cells were then lysed in 400 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Recombinant ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with mAb 12CA5 to the HA tag and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for activated ERK or for total ERK protein. The extent of ERK2 phosphorylation was quantified by scanning densitometry with the NIH Image program. CHO-K1 cells or NIH 3T3 cells (∼2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pRc/CMV containing (or not) SAP-1WT or SAP-1C/S cDNA. After 48 h, transfected cells were diluted 1:20 with normal growth medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml) and cultured in 100-mm dishes. The medium was changed every 3 days, and, after 14 days, cells that had formed colonies were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. The efficiency of colony formation was quantified by scanning densitometry with the NIH Image program. The enzymatic activity of recombinant SAP-1 was assayed with p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) as a substrate as described previously (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular SAP-1 activity immunopurified with mAb 3G5 was assayed with pNPP as described previously (28Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). All data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. To identify physiological substrates of SAP-1, we first generated two types of SAP-1 mutant: a catalytically inactive mutant, in which the invariant Cys1022 residue is replaced by Ser, and a substrate-trapping mutant, in which the invariant Asp988 residue is replaced by Ala. The latter mutant was expected to be a more powerful tool than was the former because it should not only be catalytically inactive but also retain the ability to bind SAP-1 substrates (22Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). We then prepared GST fusion proteins that contain the catalytic domains of wild-type SAP-1 (GST-SAP-1WT), catalytically inactive SAP-1 (GST-SAP-1C/S), or the substrate-trapping mutant of SAP-1 (GST-SAP-1D/A). Each recombinant protein was expressed in and purified from bacteria as a 60-kDa polypeptide, as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 A). Whereas GST-SAP-1WT exhibited substantial catalytic activity with the artificial substrate pNPP, GST-SAP-1C/S and GST-SAP-1D/A possessed virtually no activity (Fig.2 A). Each of the three recombinant proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was then incubated with lysates prepared from pervanadate-treated Panc-1 cells, which express SAP-1 (14Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis with the mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine revealed that GST-SAP-1D/A, but not GST-SAP-1WT or GST alone, precipitated several phosphotyrosyl proteins with molecular sizes of 190, 125–135, 75–85, and 55 kDa (hereafter referred to as p190, p125–135, p75–85, and p55, respectively) (Fig. 1 B). GST-SAP-1C/S precipitated a similar group of proteins, although to a much lesser extent than did GST-SAP-1D/A (Fig. 1, B andC). The amounts of p190, p125–135, p75–85, and p55 bound to GST-SAP1D/A were markedly reduced by incubation of cell lysates with the recombinant protein in the presence of vanadate, a potent inhibitor of PTPs; in contrast, the amounts of these proteins bound to GST-SAP-1C/S were substantially increased by incubation with vanadate (Fig. 1 C). Vanadate ions interact directly with the thiolate anion of the cysteine residue in the catalytic core sequence of PTPs and thereby block enzyme-substrate association (29Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). These results thus suggest that all of the detected phosphotyrosyl proteins might bind, either directly or indirectly, to the active site of SAP-1. To identify p125–135, we subjected the proteins precipitated by GST-SAP-1D/A to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for either FAK, Ras GTPase-activating protein, or p130cas, all of which are in the size range of 125–135 kDa and are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Of these antibodies, the polyclonal antibodies to p130cas specifically recognized a 125- to 135-kDa protein that bound to GST-SAP-1D/A (Fig. 1 D). A mAb to p130casthat recognizes a distinct epitope of the protein also reacted with p125–135 (data not shown). These results suggest that p125–135 might be p130cas. We also tested the ability of antibodies to paxillin, cortactin, or SHP-2 to recognize p75–85. A mAb to paxillin specifically reacted with a 75–85-kDa protein that bound to GST-SAP-1D/A (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that p75–85 might be paxillin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the p125–135 and p75–85 bands contain additional unidentified proteins. The identities of p190 and p55 remain unknown. We next examined whether SAP-1 dephosphorylates p130cas and paxillin in vitro. The catalytic activity of GST-SAP-1WT with pNPP as substrate was markedly greater than that of the recombinant SHP-2 used as a control (Fig. 2 A). Tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of p130cas and paxillin immunopurified from pervanadate-treated Panc-1 cells were also incubated with equal amounts of activity of GST-SAP-1WT and GST-SHP-2, after which their phosphorylation status was determined. GST-SAP-1WT effectively dephosphorylated p130cas and, to a lesser extent, paxillin; in contrast, GST-SHP-2 or GST alone had virtually no effect on the extent of phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig.2 B). The human RPTP PTPκ dephosphorylates β-catenin (31Fuchs M. Muller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); however, SAP-1 did not exhibit detectable catalytic activity with β-catenin as substrate (Fig. 2 B). Together, these results indicate that SAP-1 selectively dephosphorylates p130cas and, to a lesser extent, paxillin in vitro. We also examined whether SAP-1 dephosphorylates p130cas and paxillin in intact cells. We subjected 293 cells to transient transfection with expression vectors encoding SAP-1 and either HA-tagged p130cas (HA-Cas) or Myc epitope-tagged paxillin-α and then evaluated the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of each tagged recombinant protein. Wild-type SAP-1 (SAP-1WT) expressed in these cells possessed substantial catalytic activity, whereas the catalytically inactive mutant (SAP-1C/S) or the substrate-trapping mutant (SAP-1D/A) did not, as revealed by an immunocomplex phosphatase assay using mAb 3G5 to SAP-1 (data not shown). Coexpression of SAP-1WT, but not that of SAP-1C/S, markedly reduced the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-Cas (Fig.3 A), suggesting that SAP-1 dephosphorylates p130cas in intact cells. In contrast, coexpression of SAP-1D/A markedly increased the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-Cas. The presence of equal amounts of recombinant SAP-1 proteins in the different transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to SAP-1 (Fig. 3 F). Given that substrate-trapping mutants of PTPs often induce hyperphosphorylation of the corresponding substrates (21Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Coexpression of SAP-1WT also reduced the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin-α; however, the substrate-trapping mutant did not increase the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein (Fig. 3 B). Thus, paxillin might not be a physiological substrate of SAP-1. p130casundergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during integrin-mediated cell adhesion and mediates the assembly of FAs (32Nojima Y.

https://openalex.org/W2102950730,"We analyzed the influence of the atherogenic oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) on the activity of the platelet prothrombinase complex, a major contributor to overall thrombin formation in vivo. Platelet dependent thrombin generation was found to be strongly stimulated by in vitro oxidized LDL. The enhancement was additive to that observed with the platelet agonist thrombin. Oxidized LDL increased the platelet binding of annexin-V, suggesting that the augmented surface exposure of aminophospholipids promoted the prothrombinase activity. All of the stimulatory activity of the oxidized LDL could be recovered in the microemulsions prepared from the lipid portion of the modified particles. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared containing the total lipids of the oxidized LDL but lacking specifically in one lipid component. Following the selective removal of the ethanolamine phospholipids (PE) from the LDL lipids, the platelet-dependent thrombin formation was markedly reduced. Vesicles enriched with the isolated PE fraction alone enhanced the thrombin generation. Analyses with autoxidized phospholipids indicated that oxidation products of unsaturated diacyl-PE were mainly responsible for the increased prothrombinase activity. Oxidized LDL and its PE fraction lost their stimulatory activity after treatment with NaCNBH3, a chemical reductant of Schiff base adducts. Phospholipid vesicles supplemented with synthetic aldehyde-PE adducts largely reproduced the stimulation of the thrombin generation. We conclude that the oxidized LDL particles elicit a pronounced prothrombotic response by increasing the activity of the platelet prothrombinase complex. Specific oxidative modifications of the LDL-associated ethanolamine phospholipids are mainly responsible for this stimulation.

Thrombin catalyzes the formation of fibrin from fibrinogen and amplifies the coagulation process through the proteolytic activation of factors V, VIII, and XI. By means of the proteolysis of specific cell membrane receptors, thrombin activates platelets and regulates multiple cellular processes such as proliferation and chemotaxis (1Preissner K.T. Nawroth P.P. Kanse S.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Coughlin S.R. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The rapid formation of thrombin from prothrombin is thought to be mediated mainly by the prothrombinase complex assembled on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of the activated platelets. There is general agreement that under in vivo conditions this complex mediates the large scale synthesis of thrombin. The assembly of factors Va and Xa on the platelet surface is most probably triggered initially by the translocation of aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS)1 from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane (3Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. van Rijn J.L. Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The appearance of specific phospholipids on the platelet surface facilitates the interaction of factor Va with the platelet cell membrane. This, in turn, enables the binding of factors Xa and II (prothrombin), thereby allowing the proteolysis of prothrombin to thrombin as catalyzed by factor Xa. High local concentrations of thrombin within and around the atherosclerotic plaque (4Fuster V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggest that the protease may also be of importance for the development of thrombosis. Because arterial thrombosis is the major single cause of mortality in industrialized countries, the elucidation of the mechanisms causing the increased formation of thrombin is of particular interest. According to recent evidence, coronary thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction is in most cases induced by a thrombus that develops following the rupture of a lipid-rich, unstable atherosclerotic plaque (5Zaman A.G. Helft G. Worthley S.G. Badimon J.J. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 149: 251-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The nature of the lipidic material present in the unstable plaque is apparently of great relevance for the extent of pathological activation of coagulation. Among other components, the plaques are enriched with oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL). Substantial evidence obtained over the last decade suggests a causal role for oxidized LDL in the development of atherosclerosis (6Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Recent data, moreover, support the view that oxidized LDL may also directly promote thrombogenesis. This hypothesis is based on results demonstrating that oxidized LDL are able to promote the initiation of coagulation by enhancing the expression of tissue factor (7Drake T.A. Hannani K. Fei H.H. Lavi S. Berliner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 601-607PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brand K. Banka C.L. Mackman N. Terkeltaub R.A. Fan S.T. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and to mitigate anticoagulant mechanisms such as thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activation (9Ishii H. Kizaki K. Horie S. Kazama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8458-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the expression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (10Ettelaie C. Wilbourn B.R.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of oxidized LDL on the activity of the platelet prothrombinase complex. The modified lipoproteins were observed to increase thrombin formation strongly, suggesting a relevant role for oxidized LDL in the development of thrombosis. A series of separation procedures led to the identification of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as the lipoprotein component mediating the strongest stimulation of the platelet thrombin generation. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl,2-palmitoyl-PC (dipalmitoyl-PC), 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl-PC, egg PE, 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl-PE, 1-palmitoyl,2-lyso-PE (lyso-PE), 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl-phosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingomyelin (from bovine brain), 1-palmitoyl,2-lyso-PC (lyso-PC), sphingomyelin (bovine brain), copper acetate, α-thrombin, collagen (type VIII), myeloperoxidase, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, NaCNBH3, and factor Xa were obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V was purchased from Alexis, and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody was from Serotec. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) was from Calbiochem. Iloprost was kindly provided by Schering. The anti-CD36 antibody was obtained from Immunotech. 2,2′-Azobis-(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH) was provided by Polysciences Inc. Factor Va and factor II were from Enzyme Research Laboratory. Substrate S-2238 was obtained from Chromogenix. Plasmalogen-PE was isolated from total bovine brain PE by alkaline methanolysis as described (11Reiss D. Beyer K. Engelmann B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). LDL was prepared from healthy donors by ultracentrifugation (12Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar), dialyzed against argon-bubbled phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3 mmEDTA and stored under argon at 4 °C. The amount of LDL-associated protein was determined using the Bradford procedure (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Before the start of oxidation, LDL was freshly dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. To oxidize the lipoproteins with copper and peroxyl radicals, the particles (0.2 mg protein/ml) were treated for different time intervals at 37 °C with 10 μm copper acetate and for 4 h with 4 mm AAPH, respectively. Oxidation was terminated by the addition of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 20 μm). Myeloperoxidase-mediated LDL oxidation was performed according to a previously published protocol (14Heller J.I. Crowley J.R. Hazen S.L. Salvay D.M. Wagner P. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9957-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). LDL (0.5 mg protein/ml) was treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 nm myeloperoxidase in the presence of 100 μml-tyrosine, 100 μmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 1 mmH2O2 suspended in 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Na2HPO4. After the addition of BHT, the suspensions were passed through centricon filters, and the lipoproteins were recovered. Following the oxidation of the lipoproteins, the particles (50 μg of protein) were divided into aqueous and lipid phases according to the Bligh and Dyer procedure (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 912-917Crossref Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The upper two-thirds of aqueous fractions (containing less than 10% of the total protein contents of the whole LDL particles) was tested directly for its effects on platelet prothrombinase activity. The organic phase was evaporated under N2 and dispersed as a microemulsion by three sonication steps (3 min each, with 1-min breaks in between) at 4 °C under a constant stream of N2. Thereafter, the microemulsions were incubated with the platelets for analysis of the thrombin formation. To prepare the lipid mixtures from oxidized LDL deficient in specific lipid components, the lipid phases (from 1 mg LDL) were first resuspended in 500 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). Then, 10 identical portions of the suspensions were applied in parallel onto Silica G60 plates (Merck), and the samples were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH3(90:54:5.5:5.5). The spots on the lanes were visualized with diphenylhexatriene spray. The following areas were scraped from the plates: (i) the complete lane between the origin and the top; (ii) complete lanes lacking one specific spot (which was left on the plate); (iii) a portion of the plate to which no material had been applied having the same length and width as the lane mentioned under (i) above (blank). In other experiments, the individual lipid spots were recovered and further processed as described below. For elution of the lipids, CHCl3/CH3OH (1:4) was added to the silica, and the procedure was repeated twice. Subsequently, the lipids were resuspended in a biphasic system consisting of 5 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and 2 volumes of CH3OH/H2O (1:2) at 4 °C to remove the residual silica. After centrifugation at 4 °C, the lower phase was saved. Dipalmitoyl-PC (100 nmol) was added to the purified organic phase. Following evaporation, the lipids were dispersed by sonication in a buffer composed of 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm glucose (pH 7.4) (resuspension buffer). The mixtures were subjected to two sonication steps (2 min each, with 1-min breaks in between). The dispersions were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 1200 × g, and the upper 80% of the supernatant was used as vesicle solution. Lipid vesicles were also prepared directly from either dipalmitoyl-PC or 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl-PC (95 mol % each) and enriched with 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl species of PE, PI, PC (diacyl subtypes), or freshly prepared plasmalogen-PE (all at 5 mol %). The plasmalogen PE used had been shown previously to contain predominantly fatty acids with two double bonds at the sn-2 position (11Reiss D. Beyer K. Engelmann B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The phospholipids were dispersed in the resuspension buffer as described above for the LDL-extracted lipids. Subsequently, the vesicle suspensions were oxidized for 10–12 h at 37 °C with 10 μm copper acetate. The oxidation was terminated with BHT, and the oxidized vesicles were added to the platelet suspensions in order to study their effects on the prothrombinase activity. After completion of the incubation with copper acetate, the lipids were extracted from LDL (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 912-917Crossref Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) using chloroform supplemented with BHT (50 μg/ml). The LDL lipids were separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (tlc) with the solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH3(90:54:5.5:5.5). The lipid oxidation products were visualized with iodine vapor. Although the possibility cannot be excluded that some lipid oxidation products may not have been detected by the iodine vapor, this method allows the visualization of a broad spectrum of modified lipids. Fractions I (Rf value = 0.11) and II (Rf = 0.23) comigrated with native lyso-PC and native sphingomyelin, respectively. Fraction III (Rf = 0.34)) migrated at the same height as native egg PC and native PI, whereas fractions IV (Rf = 0.55) and V (at the solvent front) comigrated with native egg PE and native neutral lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), respectively. For quantification of the modified phospholipids present in fractions I–IV, the corresponding spots were scraped off and their phosphate contents determined (16Engelmann B. Streich S. Schönthier U.M. Richter W.O. Duhm J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Commercially obtained phospholipids (sphingomyelin (bovine brain), egg PC, and egg PE) were enriched in dipalmitoyl-PC vesicles and oxidized for 12 h with copper acetate (10 μm). After extraction, the oxididation products were subjected to the one-dimensional tlc procedure described above. The oxidation products of sphingomyelin migrated with native sphingomyelin, whereas those generated by oxidation of egg PC comigrated with native lyso-PC and native PC. Oxidation of egg PE yielded oxidation products comigrating with lyso-PE (Rf = 0.52) and native PE. An additional spot became visible at the solvent front following oxidation of egg PC and egg PE. To substantiate the identity of the modified lipids contained in the fraction migrating at anRf value of 0.55, this spot was eluted from the plate using CHCl3/CH3OH (1:4). Thereafter, the lipids were further separated by two-dimensional tlc using the solvents CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH (65:25:10) (first direction) and CHCl3/CH3OH/HCOOH/H2O (65:25:8.9:1.1) (second direction). Therefore, only a single spot became visible that could be stained with the amino group reagent ninhydrine. Fraction IV of the oxidized LDL therefore predominantly contained modified ethanolamine phospholipids. Fresh venous blood obtained from healthy donors was drawn into tubes containing EDTA (1 mg/ml), and plasma was prepared by centrifugation. For the enrichment of LDL with ethanolamine phospholipids, 1 μmol of either 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl-PE or plasmalogen-PE (from bovine brain) was dissolved together with 3 μmol of egg PC in 100 μl of ethanol. For the preparation of the control samples, 4 μmol of egg PC was dissolved in the same volume of ethanol. The solutions were added very slowly under stirring to 10 ml of plasma, and the suspensions were incubated at 37 °C under argon for 6 h. The LDL particles were isolated by ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline under argon at 4 °C. Synthetic HNE-PE adducts were prepared by adding 1 mol of 1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl-PE (dissolved in 1 ml of diethylether) to 2 mol of HNE suspended in 1 ml of 0.75m NaCl and 1 mm Hepes (pH 8.5) (17Guichardant M.

The mixture was incubated under vigorous shaking for 2 h in the dark in the presence of argon (30 °C). Thereafter, the lipids of the ether phase were separated by one-dimensional tlc with the solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/NH3/H2O (90:54:5.5:5.5; vol:vol). The PE adducts migrating at theRf value of 0.55 were eluted from the silica using CHCl3/CH3OH (1:4). To assess the amount of Schiff base adducts formed, the reaction mixture was incubated in the absence and presence of NaCNBH3 (25 mm). The extracted lipids were separated with the solvent CHCl3/CH3OH (9:1). The spots representing underivatized PE and ethanolamine phospholipids with reduced Schiff base (18James P.F. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23532-23539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were eluted from the silica. Phosphate analysis indicated that 9.1% of the total PE recovered had been reduced by NaCNBH3. Platelet-dependent prothrombinase activity was analyzed as described previously (19Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27008-27800Google Scholar). For isolation of the platelets, blood (anticoagulated by 0.38% citrate) from healthy volunteers was centrifuged at 330 × g for 15 min and the supernatant recovered. Platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with iloprost (10 ng/ml) and centrifuged at 3700 × g for 10 min, and the pellet washed once at room temperature with a buffer consisting of 138 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose (pH 6.3, washing buffer). Subsequently, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were added to the resuspension buffer. The mixture was slowly warmed up to 37 °C. The platelets were adjusted to 2 × 107/ml and incubated in the presence of native and oxidized LDL, microemulsions, and phospholipid vesicles for 5 min at 37 °C in the resuspension buffer. 60 μl of this suspension were given to 540 μl of resuspension buffer containing, additionally, 5 mm CaCl2, 1.1 nm factor Va, and 0.52 nm factor Xa (final concentrations). Subsequently, factor II (dissolved in resuspension buffer, final concentration 0.43 μm) and the chromogenic substrate S-2238 were added (final concentration 0.26 mm). The increase in absorption at 405 nm was measured and compared with standard curves obtained with different concentrations of thrombin. Washed platelets (107, isolated as described above) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of the resuspension buffer (supplemented with 2.5 mmCaCl2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of the oxidized LDL (50 μg protein/ml). Thereafter, the platelet suspensions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μl of CellFIX (Becton Dickinson). After removal of the supernatant by centrifugation, the fixated platelets were incubated for 10 min in CellWash buffer (Becton Dickinson) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (150 nm). In separate samples, the platelets were incubated in the dark with the phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (10 μg/ml). The suspensions of the labeled platelets were centrifuged and washed once with CellWash (Becton Dickinson), and following the addition of 250 μl of CellWash, their mean fluorescence intensities were analyzed using a FACSCan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Platelets were identified on the basis of their typical forward and sideward scatter characteristics. All mean values given are ± S.D.p values < 0.05 were considered significant. In a first series of experiments, native LDL as well as lipoprotein particles previously oxidized for 4 h with copper were added to the platelet suspensions. Although native LDL did not affect the platelet dependent thrombin formation, the copper oxidized LDL enhanced the synthesis of the protease by 5.5-fold (Fig.1 a). When platelets had been incubated for 5 min with copper (10 μm) in the absence of the lipoproteins, their prothrombinase activity remained unchanged (1.2 ± 0.4-fold versus control). Moreover, when the 4-h incubation of LDL with copper was performed in the presence of the hydrophobic radical scavenger BHT (50 μg/ml), again no stimulation of the platelet-dependent thrombin formation was observed (1.0 ± 0.2-fold versus control; means ± S.D. from three independent experiments). Taken together, these results make it unlikely that soluble or lipoprotein bound copper per secontributed to the enhancement of the prothrombinase activity by copper oxidized LDL. The platelet agonists thrombin and collagen, known stimulators of platelet prothrombinase activity, augmented the thrombin formation by 3.6 (thrombin)- and 6.0-fold (thrombin plus collagen) (Fig. 1 a). In separate experiments, the particles were oxidized for 4 h with the peroxyl radical generator AAPH (4 mm). Therefore, thrombin generation was stimulated by 4.6 ± 1.2-fold (means ± S.D. from four independent experiments). LDL oxidized for 2, 4, and 12 h with copper elevated platelet prothrombinase activity by 3.1-, 5.7-, and 4.6-fold, respectively, as compared with the untreated platelets (Fig.1 b). In the presence of thrombin, the LDL particles previously treated for different time periods with copper accelerated the prothrombinase activity by 7.4 (oxidation, 2 h)-, 10.5 (4 h)-, and 10.9-fold (12 h), respectively. Because the 4-h oxidation of LDL appeared to be the shortest time period inducing the maximal stimulation of the thrombin formation, this time interval was adopted in the subsequent experiments. The prothrombinase activity in the absence of platelets was barely promoted by the copper oxidized LDL (0.012 ± 0.004 (oxidized LDL)versus 0.006 ± 0.003 milliunits/ml (control)), the value being below the one determined in the presence of the untreated platelets (0.028 ± 0.007 milliunits/ml, means ± S.D. from three independent experiments). Thus, the presence of the platelets was necessary to elicit substantial stimulation of the thrombin formation by oxidized LDL. Activated platelets are known to enhance the prothrombinase activity by exposing aminophospholipids on their surface. To register the appearance of the aminophospholipids, we analyzed the platelet binding of annexin-V (Fig.2 a). Native LDL did not alter the aminophospholipid exposure. In contrast, oxidized LDL caused a 4.8-fold increase in annexin V binding compared with the untreated platelets. Thrombin alone and oxidized LDL plus thrombin augmented the annexin-V binding by 2.5- and 7.5-fold (Fig. 2 a). In parallel experiments, we measured the exposure of P-selectin on the platelet surface, an activation-dependent process indicative of the degranulation of the α-granula (Fig.2 b). Compared with the untreated platelets, the modified LDL increased the P-selectin fluorescence by 2.5-fold, whereas native LDL was ineffective. Thrombin alone enhanced the P-selectin exposure by 2.3-fold. In the presence of thrombin plus oxidized LDL, the P-selectin fluorescence was increased by 4.8-fold (Fig. 2 b). Together, the results demonstrate that oxidized LDL stimulates the prothrombinase activity by promoting the formation of a procoagulant surface, the effect being additive to the one elicited by thrombin. To identify the components of oxidized LDL responsible for the stimulation of thrombin generation, we separated the oxidized particles into aqueous and lipid phases. The addition of the aqueous phases from native and oxidized LDL to the platelets did not alter their prothrombinase activity (Fig.3 a). Because the protein contents of the aqueous supernatants amounted to less than 10% of the protein contents of the intact LDL particles, no conclusion can be reached from these data regarding the potential influence of the modified protein components of the oxidized LDL. Microemulsions prepared from the total lipids of the oxidized particles enhanced the synthesis of the protease by 7.6-fold. The microemulsions obtained from the native lipoproteins were without effect. The stimulation elicited by the lipid phases of the modified particles was further increased when the platelets were concomitantly activated with thrombin (data not shown). Because the results showed that the active components were mainly in the lipid portion of the modified LDL, we further separated the modified lipids into five different fractions by a one-dimensional tlc procedure. The lipids of the lanes were reisolated in a way that only one respectively different fraction was left on the plate. Thereafter, the fractions were mixed with dipalmitoyl-PC and tested for their influence on the prothrombinase activity. Oxidized LDL lipids deficient in fraction I and those lacking fraction II increased the prothrombinase activity by 13 and 30%, respectively, as compared with the thrombin formation in the presence of all modified lipids (Fig.3 b). The removal of fraction III resulted in a 24% decrease of the thrombin generation. An even stronger reduction (by 44%) was observed in the presence of the modified lipid mixture specifically deficient in fraction IV. When fraction V was selectively removed, the thrombin formation was comparable with the one determined in the presence of the total oxidized LDL lipids (Fig. 3 b). We concluded from these results that the active components of the oxidized LDL mediating the stimulation of the thrombin generation were present mainly in fractions IV and III. Next, we quantified the changes in the contents of the single lipid fractions as induced by oxidation of LDL. Because control experiments indicated that fractions I–IV contained native and modified phospholipids (see “Experimental Procedures”), their phosphate contents were determined. In Table I, the phosphate contents of the single fractions are expressed as percentages of the total phosphate content of the LDL lipids. Although the percentages of fraction I were elevated by 3.4-fold, those of fraction II were unchanged at the end of the oxidation period (Table I). The proportion of fraction III was reduced by 23%. In addition, the oxidation procedure elicited a 45% decrease in the percentage of fraction IV (Table I). Because the modified lipids of fractions III and IV emerged as likely candidates for causing the enhancement of the thrombin formation by oxidized LDL, we isolated these fractions from the modified lipoproteins and incorporated them into dipalmitoyl-PC vesicles. As a control, vesicles containing all oxidized LDL lipids were analyzed, which accelerated the prothrombinase activity by 7.1-fold (Fig. 4 a). Vesicles supplemented with fraction III of the oxidized LDL led to a 2.1-fold elevation of the prothrombinase activity. In the presence of vesicles enriched with fraction IV of the oxidized LDL, the thrombin formation was increased by 5.2-fold (Fig. 4 a). Together, the results demonstrated that fraction IV and, to a considerably lesser extent, fraction III were the active components of the oxidized LDL enhancing the formation of thrombin.Table IChanges in the contents of LDL lipid fractions after oxidation with copperFractionTotal phosphateControl10 μm copper%I6.0 ± 1.720.6 ± 4.6II24.0 ± 1.224.9 ± 4.5III66.6 ± 2.451.4 ± 7.3IV3.1 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.4LDL particles (0.2 mg protein/ml) were oxidized for 4 h with 10 μm copper; their lipids were extracted (15Bligh E.G.

When nuclei were depleted of their membrane, no radiolabeling of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could be detected showing that within the intranuclear region there are no class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)s. In membrane-depleted nuclei harvested 20 h after partial hepatectomy, the incorporation of radiolabel into PtdIns(3)P was observed together with an increase in immunoprecipitable PI3K-C2β activity, which is sensitive to wortmannin (10 nm) and shows strong preference for PtdIns over PtdIns(4)P as a substrate. On Western blots PI3K-C2β revealed a single immunoreactive band of 180 kDa, whereas 20 h after partial hepatectomy gel shift of 18 kDa was noticed, suggesting that observed activation of enzyme is achieved by proteolysis.

On the basis of their structure and in vitro activity, PI3K isozymes have been divided into three classes termed I, II, and III (8Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Class I enzymes utilize PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, as a substrate in vitro to produce their 3-phospolipid products from which PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are able to activate PKB in vivo (9Banfic H.

In the cell nucleus both subclasses of class I have been shown to exist, subclass IA, which binds p85-adaptor that facilitates translocation to phosphotyrosine-containing signaling complexes, and subclass IB, which contains the G-protein-activated enzyme p110γ (4Lu P.J.

Class II PI3K enzymes are distinguished from other PI3K isozymes by the presence of two tandem domains at their carboxyl terminus. The first one is termed a phox homology domain, and the function of this domain is rather unclear (12Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereas the second is the C2 domain, which is a phospholipid-binding domain that can confers a Ca2+sensitivity (13Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). All three members of the class II PI3K enzymes (PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, and PI3K-C2γ) are able to phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P in in vitro assays, but the mechanism of their activation and the function of their 3-phosphoinositide products in vivo are poorly understood. However, PI3K-C2α plays a signaling role downstream of monocyte chemotactic peptide receptor (14Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Wastwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and insulin receptor (15Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Sheperd P.R. J. Biol.

In the platelets, PI3K-C2β is activated in response to stimulation of integrin receptors by fibrinogen (17Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas both PI3K-C2α and PI3K-C2β are downstream signaling targets of activated epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (18Arcaro A. Zvelebil M.J. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Waterfield M.D. Domin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3817-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although PI3K-C2α and PI3K-C2β share a wide tissue distribution, PI3K-C2γ expression is restricted primarily to hepatocytes and is enhanced during the liver regeneration (19Misawa H. Ohtsubo M.

Class III PI3K contains only a single enzyme termed Vps34p, which in yeast regulates vacuolar trafficking through generation of PtdIns(3)P (21DeCamilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P.

Using a well described model of the liver regeneration in which we have previously demonstrated the activation of PLC with accompanied translocation of PKC to the nucleus (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the present study was undertaken to investigate the metabolism of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in the light of the recently demonstrated compartmentalization of inositol lipids in the isolated liver nuclei (24Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reagents were obtained from the following sources: EGTA, EDTA, HEPES, Tris, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, phosphatidylserine, Triton X-100, Na+ deoxycholate, protein A-Sepharose, SDS, and aprotinin from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis MO; inositol lipids from Eschlon Research Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT; wortmannin, μ-calpain, and calpeptin from Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK; [γ-32P]ATP, [35S]methionine, [35S]cysteine, and enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, UK. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Male Wistar rats (150–250 g of body wt) were used in all experiments. When partial hepatectomy was performed two-thirds of the liver was surgically removed (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Livers were collected on ice, washed twice in solution B (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl) and 14 g (wet wt) was homogenized in 28 ml of the same solution using a power-driven pestle. To this was added 4.9 ml of solution C (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 2.4m sucrose), to give a final concentration of sucrose of 0.25 m. This was then mixed by inversion with solution D (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 2.3 m sucrose; 90 ml), to gave a final sucrose concentration of 1.62 m. A 7.5-ml cushion of solution D was then layered carefully below 23 ml of the final (1.62 msucrose) liver homogenate. The samples were then spun at 106,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW27 rotor. The pellet at the bottom of the cushion was considered to be the nuclear fraction and was vigorously resuspended in 5 ml of solution A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25m sucrose). The fractions were then pooled and washed twice with 25 ml of solution A before being pelleted at 165 ×g for 6 min at 4 °C and finally being resuspended to 4 ml in this solution (24Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The purity of nuclei was estimated by the determination of marker enzymes (leucine arylamidase, Na+-K+-ATPase, succinate:cytochromec oxidoreductase, KCN-resistant NADH oxidoreductase, and 5-nucleotidase) and by electron microscopy (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A quantitative removal of the nuclear envelope was performed with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. A 0.5-ml aliquot of nuclei in solution A was mixed with 20 ml of ice-cold final resuspension buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.29 m sucrose) and left for 20 min. Triton X-100 was added to this buffer before addition of the nuclei to yield a final concentration of 0.04% (w/v). The nuclei were pelleted at 165 × g for 6 min (4 °C), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was carefully resuspended in solution A (5 ml), and a cushion carefully laid beneath it (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 m sucrose; 10 ml), and centrifuged at 165 × g for 6 min (4 °C). This was assumed to remove any residual Triton X-100. The supernatant was removed, and the final pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of solution A (24Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell lysate was prepared by homogenization of liver tissue in solution B as stated above. Cytosolic fraction was prepared by homogenization in solution B, and afterward samples were spun at 106,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 27 rotor, and clear supernatant was considered to be cytosolic fraction. Preparation of postnuclear membranes was achieved by centrifugation of supernatant, which remained above cushion after the nuclear fraction has been obtained. The supernatant was diluted in solution B to give a final concentration of 162 mm sucrose and spun at 106,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 27 rotor. The resultant pellet was considered to contain postnuclear membranes. For the in vitro labeling of inositol lipids with [γ-32P]ATP nuclei (total protein 100 μg) were resuspended in 90 μl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.25 msucrose. The samples were preincubated for 2 min at 30 °C to hydrolyze any remaining endogenous ATP. Then 10 μl of phosphorylation mixture (40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 μl of 5 mm non-radiolabeled ATP, made up to 10 μl with the above-mentioned buffer) was added. Incubation was carried out for 5 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) (24Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For exogenous lipid phosphorylation, radiolabeling was carried out as above, except that the nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of the above-mentioned buffer and made up to 90 μl with lipid vesicles. These consisted of different inositol lipids in the concentration of 50 mm and PtdSer (100 mm). The vesicles of each single inositol lipid and PtdSer were formed by sonication. Incubation was carried out and terminated as described above. Lipids were extracted and deacylated, and the separation of all the glycerophosphoinositides was achieved using an HPLC high resolution 5 μm Partisphere SAX column (Whatman) with a discontinuous gradient up to 1 m(NH4)2HPO4 × H2PO4 (pH 3.8) exactly as described in a previous study (25Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press Ltd., New York1990: 159-166Google Scholar). PI3K-C2β isoform-discriminant polyclonal antisera against the first 331-amino acid portion of PI3K-C2β (26Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Weber-Hall S.J. Shirpley J.M. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), expressed in Escherichia coli as an amino-terminally fused glutathioneS-transferase protein, were raised in rabbits as described previously (17Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These antisera were used for all immunoprecipitations and Western blots directed at PI3K-C2β. Native or membrane-depleted nuclei were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 0.5% Na+ deoxycholate (w/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and spun at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. PI3K-C2β was immunoprecipitated overnight from 450 μl of supernatants with antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with the above-mentioned buffer, then three times with 5 mm HEPES/2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) and then the phosphorylation assay was carried out as described above for exogenous lipid phosphorylation. Proteins for electrophoresis were prepared so that the concentration of each sample was 50 μg/25 μl of sample loading buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205438) Google Scholar), and electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad Minigel apparatus at an acrylamide concentration of 5% (w/v) or 12% (w/v) when expressed amino-terminal fragments of PI3K-C2β and PI3K-C2γ were run. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad wet-blotting system. The blot was blocked with a buffer containing 4% (w/v) dried milk, 20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. It was then probed for 2 h with primary antibody (1:1000), then washed with a blocking buffer and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Visualization was carried out using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amino-terminal fragment of PI3K-C2γ was amplified using PCR and a human liver cDNA library. Two nested pairs of oligonucleotides were used to produce a PCR template suitable for use in the STP3 in vitro transcription translation system (Novagen). The first PCR reaction produces a 1239-bp fragment from the 5′-region of PI3K-C2γ (5′-AACGGATCCAAATCCTAATGAAT at +18 and 3′-TCTGATGAGTGTTAAGAGACATTG at +1233). A T7 RNA polymerase promoter was incorporated in the sense primer of the second pair of oligonucleotides (GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGAAGCAGTATGAACACCAAG) along with a 3′-stop codon in the antisense primer (TCAAAACTGACTGTGGTCCTCTTC) used in the nested PCR. The protein expressed in the in vitrotranslation system spans the amino-terminal portion of PI3K-C2γ from amino acid 17 to amino acid 387, the region that overlaps to the antigenic portion of PI3K-C2β previously used as immunogen (28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled methionine and cysteine were used to detect the in vitro translated PI3K-C2γ amino terminus. The data are shown as means ± S.E. For statistical analyses, the Student's t test for unpaired samples at the level of significance of 0.05 was used. The purity of isolated nuclei was estimated by the determination of marker enzymes (see “Experimental Procedures”) and by electron microscopy (results not shown). Most marker enzymes were at levels so low that quantification was difficult, and electron microscopy showed no other obvious components present. The exception in this respect was for endoplasmic reticulum KCN-resistant NADH-exidoreductase: the specific activity for this enzyme in nuclear preparations (original homogenate activity, 0.59 ± 0.04 μmol/mg of protein per ml) was 0.15 ± 0.02, which decreased to 0.08 ± 0.01 when the nuclei were depleted of membrane using 0.04% Triton X-100. The presence of KCN-resistant NADH oxidoreductase may be taken as evidence for residual endoplasmic reticulum contamination that is finally removed by detergent, but it is equally likely that it is present in the nuclear membrane, which is also removed by detergent (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs.1 and 2 A when the intact nuclei have been labeled for a short time period (5 min) the radioactivity was found in PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. As has already been noticed by Lu et al. (4Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Yan H.Y. Yin H.L. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5738-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 could only be found when incubation was carried out for 20 min or longer, therefore, in the present investigation the incubation time was too short to observe any PtdIns(3,4)P2 formation. As shown in Fig. 1 the level of incorporation fell dramatically when the nuclei were depleted of their membrane, whereas no incorporation could be detected in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. This suggests that within the intranuclear region there are PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P available for phosphorylation, whereas there is no PtdIns(4,5)P2 or that the 3-kinase is not present in the nuclei depleted of nuclear membrane. To address this question, exogenous lipid substrates were added, in the form of vesicles, to the membrane-depleted nuclei. Addition of exogenous lipid substrates resulted in the reconstitution of incorporation of phosphate into PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 but not into PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, suggesting that 3-kinase that utilizes PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate is not present in the membrane-depleted nuclei.Figure 2HPLC profile of deacylated phospholipids extracted from 32P-labeled intact nuclei (A) and the nuclei harvested 20 h after partial hepatectomy (B). The nuclei were prepared and radiolabeled, and the separation of glycerophosphoinositides was achieved as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it is known that there is an increase in nuclear DAG concentration and PLC activity during the liver regeneration (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Neri L.M. Ricci D. Carini C. Marchisio M. Capitani S. Bertagnolo V. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which peaks around 20 h following partial hepatectomy, the nuclei harvested at this time point were used for labeling inositol lipids (Fig. 2). Although the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3did not change, radioactivity in PtdIns(3)P could be found. This was further documented in the membrane-depleted nuclei and membrane-depleted nuclei after addition of exogenous lipids (Fig. 3). Furthermore, this incorporation of phosphate into PtdIns(3)P is inhibitable by 10 nmwortmannin, suggesting the existence of 3-kinase in the membrane-depleted nuclei, which is unable to use PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate, because under the above-mentioned conditions no radioactivity could be found in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Polyclonal antisera against the first 331-amino acid portion of PI3K-C2β used in the immunoprecipitation studies do not detect class I PI3Ks, Vps34p, PI3K-C2α on Western blots or immunoprecipitates (17Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and were used to further characterize the observed 3-kinase activity in the membrane-depleted nuclei. Despite the fact that there is absolutely no homology between amino-terminal portions of PI3K-C2γ and PI3K-C2β (19Misawa H. Ohtsubo M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Weber-Hall S.J. Shirpley J.M. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is important to note that PI3K-C2γ is expressed in hepatocytes and that its expression is enhanced during liver regeneration (19Misawa H. Ohtsubo M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Ono F. Nakagawa T. Saito S. Owada Y. Sakagami H. Goto K. Suzuki M. Matsuno S. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7731-7736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); therefore, it is crucial that antisera used to immunoprecipitate PI3K-C2β do not detect PI3K-C2γ. As shown in Fig.4 antisera used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of PI3K-C2β were unable to detect the amino-terminal portion of PI3K-C2γ, which overlaps the antigenic portion of PI3K-C2β used as an immunogen (28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Following partial hepatectomy, an increase in immunoprecipitable PI3K-C2β activity could be observed in the membrane-depleted nuclei but not in total cell lysate, cytosolic fraction, or postnuclear membranes (Fig. 5). The time course of changes in immunoprecipitable PI3K-C2β activity showed its maximum at 20 h after partial hepatectomy and then slowly declining until 32 h (Fig. 6), similar to the increase in nuclear DAG concentration and PLC activity (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Neri L.M. Ricci D. Carini C. Marchisio M. Capitani S. Bertagnolo V. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is important to note that no PI3K-C2β activity could be found in the supernatant when the membrane-depleted nuclei were prepared (results not shown), suggesting that the enzyme is not present in the nuclear membrane.Figure 6Time course of changes in immunoprecipitable PI3K-C2β activity in membrane-depleted nuclei following partial hepatectomy. The membrane-depleted nuclei, immunoprecipitation of PI3K-C2β, and kinase assay were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” and legend to Fig. 4. The data are expressed as a percentage of the control level obtained from three independent experiments assayed in duplicate, where the range of duplicates is contained within the symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it is known that PI3K-C2β is able to phosphorylate PtdIns but not PtdIns(4)P in the presence of Ca2+, whereas some phosphorylation of PtdIns(4)P could be observed in the presence of Mg2+ (18Arcaro A. Zvelebil M.J. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Waterfield M.D. Domin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3817-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in vitro substrate specificity for immunoprecipitable PI3K-C2β was tested using Mg2+ for phosphate transfer. As shown in Fig. 7the basal level of PtdIns phosphorylation is about 4-fold higher than the phosphorylation of PtdIns(4)P, and this proportion increases to about 10-fold in the nuclei harvested 20 h after partial hepatectomy, showing that there is a strong preference for PtdIns over PtdIns(4)P as a substrate in both basal and stimulated condition. Because it is known that 10 nm wortmannin completely inhibit stimulated PI3K-C2β activity (28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) whereas the IC50 for PI3K-C2γ inhibition is 32 nm, with maximal inhibition obtained with 10 μm wortmannin (19Misawa H. Ohtsubo M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the present observation that stimulated 3-kinase activity is inhibitable by 10 nm wortmannin further demonstrates that PI3K-C2β is present in the nuclei and activated during compensatory liver growth. Western blotting of cell lysates and membrane-depleted nuclei, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 5% gels and probed with antisera raised against PI3K-C2β, revealed a single immunoreactive band of 180 kDa (Fig.8). On the other hand, 20 h after partial hepatectomy a gel shift of 18 kDa was observed only in the membrane-depleted nuclei, suggesting that the observed activation of enzyme (Fig. 5) is achieved by proteolysis. It is important to point out that no proteolytic fragment (Fig. 8) and no increase in enzyme activity (Fig. 5) were detected in cell lysates that also contain nuclei. Therefore, this suggests that proteolysis and activation occur only in the absence of the cell membrane and/or cytosolic fractions, which in turn suggests the presence of an “inhibitor” of proteolysis in the latter cellular fractions. The fact that 50 μg of protein of total cell lysate and 50 μg of nuclear protein (Fig. 8) contain virtually the same amount of PI3K-C2β indicates that the vast majority of cellular PI3K-C2β is nuclear. Thus, proteolysis and/or activation of PI3K-C2β appear to require not only the effects of hepatectomy but also the process of isolating membrane-depleted nuclei. Previously, we showed that a similar pattern of activation of PI3K-C2β in platelets could be prevented by calpain inhibitors calpeptin or calpain I inhibitor (17Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, the intact membrane-depleted nuclei were subjected to short term exposure (20 min) to μ-calpain and similar gel shift together with the increase in PI3K-C2β activity was observed (Fig.9), when compared with nuclei harvested 20 h after partial hepatectomy (Figs. 5 and 8). Moreover, the above-mentioned gel shift and the increase in PI3K-C2β activity could not be observed when the nuclei were incubated with Ca2+alone and could be prevented in the presence of calpain inhibitor calpeptin, further suggesting that calpain-mediated proteolysis of the enzyme may be responsible for its activation. The presence of both subunits of class I PI3K has been demonstrated in the cell nuclei. Although the p110γ subunit is translocated to the nuclear membrane from cytosol upon stimulation of HepG2 cells with serum (7Metjian A. Roll R.L. Ma A.D. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27943-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), translocation and precise intranuclear localization of p85 subunit differs with cell types. In HL-60 cells it is localized in the nuclear matrix during granulocytic or monocytic differentiation (5Marchisio M. Bertagnolo V. Colamussi M.L. Capitani S. Neri L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Colamussi M.L. Bertagnolo V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in PC12 cells intranuclear translocation of the subunit from cytosol was observed upon the stimulation of cells with nerve growth factor (30Neri L.M. Martelli A.M. Borgatti P. Colamussi M.L. Marchisio M. Capitani S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells the subunit is distributed not only in cytosol but also in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli, and after the stimulation of cells with interleukin 1 it also translocates from cytosol to the nucleus (31Bavelloni A. Santi S. Sirri A. Riccio M. Faenza I. Zini N. Cecchi S. Ferri A. Auron P. Maraldi N.M. Marmiroli S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 631-640PubMed Google Scholar). Sonification and centrifugation of the intact liver nuclei may lead to the distribution of enzyme in both the soluble fraction and nuclear membranes (4Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Yan H.Y. Yin H.L. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5738-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using a different approach (preparation of membrane-depleted nuclei by detergent), the present study confirms the 3-kinase activity in the nuclear envelope observed above but also shows that within the intranuclear region there is no such activity, because there was no radiolabeling of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 even when the exogenous lipid substrate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) was added. Furthermore, following partial hepatectomy no increase in the above-mentioned 3-kinase activity in the nuclei could be observed, suggesting that class I PI3K is not involved in nuclear signaling during compensatory liver growth. In contrast to class I PI3Ks, which are mainly cytosolic and are subjected to translocation to the membranes upon cell stimulation (Ref.32Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar for review), class II PI3Ks are predominantly associated with membrane fractions of cells (28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J.

Clague M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and, therefore, are good candidates for compartmentalization within the cell nucleus as has been shown for PtdIns 4-kinase and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (34Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A.J. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, from the present study it can be concluded that PI3K-C2β is not present in the nuclear envelope and is probably attached to the nuclear matrix as has been shown for the above-mentioned kinases (34Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A.J. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that polyclonal antisera against PI3K-C2β could not be used for immunohistochemical studies 2S. Volinia and H. Banfić, unpublished observation.; therefore, no exact localization of PI3K-C2β in the membrane-depleted cell nuclei could be done. Nevertheless, knowing that in the membrane-depleted nuclei the concentration of PtdIns is about 20 times higher than PtdIns(4)P (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and that in in vitro conditions with equimolar concentration of substrates, PtdIns(4)P could be phosphorylated only in the presence of Mg2+ with substantially less efficiency than PtdIns(present study), it seems obvious that in vivo PI3K-C2β phosphorylates PtdIns to produce PtdIns(3)P, which has also been observed with purified recombinant enzyme (28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the increased activation of PI3K-C2β and the formation of PtdIns(3)P parallels the increase in nuclear PLC activity, DAG concentration, and translocation of PKC to the nucleus following partial hepatectomy (23Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Neri L.M. Ricci D. Carini C. Marchisio M. Capitani S. Bertagnolo V. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This indicates that changes in the nuclear inositol lipid metabolism precede the S-phase of cell cycle and mitosis, because cells reach the peak of proliferation 22–26 h after partial hepatectomy (35Vitale M. Rizzoli R. Mazzeroti G. Zamai L. Galanzi A. Rizzi E. Manzoli L. Matteucci A. Papa S. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although potential targets for nuclear PKC include lamins, DNA polymerase, and topoisomerase II (see Refs. 3D'Santos C.S. Clarke J.H. Divecha N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,36Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Fields A.P. Thompson L.J.

Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 97-120Google Scholar for reviews), one can only speculate about the function of PtdIns(3)P in the cell nuclei. The observations that negatively charged phospholipids can stimulate RNA synthesis by affecting chromatin organization (39Capitani S. Caramelli E. Felaco M. Miscia S. Manzoli F.A. Physiol. Chem. Phys. 1981; 13: 153-158PubMed Google Scholar) and that histones H1 and H3 are PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding proteins (40Yu H. Fukami K. Watanabe C. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) indicated the importance of nuclear polyphosphoinositides in transcription events. On the other hand, intranuclear PtdIns(3)P may be involved in trafficking events, as has been shown for vesicle trafficking via its interaction with FYVE finger domain (11Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 32Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In platelets, PI3K-C2β is activated following stimulation of the integrin receptor with fibrinogen, and this activation could be prevented by calpain inhibitors (17Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The present study extends this observation by showing that short term exposure of enzyme to calpain resulted in a similar degree of activation compared to the nuclei harvested 20 h after partial hepatectomy, suggesting that calpain-mediated proteolysis of the enzyme may be responsible for its activation. The calpains are predominantly cytoplasmic Ca2+-dependent proteases, and there are two well-characterized calpain isozymes: m-calpain shows proteolytic activity at mm Ca2+ concentrations, whereas μ-calpain is already active at micromolar Ca2+concentration (41Molinari M. Carafoli E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both isoforms are likely to be able to process cellular substrates at physiological Ca2+concentrations (42Schollmeyer J.E. Science. 1988; 240: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is important to note that in the isolated liver nuclei some high molecular mass (120–200 kDa) matrix proteins were substrates for purified calpains (43Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13920-13924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, together with the observation that μ-calpain is transported into cell nuclei in an ATP-dependent fashion (44Mellgren R.L. Lu Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and accumulated evidence that there is calcium signaling in the cell nucleus (45Santella L. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1091-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 46Malviya A.N. Rogue P.J.

It is noteworthy that the deletion of C2 domain of PI3K-C2β increased the lipid kinase activity (28Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J.

In summary, the data presented in this report show that, in the membrane-depleted nuclei during the compensatory liver growth, there is an increase in PtdIns(3)P formation as a result of PI3K-C2β activation. Addition of exogenous μ-calpain to native membrane-depleted nuclei resulted in a similar degree of PtdIns(3)P formation strongly suggesting that PI3K-C2β activation may be a calpain-mediated event.

https://openalex.org/W1549932243,"L-plastin (LPL) is a leukocyte actin binding protein previously implicated in the activation of the integrin αMβ2 on polymorphonuclear neutrophils. To determine the role for LPL in integrin activation, K562 cell adhesion to vitronectin via αvβ3, a well-studied model for activable integrins, was examined. Cell permeant versions of peptides based on the N-terminal sequence of LPL and the LPL headpiece domain both activated αvβ3-mediated adhesion. In contrast to adhesion induced by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), LPL peptide-activated adhesion was independent of integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain tyrosines and was not inhibited by cytochalasin D. Also in contrast to PMA, LPL peptides synergized with RGD ligand or Mn2+ for generation of a conformational change in αvβ3 associated with the high affinity state of the integrin, as determined by binding of a ligand-induced binding site antibody. Although LPL and ligand showed synergy for ligand-induced binding site expression when actin depolymerization was inhibited by jasplakinolide, LPL peptide-induced adhesion was inhibited. Thus, both actin depolymerization and ligand-induced integrin conformational change are required for LPL peptide-induced adhesion. We hypothesize that the critical steps of increased integrin diffusion and affinity enhancement may be linked via modulation of the function of the actin binding protein l-plastin.

We hypothesize that the critical steps of increased integrin diffusion and affinity enhancement may be linked via modulation of the function of the actin binding protein l-plastin. A fundamental property of leukocyte integrins is the ability to modulate their adhesive functions. As cells circulate through blood and lymph, adhesion is minimal. In response to inflammatory signals, integrin-mediated adhesion is markedly augmented. This property of the integrins is physiologically critical, because it is required for appropriate migration out of the vasculature into sites of inflammation and at the same time limits the potentially host-damaging inflammatory response to those sites alone. Because this activity of integrins is so important to their role on leukocytes, much attention has been devoted to the molecular mechanisms by which integrin adhesion is regulated. Two distinct alterations in integrins are likely to be involved in enhancement of adhesion. A rapid response to cell activation is an increase in integrin diffusion, due to loss of cytoskeletal constraint of integrin mobility. Increased diffusion may lead in turn to integrin clustering at sites of cell interaction with ligand. A second response to activation is a conformational change in the integrins, which often reflects increased affinity for ligand. This conformational change may require initial interaction with ligand and can be reflected in the generation of new epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies, the so-called ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS1). Although a number of signaling molecules, such as PKC and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, have been implicated in this process (1Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J.

GTPases of the Ras and Rho families also have been implicated in regulation of integrin function (4Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.F. Zwartkruis F.J.T. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M.

Science. 1998; 272: 1717-1721Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar), but their downstream targets for this function have not been identified. Therefore, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms involved in regulation of integrin avidity.Our own studies have implicated the actin-binding proteinl-plastin (LPL) in regulation of integrin function (7Jones S.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24349-24356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that cell-permeant peptides from the N terminus of LPL can rapidly activate αMβ2(Mac-1)-mediated adhesion in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). When the peptides introduced into PMN cytosol contained phosphoserine at position 5, which is the major if not exclusive site of phosphorylation in LPL (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24349-24356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), integrin activation was not inhibited by blockade of PKC or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, suggesting that LPL phosphorylation might be a mechanism by which these enzymes signal changes in integrin function. Thus, LPL is likely a downstream effector of multiple signaling pathways leading to integrin activation, and LPL peptide induction of adhesion is a useful experimental system in which to begin to understand regulation of integrin avidity.To pursue these mechanistic questions, we turned to a well-characterized model for studying integrin activation. αvβ3 is not normally expressed in undifferentiated K562 cells, but when expressed through transfection of αv and β3 cDNAs, αvβ3-mediated adhesion in K562 cells is dependent on cell activation (8Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, adhesion in response to PMA or thrombin is dependent on phosphorylation of Tyr-747 in the β3 cytoplasmic tail, an event that is itself dependent on the presence of the αv cytoplasmic tail (8Blystone S.D.

Using these cells, we have examined the requirements for LPL peptide-induced adhesion. We have found that a cell permeant version of the entire headpiece domain of LPL, as well as synthetic LPL peptides, can induce adhesion. In contrast to PMA, LPL peptide-induced adhesion does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that LPL is downstream of the tyrosine signal in the activation cascade. Nonetheless, LPL peptide-induced adhesion does require actin depolymerization, presumably to induce integrin release from cytoskeletal constraint (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S. Figdor C. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and LPL peptide does cooperate with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand to induce LIBS epitope expression. These data suggest that the steps of increased integrin diffusion and conformational change may be linked via modulation of the function of the actin binding protein l-plastin.DISCUSSIONThe term “integrin activation” is sometimes used to mean the modulation of affinity that can be induced in many integrins by Mn2+, activating antibodies, ligand, and sometimes other physiologic or pharmacologic stimuli. If used in this way, integrin activation is thought be related to a conformational change in the extracytoplasmic domain of the integrins and can occur in a wide variety of cell types. However, β2 and β3integrins on bone marrow-derived cells, including leukocytes and platelets, are different from integrins on other cell types, because without physiologic or pharmacologic activation, they do not mediate adhesion. Thus, for these integrins, cell activation is an absolute requirement for function. Activation of adhesion likely results from integrin clustering within the membrane as well as changes in affinity of individual integrins (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S. Figdor C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Moreover, leukocyte integrins can be distinguished from platelet integrin αIIbβ3because, although αIIbβ3 activation for ligand binding is irreversible, activation of leukocyte integrins is a reversible process. Indeed, reversible activation of integrin-mediated adhesion is thought to be important in a variety of critical leukocyte functions, including migration, phagocytosis, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Despite the importance of this reversible activation of leukocyte integrin-mediated adhesion, the mechanisms involved in regulation of leukocyte integrin function remain obscure. Although a number of signaling molecules have been identified that can be involved in the signal transduction pathways of inside-out signaling, the effector mechanisms leading to changes in integrin function have not been elucidated. In general, two not mutually exclusive models have been invoked, one involving receptor rearrangement on the plasma membrane and another involving conformational change in the integrin itself (31Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,32Shimizu Y. Rose D.M. Ginsberg M.H. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 325-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work implicates LPL phosphorylation in a final common pathway influencing integrin function after cell activation with G-protein coupled, tyrosine kinase-mediated, and PKC-dependent stimuli (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24349-24356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that peptides that mimic the phosphorylation site in the N terminus of LPL rapidly stimulate integrin activation when introduced into PMN or monocyte cytoplasm (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) presents an excellent opportunity to gain insight into the effector mechanisms of inside-out signaling. Therefore, in this work we have investigated the mechanism by which the LPL N terminus activates integrin-mediated adhesion, using the well-characterized model of αvβ3-mediated adhesion in K562 cells.A cell-permeant version of the LPL N-terminal domain (headpiece) activated αvβ3-mediated adhesion as well as the 18-amino acid LPL peptides previously shown to activate αMβ2-mediated adhesion. As previously discussed (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), integrin activation by the LPL N-terminal peptides requires their entry into the cytoplasm, because peptides of identical sequence without the tat addition have no effect on integrin function. Placing the tat sequence at the N-terminal end of either the peptide or the headpiece domain abrogates function even though this placement does not decrease entry into the cytoplasm. 3S. L. Jones and E. J. Brown, unpublished data. This suggests the possibility that a free LPL N terminus is essential for its integrin regulatory function and that addition of the 12-amino acidtat peptide blocks some essential function of this region of the protein. However, this domain binds neither actin nor vimentin (36Correia I. Chu D. Chou Y.-H. Goldman R.D. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and there are no known cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the LPL headpiece. Although the headpiece does bind Ca2+through its tandem EF-hand domains, the active peptides do not, and modulation of intracytoplasmic Ca2+ by itself is not known to affect integrin function. Thus, the molecular interactions by which the LPL N terminus activates integrin avidity are unknown. Nonetheless, both the headpiece domain and the N-terminal peptides induce αvβ3-mediated adhesion, and the peptides clearly synergize with RGD ligand to activate a conformational change in αvβ3 associated with increased ligand affinity. We hypothesize that this occurs as the result of an interaction between the N-terminal domain of LPL and an as yet unknown target, which could be the integrin itself.The requirements in the β3 cytoplasmic domain for LPLtat induction of adhesion are distinct from PMA or thrombin, because the β3 Y747F mutant, which fails to support adhesion stimulated by PMA, supports normal adhesion induced by the LPL peptides. Because the Y747F mutant also supports adhesion in cells with constitutively active integrins (8Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it is clear that phosphorylation of this tyrosine is not required for αvβ3-mediated adhesion. Rather, Tyr-747 phosphorylation is likely required in a signal transduction pathway involving the integrin, perhaps by recruiting an SH2- or PTB-containing protein, that leads to a final common pathway of integrin adhesion that does not itself require Tyr-747. If this is the case, then LPL functions downstream of Tyr-747 phosphorylation.LPLtat acts synergistically with RGD ligand to induce the expression of an LIBS epitope on β3 recognized by mAb 7G2. The RGD peptide can induce 7G2 binding in a dose-dependent manner, as is expected for a LIBS mAb; in contrast, at optimal concentration, LPLtat induces little 7G2 binding. Thus, LPLtat does not act like an activating antibody or certain αIIbβ3 chimeras, for which LIBS expression becomes independent of ligand. Instead, LPLtat appears to augment the conformational change induced by RGD. In K562, as in other cells, only a minority of integrins expresses the LIBS epitope in the presence of ligand. Virtually nothing is known about what distinguishes receptors undergoing conformational change from those that do not. LPLtat seems to increase the fraction of receptors capable of achieving this conformational change when exposed to ligand. In studying purified αvβ3, Orlando and Cheresh (25Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted that prior exposure to RGD markedly decreased the off-rate of its binding to Vn and suggested that this was the mechanism by which the ligand-induced conformational change in the integrin induced stable cell adhesion. It is likely that, in the context of an intact cell, LPLtat exaggerates this normal response, leading to marked strengthening of adhesion. It is noteworthy that LPLtat-mediated adhesion is insensitive to cytoskeleton disruption with cytochalasin D, suggesting that the LPL effect on integrin interaction with ligand dominates any potential indirect effect of adhesion strengthening through modulation of actin-integrin interactions.Although the change in integrin conformation is essential for LPLtat-induced adhesion, it is not sufficient, because jasplakinolide blocks adhesion without significant inhibition of the conformational change. It is now clear that integrin release from cytoskeletal constraint is an early and essential aspect of activation of adhesion (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S. Figdor C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that, in addition to recruiting new αvβ3 to respond to a ligand-induced conformational change, LPLtat induces integrin release from cytoskeletal constraint. Consistent with this, treatment of cells with LPLtat diminishes total F-actin content and simultaneous treatment with jasplakinolide inhibits this effect of the peptide. Effects on both cytoskeleton and integrin conformation are required for stable adhesion induced by LPLtat, even though cytoskeletal release is not required for the peptide effects on integrin conformation. Moreover, cytoskeletal release occurs in the absence of ligand (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), so conformational change is not a prerequisite for release. In platelets, alterations in integrin-cytoskeleton interaction are important for inside-out signaling (38Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and an increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+ can activate αIIbβ3 by releasing it from cytoskeletal constraints (39Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M.E. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Release of integrins from cytoskeletal constraint may require phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (40Zhou X. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as LPL. Thus, LPL peptide appears to induce two necessary but potentially independent events in control of integrin function. It is intriguing to speculate that the peptide may interact directly with integrin cytoplasmic tails to achieve these effects. Because phosphorylation of LPL may activate its release from actin filaments,2 it is possible that signal transduction leading to LPL phosphorylation frees the N terminus to interact with integrins, leading in turn to their release from cytoskeleton and diffusion to sites of ligand concentration, where a conformational change leading to high affinity interaction occurs upon ligand binding. A fundamental property of leukocyte integrins is the ability to modulate their adhesive functions. As cells circulate through blood and lymph, adhesion is minimal. In response to inflammatory signals, integrin-mediated adhesion is markedly augmented. This property of the integrins is physiologically critical, because it is required for appropriate migration out of the vasculature into sites of inflammation and at the same time limits the potentially host-damaging inflammatory response to those sites alone. Because this activity of integrins is so important to their role on leukocytes, much attention has been devoted to the molecular mechanisms by which integrin adhesion is regulated. Two distinct alterations in integrins are likely to be involved in enhancement of adhesion. A rapid response to cell activation is an increase in integrin diffusion, due to loss of cytoskeletal constraint of integrin mobility. Increased diffusion may lead in turn to integrin clustering at sites of cell interaction with ligand. A second response to activation is a conformational change in the integrins, which often reflects increased affinity for ligand. This conformational change may require initial interaction with ligand and can be reflected in the generation of new epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies, the so-called ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS1). Although a number of signaling molecules, such as PKC and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, have been implicated in this process (1Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J.

GTPases of the Ras and Rho families also have been implicated in regulation of integrin function (4Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.F. Zwartkruis F.J.T. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M.

Science. 1998; 272: 1717-1721Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar), but their downstream targets for this function have not been identified. Therefore, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms involved in regulation of integrin avidity. Our own studies have implicated the actin-binding proteinl-plastin (LPL) in regulation of integrin function (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Wang J. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24349-24356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that cell-permeant peptides from the N terminus of LPL can rapidly activate αMβ2(Mac-1)-mediated adhesion in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). When the peptides introduced into PMN cytosol contained phosphoserine at position 5, which is the major if not exclusive site of phosphorylation in LPL (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J.

Thus, LPL is likely a downstream effector of multiple signaling pathways leading to integrin activation, and LPL peptide induction of adhesion is a useful experimental system in which to begin to understand regulation of integrin avidity. To pursue these mechanistic questions, we turned to a well-characterized model for studying integrin activation. αvβ3 is not normally expressed in undifferentiated K562 cells, but when expressed through transfection of αv and β3 cDNAs, αvβ3-mediated adhesion in K562 cells is dependent on cell activation (8Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, adhesion in response to PMA or thrombin is dependent on phosphorylation of Tyr-747 in the β3 cytoplasmic tail, an event that is itself dependent on the presence of the αv cytoplasmic tail (8Blystone S.D.

Using these cells, we have examined the requirements for LPL peptide-induced adhesion. We have found that a cell permeant version of the entire headpiece domain of LPL, as well as synthetic LPL peptides, can induce adhesion. In contrast to PMA, LPL peptide-induced adhesion does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that LPL is downstream of the tyrosine signal in the activation cascade. Nonetheless, LPL peptide-induced adhesion does require actin depolymerization, presumably to induce integrin release from cytoskeletal constraint (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and LPL peptide does cooperate with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand to induce LIBS epitope expression. These data suggest that the steps of increased integrin diffusion and conformational change may be linked via modulation of the function of the actin binding protein l-plastin. DISCUSSIONThe term “integrin activation” is sometimes used to mean the modulation of affinity that can be induced in many integrins by Mn2+, activating antibodies, ligand, and sometimes other physiologic or pharmacologic stimuli. If used in this way, integrin activation is thought be related to a conformational change in the extracytoplasmic domain of the integrins and can occur in a wide variety of cell types. However, β2 and β3integrins on bone marrow-derived cells, including leukocytes and platelets, are different from integrins on other cell types, because without physiologic or pharmacologic activation, they do not mediate adhesion. Thus, for these integrins, cell activation is an absolute requirement for function. Activation of adhesion likely results from integrin clustering within the membrane as well as changes in affinity of individual integrins (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S. Figdor C. Mol. Biol.

Moreover, leukocyte integrins can be distinguished from platelet integrin αIIbβ3because, although αIIbβ3 activation for ligand binding is irreversible, activation of leukocyte integrins is a reversible process. Indeed, reversible activation of integrin-mediated adhesion is thought to be important in a variety of critical leukocyte functions, including migration, phagocytosis, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Despite the importance of this reversible activation of leukocyte integrin-mediated adhesion, the mechanisms involved in regulation of leukocyte integrin function remain obscure. Although a number of signaling molecules have been identified that can be involved in the signal transduction pathways of inside-out signaling, the effector mechanisms leading to changes in integrin function have not been elucidated. In general, two not mutually exclusive models have been invoked, one involving receptor rearrangement on the plasma membrane and another involving conformational change in the integrin itself (31Lub M. van Kooyk Y.

The fact that peptides that mimic the phosphorylation site in the N terminus of LPL rapidly stimulate integrin activation when introduced into PMN or monocyte cytoplasm (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) presents an excellent opportunity to gain insight into the effector mechanisms of inside-out signaling. Therefore, in this work we have investigated the mechanism by which the LPL N terminus activates integrin-mediated adhesion, using the well-characterized model of αvβ3-mediated adhesion in K562 cells.A cell-permeant version of the LPL N-terminal domain (headpiece) activated αvβ3-mediated adhesion as well as the 18-amino acid LPL peptides previously shown to activate αMβ2-mediated adhesion. As previously discussed (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), integrin activation by the LPL N-terminal peptides requires their entry into the cytoplasm, because peptides of identical sequence without the tat addition have no effect on integrin function. Placing the tat sequence at the N-terminal end of either the peptide or the headpiece domain abrogates function even though this placement does not decrease entry into the cytoplasm. 3S. L. Jones and E. J. Brown, unpublished data. This suggests the possibility that a free LPL N terminus is essential for its integrin regulatory function and that addition of the 12-amino acidtat peptide blocks some essential function of this region of the protein. However, this domain binds neither actin nor vimentin (36Correia I. Chu D. Chou Y.-H. Goldman R.D. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and there are no known cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the LPL headpiece. Although the headpiece does bind Ca2+through its tandem EF-hand domains, the active peptides do not, and modulation of intracytoplasmic Ca2+ by itself is not known to affect integrin function. Thus, the molecular interactions by which the LPL N terminus activates integrin avidity are unknown. Nonetheless, both the headpiece domain and the N-terminal peptides induce αvβ3-mediated adhesion, and the peptides clearly synergize with RGD ligand to activate a conformational change in αvβ3 associated with increased ligand affinity. We hypothesize that this occurs as the result of an interaction between the N-terminal domain of LPL and an as yet unknown target, which could be the integrin itself.The requirements in the β3 cytoplasmic domain for LPLtat induction of adhesion are distinct from PMA or thrombin, because the β3 Y747F mutant, which fails to support adhesion stimulated by PMA, supports normal adhesion induced by the LPL peptides. Because the Y747F mutant also supports adhesion in cells with constitutively active integrins (8Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it is clear that phosphorylation of this tyrosine is not required for αvβ3-mediated adhesion. Rather, Tyr-747 phosphorylation is likely required in a signal transduction pathway involving the integrin, perhaps by recruiting an SH2- or PTB-containing protein, that leads to a final common pathway of integrin adhesion that does not itself require Tyr-747. If this is the case, then LPL functions downstream of Tyr-747 phosphorylation.LPLtat acts synergistically with RGD ligand to induce the expression of an LIBS epitope on β3 recognized by mAb 7G2. The RGD peptide can induce 7G2 binding in a dose-dependent manner, as is expected for a LIBS mAb; in contrast, at optimal concentration, LPLtat induces little 7G2 binding. Thus, LPLtat does not act like an activating antibody or certain αIIbβ3 chimeras, for which LIBS expression becomes independent of ligand. Instead, LPLtat appears to augment the conformational change induced by RGD. In K562, as in other cells, only a minority of integrins expresses the LIBS epitope in the presence of ligand. Virtually nothing is known about what distinguishes receptors undergoing conformational change from those that do not. LPLtat seems to increase the fraction of receptors capable of achieving this conformational change when exposed to ligand. In studying purified αvβ3, Orlando and Cheresh (25Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted that prior exposure to RGD markedly decreased the off-rate of its binding to Vn and suggested that this was the mechanism by which the ligand-induced conformational change in the integrin induced stable cell adhesion. It is likely that, in the context of an intact cell, LPLtat exaggerates this normal response, leading to marked strengthening of adhesion. It is noteworthy that LPLtat-mediated adhesion is insensitive to cytoskeleton disruption with cytochalasin D, suggesting that the LPL effect on integrin interaction with ligand dominates any potential indirect effect of adhesion strengthening through modulation of actin-integrin interactions.Although the change in integrin conformation is essential for LPLtat-induced adhesion, it is not sufficient, because jasplakinolide blocks adhesion without significant inhibition of the conformational change. It is now clear that integrin release from cytoskeletal constraint is an early and essential aspect of activation of adhesion (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S. Figdor C. Mol. Biol.

We hypothesize that, in addition to recruiting new αvβ3 to respond to a ligand-induced conformational change, LPLtat induces integrin release from cytoskeletal constraint. Consistent with this, treatment of cells with LPLtat diminishes total F-actin content and simultaneous treatment with jasplakinolide inhibits this effect of the peptide. Effects on both cytoskeleton and integrin conformation are required for stable adhesion induced by LPLtat, even though cytoskeletal release is not required for the peptide effects on integrin conformation. Moreover, cytoskeletal release occurs in the absence of ligand (10Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), so conformational change is not a prerequisite for release. In platelets, alterations in integrin-cytoskeleton interaction are important for inside-out signaling (38Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and an increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+ can activate αIIbβ3 by releasing it from cytoskeletal constraints (39Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M.E. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Release of integrins from cytoskeletal constraint may require phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (40Zhou X. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as LPL. Thus, LPL peptide appears to induce two necessary but potentially independent events in control of integrin function. It is intriguing to speculate that the peptide may interact directly with integrin cytoplasmic tails to achieve these effects. Because phosphorylation of LPL may activate its release from actin filaments,2 it is possible that signal transduction leading to LPL phosphorylation frees the N terminus to interact with integrins, leading in turn to their release from cytoskeleton and diffusion to sites of ligand concentration, where a conformational change leading to high affinity interaction occurs upon ligand binding. The term “integrin activation” is sometimes used to mean the modulation of affinity that can be induced in many integrins by Mn2+, activating antibodies, ligand, and sometimes other physiologic or pharmacologic stimuli. If used in this way, integrin activation is thought be related to a conformational change in the extracytoplasmic domain of the integrins and can occur in a wide variety of cell types.

Lymphocytes induced to proliferate with either the mitogen concanavalin A or with anti-CD3 (OKT3) in combination with interleukin 2 (OKT3/IL-2) showed a greatly accelerated rate of [3H]arachidonate-phospholipid remodeling compared with resting lymphocytes or with lymphocytes stimulated with OKT3 or IL-2 alone. The concanavalin A-stimulated cells showed a 2-fold increase in the specific activity of CoA-independent transacylase compared with unstimulated cells, indicating that this enzyme is inducible. Stimulation with OKT3 resulted in greatly increased quantities of the group VI calcium-independent phospholipase A2 but not of the quantity of group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2. However, group IV phospholipase A2 became phosphorylated in OKT3-stimulated cells, as determined by decreased electrophoretic mobility. Incubation of cells with the group VI phospholipase A2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, or the dual group IV/group VI phospholipase A2inhibitor, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, did not block arachidonate-phospholipid remodeling resting or proliferating T cells, suggesting that these phospholipases A2 were not involved in arachidonate-phospholipid remodeling. The incubation of nonproliferating human lymphocytes with inhibitors of CoA-independent transacylase had little impact on cell survival. In contrast, OKT3/IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes were very sensitive to apoptosis induced by CoA-independent transacylase inhibitors. Altogether these results indicate that increased arachidonate-phospholipid remodeling is associated with T cell proliferation and that CoA-independent transacylase may be a novel therapeutic target for proliferative disorders.

In addition to regulating the activation of phospholipase(s) A2(PLA2), which catalyzes the release of AA from phospholipids, it has been shown that inflammatory cells also regulate the distribution of this polyunsaturated fatty acid in cellular phospholipids via an arachidonate-phospholipid (PL)-remodeling pathway (1Chilton F.H.

Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although the calcium-independent group VI PLA2(iPLA2) has been suggested to be associated with arachidonate-PL remodeling (11Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the PLA2 isotype associated with this pathway has not been definitively identified. The rate of arachidonate-PL remodeling is transiently enhanced when leukocytes like neutrophils or mast cells are stimulated with agonists (12Winkler J.D. Sung C.M. Huang L. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Fonteh A.N. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1784-1791PubMed Google Scholar). This increased flux of arachidonate between phospholipid species has been hypothesized to be involved in regulating the release of AA by moving arachidonate into phospholipid pools that are accessible to arachidonate-specific PLA2(s). In an effort to uncover molecules that selectively inhibit the release of arachidonic acid, structurally different classes of compounds were discovered that inhibit CoA-IT (14Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N.

These compounds were shown to be effective inhibitors of arachidonic acid release and, consequently, of leukotriene synthesis in activated leukocytes (16Winkler J.D. Fonteh A.N. Sung C.M. Heravi J.D.

It was recently observed that several cell lines including human promyelocytic HL-60 cells, monocyte-like THP-1 cells, macrophage-like P388D1cells, and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 remodel AA very rapidly through the arachidonate-PL pathway (17Surette M.E.

When these neoplastic cell lines are incubated with CoA-IT inhibitors, not only is arachidonate-PL remodeling effectively inhibited, but the cells readily undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death (18Trimboli A.J. Waite B.M. Atsumi G. Fonteh A.N. Namen A.M. Clay C.E. Kute T.E. High K.P. Willingham M.C. Chilton F.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6171-6177PubMed Google Scholar, 20Winkler J.D. Eris T. Sung C.M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9187-9196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Importantly, isomers of CoA-IT inhibitors, which possess no inhibitory activity against CoA-IT, do not induce apoptosis in these cells (20Winkler J.D. Eris T. Sung C.M. Chabot-Fletcher M. Mayer R.J. Surette M.E. Chilton F.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 956-966PubMed Google Scholar). AA itself seems to play a central role in CoA-IT inhibitor-induced apoptosis since arachidonate-depleted HL-60 cells are much less susceptible to inhibitor-induced apoptosis than non-depleted cells (22Surette M.E. Fonteh A.N. Bernatchez C. Chilton F.H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since arachidonate is rapidly remodeled in these cell lines, CoA-IT inhibition leads to a marked accumulation of free AA, which may impart an anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic signal through ceramide generation or after its transformation to oxygenated derivatives (18Trimboli A.J. Waite B.M. Atsumi G. Fonteh A.N. Namen A.M. Clay C.E. Kute T.E. High K.P. Willingham M.C. Chilton F.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6171-6177PubMed Google Scholar,22Surette M.E. Fonteh A.N. Bernatchez C. Chilton F.H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism of cell death triggered by an accumulation of free AA has been proposed for cells treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (23Chan T.A. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of these proliferating neoplastic cell lines to apoptosis induced by CoA-IT inhibitors may be related to their rapid rate of arachidonate-PL remodeling. However, it is not known if enhanced remodeling activity is a characteristic of proliferating cells or whether accelerated remodeling necessarily renders cells sensitive to apoptosis after CoA-IT inhibition. In the present study, human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were used to determine whether flux through the arachidonate-PL-remodeling pathway is enhanced when non-neoplastic cells are induced to proliferate. Our results show that the rate of arachidonate-PL remodeling is greatly increased when human T cells move out of G0 and begin to divide. This enhanced rate of arachidonate-PL remodeling was associated with an induction of CoA-IT activity but did not depend on iPLA2 or group IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) activity. Importantly, proliferating but not resting T cells were very sensitive to cell death induced by CoA-IT inhibitors. These results suggest that accelerated arachidonate-PL remodeling is a characteristic of proliferating cells and that CoA-IT may be a novel therapeutic target for proliferative disorders. The [5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15-3H]arachidonic acid (204 Ci/mmol) and 1-O-[3H]alkyl(octadecyl)-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine (183 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

James D. Winkler and Lisa Marshall, respectively (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA). LY 311727 (3-(3-acetamide-1-benzyl-2-ethylindolyl-5-oxy)propanephosphonic acid) was a generous gift from Dr. E. Michelich (Ely Lilly, Indianapolis, IN). Methyl arachidonylfluorophosphonate (MAFP) and the bromoenol lactone (BEL) were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The anti-CD3 was produced and purified from the OKT3 clone (a gift from Dr. Walid Mourad, Center Hospitalier de l'Université Laval, Québec, Canada). Human lymphocytes were isolated from the heparinized blood of healthy donors as previously described (24Denholm E.M. Wolber F.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 144: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, lymphocytes (>85% purity) were prepared by sequential centrifugation on Ficoll and Percoll gradients. In experiments where >99% pure lymphocytes were utilized, cells were further enriched by cell sorting after gating on lymphocytes on the basis of forward/side scatter (Epics Elite ESP, Coulter, Miami, FL). After their isolation, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere with or without 10 μg/ml ConA or 1 μg/ml OKT3. In cells incubated with OKT3, 20 units/ml IL-2 were added 24 h after the addition of OKT3 unless indicated otherwise. Cells that had been incubated for the indicated times were centrifuged and resuspended in 200 μl of 10% fetal bovine serum in RPMI. One hundred μl of incubation medium containing [3H]arachidonic acid or [3H]oleic acid (3 μCi/1 × 107 cells) were added to cell suspensions that were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. The cells were then washed twice with 10% fetal bovine serum in RPMI and resuspended in their original incubation medium. In some experiments, BEL, MAFP, SB 203347, or LY311727 were added to the cells immediately after pulse-labeling. Incubations were terminated by washing cells once by centrifugation in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by extraction of cellular lipids with organic solvents (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42681) Google Scholar). The phospholipid classes of the extracts were separated by HPLC using a silica column with a hexane, 2-propanol, ethanol, 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), acetic acid (490:367:100:30:0.6, v/v/v/v/v) mobile phase. After 5 min, the composition of phosphate buffer was increased from 3 to 5%, the acetic acid composition was decreased from 0.06 to 0.02% over a 5-min period, and these concentrations were maintained for the remainder of the run (26Chilton F.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fractions containing neutral lipids, PE, PI/PS, and PC were collected. The extracts were dried under N2, and the [3H]arachidonate content of each fraction was measured by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Instruments LS 5000 CE). The phospholipid subclass analysis was performed as previously described (17Surette M.E. Chilton F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PE and PC fractions isolated by HPLC were dried under a nitrogen stream and vortexed in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). Phospholipase C, 40 and 20 units, was added to the PE and PC fractions, respectively, followed by 2 ml of ethyl ether, and the solutions were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. The resulting diglycerides were extracted with 2 ml of hexane and then again with 2 ml of hexane/ether (1:1, v/v). The pooled extracts were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and acetylated derivatives were prepared by incubating overnight in pyridine/acetic anhydride (1:5, v/v) at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. The solution was dried under N2 and extracted twice with ether/hexane (1:1, v/v). The extract was washed once with 1 ml of water, and the subclasses were separated by TLC using a benzene/hexane/ether (50:45:4, v/v/v) mobile phase. The areas containing 1-acyl, 1-alkyl, and 1-alk-1-enyl-linked lipids were identified by co-migration of standards, which were visualized with iodine. The corresponding areas were scraped, and associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. CoA-IT activity was measured in lymphocyte membrane preparations. Cells were first sonicated in 80 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmNaF, and 0.2 mm NaVO3. The sonicate was then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min (4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 45 min (4 °C). The resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing EGTA (1 mm). The CoA-IT activity assay was performed as described previously (27Winkler J.D. Sung C.M. Bennett C.F. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 100 μl containing 3 μg of membrane protein. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1-O-[3H]alkyl(octadecyl)-2-lyso-PC (0.5 μCi/assay) diluted in assay buffer containing 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and a varied (0 to 1 μm) final concentration of unlabeled 1-O-alkyl(octadecyl)-2-lyso-PC. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C and was stopped with 300 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v). The lipids were then extracted (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42681) Google Scholar), and lyso-PC and PC standards were added as carrier lipids. Lipids were separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:4 v/v/v/v). For kinetic analysis experiments, the assay was configured so that less than 5% of the substrate was converted to product in order to ensure that zero order kinetics could be applied. After the indicated times of cell culture, apoptosis was determined using the annexin V-PI apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, detected by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody C2–10 directed against PARP (28Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Dr Guy Poirier, Center Hospitalier de l'Université Laval, Québec, Canada). Lymphocyte cytosolic proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was blocked 30 min at room temperature with 5% milk protein in TBS-Tween (25 mmTris-HCl, 190 mm NaCl (pH 7.6), and 0.15% Tween 20). The membrane was then washed in TBS-Tween and incubated with polyclonal antibody to iPLA2 (Cayman Chemical Co, Ann Arbor, MI) (1:500 dilution v/v) or with a 1:500 dilution (v/v) of the polyclonal antibody to cPLA2, MF 142 (a generous gift from Dr. Philip Weech of Merck Frosst, Canada), in 1% milk protein in TBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membranes were then washed 5 times for 5 min each in TBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000) (Bio-Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) diluted in TBS-Tween containing 1% milk protein. After having washed the membrane 5 times with TBS-Tween for 5 min each, the antibody complex was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence Plus (Mandel-PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Lymphocytes (1 × 10 6 cells/ml) incubated for the various incubation times were exposed to [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well containing 200,000 cells) for 18 h. The incorporated radioactivity was collected on a glass fiber filter (Printed Filtermat A, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) with a cell harvester (Tomtec, Orange, Conn), and the radioactivity was quantified with a liquid scintillation counter 1450 Microbeta (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Protein content was determined according to a modification of the Lowry method as previously described (30Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Rapidly proliferating transformed cell lines exhibit very rapid arachidonate-PL remodeling (17Surette M.E. Chilton F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Trimboli A.J. Waite B.M. Atsumi G. Fonteh A.N. Namen A.M. Clay C.E. Kute T.E. High K.P. Willingham M.C. Chilton F.H.

These observations suggest that either cell transformation induces an increased flux of arachidonate through this remodeling pathway or that this pathway is accelerated when cells enter the cell cycle and proliferate. Therefore, a first set of experiments investigated whether the induction of cell proliferation results in an enhanced arachidonate-PL remodeling in nontransformed cells. Human lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and incubated without the addition of a stimulus or stimulated with either the T cell mitogen ConA, IL-2, the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3, or with OKT3 followed 24 h later with IL-2 (OKT3/IL-2). When freshly isolated lymphocytes were pulse-labeled with [3H]AA and allowed to incubate for up to 24 h, a slow but measurable redistribution of the radiolabel from PC to PE species was observed (Fig.2 A). This redistribution of arachidonate from PC species to PE species is a hallmark of arachidonate-phospholipid remodeling. A similarly slow but measurable rate of [3H]arachidonate redistribution between phospholipid species was observed when unstimulated cells were pulse-labeled after 1, 2, 3, or 4 days of incubation (data not shown). When freshly isolated, [3H]arachidonate-pulse-labeled cells were stimulated with ConA for 24 h; a similarly slow redistribution of the radiolabel from PC to PE species was also observed. As expected, during this initial 24-h period little induction of cell proliferation was observed in ConA-stimulated cells as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell counting (data not shown). However, when T cells were stimulated with either ConA or OKT3/IL-2 for 3 days, cells underwent rapid proliferation, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3) and cell counting (data not shown). These cells were determined to be >99% pure T cells after CD3 staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). When these 3 day-stimulated T cells were then pulse-labeled with [3H]AA and allowed to incubate further, a very rapid redistribution of [3H]arachidonate from PC to PE species was observed (Fig. 2, B and C). Stimulation of T cells with either OKT3 or IL-2 alone did not induce the degree of cell proliferation (Fig. 3) or increased rate of remodeling (Fig. 2,D and E) observed in ConA- or OKT3/IL-2-stimulated cells; however, treatment of cells with OKT3 alone did result in an induction of cell proliferation that was associated with a more rapid rate of arachidonate-PL remodeling than that observed in resting cells.Figure 3Effects of stimuli on [3H]thymidine incorporation. Lymphocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C without the addition of stimuli (Unstimulated), with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 (OKT3), 20 units/ml IL-2, or with both stimuli (OKT3 + IL-2) for 3 days as described under “Materials and Methods.” [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added for 18 h, and the incorporation of radioactivity into cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting. These results are the average of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The very rapid redistribution of [3H]arachidonate from PC to PE species observed in cells stimulated with ConA or with OKT3/IL-2 was characteristic of arachidonate-phospholipid remodeling since 1) the movement of [3H]arachidonate was mainly from 1-acyl-linked PC species to 1-alkyl-, 1-alk-1-enyl-, and 1-acyl-linked-PE species (Table I), 2) no net redistribution of [3H]arachidonate to or from PI/PS species was observed because the amount of [3H]arachidonate in these phospholipid classes remained constant during the incubation period (Fig. 2, B andC), and 3) cells pulse-labeled with [3H]oleate showed no redistribution of radiolabel between different phospholipid classes (Table I). Altogether, these results indicate that a very rapid rate of arachidonate-PL remodeling is associated with the proliferation of peripheral blood T cells.Table IDistribution of radiolabel in phospholipid subclasses and classes in ConA-stimulated T cellsIncubation timePercent of radiolabel in phospholipid subclassPercent radiolabel in phospholipid class[3H]Arachidonic acid[3H]Oleic acid1-acyl-PC1-alkyl-PC + 1-alk-1-enyl-PC1-acyl-PE1-alkyl-PE + 1-alk-1-enyl-PEPCPI/PSPEt = 0 h42.7 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.513.7 ± 36.3 ± 0.276.1 ± 5.35.9 ± 2.518.0 ± 2.7t = 24 h20.3 ± 3.51.7 ± 0.226.0 ± 1.427.2 ± 1.171.0 ± 4.19.1 ± 2.619.9 ± 1.5Cells incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml ConA for 3 days were then pulse-labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid or [3H]oleic acid, and lipids were extracted immediately (t = 0) or were incubated for another 24 h before lipid extraction and analysis.

The remodeling of arachidonate between phospholipid species requires several enzymatic activities. The step that is unique to this pathway is that which is catalyzed by CoA-IT. This enzyme has not yet been isolated; however, its activity has been characterized and can be assayed in broken cell preparations (27Winkler J.D. Sung C.M. Bennett C.F. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether the enhanced remodeling measured in proliferating T cells may be associated with an increase in CoA-IT activity, 100,000 × g particulate fractions were prepared from both unstimulated and ConA-stimulated lymphocytes, and CoA-IT activity was assayed. As can be seen in Fig. 4, 100,000 × g fractions from stimulated cells consistently showed an ∼2-fold increase in CoA-IT activity compared with unstimulated cells, indicating that the enhanced flux of arachidonate through the remodeling pathway observed in stimulated cells was associated with an induction of CoA-IT activity. Another key step associated with this remodeling pathway is that catalyzed by a PLA2 (Fig. 1). However, the PLA2 isotype involved in arachidonate-PL remodeling h"

We investigated regulation of organic anion secretion in a way that allowed us to examine simultaneously regulation of overall transepithelial secretion and to estimate the separate contributions of regulation of the basolateral and apical transport steps to this overall regulation. The data were verified by measurement of initial basolateral uptake rate and initial apical efflux rate. Opossum kidney cells were used as a suitable model system for proximal tubule cells, and [14C]para-aminohippurate was utilized as an organic anion. Stimulation of protein kinase C inhibited transepithelial secretion because of inhibition of both apical efflux and basolateral uptake. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase MEK reduced transepithelial secretion via inhibition of basolateral uptake and apical efflux. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) enhanced transepithelial secretion via stimulation of basolateral uptake but did not affect apical efflux. EGF induced stimulation of basolateral uptake was abolished by inhibition of MEK. EGF led to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which was also abolished by inhibition of MEK. Thus, EGF stimulated basolateral uptake of organic anions via MAPKs. Transepithelial organic anion secretion can be regulated at two sites, at least: basolateral uptake and apical efflux. Both steps are under control of protein kinase C and MAPK. The pathophysiologically relevant growth factor EGF enhances transepithelial secretion via stimulation of basolateral uptake.

Cell Physiol Biochem. 1996; 6: 28-38Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The basolateral organic anion exchanger is a tertiary active transport system, dependent on an inward directed Na+ gradient to drive the uptake of α-ketoglutarate, which is then exchanged for organic anions (1Friis C.

Only recently, the homologous protein was cloned from human kidney and called hOAT1 or hPAHT (8Hosoyamada M. Sekine T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F122-F128PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lu R. Chan B.S. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F295-F303PubMed Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms have been described for the apical efflux of organic anions (10Roch-Ramel F. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which differ with species and experimental setup used. For example, a PAH1/dicarboxylate exchanger, a PAH/anion exchanger, and a membrane potential-dependent mechanism have been described (11Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1649-1654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence for the involvement of oatp, OAT-K1, and OAT-K2 (10Roch-Ramel F. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Schaub T.P. Kartenbeck J. Konig J. Vogel O. Witzgall R. Kriz W. Keppler D. J. Am. Soc.

Thus, secretion of organic anions is mediated by a well described, tertiary active transport step at the basolateral membrane and a not yet settled, apical transport step. Very little is yet known about the modulation of the secretory organic anion transport system. Nagai and co-workers (17Nagai J. Yano I. Hashimoto Y. Takano M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F674-F679PubMed Google Scholar) showed an inhibition of basolateral uptake and transepithelial secretion of organic anions in OK cells by parathyroid hormone via a staurosporine sensitive mechanism. Inhibition of basolateral organic anion transport during stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) was reported in isolated tubules of kilifish (18Miller D.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F156-F164PubMed Google Scholar). The basolateral exchanger for organic anions and dicarboxylates in isolated proximal tubules of rabbit kidney was shown to be sensitive to inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (19Gabriels G. Werners A. Mauss S. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 710-715PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of OAT1 by bradykinin and phenylephrine via PKC in isolated rabbit proximal tubules has been described (20Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Sauvant C. Bednarczyk D. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F251-F256PubMed Google Scholar). In most of the studies, only regulatory events at the basolateral membrane were investigated. The study of Nagai and co-workers investigated transepithelial transport, but they used the rather unspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Inhibition of net secretory transport (21Shuprisha A. Lynch R.M. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F104-F109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of organic anions by bradykinin and phenylephrine has been reported for isolated perfused rabbit proximal tubules. Recently, Henderson and co-workers (22You G. Kuze K. Kohanski R.A. Amsler K. Henderson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10278-10284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that PKC inhibits murine OAT without direct phosphorylation of the transport protein itself. Taken together, these studies give no detailed information concerning the contribution of the single transport steps to the regulation of transcellular secretion. To address this problem, we investigated transcellular secretion in combination with measurements of initial basolateral uptake rate and initial apical efflux rate. In the present study, we determined the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and MAPKs on PAH transport in OK cells. EGF and its receptor are known to be expressed in proximal tubular cells (23Taira T. Yoshimura A. Iizuka K. Inui K. Oshiden K. Iwasaki S. Ideura T. Koshikawa S. Virchows Arch. 1996; 427: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). EGF has been suggested as a mediator of normal tubulogenesis and tubular regeneration after injury. A reduction of renal EGF expression and/or urinary excretion has been reported during acute and chronic tubular injury (24Grandaliano G. Gesualdo L. Bartoli F. Ranieri E. Monno R. Leggio A. Paradies G. Caldarulo E. Infante B. Schena F.P. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 182-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Additionally, EGF led to an increase in PAH excretion in rats (25Fleck C. Pertsch J. Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 1999; 51: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), indicating an influence of EGF on proximal tubular organic anion transport. MAPKs are known to be involved in renal stress response and represent an important downstream signal of the EGF pathway (26Lieberthal W. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F3-F11Google Scholar). Our data show that activation of PKC inhibits both the basolateral and the apical step of PAH secretion. Moreover, we show that MAPK activity is required for a proper activity of basolateral uptake step and the apical exit of PAH. EGF stimulates transepithelial secretion via stimulation of the basolateral uptake but does not affect the apical transport step. EGF leads to successive activation of the MAPKs, ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). OK cells were obtained from Dr. Biber (Department of Physiology, University of Zurich). Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The growth medium was minimal essential medium, pH 7.4, supplemented with Earl's salts, nonessential amino acids, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG, 12213 Berlin, FRG), and 26 mmol/liter NaHCO3. Cells were cultured on permeable supports (3-μm pore diameter; Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for transport measurements. The effective growth area on one permeable support was 4.3 cm2/filter. All studies were performed between passages 60 and 100. The seeding density was 0.4·106cm−2. The medium was changed every third day, and the monolayers were used for experiments at day 10 after seeding. The effect of 10−7m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 5 × 10−5m DOG on PAH secretion was determined in nonquiescent and quiescent cells, as shown in Fig. 1. OK cells were made quiescent by cultivating them in serum depleted cell culture medium for 24 h before the experiments. In both cases, secretion (Fig. 1 A) was reduced to a greater extent than cellular content (Fig.1 B), indicating that apical transport may be affected by PKC. Moreover, the effects were more pronounced in quiescent (means serum depleted for 24 h) cells (Fig. 1, right panel) as compared with nonquiescent cells (Fig. 1, left panel). In nonquiescent cells EGF showed no effect on cellular PAH content or transepithelial PAH secretion (data not shown). Because fetal calf serum contains a variety of chemokines, it is evident that investigation of the effect of an isolated chemokine is only possible in the absence of serum. As shown for PKC and mentioned for EGF, the effects on organic anion transport in OK cells were more pronounced or only apparent when cells were made quiescent. Thus, quiescent OK cells were used for all subsequent experiments. The volumes of the apical and basolateral compartment were 1.3 and 2.5 ml to avoid hydrostatic pressure differences. Before each experiment, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered Ringer (138 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 4 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 5 mmol/liter glucose, pH 7.4). Transport measurements were performed in phosphate-buffered Ringer at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. The concentrations of the radiolabeled substrates applied to the basolateral bath were: 1.5 × 10−6 mol/liter or 15 × 10−6mol/liter [14C]PAH, and 55 × 10−9mol/liter [3H]mannitol or 55 × 10−10mol/liter [3H]mannitol. [3H]Mannitol was used to correct secretion for paracellular fluxes and to determine extracellular water space. At the end of the experiment, the apical and basolateral solutions were collected. Subsequently, the filters were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and cut from the supports. Radioactivity of the solutions and the cells was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instruments, Frankfurt, Germany). Counts of cells on filters were corrected for nonspecific binding on filters by subtraction. To investigate PAH efflux, the cells were incubated with 15 × 10−6 mol/liter [14C]PAH for 60 min. After washing, the efflux was determined during the first minute. Apical and basolateral solutions and the cellular compartment were collected separately. Radioactivity in the solutions and the cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The total amount of counted [14C]PAH was set as amount of [14C]PAH in the cells at time 0 of the efflux experiments. OK cells were rinsed three times with PBS followed by a 10-min incubation with EGF and/or PD98059. Subsequently cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) for 25 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content was determined using a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell lysates were matched for protein, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane. Subsequently, membranes were blotted with rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (p42/p44) antibody (New England Biolabs). The primary antibody was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG visualized by ECL Western blotting reagents and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). According to the manufacturer's handbook Hyperfilm ECL exhibits a linear response to the light produced from enhanced chemiluminescence. Additionally, linearity was verified for our experimental conditions by a dilution series with increasing amounts of total cell protein. Western blotting was performed with protein from five independent extractions from five independent cell culture passages. Blots were analyzed using SigmaGel 2000 Software (Jandel Scientific). According to our measurements (Fig.2 A) secretory transport of organic anions in the OK clone used is detectable after 3–4 min and is then linear for at least 1 h (data not shown). Thus, secretory transport after 10 min represents the linear phase of secretion. Therefore, the amount of radiolabeled PAH in the apical compartment after 10 min was used to measure PAH secretion. The quantity of PAH in the cells is denominated cellular content. Summing up the values for PAH secretion and for cellular PAH content gives the basolateral uptake of PAH, i.e. the total amount of PAH transported across the basolateral membrane during 10 min. Additionally, we calculated the ratio of secretion to cellular content of PAH (the secretion-to-content ratio). Introducing these parameters enabled us to gain information regarding the contribution of basolateral and/or the apical transport step(s) to the overall secretion of PAH. Under our experimental conditions uptake of PAH is linear at least during the first 1.5 min as shown in Fig. 2 B (right panel), and no net secretion of PAH occurs (data not shown). Thus, the cellular PAH content after 1 min represents the initial basolateral uptake rate. Thus, the predictions concerning the basolateral part of PAH transport derived from the 10-min transport experiments were verified by the 1-min data. After preloading the cells as described above, we determined the apical efflux of [14C]PAH during the first min as percentage of cellular PAH content at time 0. Because the volume of the apical compartment is about 1000 times that of the cells, there is a large outward gradient during the entire experimental period. According to Fig. 2 C (right panel), efflux into the apical compartment is linear at least during 1.5 min, and, thus, the gradient is not collapsed in the time frame investigated. Therefore, the apical efflux during 1 min represents the initial apical efflux rate. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. n is given in the text or in the figures. n represents the number of culture plates or filters used. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance as appropriate. Results were considered statistically different at p < 0.05. Significant differences are indicated by asterisks. [14C]PAH (55 mCi/mmol) and [3H]mannitol (15 mCi/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). PD98059 was from Alexis Corp. (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). U0126 was from Promega Corp.(Madison, WI). Antibody against the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) was from New England Biolabs Inc. If not stated otherwise, all other chemicals were from Sigma. EGF from Sigma was used as human, recombinant substance. We wanted to investigate regulation of organic anion secretion in a way that would allow us to examine regulation of overall transepithelial secretion and the separate contributions of the basolateral and apical transport steps to this overall regulation, simultaneously. For this purpose, we chose the proximal tubule-derived OK cell line cultured on permeable supports, a well characterized model system to investigate organic anion secretion (27Hori R. Okamura M. Takayama A. Hirozane K. Takano M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F975-F980PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nagai J. Takano M. Hirozane K. Yasuhara M. Inui K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1161-1166PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sauvant C. Silbernagl S. Gekle M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 13-20PubMed Google Scholar). Probenecid (10 mm), the classical inhibitor of organic anion transport, and a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled PAH, both inhibited uptake and secretion of [14C]PAH by more than 95% (data not shown). Thus, our particular cell clone transports organic anions in accordance to the published data mentioned in the introduction. Stimulation of PKC by 5 × 10−5m DOG reduced secretion of PAH (Fig. 3 A), whereas the cellular content (Fig. 3 B) was not significantly different from control. Adding up secretion and cellular content of PAH gives the amount of PAH transported across the basolateral membrane (Fig.3 C). Transport across the basolateral membrane was reduced by DOG, in agreement with other studies (18Miller D.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F156-F164PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gabriels G. Werners A. Mauss S. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 710-715PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Sauvant C. Bednarczyk D. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F251-F256PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the decreased secretion-to-content ratio (Fig. 3 D) indicates that the apical transport step is also inhibited by PKC. However, there is another possible explanation. The apical transport is carrier mediated and thus has a hyperbolic relationship to substrate concentration. A decrease in intracellular concentration could reduce this ratio, without inhibition of the apical step itself. Thus, experiments on initial transport rates will have to decide what kind of explanation applies to these data. Simultaneous inhibition of apical and basolateral transport was confirmed by measurement of initial apical efflux rate and initial basolateral uptake rate. As shown in Fig.4 A, activation of PKC reduced the initial apical efflux rate, thereby leading to a decreased relative amount of PAH in the apical bath as compared with control. In addition, Fig. 4 B shows that stimulation of PKC reduced the initial basolateral uptake rate of PAH. By contrast, inhibition of PKC with 10−7m BIM increased basolateral uptake of PAH (data not shown). Thus, the basolateral organic anion transport in OK cells is regulated by PKC in agreement with data published previously (19Gabriels G. Werners A. Mauss S. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 710-715PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Sauvant C. Bednarczyk D. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F251-F256PubMed Google Scholar). EGF increased cellular content (Fig. 5 B) and transepithelial secretion (Fig. 5 A) of PAH. However, EGF did not affect secretion-to-content ratio for PAH (Fig. 5 D) at all, indicating that EGF stimulates basolateral PAH transport in OK cells but does not affect the apical transport step. Initial efflux experiments showed no change in PAH efflux across the apical membrane in EGF treated cells (Fig.6 A). These data confirm the predictions derived from the 10-min transport experiments with EGF (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 6 B, EGF stimulates the initial basolateral uptake rate of PAH in agreement with the prediction derived from the 10-min experiments.Figure 6Effect of EGF (10 ng/ml) on initial apical efflux rate of [14C] PAH (A) and initial basolateral uptake rate of [14C] PAH (B) in quiescent OK cells. A, apical efflux of [14C]PAH during 1 min was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EGF was present during the last 10 min before efflux. Apical efflux is presented as percentages of PAH content of the OK cells at efflux time 0. n = 3 for every bar.B, initial uptake of 15 × 10−6m during 1 min was determined as described. The cells were incubated with EGF 10 min before the uptake was determined. In between, the cell epithelia were washed once with PBS. n = 6 for every bar. *, p < 0.05 versuscontrol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that EGF uses the MAPK pathway also in OK cells (30Kribben A. Herget-Rosenthal S. Lange B. Michel M.C. Philipp T. Ren. Fail. 1998; 20: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of substances that inhibit MAPK activation. Transepithelial secretion (Fig.7 A) and basolateral uptake (Fig. 7 C) of PAH were reduced by PD98059 (inhibitor of MEK), whereas cellular PAH content (Fig. 7 B) was increased 3-fold as compared with control. The secretion-to-content ratio (Fig.7 D) was dramatically decreased in the presence of PD98059. These data indicate a strong inhibitory effect of PD98059 on the apical transport step of PAH secretion. Furthermore, it is possible that the increased cellular content of PAH results solely from the strong inhibition of the apical exit step of PAH, whereas the basolateral transport step remains unchanged. This is also true for the observed reduction of basolateral uptake in Fig. 7. In fact, even an increase in basolateral transport activity would be in agreement with these data. Thus, in this particular configuration, it is impossible to draw a final conclusion concerning the basolateral transport step. As Fig.8 A clearly shows, the prediction concerning the apical step is confirmed by the data obtained from efflux experiments. PD98059 inhibited initial apical efflux rate significantly. Initial basolateral uptake rate of PAH (Fig.8 B) is also reduced by PD98059. These data show that basolateral uptake of PAH in OK cells is inhibited by inhibition of MEK. Increasing the concentration of PD98059 to 50 μm(Fig. 8 B), which represents the maximal effective concentration, leads to an increased inhibition of initial basolateral uptake rate of PAH, indicating a dose-dependent action of PD98059 on the basolateral transport.Figure 8Effect of PD98059 on initial apical efflux rate of [14C] PAH (A) and initial basolateral uptake rate of [14C] PAH (B) in quiescent OK cells. A, apical efflux of [14C]PAH during 1 min was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PD98059 (5 × 10−6m) was present during the last 10 min before efflux. Apical efflux is presented as percentages of PAH content of the OK cells at efflux time 0. n = 3 for every bar. B, initial uptake of 15 × 10−6m during 1 min was determined as described. The cells were incubated with PD98059 (5 × 10−6m or 5 × 10−5m) for 10 min before the uptake was determined. Between this incubation and the uptake measurement, the cell epithelia were washed once with PBS. n for every bar is given in parentheses. *, p < 0.05versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, transepithelial secretion of PAH in OK cells is under the stimulatory control of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK. Increased secretion when MEK is active results from a stimulation of both basolateral and apical transport (Fig.9 A). Similar results were obtained with another, structurally different, MEK inhibitor U0126 (data not shown). As already mentioned, it is known that the MAPK pathway is stimulated by EGF in OK cells (30Kribben A. Herget-Rosenthal S. Lange B. Michel M.C. Philipp T. Ren. Fail. 1998; 20: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the stimulatory effect of EGF on basolateral PAH transport is mediated by MAPK. As shown in Fig. 10, inhibition of the MAPK MEK by PD98059 or U0126 completely abolishes the stimulatory effect of EGF on initial basolateral PAH uptake. These data indicate that the stimulatory effect of EGF on basolateral uptake is mediated by the activation of MEK. As shown in Fig. 11, EGF leads to increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in OK cells within 10 min. PD98059 alone, slightly but significantly, decreased the amount of pERK1/2 as compared with controls. These data are in good agreement with the effects on PAH transport. However, EGF increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is reduced by inhibition of MEK with PD98059, whereas EGF-stimulated uptake of PAH is totally abolished by PD98059. We explain this apparent discrepancy with the existence of intermediate signaling steps between ERK and basolateral organic anion transport, as discussed in detail later on. Finally we tested whether preincubation for 10 min with EGF or PD98059 affects glutarate uptake in OK cells. Glutarate is a nonmetabolizable analogue of the dicarboxylate α-ketoglutarate. EGF and PD98059 did not affect basolateral uptake of glutarate (control: 1.2 ± 0.1,n = 3; 10 ng/ml EGF: 1.4 ± 0.1, n= 3; 5 μm PD98059: 1.3 ± 0.3, n = 6; in pmol·cm−2·10 min−1). Furthermore, EGF did not affect apical glutarate uptake (control: 0.9 ± 0.1,n = 3; 10 ng/ml EGF: 1.1 ± 0.1, n= 3; in pmol·cm−2·10 min−1). Thus, availability of intracellular counterions for PAH uptake is not altered by EGF or PD98059. Previously published data showed no effect of PD98059 on basolateral glutarate uptake (19Gabriels G. Werners A. Mauss S. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 710-715PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data present strong evidence that EGF stimulates exchange of dicarboxylates and organic anions via stimulation of the ERK1/2 (Fig.9 C). The purpose of the present study was (a) to gain more information concerning the overall regulation of the proximal tubule organic anion transport and (b) to investigate the contribution of the basolateral and apical transport steps to this regulation. As shown for EGF, we were able to determine their effects on the basolateral and apical transport steps simultaneously with their effects on transepithelial secretion. However, inhibition of MEK by PD98059 led to a configuration (reduced secretion, increased content, reduced uptake, and reduced secretion-to-content ratio) where determination of the contribution of the basolateral transport step simultaneously with secretion was not possible, indicating the limitations of the method. This is also true for the DOG effect presented. However, with the help of initial apical efflux experiments and determination of the initial basolateral transport rate it is possible to investigate apical and basolateral transport steps separately. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to estimate the site of action of a chemokine on the secretory transport simultaneously with transepithelial transport, although transport occurs across two membranes (and the cytosol). Thus, the particular processing of the 10-min transport data presented here is suitable to obtain a first estimate regarding the site of action of a given modulator of secretory transport. Stimulation of PKC inhibits basolateral uptake rate and inhibition of MEK decreases basolateral uptake rate of PAH (Fig. 9 A). These data are in agreement with the action of PKC (18Miller D.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F156-F164PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gabriels G. Werners A. Mauss S. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 710-715PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Sauvant C. Bednarczyk D. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F251-F256PubMed Google Scholar) and MAPK (19Gabriels G. Werners A. Mauss S. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 710-715PubMed Google Scholar) in isolated proximal tubules and again show the suitability of the OK cell system used. Additionally, we show for the first time that PKC inhibits and MEK stimulates the apical step of organic anion secretory transport in a proximal tubule derived cell line (Fig. 9 A). Because the specific PKC inhibitors calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide stimulate basolateral uptake of PAH, the observed inhibitory action of DOG is due to an interaction with regulatory cascades and not due to nonspecific or even toxic action. Furthermore, the calphostin C-induced stimulation of PAH uptake was prevented by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and DOG (data not shown). Systematic changes in mannitol flux were not observed with any of the substances used. Thus, no changes in epithelial tightness were induced, and the measured changes in PAH transport are not due to altered paracellular flux. The unchanged epithelial tightness, together with the short exposure time (10 min) and the moderate concentrations used, make it highly unlikely that any observed effect is due to unspecific toxic actions. As the above mentioned maneuvers act directly on intracellular signaling pathways, we investigated the effect of more physiologically or pathophysiologically relevant stimuli, namely EGF. We show for the first time that EGF increases the secretion of PAH in OK cells by a stimulation of the basolateral uptake step. EGF does not affect the apical transport step (Fig. 9 B). The effect of EGF on basolateral uptake is mediated by MEK, because two specific, structurally distinct inhibitors of MEK (PD98059 and U0126) completely abolished EGF induced stimulation of initial basolateral PAH uptake. As shown in Fig. 8 B, 5 μm PD98059 led to a slight decrease of initial PAH uptake. This is in parallel with the decrease of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by 5 μmPD98059. However, the same concentration of PD98059 completely prevented the EGF-induced stimulation of initial basolateral PAH uptake. This was also the case for the structurally distinct MEK inhibitor U0126. The fact that inhibition of MEK decreased uptake only slightly but abolished EGF-stimulated uptake completely is strong evidence for the fact that EGF acts on basolateral transport via stimulation of MEK. Moreover, as already mentioned above, no secretion of organic anions in OK cells was detected during the first min. Thus, alterations of the apical transport step should not influence initial basolateral uptake rate. Inhibition of MEK prevented EGF-induced stimulation of basolateral PAH uptake completely; however, it reduced EGF induced ERK1/2 activation only partially. We consider this difference of action as evidence that ERK1/2 does not act directly on basolateral organic anion uptake but via one or more intermediate signaling steps. In fact, preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that phospholipase A2 is involved in downstream signaling following ERK1/2 activation (31Sauvant C. Gekle M. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439 (suppl.) (abstr.): 348Google Scholar). These intermediate steps (as e.g. phospholipase A2) possibly modulate the signal downstream of ERK1/2 in such a way that a partial inhibition of ERK1/2 activation leads to a complete inhibition of PAH uptake stimulation. This could be explained by a certain ERK1/2 activation threshold that has to be exceeded to stimulate the downstream signals. Thus, we hypothesize that EGF stimulates basolateral organic anion uptake via the successive activation of MEK, ERK, and additional downstream signaling steps (Fig.9 C). However, additional experiments will be necessary to clarify the downstream signal transduction and amplification network with respect to organic anion uptake in more detail. As seen in the control lane of Fig. 11 B, OK cells show a certain intrinsic ERK1/2 activation, although they were serum depleted for 24 h. Our observations indicate that OK cells with higher intrinsic ERK1/2 activation show higher control levels of basolateral PAH uptake as compared with those with a lower ERK1/2 activation (data not shown). These data again support the hypothesis that ERK1/2 activity regulates organic anion transport in OK cells. Because the effects of EGF were studied after 10 min of exposure, it can be excluded that the regulatory events observed resulted from changes in protein synthesis. However, up to now we can only speculate on the molecular events involved in the observed regulatory phenomena. Possible mechanisms include an increased insertion of preformed transport protein by fusion of vesicles with the basolateral membrane in response to EGF. Of course EGF could also lead to stimulation of transport proteins in the cell membrane, by e.g.phosphorylation. Future experiments will investigate the effects of EGF on the affinity (Km) and the maximum transport rate (Vmax) of basolateral organic anion uptake in more detail. By contrast to the events at the basolateral membrane, stimulation of MEK by EGF did not lead to a stimulation of the apical transport step, although PD98059 data indicate a regulatory role of MEK on the apical transport step, too. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the fact that basal MEK activity already induces maximal stimulation of apical transport. Consequently, reduction of basal ERK1/2 activity by PD98059 (Fig. 11) leads to reduced apical and basolateral transport, whereas activation of MEK by EGF affects only the basolateral step. Another possible explanation is the involvement of additional signal pathways downstream of EGF, which might antagonize the MEK effect on apical transport but not on basolateral transport. Finally, there is the possibility of basolateral signaling microdomains, which confine the effect of EGF. Future experiments will have to explain this apparent discrepancy. PAH clearance is routinely used for the determination of renal blood flow, based on the assumption of a high and constant renal PAH extraction. Because PAH extraction would vary according to the regulatory state of its transport system, it is conceivable that the determination of renal blood flow from PAH clearance may lead to under- or overestimation. Corrigan et al. (32Corrigan G. Ramaswamy D. Kwon O. Sommer F.G. Alfrey E.J. Dafoe D.C. Olshen R.A. Scandling J.D. Myers B.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F312-F318PubMed Google Scholar), for example, described a decreased renal PAH extraction after postischemic acute renal failure in humans, leading to severe underestimation of renal blood flow. After renal injury, a rapid fall of EGF mRNA in the kidney was measured (26Lieberthal W. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F3-F11Google Scholar). We could show that the basolateral step of PAH secretory transport is under stimulatory control of EGF, which is in agreement with excretion data from rat (25Fleck C. Pertsch J. Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 1999; 51: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and could explain, at least in part, the above mentioned data from Corrigan. In summary, we were able to determine the site of regulation of the secretory transport of organic anions. The results obtained were confirmed by measurements of initial basolateral uptake rate and initial apical efflux rate. Thus, we could show that activation of PKC inhibits not only the basolateral but also the apical step of organic anion secretion. We also showed that MEK stimulates not only the basolateral but also the apical transport step of organic anion secretion. Additionally, we presented data indicating a stimulation of the organic anion secretion by EGF. This stimulation resulted from an increase of the basolateral uptake rate only. Furthermore, we showed that EGF stimulates the basolateral uptake of organic anions via successive activation of MEK and ERK. In conclusion, the excretion of organic anions in proximal tubular cells seems to be a regulated and therefore variable process. This may be particularly important under pathophysiological conditions. We thank Prof. Dr. Stefan Silbernagl for stimulating and helpful discussions. We thank Prof. Dr. William H.

All the snoRNAs that were analyzed here carry two sequences complementary to rRNA target sites and obey the +5 rule for guide methylation. Studies on transgenic parasites carrying the snoRNA-2 gene in the episomal expression vector (pX-neo) indicated that no promoter activity was found immediately adjacent to this gene. Deleting the flanking sequences of snoRNA-2 affected the expression; in the absence of the 3′-flanking (but not 5′-flanking) sequence, the expression was almost completely abolished. The snoRNA genes are transcribed as polycistronic RNA. All snoRNAs can be folded into a common stem-loop structure, which may play a role in processing the polycistronic transcript. snoRNA B2, a member of a snoRNA cluster, was expressed when cloned into the episomal vector, suggesting that each gene within a cluster is individually processed. Studies with permeable cells indicated that snoRNA gene transcription was relatively sensitive to α-amanitin, thus supporting transcription by RNA polymerase II.

The nucleolus of eukaryotic cells contains numerous small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)1that play a regulatory role in rRNA biogenesis (1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev.

The snoRNAs can be divided into two major groups: the box C/D snoRNAs and H/ACA snoRNAs (6Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.

Although some of the snoRNAs are involved in pre-rRNA cleavage, most function in site-specific modification, i.e.2′-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridine formation.Ribose methylations are guided by box C/D snoRNAs that contain two sequence motifs, box C (5′-PuUGAUGA-3′, where Pu is purine) and box D (5′-CUGA-3′) (7Kiss-László S.

The box C/D snoRNAs contain long stretches (>10 nucleotides) that perfectly complement the universal core regions of the mature rRNA. Studies in both yeast and mammals indicate that the fifth nucleotide (+5) upstream from box D or D′ within the domains of interaction between the guide RNA and the rRNA target site is methylated; this is known as the +5 rule (7Kiss-László S.

The essential and abundant snoRNAs such as U3, U8, and U13 are expressed from their own promoters, whereas most vertebrate and some yeast snoRNAs are encoded by introns of host genes (1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 35: 897-934Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 5Weinstein L.B. Steitz J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, most of the snoRNAs are encoded by introns of host genes that encode proteins involved in ribosome biosynthesis and function (14Leverette R.D. Andrews M.T. Maxwell E.S. Cell. 1992; 71: 1215-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Fragapane P. Prislei S. Michienzi A. Caffarelli E. Bozzoni I.

However, in yeast, only a few snoRNAs are encoded by introns, and most of them are independently transcribed (1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 35: 897-934Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 4Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The maturation of most of the intron-encoded snoRNAs involves debranching of the lariat, followed by exonucleolytic trimming (17Ooi S.L. Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Boeke J.D. RNA. 1998; 4: 1096-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The self-transcribed snoRNAs are processed from a precursor by endonucleolytic cleavage and exonucleolytic trimming (18Villa T. Ceradini F. Presutti C. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3376-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In yeast, the exonucleases Rat1p and Xrn1p were shown to play a role in 5′ to 3′ trimming (18Villa T. Ceradini F. Presutti C. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3376-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Petfalski E. Dandekar T. Henry Y. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1144-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, the processing of the independently transcribed box C/D or H/ACA snoRNAs in yeast requires the endonuclease Rnt1p, which is the yeast ortholog of bacterial RNase III. Interestingly, Rnt1p specifically cleaves the duplex region of pre-snoRNAs (21Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cleaved precursor is then processed by exonuclease trimming. The splicing-independent processing mechanism also functions in processing the clustered plant snoRNAs, which are processed from a precursor molecule (23Leader D.J. Clark G.P. Watters J. Beven A.F. Shaw P.J. Brown J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein factor(s) were found to bind the snoRNA termini, including boxes C and D (24Watkins N.J. Leverette R.D. Xia L. Andrews M.T. Maxwell E.S. RNA. 1996; 2: 118-133PubMed Google Scholar, 25Xia L. Watkins N.J. Maxwell E.S. RNA. 1997; 3: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar), which protect the snoRNAs from further degradation by the processing exonucleases.Trypanosomatids are protozoan parasites that diverged very early in the eukaryotic lineage (26Sogin M.L. Elwood H.J. Gunderson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These organisms possess some unique RNA-processing pathways, including pre-mRNAtrans-splicing (27Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 28Ullu E. Tschudi C. Günzl A. Smith D.F. Parsons M. Molecular Biology of Parasitic Protozoa. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 115-129Google Scholar) and RNA editing (29Stuart K. Allen T.E. Heidmann S. Seiwert S.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). So far, there is no evidence that polymerase (pol) II-regulated promoters exist; the genes are regulated post-transcriptionally by mRNA stability (30Pays E. Vanhamme L. Smith D.F. Parsons M. Molecular Biology of Parasitic Protozoa. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 88-114Google Scholar,31Myler P.J. Audleman L. deVos T. Hixson G. Kiser P. Lemley C. Magness C. Rickel E. Sisk E.

Trypanosomatid rRNA also has a peculiar processing pathway; the large subunit rRNA (28 S) is further processed into two large and six small rRNA fragments (32Campbell D.A. Kubo K. Clark C.G. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Very little is known so far about ribosome biogenesis in trypanosomatids. Previously, we reported the identification of the first box C/D snoRNA, which was termed snoRNA-2 inLeptomonas collosoma (33Levitan A. Xu Y.-x. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We suggested that trypanosomatids obey the canonical +5 rule for snoRNA-mediated methylation. The snoRNAs located within the spliced leader-associated (SLA1) RNA loci were studied in several trypanosomatids, including Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania tarentolae. It was found that the trypanosomatid snoRNAs do not obey the general methylation rules. More specifically, the methylation sites corresponding to the duplex formed between the snoRNA and the target site are located either 1 or 6 nucleotides upstream from box D or D′ (34Roberts T.G. Sturm N.C. Yee B.K., Yu, M.C. Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, 17 box C/D snoRNAs were analyzed from T. brucei (35Dunbar D.A. Wormsley S. Lowe T.M. Baserga S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14767-14776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against the cloned T. brucei fibrillarin protein. Mapping of the methylation sites potentially guided by eight snoRNAs suggested that the T. brucei snoRNAs obey the +5 rule.To further elucidate the trypanosomatid snoRNA structure-function relationship and the mode of transcription and processing, we specifically studied four box C/D snoRNAs encoded by three chromosomal loci. Our analyses indicate that there is no irregularity in the guide methylation rule of the trypanosomatid snoRNAs and that the L. collosoma box C/D snoRNAs obey the +5 rule. The genes we analyzed were transcribed as polycistronic precursors. Proper expression of a tagged snoRNA-2 gene cloned into the episomal vector pX-neorequires at least 20-nucleotide flanking sequences. Expression, although at a lower level, was detected even in the absence of an upstream sequence, suggesting the lack of a conventional promoter adjacent to the gene. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a promoter may lie upstream from the gene cluster. Transcriptional studies performed in permeable cells suggest that snoRNA gene transcription is relatively sensitive to α-amanitin, similar to pol II-transcribed genes. The data in this study suggest that the expression of trypanosomatid snoRNAs is mainly regulated at the processing level.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotidesThe oligonucleotides for snoRNA-2 (33Levitan A.

Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 333-338Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cultures were harvested at log phase, and total RNA was prepared with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Cloning and SequencingL. collosoma small ribonucleoproteins were enriched by DEAE chromatography and fractionation on sucrose gradients (33Levitan A.

The RNA obtained from 10–20 S particles was extracted and separated on a preparative denaturing gel, and two RNA bands of ∼85 and ∼90 nucleotides, designated RNAs B2 and G2, respectively, were eluted from the gel, labeled at the 5′-end, and used to screen a phage genomic library (33Levitan A.

Two λ phage for RNAs B2 and G2 were isolated and further analyzed by subcloning ∼500- and ∼600-bp Sau3AI fragments into the pBluescript plasmid, respectively. A 1.2-kb HpaII fragment overlapping the RNA G2 Sau3AI fragment was also subcloned. All clones were sequenced with T3 and T7 primers.Plasmid ConstructionTagging of the snoRNA-2 and B2 genes was performed by PCR mutagenesis using primers carrying the tag. The sequences of the tagged constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The deletions of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of snoRNA-2 were constructed by PCR and cloned into the pX-neo episomal vector, which carries a neomycin resistance gene (neo) upstream from the cloning site. Stable cell lines carrying the different constructs were established as previously described (40Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Northern and Primer Extension AnalysesThe RNA samples (5 μg) were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide with 7 murea gel and electroblotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization with labeled oligonucleotides was performed at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Primer extension was performed using end-labeled oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm/pmol). After annealing at 60 °C for 15 min, the sample was kept on ice for 1 min; 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Expand RT, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added; and extension was performed at 42 °C for 90 min. The reaction was analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel next to a DNA sequencing reaction with the same primer. Primer extension sequencing of the rRNA was carried out as previously described (41Patzelt E. Perry K.L. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4291-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Determination of 2′-O-Methylated NucleotidesThe primer extension reaction for mapping the 2′-O-methylation nucleotides was performed in the presence of different concentrations of dNTPs using 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to the 3′-end downstream from each methylated position (42Maden B.E.H. Corbett M.E. Heeney P.A. Pugh K. Ajuh P.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 43Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Total RNA (0.5 μg/μl) was annealed with end-labeled primer at 60 °C for 5 min; the annealing mixture was chilled on ice. The reaction was carried out in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.6), 60 mm NaCl, 9 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μg of RNA, 10,000 cpm labeled primer, and 1 unit/μl reverse transcriptase (Expand RT) at 0.05–5.0 mm dNTP. After incubation at 42 °C for 1 h, the reaction was analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide with 7 m urea gel next to primer extension rRNA sequencing with the same primer. The same experimental procedure was used to determine the 2′-O-methylated sites in yeast (43Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).RT-PCRTotal RNA (20 μg) was extensively treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (5 units; Promega), and the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated in ethanol. One-tenth of the precipitated RNA was used to prepare cDNA as described above, except that two unlabeled oligonucleotides (10 pmol) complementary to the sequence downstream of the snoRNA-2 and G2 coding region (oligonucleotides 22076 and 22078, respectively) were used. One-tenth of the sample was further used as templates for the PCRs with primers located in the intergenic or coding region.Transcription Analysis in Permeable CellsL. collosoma cells were made permeable generally as previously described (44Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), except that the transcription buffer contained an additional 20 mm potassium glutamate. The radiolabeled RNA was purified with TRIzol reagent and was used for hybridization. RNA was hybridized with blotted plasmid DNA (using a Bio-Rad dot-blot apparatus). Hybridization was performed in 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 45 °C. The blots were washed at 55 °C in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS.RESULTSSequence, Structure, and Genomic Organization of Two Loci Encoding Four snoRNAsWe previously described the enrichment of L. collosoma small ribonucleoproteins by fractionation on a DEAE-Sephacel column and sucrose gradient (33Levitan A. Xu Y.-x. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Xu Y.-x. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNA enriched by these fractionations was separated on a denaturing gel, and size-selected RNAs were labeled and used as probes to clone the corresponding genes from a genomic library. Using such a scheme, we previously identified and isolated the first trypanosomatid box C/D snoRNA, snoRNA-2 (33Levitan A. Xu Y.-x. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated and characterized two additional λ phage encoding small RNA genes. A 520-bpSau3AI subclone generated from one λ phage that hybridized strongly with RNA B2 was termed the b2 locus. Two fragments, 560-bpSau3AI and 1.2-kb HpaII subclones derived from the other phage, which hybridized with the labeled RNA G2, were termed the g2 locus. The b2 locus carries two putative snoRNAs that were termed B2 and TS1. The g2 locus carries four snoRNAs. The first two are shared with the b2 locus and were therefore termed B2′ and TS1′; the other two were designated G2 and TS2. Fig.1 A presents the sequence of the 1.2-kb g2 genomic locus. The coding regions of B2 and B2′ as well as TS1 and TS1′ are identical. However, the sequences flanking the genes are different (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the two cloned genes represent two different chromosomal loci. Indeed, Southern blot analyses using g2 and b2 as probes showed that these genes are duplicated in the genome since digestion with restriction enzymes of a 6-bp recognition site always resulted in at least two fragments, and partial digestion with Sau3AI produced a duplicated ladder (data not shown). Southern blot analyses also indicated that the gene is repeated at least five times in each locus, as previously demonstrated for the snoRNA-2 gene (33Levitan A. Xu Y.-x. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The genomic organization of the b2 and g2 loci is illustrated in Fig. 1 B. One characteristic of these genomic loci was the presence of runs of GT and GC dinucleotides in the regions flanking the snoRNA genes (Fig.1 A).To demonstrate the existence of these snoRNA transcripts, we used an antisense oligonucleotide to each of the snoRNAs in Northern analyses and primer extensions. The results, presented in Fig.2, indicate that the sizes of B2, G2, TS1, and TS2 are 92, 84, 91, and 90 nucleotides, respectively. Position +1 of the RNA (Fig. 1 A) was obtained from primer extension (data not shown). The intensity of the hybridization signals reflects the abundance of the snoRNAs; snoRNA-2 is more abundant than the other snoRNAs examined.Figure 2Expression analysis of the snoRNA genes.Total L. collosoma RNA (3 μg) was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide with 7m urea gel and electroblotted onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with end-labeled antisense oligonucleotides specific for the different snoRNAs as indicated:lane 1, snoRNA-2 (oligonucleotide 16865); lane 2, snoRNA B2 (oligonucleotide 20406); lane 3, snoRNA G2 (oligonucleotide 20405); lane 4, snoRNA TS1 (oligonucleotide 20936); lane 5, snoRNA TS2 (oligonucleotide 20935).Lane M, end-labeled pBR322 HpaII digest.nt, nucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Trypanosomatid Box C/D Methylation snoRNAs Obey the Canonical +5 RuleComputer sequence analysis was performed to determine whether these snoRNAs belong to the family of box C/D methylation snoRNAs by searching for the potential base pairing interaction between the snoRNAs and the rRNA sequences. Fig.3 presents the results. snoRNA B2 has the potential to guide ribose methylation of G3403 and C3484 on 28 S rRNA, TS1 to guide ribose methylation of U910 and A921 on 28 S rRNA, G2 to guide ribose methylation of A3697 and A3709 on 28 S rRNA, and TS2 to guide ribose methylation of G893 and G2981 on 28 S rRNA. In each case, the potential for base pairing presented perfect complementarity across a duplex of 10–12 bp. One exception was that the sequence downstream of box C in snoRNA G2 can potentially interact with 18 S rRNA by perfect base pairing (Fig. 3). However, no methylation sites were found in the region of rRNA that forms base pairing with the snoRNA G2 sequence (data not shown). Our data suggest that there are methylated sites on rRNA that are conserved through trypanosomatids, yeast, and man. The methylation of adenosine at position 921, proposed to be guided by TS1, is guided by U32/U51 in humans and by snR39/snR59 in yeast, and the methylation of adenosine at position 3709, proposed to be guided by G2, is guided by human U29 and by yeast snR71. These yeast/human snoRNAs carry exactly the same guiding sequences as the trypanosomatid homologs. 2T. M. Lowe, personal communication. However, the other methylation sites that we analyzed are trypanosomatid-specific. Of interest is the potential of these snoRNAs to form a very conserved structure with their adjacent target sites on the rRNA (Fig. 3). In this proposed model, boxes C and C′ were found in proximity.Figure 3Schematic representation of potential base pairing interactions between the snoRNAs and their target sites on rRNA. The conserved boxes C/C′ and D/D′ are marked. The potential guided methylation sites are marked with asterisks. The identities of the RNAs and the sequence positions on rRNA are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The finding that the methylated positions are conserved among trypanosomatids, yeast, and mammals supports the notion that the same guiding rule is shared by these organisms. Indeed, our previous studies using the mapping of partial alkali hydrolysis supported the +5 rule since the methylated site on 5.8 S rRNA was located at position 5 upstream from box D′ of snoRNA-2 (33Levitan A. Xu Y.-x. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the 2′-O-methylated nucleotides by a reverse transcriptase primer extension assay in the presence of dNTPs from low to high concentrations (42Maden B.E.H. Corbett M.E. Heeney P.A. Pugh K. Ajuh P.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and the results agree well with"
https://openalex.org/W2046162808,"The mechanism of inactivation of bovine factor Va by plasmin was studied in the presence and absence of phospholipid vesicles (PCPS vesicles). Following 60-min incubation with plasmin (4 nm) membrane-bound factor Va (400 nm) is completely inactive, whereas in the absence of phospholipid vesicles following a 1-h incubation period, the cofactor retains 90% of its initial cofactor activity. Amino acid sequencing of the fragments deriving from cleavage of factor Va by plasmin demonstrated that while both chains of factor Va are cleaved by plasmin, only cleavage of the heavy chain correlates with inactivation of the cofactor. In the presence of a membrane surface the heavy chain of the bovine cofactor is first cleaved at Arg348 to generate a fragment of Mr 47,000 containing the NH2-terminal part of the cofactor (amino acid residues 1–348) and a Mr 42,000 fragment (amino acid residues 349–713). This cleavage is associated with minimal loss in cofactor activity. Complete loss of activity of the membrane-bound cofactor coincides with three cleavages at the COOH-terminal portion of the Mr 47,000 fragment: Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313. These cleavages result in the release of the COOH terminus of the molecule and the production of a Mr 40,000 fragment containing the NH2-terminal portion of the factor Va molecule. Factor Va was treated with plasmin in the absence of phospholipid vesicles followed by the addition of PCPS vesicles and activated protein C (APC). A rapid inactivation of the cofactor was observed as a result of cleavage of the Mr 47,000 fragment at Arg306 by APC and appearance of aMr 39,000 fragment. These data suggest a critical role of the amino acid sequence 307–348 of factor Va. A 42-amino acid peptide encompassing the region 307–348 of human factor Va (N42R) was found to be a good inhibitor of factor Va clotting activity with an IC50 of ∼1.3 μm. These data suggest that plasmin is a potent inactivator of factor Va and that region 307–348 of the cofactor plays a critical role in cofactor function and may be responsible for the interaction of the cofactor with factor Xa and/or prothrombin.

Prothrombin is activated to α-thrombin by the prothrombinase complex, which is composed of the serine protease factor Xa, and the protein cofactor factor Va assembled on a membrane surface in the presence of Ca 2+ ions (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 57: 915-956Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Formation of the prothrombinase complex increases the catalytic efficiency of prothrombin activation by 5 orders of magnitude as compared with factor Xa alone (2Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Factor V circulates in plasma as a single chain procofactor (Mr 330,000). The cDNA sequence for bovine factor V and the deduced amino acid sequence has been determined previously (3Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. Mann K.G. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2971-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1The numbering in this study refers to bovine coagulation factor V (see Fig. 1).1The numbering in this study refers to bovine coagulation factor V (see Fig. 1). The active form of the protein, factor Va, contains a heavy chain (Mr 94,000), which is derived from the NH2-terminal part of the procofactor (residues 1–713), and a light chain (Mr 74,000), which corresponds to the COOH-terminal part of the molecule (amino acids 1537–2183 (9Samis J.A. Ramsey G.D. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. Giles A.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 943-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (see Fig. 1). The two chains are non-covalently associated via divalent metal ions (4Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of both bovine and human factor Va by APC2 occurs in the presence of a lipid bilayer or platelet surface and is well documented (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APC inactivates bovine factor Va by cleavage at Arg505, Arg306, and Arg662 (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1).Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, although having completely opposite influences on the hemostatic process, communicate and regulate each other via several proteins. Important regulatory roles are exercised by thrombin on fibrin clot formation and fibrin clot solubilization. Although the former role of thrombin is well established, the latter effect is exercised on thrombolysis via thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, which is both activated and subsequently inactivated by α-thrombin (7Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 8Nesheim M.E. Wang E. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The effect of plasmin, the end product of fibrinolysis, on several coagulation proteins (i.e. factors IX and X) has been recently reported (9Samis J.A. Ramsey G.D. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. Giles A.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 943-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pryzdial E.L.G. Lavigne N. Dupuis N. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8500-8505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that plasmin is a potent inactivator of factor Va, and previous studies have demonstrated that bovine factor Va is inactivated by plasmin in the absence and presence of a lipid bilayer following cleavages of both the heavy and light chains (11Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of plasmin on the human procofactor has been also reported previously (12Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no details concerning the specific proteolytic cleavage sites on factor V/Va have yet been reported, and the direct correlation of one or more of the proteolytic cleavages with complete inactivation of the cofactor has not yet been made. The present study was undertaken to establish the plasmin-inactivating cleavage sites on the bovine cofactor and the relation between proteolysis and inactivation of the cofactor in the presence and absence of a phospholipid membrane surface.DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate that plasmin inactivates membrane-bound factor Va following cleavage of the heavy chain of the cofactor at Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313. These cleavages result in the dissociation of the A2 domain of factor Va from the rest of the molecule (Fig. 14). Previous data have demonstrated that factor Xa cleavage at Arg348 has no effect on cofactor activity (24Odegaard B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that incubation of factor Va with factor Xa and or prothrombin results in the protection of the cofactor from inactivation by plasmin (11Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrate that a 42-amino acid residue peptide spanning the region 307–348 is a good inhibitor of factor V/Va clotting activity. Together, these data suggest that amino acid region 307–348 of factor Va is involved in the interaction of the cofactor with factor Xa and/or prothrombin. This region may also be involved in chain-chain interaction.Figure 14Schematic representation of the proteolytic cleavages of plasmin on bovine factor Va. The domain structure of the cofactor's heavy and light chains is detailed in the legend of Fig. 1. The position of the inactivating cleavages by plasmin are shown by the heavy arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using monoclonal antibodies to the light and heavy chains of bovine factor Va, we have demonstrated that the A1 (Mr∼40,000 fragment) and the A3 (Mr 30,000 fragment) domains of factor Va are involved in the interaction with factor Xa (30Kalafatis M. Xue J. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the binding to each chain separately was weak, inhibition of either of the binding sites separately by a specific monoclonal antibody to factor Va completely abolished factor Xa-factor Va interaction. Thus, it is possible to completely abolish the factor Xa interaction with factor Va by inhibiting only one of its interactions with the cofactor. Our present data indicate that the fragment previously identified to contain the epitope of the monoclonal antibody comprises amino acid residues 1–309. Structural modeling of the amino acid region 307–348 using as a template the published structure of ceruloplasmin (26Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11, in black) suggests that this portion of factor Va heavy chain is almost entirely exposed to the solvent. This region is 80% identical between the human, bovine, and mouse species, verifying its importance throughout evolution. Moreover, two of the plasmin cleavage sites within this region, i.e. Lys309 and Arg313, are conserved in all three species, demonstrating the importance of these residues throughout evolution for the regulation of the activity of the cofactor. A peptide containing this amino acid portion of the molecule was found to inhibit factor Va clotting activity with an IC50 of ∼1.3 μm. We have recently demonstrated that cleavage of factor Va heavy chain by APC at Arg306 results in the dissociation of the A2 domain of the cofactor from the rest of the molecule and subsequent inactivation (31Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our present data narrows down a smaller domain that is important for factor Va cofactor activity (i.e. amino acid region 314–348). Collectively the data suggest that amino acid region 1–309 of factor Va (A1 domain) is most likely involved in chain-chain interaction, whereas amino acid region 314–348 is involved in factor Va cofactor function and possesses a binding site for factor Xa and/or prothrombin (Fig. 14).Cleavage of factor Va by APC at Arg306 is lipid-dependent, and it occurs with a significant rate when factor Va and APC are bound to a membrane surface (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavages of factor Va by plasmin at Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313 are also accelerated in the presence of a membrane surface. However, plasmin does not interact with the phospholipid vesicles. Thus, it must be concluded that factor Va structure in the region 306–325 (between the A1 and A2 domains) is altered following binding of the light chain of the cofactor to a membrane surface. Our data demonstrate that this region is actively involved in cofactor function. It is remarkable that this amino acid region, although exposed on the surface of the cofactor in solution as deduced from the modeling of the molecule by using as a template the x-ray structure of ceruloplasmin (26Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11), is not accessible to circulating proteases. This segment, which most likely undergoes conformational changes following binding of factor Va to a membrane surface, could be a “control switch” for factor Va activity prior to its binding to a cell surface and clot initiation. The amino acid segment 306–325 is located within a distorted segment between the A1 and A2 domains of the heavy chain of the cofactor that is most likely a flexible loop structure (26Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Prior to clot formation, this region must remain intact to perform its functions (i.e. binding of factor Xa and/or prothrombin). Following clot formation this region becomes vulnerable to antithrombotic proteases (i.e. APC, plasmin), because the clotting process must be terminated.Our data demonstrate that all plasmin cleavages are considerably accelerated when the cofactor is bound to a membrane surface. Cleavage of the light chain at Arg1643 as well as the proteolytic wobble on the light chain at Arg1752 and Arg1753 and the inactivating cleavages at Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313 are observed in the presence of a membrane surface. We have previously demonstrated that cleavage of the human or bovine cofactor at Arg306 is anionic-lipid dependent (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of the active cofactor to a cell surface during normal hemostasis increases its susceptibility to cleavage and inactivation by antithrombotic proteases (i.e. APC and plasmin). In normal hemostasis there is a controlled balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. An imbalance between these two processes leads to pathologic conditions resulting to the unnecessary activation/inactivation of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (32Bick R.L. Arun B. Frenkel E.P. Haemostasis. 1999; 29: 111-134PubMed Google Scholar). In clinical DIC, the course of the disease is complicated by uncontrolled proteolysis of important clotting factors. It is noteworthy that most physicians consider DIC as a hemorrhagic syndrome rather than a massive thrombosis during DIC, because the hemorrhage is often impressive. In humans, an increase in the plasma concentration of plasmin correlates with decreased factor VIIIa and factor Va activities (33Wyshock, E. G., Suffredini, A. F., Parillo, J. E., and Colman, R. W. (1995) 80, 377–389.Google Scholar, 34Hedner, U., Johansson, L., and Nilsson, I. M. (1978)51, 157–164.Google Scholar) thus partially explaining the massive bleeding syndrome during DIC. More interestingly, factor V cleavage in thrombolytic therapy is primarily plasmin-mediated and potentially associated with hemorrhagic events subsequent to the thrombolytic therapy (35Tracy R.P. Rubin D.Z. Mann K.G. Bovill E.G. Rand M. Geffken D. Tracy P.B. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1997; 30: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our data correlates specific cleavages in factor Va with inactivation by plasmin and provides markers that could be used for the detection of factor V following thrombolytic therapy. Recently, we have reported an assay in whole plasma that could differentiate between normal factor V and factor VLEIDEN (36Kalafatis M. Bernardi F. Simioni P. Lunghi B. Girolami A Mann K.G.

Because we have defined the proteolytic fragments derived from factor Va following cleavage by plasmin, a similar assay that would detect factor V fragments in whole plasma might be useful in preventing serious complication following thrombolytic therapy. Furthermore, the presence in plasma of the factor Va-derived peptide containing amino acid residues 314–348 could be an indicator of plasmin activation and ongoing fibrinolysis.Our data show that the structure of factor Va is equivalent to that of factor VIIIa. Furthermore, the mode of inactivation of the two cofactors, although similar, involves amino acid sequences that are completely opposite in nature. Factor VIIIa cofactor activity involves an acidic peptide located between the A1 and A2 domains (amino acid residues 337–372, with 35 amino acids) (37Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas our data show that factor Va activity involves an amino acid region containing mostly basic amino acids (307–348, with 42 amino acids). These differences in structure between the two cofactors are most likely related to their participation to the interaction with different proteins that are member of two different complexes with totally different specificity. Factor Va is the cofactor for prothrombinase for the activation of prothrombin, whereas factor VIIIa is the cofactor for the intrinsic tenase for the activation of factor X. Thus, the critical amino acid regions that are responsible for their interaction with the components of prothrombinase and intrinsic tenase must be (and are) unique to each cofactor to ensure their specificity.A binding domain for factor X has been reported on the COOH-terminal acidic region of factor VIII (amino acid residues 337–372) (37Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a binding site for prothrombin may be located within the basic amino acid region 314–348 of factor Va. Interestingly, a recent publication by Kojima et al. (38Kojima Y. Heeb M.J. Gale A.J. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using synthetic peptides suggested that a binding domain for factor Xa is located within amino acid residues 311–325 of factor Va. Our study supports these results. However, the study by Kojima et al. did not demonstrate direct competition of binding between factor Va and factor Xa by the synthetic peptide(s). Furthermore, in the study of Kojima et al. (38Kojima Y. Heeb M.J. Gale A.J. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) the inhibitory peptide was also found to interact with prothrombin. Thus, the peptide region defined by our study may be essential for the interaction of the cofactor with factor Xa and/or prothrombin, and more data are necessary to establish the exact amino acid residues involved in the interaction of factor Va with the components of prothrombinase.Recently, the mechanism of cleavage of platelet factor Va by plasmin was also studied on the surface of platelets (39Conlon S.J. Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 2505Google Scholar). The addition of a high concentration of plasmin (∼10 nm) to the platelet-bound platelet factor Va resulted in a 4-fold increase in cofactor activity when compared with the activity of the cofactor observed in the absence of plasmin. Under the conditions employed, the increased cofactor activity was sustained as long as 4 h. The increased cofactor activity was not due to a plasmin-mediated release of residual cofactor stores, because the release of additional platelet factor Va was not detected. In marked contrast, only a small increase in cofactor activity (∼1.5-fold) was observed when plasma factor Va was added to activated platelets. Furthermore, in contrast to its platelet counterpart, the plasma factor Va was immediately inactivated by plasmin. When platelets were removed from the mixture and phospholipid vesicles were used to supply a membrane surface, a rapid inactivation of platelet factor Va was observed following a 1-h incubation time period. Based on the epitope specificity of the various monoclonal antibodies used in Western blotting experiments, we hypothesize that plasmin-induced cleavages in the NH2-terminal portion of the platelet factor Va heavy chain, most likely at amino acid residue 348, are responsible for both the gain and maintenance in the platelet factor Va cofactor activity.In conclusion, cleavages of factor Va at Arg348 by plasmin (present data) and by factor Xa (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Odegaard B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not responsible for any substantial loss in cofactor activity. The initial loss in factor Va cofactor activity in the absence of a membrane surface (∼10%, after 1 h; Fig. 2, filled circles) is due to secondary slow cleavages of the cofactor by plasmin at Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313. These cleavages are very slow in the absence of a membrane surface as demonstrated in Fig. 3,lane 3, and are accelerated when the substrate is theMr 47,000 fragment (Fig. 3, lanes 4–7). Thus, amino acid region 307–348 is crucial for the expression of factor Va cofactor activity. This region of factor Va is important for factor Va cofactor activity, because it most likely contains a binding site for factor Xa and/or prothrombin. Cleavage of the cofactor by plasmin at Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313 will result in the dissociation of the A2 domain of factor Va from the A1 domain/light chain resulting in its inactivation. Coagulation involves a multitude of proteins that respond to a vascular injury by forming the procoagulant enzyme α-thrombin. Prothrombin is activated to α-thrombin by the prothrombinase complex, which is composed of the serine protease factor Xa, and the protein cofactor factor Va assembled on a membrane surface in the presence of Ca 2+ ions (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 57: 915-956Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Formation of the prothrombinase complex increases the catalytic efficiency of prothrombin activation by 5 orders of magnitude as compared with factor Xa alone (2Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V circulates in plasma as a single chain procofactor (Mr 330,000). The cDNA sequence for bovine factor V and the deduced amino acid sequence has been determined previously (3Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. Mann K.G. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2971-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1The numbering in this study refers to bovine coagulation factor V (see Fig. 1).1The numbering in this study refers to bovine coagulation factor V (see Fig. 1). The active form of the protein, factor Va, contains a heavy chain (Mr 94,000), which is derived from the NH2-terminal part of the procofactor (residues 1–713), and a light chain (Mr 74,000), which corresponds to the COOH-terminal part of the molecule (amino acids 1537–2183 (9Samis J.A. Ramsey G.D. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. Giles A.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 943-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (see Fig. 1). The two chains are non-covalently associated via divalent metal ions (4Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of both bovine and human factor Va by APC2 occurs in the presence of a lipid bilayer or platelet surface and is well documented (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APC inactivates bovine factor Va by cleavage at Arg505, Arg306, and Arg662 (5Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, although having completely opposite influences on the hemostatic process, communicate and regulate each other via several proteins. Important regulatory roles are exercised by thrombin on fibrin clot formation and fibrin clot solubilization. Although the former role of thrombin is well established, the latter effect is exercised on thrombolysis via thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, which is both activated and subsequently inactivated by α-thrombin (7Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 8Nesheim M.E. Wang E. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The effect of plasmin, the end product of fibrinolysis, on several coagulation proteins (i.e. factors IX and X) has been recently reported (9Samis J.A. Ramsey G.D. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. Giles A.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 943-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pryzdial E.L.G. Lavigne N. Dupuis N. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8500-8505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that plasmin is a potent inactivator of factor Va, and previous studies have demonstrated that bovine factor Va is inactivated by plasmin in the absence and presence of a lipid bilayer following cleavages of both the heavy and light chains (11Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of plasmin on the human procofactor has been also reported previously (12Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no details concerning the specific proteolytic cleavage sites on factor V/Va have yet been reported, and the direct correlation of one or more of the proteolytic cleavages with complete inactivation of the cofactor has not yet been made. The present study was undertaken to establish the plasmin-inactivating cleavage sites on the bovine cofactor and the relation between proteolysis and inactivation of the cofactor in the presence and absence of a phospholipid membrane surface. DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate that plasmin inactivates membrane-bound factor Va following cleavage of the heavy chain of the cofactor at Lys309, Lys310, and Arg313. These cleavages result in the dissociation of the A2 domain of factor Va from the rest of the molecule (Fig. 14). Previous data have demonstrated that factor Xa cleavage at Arg348 has no effect on cofactor activity (24Odegaard B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that incubation of factor Va with factor Xa and or prothrombin results in the protection of the cofactor from inactivation by plasmin (11Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrate that a 42-amino acid residue peptide spanning the region 307–348 is a good inhibitor of factor V/Va clotting activity. Together, these data suggest that amino acid region 307–348 of factor Va is involved in the interaction of the cofactor with factor Xa and/or prothrombin. This region may also be involved in chain-chain interaction.Using monoclonal antibodies to the light and heavy chains of bovine factor Va, we have demonstrated that the A1 (Mr∼40,000 fragment) and the A3 (Mr 30,000 fragment) domains of factor Va are involved in the interaction with factor Xa (30Kalafatis M. Xue J. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the binding to each chain separately was weak, inhibition of either of the binding sites"

Previous work in our laboratory has shown that constitutive expression of Id-1 in SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells inhibits their differentiation and induces proliferation, invasion, and migration. Id-1 expression also correlates with the invasive and aggressive potential of human breast cancer cells. However, little is known about Id-1 target genes that are important for regulating normal and transformed breast epithelial cell phenotypes. Now we report the cloning of a novel zinc finger protein, Zfp289, using degenerate primers to specifically amplify cDNAs from Id-1-transfected SCp2 cells. Zfp289 has homology with a yeast zinc finger protein, the GTPase-activating protein Gcs-1, which was initially identified as a gene required for the re-entry of cells into the cell cycle after stationary phase growth. Zfp289 mRNA expression pattern correlates with Id-1 expression in SCp2 mammary epithelial cells under various experimental conditions as well as in the mouse mammary gland at different stages of development. It is predominantly present in the cytoplasm of the cells as evident from green fluorescent protein fusion protein localization. SCp2 mammary epithelial cells with constitutive expression of Zfp289 have a higher S-phase index, compared with control cells, when cultured in a serum-free medium.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 factors are transcription factors that bind DNA as homo- or heterodimers and regulate transcription of target genes containing E-boxes (CANNTG) or E-box-like sequences in their promoters. Dimerization occurs through interactions of the HLH domains, while binding to DNA is mediated by the basic domain. These factors have been shown to regulate the expression of tissue-specific genes in a number of mammalian and nonmammalian organisms (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Id proteins (for “inhibitors of differentiation or DNA binding”) are dominant negative regulators of the bHLH transcription factors. Id proteins contain an HLH domain, allowing them to form dimers with bHLH proteins, but they lack the basic domain, and therefore such dimers, Id/bHLH, do not bind DNA (2Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Therefore, Id proteins do not regulate transcription directly, but indirectly, by preventing bHLH proteins from interacting with the promoter of various target genes. The role of Id proteins in the tissue-specific regulation of growth and differentiation has been examined in several systems. For example, Id-1 has been found to inhibit differentiation in myoblast (2Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that constitutive expression of Id-1 results in the inhibition of differentiation of SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It also induces proliferation, invasion, and migration of the same cells (9Desprez P.Y.

In addition, Id-1 is highly expressed in aggressive and invasive human breast cancer cell lines as compared with noninvasive cell lines (9Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and in biopsies from invasive ductal carcinomas as compared with ductal carcinomasin situ (10Lin C.Q.

Investigations have shown that Id-1 is a positive regulator of G1-S phase transition during cell cycle progression and is also involved in inducing apoptosis (11Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G.

A recent report demonstrated that Id-1 and Id-3 might also control angiogenesis by regulating the growth and invasion of endothelial cells (17Lyden D. Young A.Z. Zagzag D. Yan W. Gerald W. O'Reilly R. Bader B.L. Hynes R.O. Zhuang Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Nature. 1999; 401: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). However, little is known about Id target genes, which are important for regulating growth, differentiation, invasion, and apoptosis of normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells. In this paper, we report the cloning of a novel Id-1-induced zinc finger protein, Zfp289, which is predominantly localized in the perinuclear compartment of the cells and which appears to function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Zfp289 expression is correlated with the proliferative stages of mammary epithelial cells in culture and during mammary gland development, and this novel zinc finger protein is able to induce higher S-phase entrance when constitutively expressed in epithelial cells. We used PCR amplification to isolate genes specifically regulated by Id-1, as indicated by their up-regulation in SCp2 cells transfected with Id-1. Our rational for selecting the degenerate primers was that we previously demonstrated a novel matrix metalloproteinase family member to be up-regulated in SCp2 cells transfected with Id-1 (9Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since we were particularly interested in cloning this novel metalloproteinase, and since most of the known metalloproteinases have a “Cys” motif and a “zinc” binding motif in their sequence, we designed degenerate primers against two regions of interest, one containing a cysteine residue Cys (PRCGXPD), the other a catalytic domain binding zinc ions (VAAHEFGHALGLH). Cys and zinc sequences were as followed: 5′-S(c/g)GR(g/a) TGT GGY(c/t) S(c/g)W (a/t)R(g/a) CCN(a/c/g/t) GA-3′ and 5′-GCR(g/a) TGS(g/c) CCV(a/c/g) AAY(c/t) TCR(g/a) TGS(c/g) GC-3′. Total RNA was isolated from SCp2-Id-1-transfected cells and SCp2 control cells, and cDNA was prepared. Specific AP-1 adaptors (Marathon cDNA amplification kit) were ligated at both ends of the cDNAs, and a first round of PCR amplification was performed using adaptor-specific primers on one side and zinc primers on the other. A second round of amplification was performed using the PCR product from the first round and using Cys and zinc primers. Only two amplified products of 0.8 and 2.6 kb were visible. We used annealing temperatures of 45 and 50 °C to obtain sharp bands at 0.8 and 2.6 kb, respectively. Both of these bands were extracted and cloned into a TOPO vector for sequencing. SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and insulin (5 μg/ml), at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, as described previously (18Desprez P.Y. Roskelley C. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell Differ. 1993; 1: 99-110Google Scholar). For experiments in serum-starved conditions, fetal bovine serum was omitted. Pool populations of SCp2 cells transfected with an empty vector or with the murine Id-1 sense cDNA driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter were as described previously (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Single cell-derived clones from SCp2 cells transfected with an Id-1 antisense cDNA (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were derived by plating cells at limiting dilutions in 24-well plates. The Zfp289 encoding region including the Kozak sequence was amplified from theBamHI site at the 5′-end, to either BamHI (for LXSN vector) or SalI site (for pBabe vector) at the 3′-end. The restriction digested fragments were then cloned into appropriate sites of LXSN and pBabe vectors. These viral vectors were then packaged in TSA-54 cells (Cell Genesis, Foster City, CA). After infecting the SCp2 cells with control or Zfp289 vectors, stably transfected cells were selected with neomycin and puromycin (for LXSN and pBabe vectors, respectively). For intracellular localization studies, the full-length coding sequence of Zfp289 was cloned into a pEGFP vector (CLONTECH) between the SalI and BamHI sites. The pEGFP vector was transfected using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Neomycin-resistant cells were subcultured, and localization of the GFP fusion protein was determined under inverted fluorescent microscopy. Total cellular RNA was isolated and purified as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). RNA (15 μg) was size-fractionated by electrophoresis through denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Nylon membrane (Hybond-N from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were hybridized with32P-labeled probes prepared by random oligonucleotide priming, washed, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for autoradiography (20Maniatis T. Frisch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased fromCLONTECH and probed as above. The Zfp289 probe was the PCR-amplified 2.6-kb fragment described under “cDNA Cloning of Zfp289,” whereas β-casein and Id-1 probes were as described previously (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The clusterin probe was obtained by subtractive hybridization, 2J. Singh and P. Y. Desprez, unpublished data. and the β-actin probe was obtained from CLONTECH. BALB/c wild type virgin female mice were purchase from Simonsen Laboratories, Inc. (Gilroy, CA) and some were mated at the age of 12 weeks. The animals were sacrificed, and biopsies of the fourth inguinal mammary gland were performed at 3, 7, and 12 weeks of age for the virgin stage; at days 2 and 12 of pregnancy; and at days 2, 7, 20, and 21 of lactation. Mammary glands were immediately frozen at −70 °C until utilized for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using TriPure Isolation reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells (104 or 5 × 104) plated on coverslips were labeled with [3H]methylthymidine (10 μCi/ml; 60–70 Ci/mmol) for at least 7 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then fixed for 5 min with 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetone and methanol kept at −20 °C. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-diluted 1:10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min. The coverslips were air-dried, coated with Kodak NTB2 emulsion (1:2 dilution), and exposed for 16–24 h. The coverslips were developed with D19, fixed with Rapid-fix, and viewed by phase contrast microscope. The coding region of Zfp289 was amplified by PCR and then cloned into a bacterial expression vector pTrcHis A (Invitrogen). The 6×His-tagged protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain DH5α. After inducing protein expression for 5 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, bacteria were pelleted and lysed under denaturing conditions in buffer containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2PO4, pH 8.0, for 1 h at room temperature with continuous shaking. Cellular debris was then pelleted by centrifugation of cell lysate at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then transferred to a column and sequentially washed with Buffer 1 (6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and Buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0) to remove the nonspecific proteins and to renature the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-bound proteins (21Holzinger A. Phillips K.S. Weaver T.E. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The 6×His-tagged ZFP-289 protein was eluted with Buffer 2 containing 50 mm EDTA. The eluted protein was concentrated by using centricon column, and the purity of the sample (75–80%) was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Full-length coding region of mouse ARF-1 (ADP-ribosylation factor-1) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHis A. After induction of recombinant ARF-1 for 5 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were lysed and supernatant mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads as described above. The beads were transferred to a column and washed with Buffer 3 (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m Na2PO4, pH 6.3). The bound 6×His-tagged ARF-1 was eluted with Buffer 4 (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mNa2PO4, pH 5.9) and then again with Buffer 4 containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted ARF-1 was renatured by sequential dialysis against 4 m urea, 100 mmNa2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, then against 2 m urea 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and finally twice against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The renatured ARF-1 was concentrated, and its purity (about 80–85%) was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. ARF-GAP activity was assayed by measuring the effects of the putative GTPase-activating protein (Zfp289) on the hydrolysis of ARF-bound GTP to GDP, with some modifications of the assay previously described by Goldberg (22Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, ARF-1 was incubated with [γ-32P]GTP for 30 min in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) containing 0.3 mm [γ-32P]GTP. ARF ([γ-32P]GTP) was then diluted 10 times with binding buffer. GTPase assay was done by incubating GTP-bound ARF-1 with or without Zfp289 at room temperature for 20 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture. After incubation, the samples were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane, washed four times with Tris buffer saline, and radioactivity assayed by scintillation counting. The potential GTPase-activating protein activity of Zfp289 was determined as the decrease of label associated with ARF-1. Using degenerate primers as described under “Materials and Methods,” we isolated two cDNA clones (0.8 and 2.6 kb) preferentially up-regulated in SCp2-Id-1-transfected cells. A partial sequencing of the 0.8-kb band revealed that it corresponded to a known gene encoding histone H3.3. Since we only performed a partial sequencing of this clone and did not analyze it further, we could not ascertain the presence of the zinc and Cys motifs. Using this cDNA as a probe, two mRNAs of 1.2 and 1.8 kb were detected in SCp2 cells cultured in 5% serum (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) and in SCp2-Id-1 serum-starved for 2 days (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). The other 2.6-kb band corresponded to a gene encoding a mRNA of about 2.9 kb. We found a higher expression of this 2.9-kb transcript in serum-starved Id-1-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) as compared with control cells, which were also serum-starved for 2 days and which showed a reduced amount of Id-1 protein (Fig.1 A, lane 2). We detected a high level of expression of this 2.9-kb transcript in control SCp2 cells cultured in the presence of 5% serum (Fig.1 A, lane 1). This level of expression was not further increased in Id-1-transfected SCp2 cells also cultured in 5% serum (data not shown). This may be due to the large amount of endogenous Id-1 proteins, up-regulated by serum in control cells, which may be sufficient to interact with all bHLH proteins present. The level of expression of target genes, such as the one encoding the 2.9-kb transcript, may then correspond to a maximum. As a control of the loading, we used ethidium bromide staining of ribosomic RNA as well as β-actin, which did not show a difference of expression at the mRNA level between control and Id-1-transfected cells in serum-starved conditions for 2 days. However, mRNA levels of another gene, clusterin, a glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interaction, were down-regulated in the presence of Id-1. To establish further that Id-1 up-regulates expression of Zfp289, we analyzed mRNA levels of both genes in nine different clones from SCp2 cells transfected with Id-1 antisense vectors (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and treated with growth factors, lactogenic hormones, and extracellular matrix. As shown in Fig. 1 B, these clones expressed variable amounts of Id-1. In each of these clones, the levels of Zfp289 strongly correlated with that of Id-1. Four clones (lanes 1, 4,6, and 8) expressed high levels of Id-1 and Zfp289, whereas in five clones (lanes 2, 3,5, 7, and 9) Id-1 expression was considerably reduced, and therefore Zfp289 mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated. As described previously (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the expression of β-casein (a differentiation-related gene) was inversely correlated with that of Id-1. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2.6-kb fragment (plus the sequence of overlapping expressed sequence tags at the 5′- and 3′-ends) revealed an open reading frame of 1560 base pairs, encoding a 519-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of about 57 kDa (Fig.2). We could clearly detect a sequence on this cDNA that was homologous to the zinc degenerate primer. We attempted to determine any sequence homology to the Cys motif, but due to the level of degeneracy of this Cys primer, we were not able to locate any region of clear homology. A search of the protein data base revealed that this predicted 57-kDa protein was a unique sequence, having, however, a 48% homology and 32% identity with the yeast zinc finger protein Gcs-1 (23Ireland L.S. Johnston G.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This putative mouse protein, which we called Zfp289 after submission to the nomenclature committee, has one zinc finger domain at the N terminus, with a CxxCx (16)CxxC motif encompassing 26–49 amino acids. This zinc finger domain has 66% homology with the zinc finger domain in the yeast protein Gcs-1. Northern blot analysis of Zfp289 revealed a predominantly 2.9-kb transcript in all the major murine tissues (Fig.3), although the level of expression varied widely. Zfp289 mRNA was expressed at very high levels in liver, followed by heart and kidney. Skeletal muscle and spleen had the lowest levels of mRNA expression. During mammary gland development in mice, Zfp289 mRNA expression pattern was closely correlated with Id-1 expression (Fig.4). We detected high levels of expression of Zfp289 as well as Id-1 in the mammary gland from virgin (V) mice and during pregnancy (P) when there is extensive ductal cell proliferation and lobulo-alveolar development, respectively. The expression of both genes declined at the beginning of lactation (L) when the glands fully differentiate and express the milk product β-casein. Zfp289 and Id-1 were almost undetectable after day 2 of lactation until day 21. Localization studies using EGFP vector-transfected SCp2 cells showed that GFP-Zfp289 fusion protein was predominantly present in the cytoplasm with a high proportion of cells showing perinuclear staining (Fig. 5,B, C, and D). These data suggest that Zfp289 is not a transcription factor, which is corroborated by the fact that it contains only one zinc finger domain and not several like typical transcription factors belonging to the zinc finger protein family. This also suggests a function in the regulation of exocytic and/or endocytic vesicular transport pathways at the periphery of the nuclei. The control EGFP plasmid-transfected cells showed homogenous nonspecific staining all over the cell cytoplasm as well as nucleus (Fig. 5 A). To investigate the functional role of Zfp289, we stably transfected the SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells with two different mammalian expression vectors (LXSN and pBabe) containing the full-length coding region of Zfp289. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from these cells confirmed the constitutive transcription of transfected Zfp289, which displayed a larger size than the endogenous Zfp289 mRNA (Fig.6 A). In low serum conditions, constitutive expression of Zfp289 resulted in higher S-phase rate of mammary epithelial-transfected SCp2 cells as compared with control plasmid-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). The difference was more significant in the case of cells transfected with LXSN (170% of the control) than with pBabe (150% of the control). This may be due to a higher level of the transgene in the LXSN vector than in the pBabe vector. Zfp289 does not appear to play a role in the invasive behavior of the cells. Even after 2 weeks on extracellular matrix, both control as well as Zfp289-transfected cells remained associated within compact spheres (data not shown). In contrast, constitutive expression of Id-1 was able to induce invasion in SCp2 cells (9Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We conclude that Zfp289 may be a downstream gene under the control of the transcriptional regulators of the helix-loop-helix family. This novel zinc finger protein is potentially an important mediator of the Id-1-induced proliferation pathway, but not of Id-1-induced invasiveness and/or migration, in mammary epithelial cells. We noted above the homology of sequence between Zfp289 and the yeast GAP Gcs-1. Since Zfp289 also contains the zinc finger motif shared by most of the GAP proteins, we examined whether Zfp289 was functionally a GTPase-activating protein. We analyzed the GTPase activity of ARF-1 in the presence of two different amounts of recombinant Zfp289 protein. ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) proteins are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are active when GTP is bound. However, hydrolysis of bound GTP requires interaction with a GAP protein, as ARF itself has no detectable GTPase activity. Zfp289 displays a strong GAP activity as demonstrated by the decrease of label associated with ARF-1 (Fig. 7). This is particularly significant at 200 ng of Zfp289 and already detectable at 50 ng. Zfp289 may therefore correspond to the mammalian counterpart of the yeast GAP protein, Gcs-1. We have previously reported that Id-1, a dominant negative regulator of bHLH transcription factors, is not only involved in the inhibition of differentiation, but also induces proliferation, migration, and invasion in SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells (8Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To learn more about its action, we sought here to identify transcripts up-regulated in cells transfected with Id-1. Of the two transcripts we identified, one was the histone H3.3. This is consistent with the up-regulation of H3.3 during the Go to S-phase transition in mouse kidney cells (24Hraba-Renevey S. Kress M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and suggests that histone H3.3 is one of the mediators of Id-1-controlled proliferation. Of more interest was the second up-regulated transcript, Zfp289, which encodes for a zinc finger protein with homology to the yeast zinc finger protein Gcs-1 and its related protein Glo-3. Gcs-1 was first identified because of its requirement for transition of yeast cells from stationary to proliferation phase (23Ireland L.S. Johnston G.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reports have also shown that Gcs-1 protein is a GAP for the ARF (25Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is involved in regulation of vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeleton network (26Blader I.J. Cope M. Jamie T.V. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Greenwood A.F. Drubin D.G. Prestwich G.D. Theilbert A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Yeast cells containing a functionally mutant Gcs-1 gene were unable to transit from the stationary phase to growth phase (23Ireland L.S. Johnston G.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and exhibited vesicle trafficking defects at the nonpermissive 15 °C temperature (27Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Zfp289 seems to be evolutionarily a well conserved protein, with about 50% homology between mammalian and yeast sequences, suggesting a conservation of function as well. The GAP activity of Gcs-1 has been localized in the N-terminal zinc finger domain (28Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the Zfp289 sequence in this finger domain (CxxCx (16)CxxC) is 66% homologous to that of yeast. We found that Zfp289 appears to have similar function, as it activates ARF-1-GTPase activity. The intracellular localization experiments in SCp2 cells confirmed that Zfp289 functions predominantly in the cytoplasm, and in the majority of the cells, Zfp289-GFP fusion proteins seemed to be concentrated around the perinuclear region. When we compared mRNA expression of Zfp289 with that of Id-1 in the multiple tissue Northern blot, we found a direct correlation in five out of seven tissues (Fig. 3). The liver exhibited a relatively low level of Id-1 message compared with that of Zfp289, while in lung, Id-1 expression was quite high as compared with that of Zpf289. In these tissues, there may be additional or other types of controls than Id-l for regulating Zfp289 gene expression. However, Zfp289 expression paralleled that of Id-1 during mammary gland development, with Zfp289 expressed during ductal (virgin) as well as lobulo-alveolar (pregnant) morphogenesis, when there is extensive proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Its down-regulation followed the decrease in Id-1 expression in differentiated, growth-arrested lactating epithelial cells. The data presented in Fig. 1, A and B, provide indirect evidence that Zfp289 mRNA expression may be controlled by Id-1 levels. To establish this relationship directly, it will be necessary to sequence the Zfp289 promoter, to determine the presence of E-box motifs and to isolate the Id-1-interacting bHLH proteins, work now in progress. Nevertheless, this novel zinc finger protein Zfp289 appears to mediate some of the Id-1-dependent phenotypic effects on mouse mammary epithelial cells. Functional analysis using retroviral-mediated transfection in SCp2 cells indicates that it may be an important mediator of Id-1-dependent S-phase entrance (Fig. 6 B), a conclusion consistent with the known function of the yeast protein. The increased expression of Zfp289 may confer an advantage in cell cycle entrance to Zfp289-transfected cells in comparison with control cells. This may represent an example of the involvement of ARF-GAP proteins in many fundamental cellular processes such as cell growth and survival, as well as vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. Although we have no direct evidence that Zfp289 plays a role in migration or invasion of cells, this question should remain open. Besides the role of the yeast homologue Gcs-1 in the cytoskeletal organization, it has been found that members of the GTPase family (such as Rho and Rac) and their activators can regulate cell migration through their control of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal distribution (29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar). Our negative results obtained from invasion assays in Zfp289-transfected cells may be due to the fact that constitutive expression of Zfp289 alone is not sufficient to induce the invasive phenotype, an event that may also require the induction of some other genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases.

A missense mutation that changes a highly conserved glycine to serine (G1127S) has been identified in cbEGF13, which results in a variant of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease. Previous experiments on isolated cbEGF13 and a cbEGF13-14 pair indicated that the G1127S mutation caused defective folding of cbEGF13 but not cbEGF14. We have used limited proteolysis methods and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy to identify the structural consequences of this mutation in a covalently linked cbEGF12-13 pair and a cbEGF12-14 triple domain construct. Protease digestion studies of the cbEGF12-13 G1127S mutant pair indicated that both cbEGF12 and 13 retained similar calcium binding properties and thus tertiary structure to the normal domain pair, because all identified cleavage sites showed calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis. However, small changes in the conformation of cbEGF13 G1127S, revealed by the presence of a new protease-sensitive site and comparative two-dimensional NOESY data, suggested that the fold of the mutant domain was not identical to the wild-type, but was native-like. Additional cleavage sites identified in cbEGF12-14 G1127S indicated further subtle changes within the mutant domain but not the flanking domains. We have concluded the following in this study. (i) Covalent linkage of cbEGF12 preserves the native-like fold of cbEGF13 G1127S and (ii) conformational effects introduced by G1127S are localized to cbEGF13. This study demonstrates that missense mutations in fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains can cause short range structural effects in addition to long range effects previously observed with a E1073K mutation in cbEGF12.

It has a modular organization and is mainly composed of multiple tandem arrays of EGF domains, the majority of which contain calcium binding sites (Fig. 1). In addition there are seven transforming growth factor β-binding protein-like (TB) domains, two hybrid domains, a proline-rich region, and N and C termini with homology to other matrix proteins (17Giltay R.

Blood. 1988; 72: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The location of G1127S within the “neonatal” region of fibrillin-1 (Fig. 1), where MFS causing mutations are associated with extreme phenotypic diversity, suggests that structural investigations of this region may yield important insights into the mechanism of disease. A previous study has shown that the G1127S mutation resulted in defective folding in vitro when introduced into the single cbEGF domain 13. When present in the covalently linked cbEGF13-14 domain pair, the C-terminal cbEGF14 domain adopted the native fold and retained calcium binding properties despite the fact that the adjacent domain 13 was misfolded. This suggested that the effects of the mutation were localized (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7807-7813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here the structural consequences of the G1127S mutation in the cbEGF12-13 domain pair and also in the triple domain fragment, cbEGF12-14, have been investigated, using a combination of protease digestion studies and two-dimensional NMR methods. The data indicate that covalent linkage of cbEGF12 moderates the effect of G1127S in cbEGF13 resulting in localized changes to the structure and calcium binding properties of domain 13, but not cbEGF12 or 14. The implications of such short range effects for the pathogenic mechanism of MFS are discussed. DNA fragments (nucleotides 3338–3595 and 3338–3721 of human fibrillin-1 cDNA) encoding the wild-type sequences of the cbEGF12-13 domain pair and the cbEGF12-14 triple construct (residues 1069–1154 and 1069–1196 respectively, numbering according to Ref. 22Pereira L.

The forward primer in cbEGF12 and the reverse primers for cbEGF13 and cbEGF14, together with the cloning procedures used, were as described previously (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 957-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The G1127S mutation was introduced into the pQE30 recombinant plasmids containing the cDNA sequences of the cbEGF12-13 double or cbEGF12-14 triple constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmids were amplified using a forward primer: 5′-GAGGTAGTGTTTGCCATAAC-3′ and a reverse primer: 5′-GGCATAGGAGAGGATC-3′. The amplified DNA was purified from a 0.7% agarose gel with a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and ligated and transformed into Escherichia coli NM554[pREP4]. Clones were sequenced to confirm the mutation had been introduced with no other changes into the inserted fragments. Protein purification, refolding, and His-tag cleavage were carried out as described previously (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol.

Incubation with trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4; bovine pancreatic; TPCK-treated; Sigma; 1:1000, w/w) or endoproteinase GluC from Staphylococcus aureus (EC 3.4.21.19; Sigma; 1:100, w/w) was carried out at 37 °C. At the times indicated, samples (10 μl) were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and heating at 95 °C for 4 min. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by 16% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For N-terminal sequence analysis of the cleavage sites, samples were digested for 30 min in the presence of EGTA or calcium, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 4 min, and the digest products were purified under non-reducing conditions by reverse phase HPLC. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and N-terminal sequencing was carried out using automated Edman chemistry. The samples were absorbed onto PVDF (polyvinlidene difluoride (0.2-μm porosity) using a ProSorb cartridge (PE Biosystems, Warrington, UK.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane-bound samples were then excised from the ProSorb cartridge, and N-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 494A ‘Procise’ sequencer (PE Biosystems). Cysteine residues reported in the N-terminal sequences were inferred from the published sequence (22Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were recorded on a home-built/GE Omega spectrometer equipped with self-shielded pulsed field gradients at 600 MHz. The wild-type and G1127S mutant cbEGF12-13 domain pair protein samples were dissolved in 550 μl of 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, to yield final protein concentrations of 2.00 and 1.93 mm, respectively. Added NaCl was not utilized in these investigations because high ionic strength may compromise spectral quality. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra (24Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) were acquired for both samples at 0 mm CaCl2 and 12.5 mmCaCl2 to allow qualitative assessment of calcium binding. At 12.5 mm CaCl2, the two calcium binding sites of the wild-type domain pair are saturated based on previous calcium binding studies of the cbEGF12-13 domain pair (26Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and these calcium-loaded spectra were also used to assess the structural consequences of the G1127S mutation. All spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms at T = 33 °C. Water suppression was achieved using field gradients (27Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Data were processed using Felix 2.3 (Biosym, Inc.). 1024 complex points were acquired in F2and F1 for each experiment with a spectral width of 8000 Hz in each dimension. Spectra were referenced with respect to the H2HO resonance and were zero-filled to 8 K in the F2 dimension to yield a digital resolution of 0.98 Hz/pt. The predicted structure of the cbEGF12-14 triple construct analyzed in this study, modeled on the coordinates of the cbEGF32–33 domain pair from human fibrillin-1, is shown in Fig.2 (5Downing A.K.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 957-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This model has been validated by NMR structural studies of the cbEGF12-13 pair. 2R. S. Smallridge, P. Whiteman, J. M. Werner, P. A. Handford, and A. K. Downing, manuscript in preparation. The G1127S mutation in domain 13 was introduced into the cbEGF12-13 double and cbEGF12-14 triple constructs at the position indicated. The wild-type and mutant domain pairs and triple constructs were expressed and purified as described previously (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7807-7813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After reduction and refolding in vitro followed by reverse phase HPLC, the cbEGF12-13 domain pairs and cbEGF12-14 triple constructs had slightly different elution times. However, there was no difference in the elution profile of each mutant from the corresponding wild-type construct. On in vitrorefolding in the presence of Ca2+ each gave one major species, the molecular mass of which was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Table I). Together, the characteristic change in the elution profile on refolding of the pair and triple constructs, the observed Ca2+-dependent protection against proteolysis, and the NMR analysis of the wild-type cbEGF12-13 domain pair (see below) were all indicative of correctly folded cbEGF domains (28Kettle S.K. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Digestion and subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis of both the wild-type and G1127S mutant cbEGF12-13 constructs by trypsin in the presence of EGTA (10 mm) or Ca2+ (10 mm) showed that there was significant protection by calcium against proteolysis (Fig.3 A). Although minor differences were apparent between the wild-type and mutant constructs in the presence of EGTA, the degree of protection by Ca2+appeared equivalent. Similar SDS-PAGE analysis of endoproteinase GluC digests also demonstrated protection by calcium (data not shown). Digestion products obtained in the presence of Ca2+and EGTA were purified under non-reducing conditions by HPLC, and the N-terminal sequences of each were determined. The amount of each N terminus expressed relative to the authentic N-terminal sequence is shown in Table II. In both the mutant and wild-type cbEGF12-13, three trypsin and one endoproteinase GluC susceptible cleavage sites were located in cbEGF12. The cbEGF12-13 G1127S mutant contained an additional endoproteinase GluC site (1134GSYRC) in cbEGF13. Calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis of all sites in the mutant pair, including this additional site in the mutant domain, was found, and the degree of protection was the same as in the wild-type pair (Table II).Table IIProtease digestion productsProteaseN-terminal sequencecbEGFResidueAmt relative to N terminuswt Ca2+wt EGTAmut Ca2+mut EGTA–SATDI12N terminus1.001.001.001.00TrypsinISPDL1210760.521.360.541.18(0.19)(1.06)(0.28)(1.03)TrypsinGQCVN1210840.351.260.321.68(0.22)(0.76)(0.54)(1.08)GluCSGFMM1211030.181.080.150.90(0.19)(1.10)(0.44)(1.10)TrypsinNCMDI1211100.340.940.320.88(0.16)(0.58)(0.30)(0.62)TrypsinGSVCH131126––0.180.74GluCGSYRC131134––0.100.54––(0.24)(0.67)TrypsinCECPP131138––0.170.52TrypsinCVNLI141171n.d. 2-an.d., none detected.1.28n.d.1.03TrypsinYQCAC1411780.121.800.231.50TrypsinLFCV1411930.381.470.421.21N-terminal sequences identified in purified digestion products were quantitated and expressed relative to the native N-terminal sequence of cbEGF12–14 (or cbEGF12–13).

Endoproteinase GluC revealed the site at1134GSYRC in cbEGF13. All sites were protected by calcium. The protease susceptible sites identified in cbEGF13 of the cbEGF12–14 GS mutant construct were protected by calcium to a similar extent as those present in cbEGF12 and cbEGF14 of the wild-type construct.2-a n.d., none detected. Open table in a new tab N-terminal sequences identified in purified digestion products were quantitated and expressed relative to the native N-terminal sequence of cbEGF12–14 (or cbEGF12–13).

Endoproteinase GluC revealed the site at1134GSYRC in cbEGF13. All sites were protected by calcium. The protease susceptible sites identified in cbEGF13 of the cbEGF12–14 GS mutant construct were protected by calcium to a similar extent as those present in cbEGF12 and cbEGF14 of the wild-type construct. Trypsin digestion and subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis of both the wild-type and mutant cbEGF12-14 triple constructs in the presence of EGTA (10 mm) and Ca2+ (10 mm) again showed the protection against digestion afforded by calcium (Fig. 3 B). The G1127S mutation did not appear to significantly affect the calcium binding properties of the construct, because the calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type on SDS-PAGE. Calcium protection was also evident on digestion by endoproteinase GluC (data not shown). N-terminal sequence analysis of HPLC-purified digestion products obtained in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ identified the cleavage sites shown in Table II. On endoproteinase GluC digestion, an extra site 1134GSYRC, not present in the wild-type construct, was identified in the mutant. This site, located at the turn of the central two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, was the same site revealed in the cbEGF12-13 G1127S pair. In the case of trypsin, two additional sites, 1126GSVCH and 1138CECPP, were seen upon digestion of the mutant construct. The additional site at1126GSVCH is adjacent to the mutated residue whereas the other protease sensitive site, 1138CECPP, occurs distal to the mutation but still within cbEGF13 (Fig.4). The comparison of the amount of each of these N termini identified on digestion in EGTA or calcium, and expressed relative to the authentic N-terminal sequence is shown in Table II. Calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis of all cleavage sites, including those in the mutant domain, was observed. All cleavage sites were represented in comparable amounts indicative of efficient cleavage of a single population of molecules. Comparative analysis of the calcium-saturated two-dimensional NOESY spectra for the wild-type and G1127S mutant cbEGF12-13 constructs indicated that, unlike the case for the cbEGF13-14 wild-type and mutant spectra (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7807-7813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a significant number of peaks corresponding to domain 13 were unaffected or only mildly affected by the presence of the G1127S mutation. The fingerprint regions of these spectra are shown in Fig.5. Most resonances appeared unaltered between the two spectra, and a subset of peaks were only slightly shifted. For example, of the two well resolved sets of triplet peaks in the lower left-hand corner of the spectra, the chemical shifts of the upper set of peaks were identical, whereas the positions of resonances in the lower triplet were slightly shifted. Because these peaks involve connectivities to downfield-shifted CαH, which are typically involved in β-structure, the data suggest that domain 12 in the mutant cbEGF12-13 pair is unaffected by the presence of the G1127S mutation, and that the β-sheet region of domain 13 is only mildly affected. To examine calcium binding properties of each construct, the aromatic regions of the two-dimensional NOESY spectra acquired at 0 and 12.5 mm CaCl2 were overlaid for both the wild-type and G1127S mutant cbEGF12-13 domain pair (Fig.6). Chemical shift changes of the Hδ* resonances of the consensus, aromatic, calcium binding residues for the N- and C-terminal domains of each pair, i.e.Phe1093 and Tyr1136, respectively, were used to assess calcium binding. The overlay of the wild-type NOESY spectra at zero and saturating calcium showed the expected, native binding properties previously observed when Kd values were determined for the two sites in this domain pair (26Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Comparison of the wild-type spectral overlay with that of the G1127S mutant revealed that both domain 12 and 13 retained calcium binding properties in the mutant cbEGF12-13 pair. Domain 12 appeared to retain native calcium binding properties because the Phe1093 peak movement was identical to that seen in the wild-type spectrum. The peak movement seen for Tyr1136 in cbEGF13 was slightly altered, however, with a larger chemical shift change associated with binding by the mutant domain. Collectively, these comparative data indicate that when preceded by cbEGF12, the G1127S mutant cbEGF13 domain preserves a native-like but not identical fold. In a previous study, it was shown that G1127S caused misfolding of isolated domain 13 with loss of calcium binding properties, whereas, in a cbEGF13-14 domain pair, cbEGF14 was unaffected. In this study, the effects of the G1127S mutation on the cbEGF12-13 domain pair have been assessed, and the results indicate that domain 12 is unaltered, and the consequences of this mutation are again localized to domain 13. The demonstration that domain 13 in the 12-13 pair retains the ability to bind calcium is unlike the situation previously seen for both the single mutant cbEGF13 domain and the mutant cbEGF13-14 domain pair. As calcium binding by cbEGF domains is used as a probe for correct refolding, the fact that cbEGF13 continues to bind calcium in the mutant cbEGF12-13 pair suggests that this domain preserves a native-like fold. This hypothesis is also supported by a comparative analysis of the calcium-saturated wild-type and mutant two-dimensional NOESY spectra for the cbEGF12-13 pair, which show only minor differences (see Fig. 5). These NMR studies indicate that the G1127S mutation has a less severe effect on folding when preceded by cbEGF12. Measurement of the calcium binding affinities of the two sites in the cbEGF12-13 wild-type pair by NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy has previously demonstrated that covalent linkage of an N-terminal cbEGF domain had a stabilizing effect on the adjacent C-terminal domain (26Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observation in this study that cbEGF12 moderates the effect of the G1127S folding mutation also suggests an effect of N-terminal linkage, because structural features associated with cbEGF domains (β-sheet, calcium binding) were absent in cbEGF13 or cbEGF13-14 mutant constructs. In parallel with NMR analyses, protease digestion studies have also been used to probe the structural and calcium binding properties of the wild-type and G1127S-containing fibrillin fragments. It has previously been shown that tandem repeats of wild-type cbEGF domains are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at specific sites on removal of calcium by EGTA, whereas in the presence of calcium, protection from proteolysis is observed (7Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29McGettrick A.J. Knott V. Willis T.A. Handford P.A. Hum. Mol Genet. 2000; 9: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An increased susceptibility to proteolysis in vitro also results from the introduction of specific calcium binding mutations in both recombinantly expressed polypeptides (30Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and domain pairs (29McGettrick A.J. Knott V. Willis T.A. Handford P.A. Hum. Mol Genet. 2000; 9: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A comparison of protease digestion profiles together with the identification of how far reaching the loss of calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis is can therefore be used to assess the short versus long range consequences of various mutations. As this approach can be applied to relatively large fragments and only requires a small amount of material, it can be successfully applied to the investigation of large numbers of mutations in a more native setting. On endoproteinase GluC digestion of the cbEGF12-13 pair, an additional cleavage site was revealed in cbEGF13 of the mutant fragment, which showed calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis. These results are consistent with the NMR analysis of this domain pair, suggesting that the mutant domain has a degree of disruption but is not severely misfolded. A comparison of the digestion patterns of the cbEGF12-14 triple construct with those of the corresponding wild-type provided additional insights. In addition to the endoproteinase GluC site in the mutant domain, also identified in the cbEGF12-13 pair, two tryptic sites were identified in the mutant triple construct indicative of further subtle changes to the mutant domain, which did not detectably affect its calcium binding properties. The presence of the cleavage site 1134GSYRC identified in both the 12-13 and 12-14 mutant constructs (Fig. 4) and located distal to the mutation suggests a conformational change around the β-sheet region of domain 13. Additional tryptic cleavage sites1138CECPP and 1126GSVCH, observed only in 12-14 are supportive of this, although because of the proximity of these sites to the mutation (in the case of C1138 via its disulfide bond to C1124) we cannot formally exclude a sequence-specific effect of the mutation that enhances substrate recognition by the protease in the triple domain construct. However, an alternative explanation that the addition of a C-terminal cbEGF domain may influence the structure of the preceding mutant domain is also possible. The position and calcium-dependent properties of the cleavage sites in the flanking domains 12 and 14 were the same in the mutant and wild-type constructs, indicative of a structural change localized to cbEGF13. The protease data are therefore consistent with the NMR data for the cbEGF12-13 (this study) and cbEGF13-14 (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7807-7813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) domain pairs and validate this as a useful method for probing structural effects of mutations. A summary of the structural and calcium binding consequences of the G1127S mutation for cbEGF13, the cbEGF13-14 pair (21Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7807-7813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the cbEGF12-13 pair and the cbEGF12-14 triple construct (present study) are schematically represented in Fig.7. Further comparative NMR analyses of the structure and dynamics of both the wild-type and mutant constructs will allow the degree of disruption caused by the mutation to be defined more precisely. The tryptic sites identified in cbEGF12 of both the pair and triple constructs were identical to those found in digests of a recombinantly expressed cbEGF10-22 construct containing a calcium binding mutation E1073K in cbEGF12 (30Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). E1073K is associated with neonatal MFS, the most severe form of the disease. In this case, the sites within mutant domain 12 showed enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis compared with the wild-type, in contrast to the present study in which the sites in mutant domain 13 containing the G1127S mutation were protected by calcium. In addition a cleavage site was also revealed N-terminal to cbEGF11, indicating a longer range structural effect of the calcium binding mutation. Collectively these data indicate that MFS-causing mutations in this region cause variable intramolecular effects on fibrillin-1 structure. Because the effect of the G1127S mutation is confined to domain 13 and this domain retains a native-like fold, fibrillin-1 monomers containing this mutation are likely to be secreted by the cell and the effect of the mutation exerted either on or after incorporation into the microfibril. The small localized changes in structure and calcium binding in domain 13 could disrupt protein binding sites involved in the assembly process or the properties of the assembled microfibril. The protection afforded by calcium against proteolytic degradation of tandem repeats of cbEGF domains in fibrillin-1 (7Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29McGettrick A.J. Knott V. Willis T.A. Handford P.A. Hum. Mol Genet. 2000; 9: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggests that missense mutations may result in increased proteolysis in vivo. Although cbEGF13 containing the G1127S mutation appears to be more susceptible to proteolysis than the wild-type in vitro, calcium-dependent protection was observed for all the additional protease sites revealed in the domain (Table II), therefore increased proteolytic susceptibility seems less likely to be involved in the pathogenic mechanism than for the E1073K mutation. In summary, interdisciplinary studies utilizing both high and low resolution methods have proved effective in identifying the structural consequences of the G1127S mutation. Further studies will now focus on identifying the functional effects of this and related mutations on fibrillin assembly.

In contrast, a truncated p85(1–333), which lacks the SH2 and iSH2 domains and does not bind p110, had no effect on EGF-stimulated mitogenesis but still blocked EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension. Additional deletional analysis showed that the SH3 domain was not required for inhibition of lamellipod extension, as a construct containing only the proline-rich and breakpoint cluster region (BCR) homology domains was sufficient for inhibition. Although the BCR domain of p85 binds Rac, the effects of the p85 constructs were not because of a general inhibition of Rac signaling, because sorbitol-induced JNK activation in MTLn3 cells was not inhibited. These data show that the proline-rich and BCR homology domains of p85 are involved in the coupling of p85/p110 PI 3-kinases to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. These data provide evidence of a distinct cellular function for the N-terminal domains of p85."

To identify anti-apoptotic pathways, we performed a retroviral-insertion mutagenesis on Baf-3 cells and selected mutants that have acquired a long term survival capacity. The phenotype of one mutant, which does not overexpress bcl-x and proliferates in the absence of IL-3, is described. We show that, in this mutant, Akt is constitutively activated leading to FKHRL1 phosphorylation and constitutive glycolytic activity. This pathway is necessary for the mutant to survive following IL-3 starvation but is not sufficient or necessary to protect cells from DNA damage-induced cell death. Indeed, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in Baf-3 cells does not prevent the ability of IL-3 to protect cells against γ-irradiation-induced DNA damage. This protective effect of IL-3 rather correlates with the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-x protein.

Baf-3 cells are dependent on IL-31 for their proliferation and survival (1Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A number of signaling pathways that are activated by IL-3 play a role in the inhibition of apoptosis (2Miyajima A. Ito Y. Kinoshita T. Int. J.

One major signaling pathway involved in the control of cell death by growth factors is the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation of PI3K leads to the generation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides that act by multiple mechanisms to activate Akt (5Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar). Akt will in turn phosphorylate proteins that play a key role in the control of apoptosis. These proteins include Bad, a pro-apoptoticbcl-2 family member, which when phosphorylated by Akt, releases Bcl-x allowing it to perform its anti-apoptotic function (6Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X.

Finally, the transcription factor FKHRL1 that regulates the expression of genes encoding pro-apoptotic proteins such as Fas-ligand is located in the cytoplasm following its phosphorylation by Akt on serine 253 and threonine 32 (9Brunet A.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that IL-3 protects Baf-3 cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis (13Collins M.K. Marvel J. Malde P. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the absence of IL-3, the kinetics of cell death is accelerated following DNA damage. In contrast, in the presence of IL-3, cells are resistant to high doses of DNA damage-inducing agents. The increased rate of death observed when cells are irradiated in the absence of IL-3 is dependent on functional p53, indicating that IL-3 acts by inhibiting a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (15Silva A. Wyllie A. Collins M.K. Blood. 1997; 89: 2717-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are multiple pathways downstream of p53 that are potentially involved in the induction of apoptosis (16Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 17Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 18Sionov R.V. Haupt Y.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 704-718PubMed Google Scholar), which could play a role in this process, although some of them such asBax could have a redundant function because p53-induced death is not affected by its absence (22Brady H.J. Salomons G.S. Bobeldijk R.C. Berns A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1221-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that, in irradiation or myc-induced p53-dependent death, APAF-1 and Caspase 9 were essential down-stream targets of p53 (23Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).The signaling pathways involved in the inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis by growth factors have been studied in a number of systems. In erythropoietin-dependent myeloid cell lines, Jak2 kinase activation by erythropoietin receptor mutants was shown to be necessary and sufficient to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation (24Quelle F.W. Wang J. Feng J. Wang D. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the same system, activation of other signaling pathways, including PI3K, STATs, and Ras was not required to inhibit death. In contrast, it has recently been shown that death induced by p53 expression could be inhibited by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway (25Sabbatini P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24263-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that IL-3 could delay p53-dependent apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation by regulating the levels of p21 and Rb, two proteins involved in the regulation of the G1/S transition (14Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 26Gottlieb E. Oren M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although in one report, the expression of v-Src or activated c-Raf could mimic the effect of IL-3 on p21 levels, the signaling pathway activated by IL-3, involved in the control of G1 arrest or apoptosis following DNA damage, has not been identified.We have performed a retroviral insertion mutagenesis to obtain mutants that are resistant to apoptosis following growth factors starvation. We describe the characterization of one mutant that proliferates in the absence of growth factors and that, in contrast to previously described mutants, does not overexpress bcl-x (27Thomas J. Leverrier Y. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This mutant (the S4 mutant) is able to survive for prolonged periods of time in the absence of IL-3 but shows no resistance to γ-irradiation-induced cell death. This mutant shows a constitutive IL-3-independent, 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides-dependent, Akt kinase activation. In this mutant, we could demonstrate that Akt activation leads to FKHRL1 phosphorylation and constitutive glycolytic activity. In Baf-3 cells, glycolysis is regulated by IL-3 and is the main ATP-generating source (28Garland J.M. Lymphokines. 1984; 9: 153-200Google Scholar). The activation of Akt was necessary for the survival observed in the absence of IL-3. In contrast we show in the S4 mutant and in Baf-3 cells that Akt activation is neither sufficient nor necessary to inhibit p53-dependent DNA damage-induced cell death. These results indicate that IL-3 activates multiple signaling pathways, which can inhibit growth factor starvation-induced apoptosis (called intrinsic apoptosis here after); however, only some of these can delay DNA damage-induced p53-dependent apoptosis.DISCUSSIONIn this study we report that, in a Baf-3 mutant cell line, the S4 mutant, which was obtained after retroviral-insertion mutagenesis, shows an IL-3 independent Akt phosphorylation on serine 473, which leads to FKHRL1 phosphorylation on threonine 32 and constitutive glycolysis. Akt activation was necessary for the inhibition of the intrinsic death pathway and long term survival of these cells in the absence of growth factor. The gene modified upstream of Akt responsible for the constitutive activation of Akt has not yet been identified. Several pathways downstream of Akt could be responsible for the survival of the S4 mutant in the absence of growth factor. In neurones, inactivation of the FKHRL1 transcription factor following phosphorylation by Akt is potentially involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by growth factors (5Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar, 9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). Indeed, FKHRL1 mutants where the three residues phosphorylated by Akt have been converted to alanine are strong transactivators and trigger apoptosis when overexpressed in a number of cell types. Conversely, replacement of these residues by aspartic acid, which mimics the presence of a phosphate group, disrupts the transactivation function of FKHRL1 (44Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). FKHRL1-mediated death could result from the expression of death genes, such as Fas-ligand, which expression is regulated by FKHRL1 and which are strongly up-regulated following growth factor withdrawal in neurones (9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). In Baf-3 cells we have found that FKHRL1 threonine 32 phosphorylation is controlled by IL-3. In contrast, FKHRL1 serine 253 remains phosphorylated in Baf-3 cells grown in the absence of IL-3 up to a stage when cells are starting to enter apoptosis. Because FKHRL1 phosphorylation on serine 253 should maintain FKHRL1 in the cytoplasm (9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar), these results suggest that IL-3 starvation-induced apoptosis is not mediated by FKHRL1-dependent gene transactivation. This is in agreement with data showing that IL-3 starvation-induced apoptosis proceeds with similar kinetics in the presence of protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors (45Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Perkins G.R. Mangeney M. Collins M.K. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the Baf-3 cells or the S4 mutant we have been unable to detect a phosphorylation of the Bad protein. Even if we cannot completely exclude a role for Bad in the inhibition of death, we have shown that in the S4 mutant the Bcl-x mRNA and protein are down-regulated following IL-3 starvation, suggesting that the Bad-Bcl-x pathway is not involved in the survival of these cells in the absence of IL-3. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between expression of Bcl-x and protection against DNA damage-induced death. Hence, pathways such as Jak/Stat5 or MAPK, which are involved in the up-regulation of Bcl-x by IL-3 could play a role in the inhibition of DNA damage-induced death (45Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Perkins G.R. Mangeney M. Collins M.K. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F.

Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway has also been involved in the regulation of bcl-x expression (43Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Mathieu A.L. Low W. Blanquier B. Marvel J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 48Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 557-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Indeed, PI3K inhibition delays bcl-x mRNA up-regulation induced by IL-3 restimulation of growth factor-starved cells. However, the addition of the PI3K inhibitor does not affect the steady-state level of Bcl-x protein in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 7 C), and constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway does not inducebcl-x overexpression (Fig. 6, B andC), suggesting that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is not sufficient for bcl-x expression.The maintenance of a glycolytic activity in the absence of IL-3 could contribute to the survival of the S4 mutant in these conditions. Indeed, glucose deprivation or inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose can lead to growth arrest or to apoptosis, suggesting that some as yet undefined checkpoint able to induce apoptosis in these conditions exists (49Shim H. Chun Y.S. Lewis B.C. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In IC.DP IL-3-dependent cells, survival in the absence of IL-3 following v-abl transfection has been shown to be dependent on glucose transport activation. Indeed v-ABL activation in these cells induced an increased survival in the absence of growth factor which correlated with a stimulation of glucose uptake. Hence the control of glycolytic activity by growth factors could be an essential step in the inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (50Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Acquisition of a growth factor-independent glycolytic activity could delay the onset of apoptosis and contribute to the process of transformation. Indeed, tumor cells frequently exhibit a high rate of anaerobic glycolysis even under aerobic conditions (51Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In Baf-3 and S4 cells, we confirmed that anaerobic glycolysis is the main glucose-derived ATP-generating source, because these cells do not undergo aerobic glycolysis. The S4 mutant shows constitutive glucose transport and glycolytic metabolism in the absence of IL-3 as measured by glucose uptake and lactate production. In the presence or absence of IL-3, glycolytic activity was dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In the absence of IL-3, inhibition of the glycolytic pathway using PI3K inhibitors, glucose deprivation, or 2-deoxy-glucose all resulted in rapid apoptotic death of the S4 mutant but not of Bcl-x-overexpressing cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the maintenance of the glycolytic activity of these cells was essential for their survival in the absence of growth factor.We also show that the inhibition of p53-dependent DNA damage-induced death is not inhibited by Akt activation. Indeed, the activation of Akt in the S4 mutant in the absence of growth factor is unable to protect these cells against DNA damage-induced death. Similarly, in parental Baf-3 cells inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway does not abrogate the protection conferred by IL-3. These results are in contradiction with data showing that overexpression of PI3K or activated Akt can protect against apoptosis following p53 transfection (25Sabbatini P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24263-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be due to difference in the level of Akt activation obtained by overexpressing an activated form of Akt compared with the level of Akt activation obtained in the S4 mutant. Indeed, the level of Akt phosphorylation in these cell in the absence of growth factors is lower than the level obtained when growth factor-starved cells are synchronously restimulated with IL-3. However, it is similar to the physiological level observed in Baf-3 or S4 cells continuously maintained in the presence of IL-3 and might mimic more accurately the functions fulfilled by Akt in IL-3-dependent cell lines. Alternatively, one could imagine that the apoptotic pathway induced by p53 following DNA damage-induced death is different from the pathway induced by p53 overexpression. p53 has multiple functions that are regulated by post-translational modifications such as protein phosphorylation or protein/protein interaction. A number of these functions are involved in the induction of apoptosis by p53 (16Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Therefore increasing the level of p53 protein by overexpression or by DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and stabilization might not result in the activation of the same function and apoptotic pathway. A better understanding of the apoptotic pathways activated by p53 in these different experimental conditions might help to resolve this issue. Growth factors are necessary to inhibit the intrinsic apoptotic machinery, which is constitutively expressed in all cells. Baf-3 cells are dependent on IL-31 for their proliferation and survival (1Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A number of signaling pathways that are activated by IL-3 play a role in the inhibition of apoptosis (2Miyajima A. Ito Y. Kinoshita T. Int. J.

Salomons G.S. Bobeldijk R.C. Berns A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1221-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that, in irradiation or myc-induced p53-dependent death, APAF-1 and Caspase 9 were essential down-stream targets of p53 (23Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways involved in the inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis by growth factors have been studied in a number of systems. In erythropoietin-dependent myeloid cell lines, Jak2 kinase activation by erythropoietin receptor mutants was shown to be necessary and sufficient to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation (24Quelle F.W. Wang J. Feng J. Wang D. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the same system, activation of other signaling pathways, including PI3K, STATs, and Ras was not required to inhibit death. In contrast, it has recently been shown that death induced by p53 expression could be inhibited by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway (25Sabbatini P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24263-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that IL-3 could delay p53-dependent apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation by regulating the levels of p21 and Rb, two proteins involved in the regulation of the G1/S transition (14Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 26Gottlieb E. Oren M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although in one report, the expression of v-Src or activated c-Raf could mimic the effect of IL-3 on p21 levels, the signaling pathway activated by IL-3, involved in the control of G1 arrest or apoptosis following DNA damage, has not been identified. We have performed a retroviral insertion mutagenesis to obtain mutants that are resistant to apoptosis following growth factors starvation. We describe the characterization of one mutant that proliferates in the absence of growth factors and that, in contrast to previously described mutants, does not overexpress bcl-x (27Thomas J. Leverrier Y. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This mutant (the S4 mutant) is able to survive for prolonged periods of time in the absence of IL-3 but shows no resistance to γ-irradiation-induced cell death. This mutant shows a constitutive IL-3-independent, 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides-dependent, Akt kinase activation. In this mutant, we could demonstrate that Akt activation leads to FKHRL1 phosphorylation and constitutive glycolytic activity. In Baf-3 cells, glycolysis is regulated by IL-3 and is the main ATP-generating source (28Garland J.M. Lymphokines. 1984; 9: 153-200Google Scholar). The activation of Akt was necessary for the survival observed in the absence of IL-3. In contrast we show in the S4 mutant and in Baf-3 cells that Akt activation is neither sufficient nor necessary to inhibit p53-dependent DNA damage-induced cell death. These results indicate that IL-3 activates multiple signaling pathways, which can inhibit growth factor starvation-induced apoptosis (called intrinsic apoptosis here after); however, only some of these can delay DNA damage-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. DISCUSSIONIn this study we report that, in a Baf-3 mutant cell line, the S4 mutant, which was obtained after retroviral-insertion mutagenesis, shows an IL-3 independent Akt phosphorylation on serine 473, which leads to FKHRL1 phosphorylation on threonine 32 and constitutive glycolysis. Akt activation was necessary for the inhibition of the intrinsic death pathway and long term survival of these cells in the absence of growth factor. The gene modified upstream of Akt responsible for the constitutive activation of Akt has not yet been identified. Several pathways downstream of Akt could be responsible for the survival of the S4 mutant in the absence of growth factor. In neurones, inactivation of the FKHRL1 transcription factor following phosphorylation by Akt is potentially involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by growth factors (5Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar, 9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). Indeed, FKHRL1 mutants where the three residues phosphorylated by Akt have been converted to alanine are strong transactivators and trigger apoptosis when overexpressed in a number of cell types. Conversely, replacement of these residues by aspartic acid, which mimics the presence of a phosphate group, disrupts the transactivation function of FKHRL1 (44Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). FKHRL1-mediated death could result from the expression of death genes, such as Fas-ligand, which expression is regulated by FKHRL1 and which are strongly up-regulated following growth factor withdrawal in neurones (9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). In Baf-3 cells we have found that FKHRL1 threonine 32 phosphorylation is controlled by IL-3. In contrast, FKHRL1 serine 253 remains phosphorylated in Baf-3 cells grown in the absence of IL-3 up to a stage when cells are starting to enter apoptosis. Because FKHRL1 phosphorylation on serine 253 should maintain FKHRL1 in the cytoplasm (9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar), these results suggest that IL-3 starvation-induced apoptosis is not mediated by FKHRL1-dependent gene transactivation. This is in agreement with data showing that IL-3 starvation-induced apoptosis proceeds with similar kinetics in the presence of protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors (45Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Perkins G.R. Mangeney M. Collins M.K. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the Baf-3 cells or the S4 mutant we have been unable to detect a phosphorylation of the Bad protein. Even if we cannot completely exclude a role for Bad in the inhibition of death, we have shown that in the S4 mutant the Bcl-x mRNA and protein are down-regulated following IL-3 starvation, suggesting that the Bad-Bcl-x pathway is not involved in the survival of these cells in the absence of IL-3. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between expression of Bcl-x and protection against DNA damage-induced death. Hence, pathways such as Jak/Stat5 or MAPK, which are involved in the up-regulation of Bcl-x by IL-3 could play a role in the inhibition of DNA damage-induced death (45Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Perkins G.R. Mangeney M. Collins M.K. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F.

Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway has also been involved in the regulation of bcl-x expression (43Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Mathieu A.L. Low W. Blanquier B. Marvel J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 48Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 557-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Indeed, PI3K inhibition delays bcl-x mRNA up-regulation induced by IL-3 restimulation of growth factor-starved cells. However, the addition of the PI3K inhibitor does not affect the steady-state level of Bcl-x protein in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 7 C), and constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway does not inducebcl-x overexpression (Fig. 6, B andC), suggesting that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is not sufficient for bcl-x expression.The maintenance of a glycolytic activity in the absence of IL-3 could contribute to the survival of the S4 mutant in these conditions. Indeed, glucose deprivation or inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose can lead to growth arrest or to apoptosis, suggesting that some as yet undefined checkpoint able to induce apoptosis in these conditions exists (49Shim H. Chun Y.S. Lewis B.C. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In IC.DP IL-3-dependent cells, survival in the absence of IL-3 following v-abl transfection has been shown to be dependent on glucose transport activation. Indeed v-ABL activation in these cells induced an increased survival in the absence of growth factor which correlated with a stimulation of glucose uptake. Hence the control of glycolytic activity by growth factors could be an essential step in the inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (50Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Acquisition of a growth factor-independent glycolytic activity could delay the onset of apoptosis and contribute to the process of transformation. Indeed, tumor cells frequently exhibit a high rate of anaerobic glycolysis even under aerobic conditions (51Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In Baf-3 and S4 cells, we confirmed that anaerobic glycolysis is the main glucose-derived ATP-generating source, because these cells do not undergo aerobic glycolysis. The S4 mutant shows constitutive glucose transport and glycolytic metabolism in the absence of IL-3 as measured by glucose uptake and lactate production. In the presence or absence of IL-3, glycolytic activity was dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In the absence of IL-3, inhibition of the glycolytic pathway using PI3K inhibitors, glucose deprivation, or 2-deoxy-glucose all resulted in rapid apoptotic death of the S4 mutant but not of Bcl-x-overexpressing cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the maintenance of the glycolytic activity of these cells was essential for their survival in the absence of growth factor.We also show that the inhibition of p53-dependent DNA damage-induced death is not inhibited by Akt activation. Indeed, the activation of Akt in the S4 mutant in the absence of growth factor is unable to protect these cells against DNA damage-induced death. Similarly, in parental Baf-3 cells inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway does not abrogate the protection conferred by IL-3. These results are in contradiction with data showing that overexpression of PI3K or activated Akt can protect against apoptosis following p53 transfection (25Sabbatini P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24263-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be due to difference in the level of Akt activation obtained by overexpressing an activated form of Akt compared with the level of Akt activation obtained in the S4 mutant. Indeed, the level of Akt phosphorylation in these cell in the absence of growth factors is lower than the level obtained when growth factor-starved cells are synchronously restimulated with IL-3. However, it is similar to the physiological level observed in Baf-3 or S4 cells continuously maintained in the presence of IL-3 and might mimic more accurately the functions fulfilled by Akt in IL-3-dependent cell lines. Alternatively, one could imagine that the apoptotic pathway induced by p53 following DNA damage-induced death is different from the pathway induced by p53 overexpression. p53 has multiple functions that are regulated by post-translational modifications such as protein phosphorylation or protein/protein interaction. A number of these functions are involved in the induction of apoptosis by p53 (16Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Therefore increasing the level of p53 protein by overexpression or by DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and stabilization might not result in the activation of the same function and apoptotic pathway. A better understanding of the apoptotic pathways activated by p53 in these different experimental conditions might help to resolve this issue. In this study we report that, in a Baf-3 mutant cell line, the S4 mutant, which was obtained after retroviral-insertion mutagenesis, shows an IL-3 independent Akt phosphorylation on serine 473, which leads to FKHRL1 phosphorylation on threonine 32 and constitutive glycolysis.

Nonetheless, because HP1 proteins oligomerize and are capable of interacting with a wide variety of cellular components (see the Introduction), it would be reasonable to assume that their molecular associations are regulated by auxiliary factors and molecular chaperones. In this study, we have attempted to identify and characterize such factors using quantitativein vitro assays in combination with subcellular fractionation. Our results show that M31 binding to the nuclear envelope is potently inhibited by nonpolymeric tubulin. This is a surprising finding, because soluble tubulin has always been considered to be a mere “reservoir” of microtubule subunits. The biochemical and morphological data presented here make it clear that the inhibitory effect of tubulin is not due to a chaotropic or purely electrostatic effect. First, nonpolymeric tubulin effectively competes with M31 under pH conditions at which the total charge of the molecule is nearly zero. Second, at the same nominal concentration nonpolymeric tubulin is a much better inhibitor than polymeric tubulin, although the charge of the protein is similar in both aggregation states. Soluble, nonpolymeric tubulin is an abundant constituent of the cytoplasm. Earlier studies indicate that the average hepatocyte contains 3.1 × 107 αβ dimers, of which only 15% are incorporated into microtubules (35Reaven E.P. Cheng Y. Miller M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the proportion of polymeric tubulin could be much higher in cultured cells (up to 62% in porcine kidney epithelial cells, according to Zhai and Borisy (36Zhai Y. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 881-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the intracellular concentration of unassembled tubulin is on the order of 1 mg/ml (37Olmstead J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), i.e. well above the critical concentration for microtubule assembly. A transient increase in the concentration of soluble tubulin should be expected at prophase-prometaphase, when the network of interphase microtubules has been destroyed, and the mitotic spindle has not been fully assembled. At that point, soluble tubulin may gain access to internal nuclear structures, because the nuclear envelope is disrupted by a combination of mitotic hyperphosphorylation and mechanical force (for a review see Ref. 38Georgatos S.D. Theodoropoulos P.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Tubulin binding to the disassembling nuclear envelope might prevent premature interactions between fragments of the nuclear membrane and M31 at early phases of cell division. Reversal of this process, i.e. dissociation of tubulin from nuclear envelope-derived membranes, could occur at subsequent stages of mitosis, when the spindle fully develops, the mass of polymerized tubulin increases to interphase levels (36Zhai Y. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 881-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration of soluble tubulin presumably drops. Be it as it may, tubulin would not be the only example of a protein that participates in more than one function inside eukaryotic cells. As it turns out, a wide variety of cellular proteins, from oligomeric enzymes to crystallins and ion channels, switch partners and become involved in different functions when their aggregation state or localization is changed. These are the so-called “moonlighting proteins,” a class of molecules that supposedly evolved when “unused,” surface-exposed regions of pre-existing molecules became useful for the global physiology of the cell (for a review see Ref.39Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). We thank K.

Because this activity by UV may contribute to its immunosuppressive properties we studied whether this is specific for STAT1 or whether UV also affects other members of the STAT family. STAT5 is crucially involved in signaling of interleukin (IL)-2, enabling up-regulation of the IL-2 receptor α chain, an essential component of the high affinity IL-2 receptor. Exposure of the murine T cell line CTLL to IL-2 caused tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 that was remarkably reduced when cells were exposed to UV. Accordingly, STAT5 binding activity was significantly impaired in UV-exposed cells. In contrast, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinases Jak1 and Jak3 located upstream of STAT5 was not affected by UV. The effect of UV on STAT5 phosphorylation was antagonized by orthovanadate, implying involvement of a phosphatase in this process. Accordingly, up-regulation of the IL-2 receptor α chain was reduced in cells that were treated with IL-2 plus UV. Because STAT5-mediated IL-2 effects are vital for normal immune functions, inhibition of STAT5 signaling by UV may contribute to its well known immunosuppressive properties.

UV radiation and, in particular, UVB with a wavelength range between 290 and 320 nm, represents one of, if not the most important environmental danger to human health. Its hazardous effects include the induction of skin cancer (1De Gruijl F.R. Sterenborg H.J. Forbes P.D. Davies R.E. Cole C. Kelfkens G. van Weelden H. Slaper H. van der Leun J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar), suppression of the immune system (2Beissert S. Schwarz T. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp.

Voorhees J.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The effects of UV on the cellular level include the induction of apoptotic cell death (4Kulms D. Pöppelmann B.

Proc. 1999; 4: 61-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In particular, the immunosuppressive properties of UV are of major biological relevance, because suppression of the immune system by UV is not only responsible for the exacerbation of infectious diseases following UV exposure,e.g. herpes simplex (6Chapman R.S. Cooper K.D. De Fabo E.C. Frederick J.E. Gelatt K.N. Hammond S.P. Hersey P. Koren H.S. Ley R.D. Noonan F. Rusch G.M. Photochem.

Golomb C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 174-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, understanding of the mechanisms by which UV suppresses the immune system is of primary importance. UV suppresses the immune system in multiple ways (2Beissert S. Schwarz T. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1999; 4: 61-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Just to name a few, it inhibits antigen presentation by down-regulating the surface expression of accessory molecules (8Fujihara M. Takahashi T.A. Azuma M. Ogiso C. Maekawa T.L. Yagita H. Okumura K. Sekiguchi S. Blood. 1996; 87: 2386-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it induces the generation of T suppressor cells, which inhibit antigen-specific immune responses (9Schwarz T. Allergy. 1999; 54: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and it induces the release of immunosuppressive cytokines e.g. interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinIFNγinterferon-γIL-2Rinterleukin-2 receptorSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionγccytokine receptor γ chainEMSA(s)electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction-10, tumor necrosis factor α, and transforming growth factor β (reviewed in Refs. 10Ullrich S.E.

Specifically, we demonstrated that UV is able to hinder the immunomodulatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) from exerting its biological effects (12Aragane Y. Schwarz A. Luger T.A. Ariizumi K. Takashima A. Schwarz T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5393-5399PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of the interaction of IFNγ with its receptor, the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1 (13Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated. Phosphorylated STAT1 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the IFNγ-activated sequences (GAS) in various promoters, and ultimately induces specific gene transcription. We observed that UV inhibits IFNγ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and consequently STAT1 binding capacities (15Aragane Y. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11490-11495Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of STAT1 is a critical event in IFNγ signaling, UV inhibits IFNγ from exerting its biological effects via this mechanism. Interestingly, UV had no effect on the phosphorylation of STAT3, which is involved in signaling of IL-6, a potent proinflammatory cytokine whose release is also induced by UV (16Urbanski A. Schwarz T. Neuner P. Krutmann J. Kirnbauer R. Köck A. Luger T.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 808-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-6 is an inflammatory mediator and IFNγ is an immunomodulatory molecule, we postulated that the differential effects on cytokine signaling by UV may explain the diverse biological effects of UV, which on the one hand causes inflammation (via induction of the release of inflammatory cytokines) but, on the other hand, inhibits immune reactions (presumably by interruption of the signal transduction of immunomodulatory cytokines). If this hypothesis holds true, the inhibitory effect of UV should not only affect IFNγ signaling but also other immunostimulatory cytokines. Hence, we were interested in finding out whether UV also interferes with IL-2 signaling. IL-2 is a key regulator of normal immune function and acts on a variety of lymphoid cells including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (17Leonard W.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1999: 293-322Google Scholar, 18Ruscetti F.W. Oppenheim J.J. Shevach E.M. Immunophysiology. The Role of Cells and Cytokines in Immunity and Inflammation. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 46-66Google Scholar). Blockade of IL-2 or the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) results in pronounced impairment of antigen-specific proliferative T cell responses (17Leonard W.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1999: 293-322Google Scholar, 18Ruscetti F.W. Oppenheim J.J. Shevach E.M. Immunophysiology. The Role of Cells and Cytokines in Immunity and Inflammation. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 46-66Google Scholar). To exert its biological effects, IL-2 must interact with the specific IL-2 receptor, which consists of at least two subunits. Heterodimerization of the constitutively expressed IL-2Rβ chain and the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc) forms an intermediate affinity receptor for IL-2-mediated signaling. Although the IL-2Rα chain is not necessarily required for IL-2 binding or signaling, it is essential for forming high affinity receptors (19Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jaques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). IL-2Rα expression is tightly regulated by the extracellular binding of IL-2 to the intermediate affinity receptor (21Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthesy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10743-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), resulting in intracellular phosphorylation of the activated β chain or γc. Recruitment of the janus kinases Jak1 to IL-2Rβ and Jak3 to γc results in tyrosine phosphorylation, which in turn triggers downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 proteins (22Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 23Farrar W.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, the STAT5 molecules dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors for their responsive elements. Positive regulatory elements responsive for STAT5 binding are located in the IL-2Rα chain gene promotor region and serve as enhancers of IL-2Rα gene expression (24Nakajima H. Liu X.W. Wynshaw-Boris A. Rosenthal L.A. Imada K. Finbloom D.S. Hennighausen L. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that UV inhibits IL-2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and consequently inhibits STAT5 binding activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of the upstream-located kinases Jak1 and Jak3 was not affected by UV. As a consequence of impaired STAT5 phosphorylation, IL-2-mediated up-regulation of the IL-2Rα chain was reduced in T cells exposed to UV at both the mRNA and the protein level. Hence, UV may inhibit immune responses by interfering with the signaling of IL-2. Together, these data indicate that interference of UV with the signal transduction of immunostimulatory cytokines represents an additional pathway by which UV compromises the immune system. The murine T cell line CTLL (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol and IL-2. Supernatants obtained from concanavalin A-stimulated rat splenocytes were used as a source for IL-2 at a final concentration of 10% (26Stadler B.M. Dougherty S.F. Farrar J.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1936-1940PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 containing supernatant was added to the culture medium every 24 h. IL-2 (100 units/ml) supplementation was stopped 60 h before experiments were performed. For stimulation, recombinant murine IL-2 was used (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) and the serine phosphatase inhibitor ocadaic acid were purchased from Sigma. UV irradiation was performed as described previously with slight modifications (5Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15060-15066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 106/ml) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to UV radiation through colorless medium without fetal calf serum. For UV irradiation a bank of six fluorescent bulbs (TL12; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was used that emit most of their energy within the UVB range (290–320 nm) with an emission peak at 313 nm. Throughout this study a dose of 400 J/m2 was used. This dose was used, because it is in the range of the physiologically relevant doses usually used for in vitrostudies when investigating UVB (27Köck A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Control cells were subjected to the identical procedure without being exposed to UV. 15 min after stimulation, nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously (12Aragane Y. Schwarz A. Luger T.A. Ariizumi K. Takashima A. Schwarz T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5393-5399PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide with a consensus binding site for STAT5 (sc-2565; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and 20 μg of nuclear protein extracts for 20 min at 22 °C. Reaction samples were separated electrophoretically on native high ionic gels at 150 V for 1.5 h and detected by autoradiography. Competition analysis was performed by the addition of the unlabeled consensus oligonucleotide in a 50-fold molar excess. Supershifts were carried out utilizing specific antibodies directed against either STAT5a (sc-108X) or STAT5b (sc-835X; both Santa Cruz). 15 min after stimulation cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 0.01% NaN3, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture) by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and the protein content was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Immunoprecipitations were carried out with 1 ml of a 1 mg/ml protein solution supplemented with 5 μg of the corresponding antibody directed against Jak1 (AF602; R & D Systems), Jak3 (05-406; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or STAT5 (PA-ST5A; R & D Systems) and with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed 3 times in lysis buffer with centrifugation being performed at 13,000 rpm for 5 s. Precipitated proteins were released from protein A/G-agarose beads at 95 °C in sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The protein samples were subjected to 6% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (sc-7020; Santa Cruz). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with different antibodies detecting Jak1 (sc-1677; Santa Cruz), Jak3 (06-667, Upstate Biotechnology), or STAT5 (sc-1656, Santa Cruz). Signals were visualized with an ECL™ kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2 h after stimulation total RNA was extracted from cells according to the protocol described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amount of template needed was titrated by β-actin PCR in a 20-μl reaction utilizing the RedTaq polymerase system from Sigma and evaluated densitometrically. A murine IL-2 receptor α-amplimer set fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) was used as primers for the amplification of the IL-2 receptor α chain. Aliquots of 2 × 105 cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibodies directed against either the IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25) or the IL-2 receptor β-chain (CD122; both from Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL) for 45 min on ice. Purified rat IgG was used as an isotype control. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, propidium iodide (100 μm) was added, and cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (Epics XL; Coulter, Miami, FL). To address the question whether UV interferes with the phosphorylation of STAT5, proteins from lysates of CTLL cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against STAT5, and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against phosphotyrosine and STAT5, respectively (Fig.1). In untreated CTLL cells (lane 1) STAT5 was barely phosphorylated if at all, whereas stimulation with IL-2 induced a strong phosphorylation of STAT5 (lane 2). However, in cells that, in addition to IL-2, were also exposed to UV, IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was remarkably reduced (lane 4). Exposure of CTLL cells to UV alone did not affect the phosphorylation status of STAT5 (lane 3). To determine whether inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT5 by UV is functionally relevant, EMSAs were performed using nuclear protein extracts from CTLL cells that were exposed to IL-2 alone or to IL-2 plus UV (Fig. 2). Low constitutive binding activity was observed in untreated cells (lane 1), and this activity was considerably induced upon stimulation of cells with IL-2 (lane 2). UV treatment did not alter the low constitutive binding activity (lane 3) but significantly reduced IL-2-induced STAT5 binding (lane 4). Competition analysis using excess amounts of unlabeled specific oligonucleotides is shown in lane 7. In addition, as demonstrated in Fig.3, the specificity of the binding activity was proven by incubating the extracts with antibodies directed against either STAT5a (lane 5) or STAT5b (lane 6). Both antibodies caused a supershift of the activated STAT5 bound to its specific consensus oligonucleotide, indicating that both STAT5a and STAT5b proteins heterodimerize upon tyrosine phosphorylation to form active STAT5.Figure 3IL-2-induced phosphorylation of STAT5 is stabilized by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 but not by the serine phosphatase inhibitor ocadaic acid. CTLL cells were left untreated (lane 1), stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-2 (lane 2), or stimulated with IL-2 after preincubation with 1 mmNa3VO4 (lane 3) or with 1 mm ocadaic acid for 2 h (lane 4). Supershifts with antibodies specifically directed against STAT5a (lane 5) or STAT5b (lane 6) were performed with nuclear protein extracts of cells stimulated with IL-2 in the presence of ocadaic acid (lane 5) or Na3VO4(lane 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There is evidence that the inactivation of STAT molecules appears to be dependent on protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) (29Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 30Yu C.L. Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 599-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hence, EMSA was performed in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (Fig. 3). Orthovanadate enhanced IL-2-induced binding activity of STAT5 (lane 3), whereas the serine phosphatase inhibitor ocadaic acid did not augment IL-2-mediated STAT5 binding (lane 4). The inhibitory effect of UV on STAT5 binding was also reduced by orthovanadate (Fig. 2, lane 6). The same effect was observed when checking for STAT5 phosphorylation. Inhibition of IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was prevented in the presence of orthovanadate (Fig. 1, lane 6). Together, these data suggest that the activation of a phosphatase may be involved in the inhibitory effect of UV on IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation and binding. Because phosphorylation of STAT5 is a consequence of the binding of IL-2 to the intermediate receptor consisting of IL-2Rβ and γc (19Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jaques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), UV could indirectly inhibit STAT5 phosphorylation simply by down-regulating IL-2Rβ and γc. To determine whether IL-2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 is directly inhibited by UV or rather a consequence of down-regulation of IL-2Rβ and γc, the effect of UV on the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3 was analyzed. Jak1 and Jak3 are both required for the IL-2 response and are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon ligand binding (22Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Proteins extracted from CTLL cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against either Jak1 or Jak3, and Western blot was performed using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (Fig.4). Jak1 and Jak3 were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation. However, neither Jak1 nor Jak3 phosphorylation was inhibited or reduced upon UV irradiation. In contrast to the constitutively expressed IL-2Rβ and γc molecules, which form the intermediate-affinity receptor, the inducible IL-2Rα chain contains a STAT5-responsive positive regulatory element within its promoter region (24Nakajima H. Liu X.W. Wynshaw-Boris A. Rosenthal L.A. Imada K. Finbloom D.S. Hennighausen L. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Hence, inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation by UV should result in a reduced transcription rate of the IL-2Rα chain gene. To prove this hypothesis, semiquantitative PCR analysis using specific primers for the IL-2Rα chain was performed (Fig.5). Untreated CTLL cells expressed low amounts of IL-2Rα chain transcripts, which were enhanced upon stimulation with IL-2 within 2 h. IL-2-induced up-regulation of the IL-2Rα chain transcripts was remarkably reduced following UV exposure of IL-2-treated CTLL cells. Again, orthovanadate prevented the inhibitory effect of UV on IL-2Rα chain mRNA expression. To determine whether mRNA expression correlates with the cell surface expression of the IL-2Rα chain, flow cytometric analysis using an antibody directed against the IL-2Rα chain was performed. In accordance with the PCR results, IL-2 caused an up-regulation of the IL-2Rα chain, which was reduced to control levels upon exposure to UV (Fig. 6). UV alone did not affect IL-2Rα expression. Exposure of cells to orthovanadate prevented the inhibitory effect of UV on IL-2-induced IL-2Rα expression. Neither IL-2 nor UV had an effect on the constitutive expression of the IL-2Rβ chain (data not shown). STAT proteins are cytoplasmatically located transcription factors that, upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific regulatory elements that control gene expression. Several of the STAT members are involved in the signal transduction of immunomodulatory cytokines (31Ihle J.N.

IFNγ signaling is critically dependent on STAT1, and STAT5 plays an important role in the signal transduction of IL-2 (25Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Hence, disruption of or interference with STAT signaling may be an effective way to compromise an immune response. Recently, we observed that UV radiation, a potent immunosuppressor, may interfere with STAT signal transduction and thereby antagonizes the biological effects of IFNγ (12Aragane Y. Schwarz A. Luger T.A. Ariizumi K. Takashima A. Schwarz T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5393-5399PubMed Google Scholar, 15Aragane Y. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11490-11495Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the same seems to apply to IL-2 signaling. A crucial step in IL-2 signal transduction is the phosphorylation, subsequent dimerization, and nuclear translocation of STAT5 (25Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Hence, disturbances in the STAT5 pathway results in severe alterations of immune responses as the phenotypes of STAT5a−/−, STAT5b−/−, and STAT5a−/−/STAT5b−/− double knockout mice clearly show (24Nakajima H.

Our results demonstrate that UV interferes with IL-2-mediated STAT5 signaling by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Accordingly, STAT5 binding activity as demonstrated by EMSA is significantly reduced when CTLL cells are exposed to UV in the presence of IL-2. Jak1 and Jak3 are required for normal IL-2-mediated STAT5 activation (35Nosaka T. van Deursen J.M. Tripp R.A. Thierfelder W.E. Witthuhn B.A. McMickle A.P. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N.

Science. 1995; 270: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In contrast to STAT5 phosphorylation, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 was not affected by UV. This excludes the possibility that UV affects components in the IL-2 signaling pathway located upstream of STAT5 phosphorylation. Hence, it is unlikely that UV exerts its inhibitory effect by down-regulating the IL-2 receptor, e.g. by inducing shedding of one of the IL-2 receptor chains. Along this line, STAT3 phosphorylation, which also appears to be involved in IL-2 signaling, was not significantly affected by UV (data not shown). In this context it is important to mention that it was previously observed that IL-6-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 was also not inhibited by UV (15Aragane Y. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11490-11495Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These findings and the fact that UV is a well known activator of nuclear factor-κB and AP-1 both in vitro and in vivo(39Abeyama K. Eng W. Jester J.V. Vink A.A. Edelbaum D. Cockerell C.J.

To study the mechanism by which fish retinol-binding protein (RBP) is able to remain in plasma besides its small molecular size, we isolated RBP cDNA from a carp liver cDNA library. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of known vertebrate RBPs showed that carp RBP has high homology to the other cloned vertebrate RBPs, but it lacks the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide, RNL(S)L, which is most likely involved in the interaction with transthyretin in mammalian RBPs. In addition, the primary structure of carp RBP contains two consensusN-linked glycosylation sites that represent a unique feature. We have obtained experimental evidence, by in vitro and in vivo expression experiments, that both sites are indeed glycosylated. We have also characterized the protein as a complex type N-linked glycoprotein by lectin binding assay, neuraminidase and endoglycosidase H and F digestion. Inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin treatment of transfected cells caused a great reduction of RBP secretion. Since kidney filtration of anionic proteins is less than half that of neutral protein of the same size, this finding strongly suggests that the amount of carp RBP filtration through kidney glomeruli may be reduced by a glycosylation-dependent increase in the molecular size and negative charge of the protein. A second unique feature of carp RBP as secretory protein is the presence of a nonconserved NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain, which functions as an insertion signal but is not cleaved cotranslationally and remains in the secreted RBP.

Retinol binding protein (RBP,1 molecular mass of about 20 kDa) is the specific blood carrier of vitamin A (retinol) that transports retinol from its storage site, the liver, to the various vitamin A-dependent tissues, where it is internalized and metabolized to its active form, retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is an important transcription modulator involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of many cell types, as well as in fetal morphogenesis (1Blomhoff R. Vitamin A in Health and Disease.Marcel Dekker. 1994; : 1-35Google Scholar). RBP is synthesized mainly by hepatocytes and secreted when bound to retinol (molar ratio of 1:1) and to a 55-kDa homotetrameric protein, the transthyretin (TTR) (2Bellovino D. Morimoto T. Tosetti F. Gaetani S. Exp. Cell Res... 1996; 222: 77-83Google Scholar, 3Bellovino D. Lanyau Y. Garaguso I. Amicone L. Cavallari C. Tripodi M. Gaetani S. J. Cell.

The association of RBP with TTR stabilizes the complex and at the same time increases the size of the RBP-retinol complex, thus lengthening the time of RBP-retinol circulation in plasma, by preventing easy filtration of the relatively small RBP molecule through the kidney (5Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine.Raven Press. 1994; : 257-282Google Scholar). RBP has been isolated and characterized from different species: human (6Colantuoni V. Romano V. Bensi G. Santoro C. Costanzo F. Raugei G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 11: 7769-7776Google Scholar), rat (7Laurent B.C. Nilsson M.H.L. Bavik C.O. Jones T.A. Sundelin J. Peterson P.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 1835-1842Google Scholar). In some species, the structure has been resolved by x-ray diffraction (13Zanotti G. Marcello M. Malpeli G. Folli C. Sartori G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 29613-29620Google Scholar, 14Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science.. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Google Scholar). These studies show that RBP is an extremely conserved protein, sharing strong homology among the species studied, particularly in the regions involved in retinol binding, interaction with TTR and tertiary structure organization. The structure and function of TTR have also been analyzed in detail (14Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science.. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Google Scholar, 15Naylor H.N. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 2647-2653Google Scholar). These studies revealed that in the circulating complex one RBP molecule binds to a TTR tetramer and that the affinity of the interaction is much higher when RBP is in the “holo” form, charged with retinol. Furthermore, a putative interaction domain with TTR has been identified in human RBP (15Naylor H.N. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 2647-2653Google Scholar). RBP was purified by column chromatography from rainbow trout plasma, and its primary and three-dimensional structures were analyzed, as well as its binding affinity for human TTR (16Berni R. Stoppini M. Zapponi M.C. Eur. J. Biochem... 1992; 204: 99-106Google Scholar, 17Zapponi M.C. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Eur. J. Biochem... 1992; 210: 937-943Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence and the tertiary structure are highly conserved, but the in vitro affinity of trout RBP for human TTR appears to be much lower than that of mammalian RBP. Moreover, no circulating RBP·TTR complex was found in trout plasma by gel filtration techniques. A thyroid hormone-binding protein displaying amino acid sequence homology with higher vertebrate TTR was recently isolated from salmon serum (18Yamauchi K. Nakajima J. Hayashi H. Hara A. Yamauchi K. Eur. J. Biochem... 1999; 265: 944-949Google Scholar). Cloning of sea bream TTR provided experimental evidence that TTR is expressed in fish (19Santos C.R.A. Power D.M. Endocrinology.. 1999; 140: 2430-2433Google Scholar), in contrast to previous findings obtained by other investigators through radiolabeled thyroxine binding assays (20Shidoji Y. Muto Y. J. Lipid Res... 1977; 18: 679-691Google Scholar). These observations indicate that, in fish, RBP transports retinol without forming a complex with TTR, raising the question on how such a small molecular mass RBP-retinol complex can be retained in plasma and escape kidney filtration. The elucidation of the mechanisms by which vitamin A is distributed to target tissues in fish is extremely important to optimize aquaculture conditions. In fact, different fish species grown in aquaculture exhibit a high rate of skeletal malformations during embryonic development, and this phenomenon might be related to an incorrect supply of some nutrients in the diet. In particular, vitamin A or, more exactly, its active metabolite retinoic acid plays an essential role in modulating some step of antero-posterior axis formation during embryogenesis by regulating Hox gene expression. Moreover, since it regulates proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, including chondrocytes, it is directly involved in skeleton development (21Stainier D.Y.R. Fishman M.C. Dev.

As a first step in the study of the possible mechanisms by which RBP-retinol is retained in fish plasma without forming a complex with TTR, a cDNA clone for RBP was isolated from a carp liver cDNA library and characterized using in vivo and in vitro expression systems. We present in this paper the experimental evidence that the protein has two unique features; one is the presence of two N-linked sugar moieties, and the second is the presence of a nonconserved uncleaved NH2-terminal signal peptide. Such features may play an important physiological role in the proper intracellular transport of the protein and in decreasing its plasma clearance through the kidney. Monoclonal antibody against c-Myc epitope tag and all chemicals unless specified otherwise were obtained from Sigma Italia (Milan, Italy). Nick translation kit, nylon membranes, pGEX glutathione S-transferase fusion vector, and protein G-agarose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Rainham, United Kingdom). Plaque lifts (Nytran filters) and nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher & Schuell GmbH (Dassel, Germany). The carp liver cDNA library (Uni-ZAPTM XR Vector) and ExAssist/SOL-R system were from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany), and Dynabeads, oligo(dT)25 were from Dynal (Oslo, Norway). SuperSignal Substrate was from Pierce Europe B.V. (Oud Beijerland, The Netherlands). Restriction enzymes and T3 RNA polymerase were fromPromega Corp. (Madison, WI). Endoglycosidase H (EC 3.2.1.96),N-glycosidase F kit (EC 3.5.1.52), neuraminidase fromVibrio cholerae (EC 3.2.1.18), and DIG glycan differentiation kit, RNA inhibitor, dog pancreas microsomes, and Fugene6 were obtained from Roche Diagnostic S.p.a. (Monza, Italia). QIAQUICK DNA purification/extraction kit was from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). [35S]Methionine-cysteine (35S-Protein Labeling Mix, specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Les Ulis, France). Culture media, fetal calf serum, antibiotics, glutamine, and amino acids were from HyClone (Logan, UT). Plasmid pCMV/Myc/ER was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). RI-100 rainbow trout liver cells were obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). 10–20% acrylamide gradient precast gels were purchased from Novex (Carlsbad, CA). 1 × 105plaques were screened with a human RBP cDNA, as probe, labeled with [α-32P]CTP using a nick translation kit. Plaque lifts (Nytran filters) were hybridized overnight at 58 °C and washed twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, plus twice with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Filters were subjected to autoradiography. Positive clones were isolated and excised from phage DNA with ExAssist/SOL-R system; the inserted DNA fragments were sequenced by a conventional dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using the universal primers (T3, T7) of pBlueScript, located downstream and upstream of the cloned cDNA and several synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. Carp RBP cDNA was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides that contained NheI upstream of the initiator methionine codon and NotI just before the termination codon. After digestion with NheI andNotI, the cDNA was cloned into pClneo-Myc (modified from pClneo) to construct pClneo-carpRBPmyc. pEGFP-carp putative signal peptide, defined as “chimeric protein” or “carp signal green fluorescent protein (GFP),” was constructed by ligating to pEGFP-N3 vector the carp RBP NH2-terminal region (26 amino acids) amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides containing NheI upstream and SalI downstream. Plasmid pGEX-carpRBP was constructed by ligating to pGEX vector the carp RBP sequence amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides containing BamHI upstream and EcoRI downstream. The resulting fusion protein is formed by glutathione S-transferase followed by carp RBP. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted as described by Chirgwinet al. (26Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.I. Biochemistry.. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar) from different carp tissues (liver, intestine, brain, kidney, and female gonads). Poly(A)+ RNA was then isolated from total RNA on Dynabeads, oligo(dT)25. Poly(A)+ RNA samples were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose, 1.85 m formaldehyde gel and transferred onto nylon membranes, which were then hybridized with 32P-labeled carp RBP cDNA and with rat actin cDNA for normalization under standard conditions (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar). Cos-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum. R1–100 rainbow trout liver cells were grown in Medium 199 with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was performed on cells at 80% confluence in 35-mm plates. 3 μl of Fugene6 was mixed with 97 μl of serum-free medium in an Eppendorf tube, 1 μg of DNA was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to each plate in 2 ml of complete medium, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), supplied with methionine-cysteine-free DMEM and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for starvation of the two amino acids. After this period, 100 μC/ml35S-protein labeling mix was added to fresh methionine-cysteine-free DMEM (300 μl/plate) and the cells were incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends. Antibody against purified trout RBP was raised in mice. This antibody has been proven to recognize carp RBP by Western blotting but not by direct immunoprecipitation. Antibody against carp RBP was therefore raised in rabbit by injecting the fusion protein glutathioneS-transferase-carpRBP; the fusion protein, expressed inEscherichia coli cells, was extracted from inclusion bodies (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar) by boiling in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and separated by 13% SDS-PAGE. The corresponding gel band was then cut and eluted overnight in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. Labeled cells were harvested in 1 ml of cold radioimmunoprotein assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100), and samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation as previously described (3Bellovino D. Lanyau Y. Garaguso I. Amicone L. Cavallari C. Tripodi M. Gaetani S. J. Cell. Physiol... 1999; 181: 24-32Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were dissolved in the desired amount of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), incubated in boiling water for 5 min, and then analyzed on 13% SDS-PAGE, followed by sodium salicylate fluorography (28Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem... 1979; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar). Proteins fractionated on SDS-PAGE as described above were transferred on a nitrocellulose filter using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, buffer containing 20% methanol. The blot was stained with Ponceau S to check the extent of transfer, destained with PBS, and immunostained as described (3Bellovino D. Lanyau Y. Garaguso I. Amicone L. Cavallari C. Tripodi M. Gaetani S. J. Cell. Physiol... 1999; 181: 24-32Google Scholar). Finally, the blot was incubated with SuperSignal substrate (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray films for appropriate time. Plasmid encoding carp RBP was linearized and then purified using a QIAQUICK DNA purification/extraction kit. Transcription and translation were carried out as described in the Promega technical manual. Immediately after the incubation, the translation mixture was chilled on ice, diluted to 100 μl with a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2 and then overlaid onto a 200 μl cushion containing 0.5 m sucrose, 50 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, and 5 mmMgCl2. The step gradient was centrifuged at 65,000 rpm at 4 °C for 60 min in the 100.3 rotor of the Beckman centrifuge TL-100. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 0.25 m sucrose buffer and divided in two samples; one was incubated at 37 °C with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, 2.5 milliunits (specific activity 125 units/mg of enzyme protein)) overnight, and the other was used as untreated control. In the protease protection experiment, the pellet was treated as described previously (29Xie Y. Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Bellovino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2563-2573Google Scholar). Two carp serum samples (2.5 μl each) were mixed with 2.5 μl of Dilution Buffer and boiled for 3 min in the presence of 1% β-mercaptoethanol. After addition of 5 μl of Reaction Buffer to all samples, one of the two samples received 5 μl of Reaction Buffer as control, and the other received 5 μl of Endo F (5 milliunits). All the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, mixed with 5 μl of SDS gel loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunostaining as described previously (3Bellovino D. Lanyau Y. Garaguso I. Amicone L. Cavallari C. Tripodi M. Gaetani S. J. Cell. Physiol... 1999; 181: 24-32Google Scholar). Treatment with neuraminidase from V. cholerae and subsequent analysis were carried out as follows. The immunoprecipitates by anti-Myc/protein G from culture media of Cos-1 cells, which have been transiently transfected with pClneo-carpRBPmyc and metabolically labeled for 6 h, were suspended in a small volume of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100. After incubating in boiling water for 5 min, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was adjusted to 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. Each sample received either 5 milliunits of enzyme or buffer alone as control and was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Digested samples were analyzed in 10–20% native acrylamide gel (pre-cast by Novex). In parallel 2 μg of purified human transferrin was treated in the same way and analyzed by the same methods as positive control. Six carp serum samples (4 μl each) were immunoprecipitated with anti-carp RBP antibody. The six immunoprecipitates were individually suspended in gel loading buffer, incubated in boiling water for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant and 2 μl of carp serum, which was mixed with gel loading buffer and incubated in boiling water for 5 min, were fractionated on 13% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter as described earlier. The filter was then cut into seven strips and stained with lectins as described in the legend to Fig. 4 A. The cDNA encoding carp RBP was cloned from a liver cDNA library by hybridization, using a human RBP cDNA as probe under low stringency conditions. Three positive candidate clones were isolated. The largest, of about 800 base pairs, contained an open reading frame corresponding to 213 amino acid residues. To confirm that the cDNA encodes RBP, the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with human (6Colantuoni V. Romano V. Bensi G. Santoro C. Costanzo F. Raugei G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 11: 7769-7776Google Scholar), rat (7Laurent B.C. Nilsson M.H.L. Bavik C.O. Jones T.A. Sundelin J. Peterson P.A. J. Biol.

As it is evident from Fig. 1, the primary structure of carp RBP has high homology with all six species. All cysteine residues that are involved in disulfide bond formation (indicated by closed rectangles), as well as the amino acid residues that are predicted to form the “retinol pocket” (indicated by underlines) (17Zapponi M.C.

As expected from such high degree of conservation, the α helix and β sheet distribution in carp RBP is almost identical to that of human RBP (data not shown). The primary structure also shows that there is a hydrophobic domain at the NH2 terminus, which contains 13 consecutive hydrophobic amino acid residues resembling signal peptides of Xenopus, chicken, and mammalian RBPs. Moreover, the primary sequence of this putative signal is not evolutionarily conserved. Additional features of carp RBP are: (i) the absence of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide, RNL(S)L, that is presumed to stabilize the interaction with TTR in mammalian RBPs (indicated by open rectangle) (15Naylor H.N. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 2647-2653Google Scholar), and (ii) the presence of two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (indicated by waved underlines) near the NH2 terminus (residues 25 and 46), which are absent in all the available RBP sequences from other species, including trout. To examine whether carp RBP is expressed in specific tissues like mammalian RBP, poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA prepared from adult carp liver, kidney, intestine, brain, and female gonads and was subjected to Northern blot analysis using carp RBP cDNA as a probe and actin cDNA for normalizing the amount of mRNA. The results (Fig. 2) show that, like in mammals, carp RBP is highly expressed in liver (lane 3), whereas, unlike in mammals, a significant amount of mRNA is also expressed in intestine. RBP transcription is barely detectable in kidney and brain and absent in female gonads. As seen in Fig. 1, carp RBP contains two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites in the NH2-terminal region. Since none of the vertebrate RBPs sequenced to date have N-linked glycosylation sites, we examined in vitro glycosylation of the carp protein. The cDNA was transcribed in vitro, and the transcript was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system. SDS-PAGE analysis of the primary translation product shows migration at a position corresponding to about 24 kDa (Fig.3 A, lane 1, indicated by an asterisk). When the transcript was translated in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, two additional bands were detected at 27 and 30 kDa (lane 2), corresponding to the expected molecular mass of single and double glycosylated products, respectively. However, when microsomes were added to the translation mixture 90 min following initiation of translation, only one product with a molecular mass of 24 kDa was obtained (data not shown). As the band with the smallest molecular mass migrated at the same rate as the primary translation product inlane 1, it may be either untranslocated or translocated but unglycosylated RBP. To discern between the two possibilities, we performed a digestion with exogenously added proteases. When the products translated in the presence of microsomes were digested with proteases in the absence of detergent, all three bands were protected (lane 4), but none of the band was protected when digested in the presence of detergent (lane 5). This result indicates that all three forms of the protein are cotranslationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where they are protected from digestion by exogenously added proteases. This result suggests the interesting possibility that the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain (predicted signal peptide) of carp RBP (see Fig. 1) may not be cleaved during cotranslational translocation because the fastest migrating band in lane 4 (indicated by an asterisk) has the same mobility as the primary translation product indicated by an asterisk in lane 1. To confirm that the two high molecular weight bands representN-linked glycosylated forms of carp RBP, the products translated in the presence of microsomes were digested with Endo H. This enzyme specifically removes, by cutting between the twoN-acetylglucosamine residues, the “core” carbohydrates added to N-linked glycoprotein in the ER, but does not remove the carbohydrates of complex and hybrid type that are further modified in the Golgi apparatus. As shown in Fig. 3 B(lanes 1 and 2), following digestion the two bands with higher molecular mass shifted to the position of the smallest molecular mass (24 kDa, deglycosylated RBP, indicated by anasterisk). These results clearly demonstrate that carp RBP is cotranslationally glycosylated. It is apparent from comparison between panels A (lanes 3and 4) and B (lanes 1 and2) of Fig. 3 that the protease-resistant, fastest migrating band (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 3 A,lane 4) migrated at the same rate as the deglycosylated RBP (indicated by an asterisk in Fig.3 B, lane 2). Since the fastest migrating band in Fig. 3 A (lane 4) comigrated with the primary translation product (indicated byasterisks in Fig. 3 A, lane 1), the deglycosylated form shown in Fig. 3 B also appears to have the same molecular mass as the primary translation product. In other words, newly in vitro synthesized carp RBP was cotranslationally translocated in the ER lumen where it was glycosylated, but the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain was not cotranslationally cleaved. To examine whether the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain of carp RBP is cleaved during translocation in vivo, total proteins from carp plasma were digested with the deglycosylating enzyme Endo F (Fig.3 B), which removes the core carbohydrate of all types ofN-linked glycoprotein by cutting between asparagine residue and N-acetylglucosamine. The size of the Endo F-digested RBP was then compared with that of the deglycosylated, microsomal RBP synthesized in vitro (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Western blot analysis of the circulating form of carp RBP was performed using an anti-trout RBP antibody. The results show that undigested carp plasma RBP migrates as a single band of about 32 kDa. However, upon Endo F digestion, the protein appears as a single band that migrates at the same rate as the deglycosylated, microsomal RBP. These data confirm that the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain of carp RBP is not cleaved cotranslationally, but remains in the secreted RBP. It should be pointed out here that the molecular mass of the in vivo synthesized carp RBP is slightly larger than the microsomal form translated in vitro. This can be attributed to post-translational oligosaccharide processing that is carried out in the Golgi apparatus. To examine this possibility, additional analysis was carried out to characterize the terminal carbohydrate of serum carp RBP using the “DIG glycan differentiation kit,” as described in the legend to Fig. 4. This kit contains five different lectins: Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (specific to terminal mannose), Sambucus nigraagglutin (specific to Neu5Acα2–6Gal and Neu5Acα2–6GalNAc),Maakia amurensis agglutinin (specific to sialic acid α2–3Gal), peanut agglutinin (specific to Galβ1–3GalNAc), andDatura stramonium agglutinin (specific to Galβ1–4GlcNAc). The results (Fig. 4 A) show that, among five lectins, only MAA and DSA bound to serum RBP, indicating that the terminal sugar moiety is composed of sialic acid (α2–3) and galactose (β1–4), but not mannose. The presence of sialic acid in the secreted RBP was also examined by comparing the migration rate of neuraminidase treated and undigested RBP in native PAGE, because the migration rate of the sialylated protein becomes slower upon digestion with neuraminidase, due to the decrease in negative charge. For this experiment Cos-1 cells were transiently transfected with a Myc-tagged expression construct of carp RBP, and secreted RBP was purified from the culture medium by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody and digested with neuraminidase from V. cholerae. As positive control, transferrin was digested with neuraminidase and analyzed with the same procedure. Fig. 4 B clearly shows that neuraminidase digested RBP (lane 2) migrated slower than undigested RBP (lane 1) as in the case of digested (lane 4) and undigested (lane 3) transferrin. These results led us to conclude that carp RBP is a complex type of N-linked glycopr"

The anesthetic nitrous oxide (NNO) occupies multiple sites within each protein, but does not bind to heme iron. Infrared (IR) spectra of NNO molecules sequestered within albumin, with NO present, support the binding of NO and NNO to the same sites with comparable affinities. Perturbations of IR spectra of the Cys34 thiol of HSA indicate NO, NNO, halothane, and chloroform can induce similar changes in protein structure.

With HbA, IR spectra of cysteine thiols and/or the iron(II) N-O stretching region denote changes in protein structure due to NO, NNO, or CO occupying noniron sites with an order of decreasing affinities of NO > NNO > CO. Loss of NO from some, not all, noniron sites in hemeproteins is very slow (t½∼ hours). These findings provide examples in which NO and anesthetics alter the structure and properties of protein similarly, and support the hypothesis that some physiological effects of NO (and possibly CO) result from anesthetic-like noncovalent bonding to sites within protein or other tissue components.

The mechanisms of anesthesia and the regulatory functions of nitric oxide (NO)1 remain far from clear.

In contrast, the reactions between NO and receptor sites in proteins that have been studied extensively involve covalent bond formation, as in metal nitrosyl andS-nitrosothiol (-SNO) derivatives (7Henry Y.

Nitrosations (i.e. attack of protein residues by NO+) on exposure of proteins to NO with a suitable oxidant present are the only reactions of NO that have been discussed other than the binding of NO to metal sites. Evidence of NO occupying sites within proteins as an uncharged diatomic free radical by means of anesthetic-like noncovalent bonding has not been reported. The binding of volatile anesthetics to serum albumins and the effects of such binding on protein structure are considered in several recent reports. Specific, saturable binding of halothane and other anesthetics to bovine serum albumin and anesthetic-induced alterations in the structure or carrier function of this protein have been shown (11Eckenhoff R.G.

Acta. 1999; 1430: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The anesthetic nitrous oxide (NNO) was detected at sites within human serum albumin (HSA) (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Infrared (IR) spectra of bound NNO molecules demonstrated sites of two types. The exposure of HSA to NNO enhanced absorbance in the S-H stretching region of the IR spectrum giving evidence of an NNO-induced change in protein conformation near Cys34 (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1992, NO was proposed to circulate in mammalian plasma primarily in association with serum albumin, due to formation of the S-nitrosothiol derivative (17Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). However, the similarities in the structure and physical properties of NNO and NO suggest the possibility that NO may also interact at some sites within albumin in the manner shown for NNO. IR evidence of NNO molecules at multiple sites within hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) has also been obtained (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Einarsdottir O. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9199-9205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NNO neither serves as a ligand to heme iron nor reacts with thiols. The ability of NNO to alter hemeprotein structure and function was shown by shifts in the IR spectra of cysteine thiols of HbA (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by partial and reversible inhibitions of CcO (18Einarsdottir O. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9199-9205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The well established ability of NO to ligate to heme iron in HbA, Mb, and CcO, and to copper B in CcO (19Sampath V. Zhao X.J. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), led to the assumption of metal binding in proposed mechanisms for physiologically important reactions of NO with hemeproteins. Reactions of NO with HbA that result inS-nitrosothiol derivative formation have also received much attention (8Broillet M.C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, alternative mechanisms whereby NO alters hemeprotein structure and function by noncovalent anesthetic-like bonding to sites that involve neither metal nor cysteine sulfur remain unexplored. Much interest in possible physiological roles of carbon monoxide (CO), including a messenger role in the nervous system and the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, has developed recently (21Xue L. Farrugia G. Miller S.M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Szurszewski J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1851-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.

Physiol. 1999; 115: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms related to these effects of CO have not been elucidated, but those proposed thus far have considered the ability of CO to bind to iron(II) of hemeproteins. The occupancy of nonmetal protein sites by CO, as with NO, remains unstudied. We report here experimental results that indicate NO can reversibly occupy sites within HSA and hemeproteins in the manner of NNO (and other anesthetics) and, in so doing, can induce changes in the properties and structures of the proteins. These findings provide support for considering NO-protein interactions of this type as potentially important in at least some of the physiological roles of NO. Limited evidence of the ability of CO to occupy noniron as well as iron(II) sites in hemoglobin is also presented. Fatty acid- and globulin-free human serum albumin (99% from Sigma) was used as received. Recrystallized heart cytochromec oxidase and myoglobin were isolated and purified from fresh bovine heart as was hemoglobin A from human blood via methods described earlier (24Yoshikawa S.

Nitric oxide was obtained as15N16O (99% from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and as 5% 14N16O, 95% N2 (technical grade, Air Products and Chemicals). Both NO gases were treated with 1 m aqueous KOH to remove NO2 (27Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 7982-7986Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Other materials included NNO (99% from General Air Services and Supply), CO (99.5% from General Air Services and Supply), N2 (99.9% from General Air Services and Supply), halothane (99.99% from Halocarbon Laboratories), and chloroform (99% from Fisher). Solutions of HSA in 200 mmTris-Cl buffer, pH 7.2, were made anaerobic by evacuation and flushing with nitrogen. HSA solutions were exposed to varying amounts of15N16O, NNO, and/or nitrogen to give a total pressure of 1 atm. Halothane and chloroform were added to HSA solutions as liquids. In each case the treated solution was allowed to stand for at least 1 h prior to recording IR spectra. All operations were carried out at 20 °C in both albumin and hemeprotein studies. Hemeprotein solutions were prepared in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, under strictly anaerobic conditions as described earlier (19Sampath V. Zhao X.J. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Caughey W.S. Dong A. Sampath V. Yoshikawa S. Zhao X.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several methods were used to detect the relative affinities of the proteins for NO and CO and the slow release of NO. In one method a solution (2.5 ml) of deoxy-Mb (or deoxy-Hb), 5 μm in heme and CcO (unliganded and fully-reduced) at 10 μm in heme A was prepared in a sealed 1-cm path length spectrophotometer cell. A NO/N2 gas mixture or CO was gradually added incrementally via a gas-tight syringe under atmospheric pressure. The visible/Soret spectrum was measured after each addition and second-derivative analysis of the Soret spectrum carried out. In a second procedure, CcONO was prepared initially from a solution (2.5 ml) of CcO (10 μm in heme A) by slowly adding, at atmospheric pressure, an amount of NO/N2 (∼0.3 ml) that was just sufficient for the complete ligation of heme a3 iron(II) with NO as observed in visible/Soret spectra. N2 was then passed over the solution for 15 min to remove the dissolved free NO, as well as the NO present above the solution, without decreasing metal-bound NO. A solution of deoxy-Mb or deoxy-Hb at 8–10 mm in heme was introduced into the CcONO solution with a gas-tight syringe to give a solution containing 5 μm Mb or Hb. Changes in visible/Soret spectra were monitored over 24 h. The Mb or Hb level was then increased to 15 μm and the visible/Soret spectra followed for another 24 h. An analogous procedure was used to measure the relative affinities of these hemeproteins for CO. In a third method the order of protein addition was reversed. A solution (2.5 ml) of 5 μm deoxy-Mb or deoxy-Hb was exposed to 0.3 ml of NO/N2, which was just sufficient to saturate the heme irons with NO as shown in visible/Soret spectra, followed by exposure to N2 for 15 min. Changes in visible/Soret spectra were monitored for 48 h after the addition of 10 μm CcO. Spectra were observed for an additional 24 h after raising the Mb or Hb levels to 15 μm. To evaluate the number of nonmetal sites for NO in Hb, a solution (2.5 ml) of 5 μm deoxy-Hb was exposed to 0.3 ml of NO/N2. This amount of NO was sufficient to saturate essentially all the heme iron sites with NO, but not necessarily all the noniron sites. After flushing with N2 for 15 min, an additional 5 μm deoxy-Hb was added. Three additional 5 μm increases in Hb concentration were made after 4-, 5-, and 12-h intervals, respectively. Visible/Soret spectra were monitored throughout. To evaluate the effectiveness of N2 flushing for removal of unbound NO, 0.3 ml of NO/N2 was introduced into 2.5 ml of anaerobic buffer. After passing N2 above the solution for 15 min, deoxy-Mb or deoxy-Hb was added to a level of 5 μm. Visible/Soret spectra of the solution were monitored for 48 h to ascertain if any MbNO or HbNO formed in the solution. To evaluate the effects of NNO, CO, N2, and excess NO on the IR spectra of solutions of hemeprotein nitrosyls, concentrated protein solutions were required. Solutions of oxy-Hb (9 mmin heme) and oxy-Mb (9 mm) were made anaerobic and fully reduced by repeated evacuations and exposures to N2 for 30 min, followed by treatment with sodium dithionite in slight excess. These solutions were exposed to increasing levels of NO/N2in small increments. After each treatment with NO, a small amount of solution was placed in an N2-flushed IR cell in which both the IR spectrum from 4000 to 1000 cm−1 and the visible/Soret spectrum from 700 to 350 nm were recorded. The degree of saturation of the heme iron(II) sites by NO was calculated from Soret spectra. Exposure to NO was continued until all iron sites had bound NO. Finally more NO, that represented 50% of the total NO already added, was administered. IR spectra were also recorded following exposures of the solutions to N2, NNO, and CO. The methods followed to record the IR spectra were as described earlier (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sampath V. Rousseau D.L. Caughey W.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley, New York1996: 413-426Google Scholar). IR spectra were recorded at 20 °C in cells with CaF2 windows with a PerkinElmer Model 1800 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a mercury/cadmium/tellurium detector and interfaced with a PerkinElmer 7700 data station. Path lengths were 100 μm for S-H spectra and 6 μm for NNO and NO spectra. For each spectrum a 1000-scan interferogram was collected in single beam mode with a 2-cm−1 resolution and a 1-cm−1 interval. Reference spectra were recorded under identical scan conditions. SH, NNO, and NO IR spectra were obtained by subtracting a reference solution spectrum from the sample spectrum followed by baseline corrections in the regions from 2630 cm−1 to 2500 cm−1, 2260 cm−1 to 2180 cm−1, and 1700 cm−1 to 1400 cm−1, respectively. To obtain the spectra for the NNO molecules within protein the spectra for NNO in buffer alone was subtracted from the NNO spectrum for the protein solution (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curve fitting analysis was carried out using the CURVEFIT function of Spectra Calc software (Galactic Industries Corp.). Visible/Soret spectra were recorded with a Cary 2200 spectrophotometer. The increases in absorbance near 2560 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of an anaerobic solution of HSA at pH 7.2 that resulted from exposure of the solution to NNO or NO are shown in Fig. 1. Curve-fitting of the absorbance induced by NNO with 100% Gaussian profiles, as in spectrum C, gives two bands: a major band at 2563 cm−1 with about 85% of total intensity and a minor band at 2579 cm−1. Assignment of these bands to S-H stretch vibrations was discussed earlier (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol.

With NO, as in spectrum F, curve-fitting yields one band at 2563 cm−1, the same wavenumber as found for the major band with NNO, and a second less intense band at 2548 cm−1. The insets of Fig. 1 show the dependence of band intensities on partial pressures of NNO and NO. Raising the partial pressure beyond 0.6 atm did not increase S-H band intensity with either gas. One-half maximum absorbance was achieved at 0.35 atm for NNO and 0.47 atm for NO. Saturation of a solution of HSA with either halothane or chloroform resulted in a S-H band (Fig. 2) that was broader and at higher wavenumber (∼2576 cm−1) than occurred with either NNO or NO (Fig. 2). The spectra obtained with NNO/halothane and NNO/chloroform mixtures reflected a combination of the spectra exhibited by the individual anesthetics. Mixtures of NO and NNO resulted in NO-type and NNO-type S-H bands with their relative contributions varying as the ratio of their partial pressures are changed (Fig. 2). The NNO-IR spectrum obtained when HSA was exposed only to NNO is shown in Fig. 3A. As reported earlier (5Dong A. Huang P. Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23911-23917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), curve-fitting reveals two major bands at 2220 cm−1and 2225 cm−1 and minor “hot bands” at lower wavenumbers. Spectra B, C, and D of Fig. 3 exhibit a reduction in the intensity of the 2225 cm−1 band relative to the 2220 cm−1 band as the partial pressure of NNO relative to NO decreases. Spectra A and B are nearly identical indicating that the NNO sites are essentially as fully occupied by NNO at 0.8 atm NNO and 0.2 atm NO as when NNO is 1 atm with NO absent. However, spectra C and D show that at lower NNO/NO pressure ratios, the intensity of the 2225 cm−1 band relative to the 2220 cm−1 band decreases, as does the combined band intensity. Thus, at NO partial pressures greater than 0.2 atm, occupancy by NNO at both NNO sites decreases, but more so at the more polar 2225 cm−1 site. The visible/Soret spectra for unliganded fully reduced Hb, Mb, and CcO and their iron(II) nitrosyl complexes (Fig.4) served as reference spectra for determining the binding of NO to heme iron(II) in these proteins. For example, spectra of a solution of deoxy-Mb and unliganded fully reduced CcO were recorded as the solution was exposed to increasing volumes of a 5% NO, 95% N2 gas mixture (Fig.5). With NO absent, the second-derivative minimum at 441 nm represents the combination of unresolved bands for deoxy-Mb at 435 nm and unliganded CcO at 444 nm. Exposure to 0.2 ml of gas mixture gave spectra consistent with only partial conversion of deoxy-Mb to MbNO. Exposure to 0.4 ml resulted in second-derivative minima at 421 and 444 nm, as expected for Mb being present as mainly MbNO and CcO remaining mostly unliganded. Increasing the volume of gas to 0.6 ml resulted in bands due to both MbNO and CcONO. The addition of deoxy-Mb to a solution of CcONO resulted in the rapid transfer of NO from heme a3 of CcONO to Mb heme iron(II) (Fig.6B). Similar experiments with CO demonstrated the greater affinity of Mb for CO (data not shown).Figure 5Nitric oxide-induced changes in visible/Soret spectra of a mixture of cytochrome c oxidase and myoglobin.

Similar experiments with CO indicated HbCO formed first. Following the addition of deoxy-Hb to a solution containing CcONO a slow transfer of NO from heme a3 of CcONO to Hb occurred (Fig.7, A-D). Experiments with CcOCO and deoxy-Hb revealed a fast transfer of CO from CcOCO to Hb, which was complete within 5 min. Discrimination between Hb and Mb as iron(II) nitrosyl or carbonyl species was more readily achieved by use of ligand IR spectra than visible/Soret spectra (19Sampath V. Zhao X.J. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Zhao X.J. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both NO and CO were shown by N-O or C-O stretching bands to bind preferentially to the iron(II) of Mb in an anaerobic solution of deoxy-Mb and deoxy-Hb, equimolar in heme (data not shown). However, based on C-O stretching band parameters (32Potter W.T. Hazzard J.H. Choc M.G. Tucker M.P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6283-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), when CO was added to an aerobic solution of oxy-Mb and oxy-Hb, equimolar in heme, the order of affinities for CO was shown to be Hb β subunits > Hb α subunits > Mb. The visible/Soret spectrum of a solution of CcCCO or HbCO upon exposure to NO underwent immediate changes that were consistent with the conversion of the carbonyl species to the nitrosyl species. NO was less effective in displacing CO from MbCO. If a solution of MbCO had been prepared by exposing deoxy-Mb only to the amount of CO needed to completely saturate iron(II) sites, the displacement of CO by NO was much slower than in a similar experiment with HbCO. Furthermore, CO at high levels slowly displaced the heme-bound NO of MbNO, if the MbNO solution had been prepared with the minimum amount of NO needed to saturate all iron(II) sites with NO. Thus, the order of affinities of NO > CO is more pronounced for CcO and Hb than for Mb. The visible/Soret spectrum 35 min after the addition of deoxy-Mb to a solution of CcONO (Fig. 6C), which indicated only MbNO and ligand-free CcO were present, changed upon standing. The spectrum recorded after 120 min (Fig. 6D) revealed that now all the heme a3 of CcO, as well as all Mb heme, contained iron(II)-bound NO. Analogous experiments, except for the substitution of Hb for Mb, resulted in similar, but slower, spectral changes (Fig.7). A solution (2.5 ml) of 5 μm deoxy-Hb was exposed to 0.3 ml of NO/N2 to saturate all heme iron(II) sites with NO and then surface-flushed with N2 for 15 min to completely remove all the NO in buffer. Following the addition of another 5 μm deoxy-Hb, the second-derivative Soret minimum at 433 nm due to deoxy-Hb decreased slowly as a minimum at 418 nm (HbNO) increased. After 3 h, only HbNO was present. Similar changes in spectra occurred over 4 h following the addition of a second 5 μm deoxy-Hb, and, over 5 h, after a third 5 μm addition of deoxy-Hb. However, no further spectral changes occurred over 24 h following a fourth addition of 5 μm deoxy-Hb. These findings support the slow release of NO from noniron sites in both CcO and Hb with the released NO subsequently binding to heme iron(II) of added Mb or Hb. Fig.8 shows IR spectra of a NO-saturated MbNO solution with a CO-saturated solution of MbCO used as reference. Curve-fitting of the asymmetric absorbance in Fig. 8Ayielded three bands with maxima at 1611.5 ± 0.1, 1603.5 ± 0.5, and 1595.3 ± 0.2 cm−1, widths at one-half maximum absorbance of 9.2 ± 0.4, 8.4 ± 0.4, and 9.0 ± 0.2 cm−1, and relative integrated areas of 15:4:1, respectively. After N2-flushing, the spectrum obtained (Fig. 8B) can be curve-fitted as only two bands with maxima at 1611.8 ± 0.1 and 1604.8 ± 0.1 cm−1, widths at one-half maximum absorbance of 8.4 ± 0.6 and 9.1 ± 0.3 cm−1, and relative integrated areas of 3:1, respectively. Flushing of NO-saturated solutions of HbNO with N2 also perturbs the IR spectra (Fig. 8, C and D). Curve-fitting yielded two bands for the NO-saturated solution and three bands for the N2-flushed solution (data not shown). Asymmetry decreased on N2-flushing with Mb but increased with Hb. Flushing with CO or NNO also affected the degree of asymmetry of HbNO solutions (Fig. 8, D and E). These asymmetry differences are reflected in the widths of absorbances recorded at one-tenth maximum absorbance. Thus, flushing the solutions with NNO, CO, or N2 altered the recorded spectrum without reducing the amount of NO bound to iron(II). The S-H stretching bands due to β93, β112, and α104 cysteines were perturbed very little when a CO-saturated solution of HbCO or a NO-saturated solution of HbNO was flushed with N2 (Fig. 9, A-D). Incubations of solutions of HbCO, HbNO, and HbO2 saturated with CO, NO, and O2, respectively, under a small volume of NNO also had only small effects on the S-H bands (Fig. 9, E, G, and I). However, incubations under a larger volume of NNO resulted in substantial shifts in spectra for the β93 and β112 cysteines (Fig. 9, F, H, and K). NNO-IR spectra recorded for solutions E to K of Fig. 8 (data not shown) demonstrated that exposure to the larger volume of NNO resulted in a 5-fold larger concent"
https://openalex.org/W2012816659,"The c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase is activated by certain DNA-damaging agents and regulates induction of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). The hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) has also been shown to act upstream to the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway. We report here that exposure of hematopoietic Jurkat T cells to genotoxic agents is associated with activation of HPK1. The results demonstrate that exposure of Jurkat cells to DNA-damaging agents is associated with translocation of active c-Abl from nuclei to cytoplasm and binding of c-Abl to HPK1. Our findings also demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylates HPK1 in cytoplasm and stimulates HPK1 activity. The functional significance of the c-Abl-HPK1 interaction is supported by the demonstration that this complex regulates SAPK/JNK activation. Overexpression of c-Abl(K-R) inhibits HPK1-induced activation of SAPK/JNK. Conversely, the dominant negative mutant of HPK1 blocks c-Abl-mediated induction of SAPK/JNK. These findings indicate that activation of HPK1 and formation of HPK1/c-Abl complexes are functionally important in the stress response of hematopoietic cells to genotoxic agents."
