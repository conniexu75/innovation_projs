TGF-β-meditated EMT involves the stimulation of a number of signaling pathways by the sequential binding of the type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, respectively. Integrins comprise a family of heterodimeric extracellular matrix receptors that mediate cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, hence making them crucial for EMT progression. In light of substantial evidence indicating TGF-β regulation of various β1 integrins and their extracellular matrix ligands, we examined the cross-talk between the TGF-β and integrin signal transduction pathways. Using an inducible system for the expression of a cytoplasmically truncated dominant negative TGF-β type II receptor, we blocked TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, transcriptional activation, and EMT progression. Dominant negative TGF-β type II receptor expression inhibited TGF-β signaling to the SMAD and AKT pathways, but did not block TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation. Interestingly, blocking integrin β1 function inhibited TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation and EMT progression. Limiting p38MAPK activity through the expression of a dominant negative-p38MAPK also blocked TGF-β-mediated EMT. In summary, TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation is dependent on functional integrin β1, and p38MAPK activity is required but is not sufficient to induce EMT.

Yang S.H. Hair A. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7985-7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). TGF-β was initially described as a secreted factor that induced an anchorage-independent transformed phenotype in fibroblasts in vitro (2Moses H.L. Branum E.L. Proper J.A. Robinson R.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2842-2848PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β also induces phenotypic changes in epithelial cells and activates transcription of integrin genes as well as their extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands. The spectrum of TGF-β responses are initiated by its interaction with cell surface receptors that form a heterotetrameric complex of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (3Ebner R.

The activated ligand-receptor complex in turn conveys the signal to the nucleus via the phosphorylation and activation of the SMAD signaling pathway (5Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R.

Despite the cross-talk among the various signaling pathways, there is compelling data to suggest a separation of function among the individual signaling molecules (for review, see Ref. 12Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that the SMAD pathway is involved in growth inhibition, while the Rho proteins, and PI3-kinase pathways are likely operative in phenotypic changes (6Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M.

EMT has been defined by the loss of cell polarity, break down of cell-cell junctions, and the acquisition of an elongated cell shape. While tight junctions and adherence junctions mediate epithelial cell-cell interactions, its interaction with the substratum is through the heterodimeric integrin receptors (15Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A large body of literature shows that the expression of integrins is regulated by TGF-β, in particular the up-regulation of β1 integrins (16Kumar N.M. Sigurdson S.L. Sheppard D. Lwebuga-Mukasa J.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Roberts C.J. Birkenmeier T.M. McQuillan J.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. McDonald J.A. J. Biol.

In addition, integrin-mediated adhesion potentiates many of the same signaling pathways regulated by TGF-β such as the PI3-kinase-AKT, stress kinases, and ERK1/2-stimulated pathways, (19Mainiero F. Soriani A. Strippoli R. Jacobelli J. Gismondi A. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the underlying cross talk of TGF-β and integrin signaling.Given the convergence of TGF-β and integrin signaling on common downstream factors as well as their central effects on cytoskeletal organization, we hypothesized that there may be cooperation between TGF-β and integrins in both signal transduction and the modulation of EMT progression. To isolate the role of TGF-β we disrupted TGF-β signaling by inducibly expressing a cytoplasmically truncated TβRII (DNIIR, (20Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar)) in non-transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells, NMuMG. Elevated expression of DNIIR caused the loss of TGF-β responsiveness to growth, SMAD-mediated transcriptional regulation, and EMT progression without the apparent loss of p38MAPK activation. However, blocking integrin β1 adhesion inhibited TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK stimulation and EMT progression. The findings suggest integrin β1 adhesion and p38MAPK signaling are necessary but not sufficient for the complex process of TGF-β-induced EMT.DISCUSSIONThe extracellular microenvironment plays a critical role in the ability of an epithelial cell to transition to a more plastic phenotype. This is exemplified by the influence that TGF-β and ECM components have one basic epithelial cell functions such as the morphology, polarity, and adhesion through TGF-β receptors and integrin function. Based on the common downstream signaling molecules and overlapping cellular consequences induced by TGF-β and integrins, we hypothesized that there may be cooperation between the two pathways in EMT. We utilized an inducible system expressing DNIIR in mammary epithelial cells and employed an integrin β1 antibody to explore potential cross-talk between the two cell surface receptors. Effectively limiting TβRII activity by the induction of DNIIR expression was able to block TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, SMAD-mediated transcriptional activation, and EMT. TGF-β-induced Smad2, and AKT phosphorylation was blocked by the expression of DNIIR. Yet, the induced expression of the cytoplasmically truncated TβRII at the levels that blocked the other measured responses did not block TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation. The potential for a lower TβRII threshold for p38MAPK activation was indicated by the results using cells with a TβRII null background, T47D. Blocking integrin-β1-mediated adhesion resulted in the inhibition of TGF-β-mediated activation of p38MAPK. Further, TGF-β-mediated EMT was blocked both by the neutralizing integrin β1antibody and by limiting p38MAPK activity with a DNp38MAPK-β-expressing adenovirus. However, as DNIIR expressing cells are insensitive to TGF-β-mediated EMT progression, our data suggest that p38MAPK activation is necessary but not sufficient for the fibroblastic transition of NMuMG cells.We investigated TGF-β signaling in NMuMG cells expressing an inducible DNIIR gene to assess the effect of a functional reduction of TβRII expression. The NMuMG cells were used as a model system for the expression of DNIIR because TGF-β induces both growth arrest and EMT in these cells (6Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 28Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 29Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of DNIIR at higher levels limited TGF-β-induced growth inhibition and diminished transcriptional induction of the luciferase reporters in NMuMG cells (Fig. 1). Similar DNIIR expression levels were also observed to block TGF-β-mediated Smad2/3 nuclear translocation, loss of ZO-1 tight junction expression, and the conversion to a fibroblastic morphology (Fig. 2). To identify signaling pathways that may be regulated in the presence of DNIIR expression subsequent studies were performed in the presence of 5 μm ponasterone. The results in Fig. 3suggested that expression levels of DNIIR sufficient to desensitize the NMuMG cells to TGF-β-induced Smad2 and AKT activation still permitted TGF-β stimulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation. This result was consistent with the results of Chin et al. that showed TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK phosphorylation in cells expressing another cytoplasmically truncated construct of TβRII (30Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their expression of the mutant TβRII construct did not inhibit TGF-β induction of p38MAPK-mediated pro-α (1Brown L.A. Yang S.H. Hair A. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7985-7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) collagen I mRNA expression in mesangial cells (30Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since DNIIR expression was not able to rescue TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK phosphorylation in T47D cells, we speculate that a fraction of the receptor tetramer-ligand complex on the cell surface of NMuMG cells may include a combination of DNIIR as well as endogenous type I and type II receptors. Thus if sufficient over-expression of DNIIR was achieved in NMuMG cells one could anticipate the complete competition of TβRII and the loss of p38MAPK signaling.We demonstrated that p38MAPK activation by TGF-β is dependent on integrin β1 adhesion to ECM by examining TGF-β signaling in the presence of integrin β1-neutralizing antibody. We also found that, integrin β1-dependent adhesion was necessary for TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation in both DNIIR-expressing and -non-expressing NMuMG cells. Furthermore, our in vitrokinase results (Fig. 6) lend supportive evidence to the apparent cooperative regulation of p38MAPK by TGF-β and integrin β1. TGF-β signaling to p38MAPK is thought to be mediated through the coupling of TAK1 and TAB for the subsequent recruitment of MKK3 and MKK6 and activation of p38MAPK (31Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Analogously the transient integrin-mediated activation of p38MAPK upon cell attachment on collagen I is mediated by Rac1-stimulated PAK association with MKK3 and MKK6 (19Mainiero F. Soriani A.

Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A potential mechanism for the cooperation of integrins and activated TGF-β receptor complexes may be their co-localization in caveolar vesicles (33Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 34Thorne R.F. Marshall J.F. Shafren D.R. Gibson P.G. Hart I.R. Burns G.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6727-6738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that integrin-dependent adhesion to ECM regulates scaffolding proteins that bring the signaling intermediaries together.The microscopy results in Fig. 8 illustrate that blocking either integrin β1 stimulation or inhibiting p38MAPK kinase activity can abrogate TGF-β-mediated EMT. Blocking integrin β1 caused a phenotypic change independent of TGF-β that is possibly unrelated to p38MAPK activity. This was evident since the integrin β-neutralizing antibody alone resulted in the loss of ZO-1 junctional localization. There is recent evidence showing integrin β1 co-localization together with apical tight junction-associated ZO-1 and occludin proteins (36Tafazoli F. Holmstrom A. Forsberg A. Magnusson K.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5335-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The disruption of this association may explain our result. Alternatively, the neutralizing antibody may cause a loss of cell polarity. E-cadherin, an epithelial marker localized at adherence junctions, was not affected by blocking integrin-β1 adhesion. Although the role of integrins in the maintenance of cell-cell junctions is not entirely clear and further complicates the interpretation of these results, it is evident that p38MAPK activity and integrin adhesion are necessary for TGF-β-induced EMT.In conclusion we have presented data indicating that TGF-β can stimulate p38MAPK activation at a lower functional TβRII threshold than the activation of Smad2 and AKT. Furthermore, TGF-β-dependent p38MAPK activation is dependent on integrin β1-ECM interactions and TGF-β-induced epithelial cell EMT is both p38MAPK activation- and integrin-β1-mediated. Taken together these data suggest that functional TβRII dosage as well as cooperative signaling between the TGF-β receptor and integrins may influence the phenotypic fate of epithelial cells in vivo. TGF-β1 has emerged as a multifunctional cytokine involved in autocrine and paracrine mediation of development, proliferation, wound healing, and pathologic processes (1Brown L.A. Yang S.H. Hair A.

This result was consistent with the results of Chin et al. that showed TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK phosphorylation in cells expressing another cytoplasmically truncated construct of TβRII (30Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their expression of the mutant TβRII construct did not inhibit TGF-β induction of p38MAPK-mediated pro-α (1Brown L.A. Yang S.H. Hair A. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7985-7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) collagen I mRNA expression in mesangial cells (30Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since DNIIR expression was not able to rescue TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK phosphorylation in T47D cells, we speculate that a fraction of the receptor tetramer-ligand complex on the cell surface of NMuMG cells may include a combination of DNIIR as well as endogenous type I and type II receptors. Thus if sufficient over-expression of DNIIR was achieved in NMuMG cells one could anticipate the complete competition of TβRII and the loss of p38MAPK signaling.We demonstrated that p38MAPK activation by TGF-β is dependent on integrin β1 adhesion to ECM by examining TGF-β signaling in the presence of integrin β1-neutralizing antibody. We also found that, integrin β1-dependent adhesion was necessary for TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation in both DNIIR-expressing and -non-expressing NMuMG cells. Furthermore, our in vitrokinase results (Fig. 6) lend supportive evidence to the apparent cooperative regulation of p38MAPK by TGF-β and integrin β1. TGF-β signaling to p38MAPK is thought to be mediated through the coupling of TAK1 and TAB for the subsequent recruitment of MKK3 and MKK6 and activation of p38MAPK (31Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Analogously the transient integrin-mediated activation of p38MAPK upon cell attachment on collagen I is mediated by Rac1-stimulated PAK association with MKK3 and MKK6 (19Mainiero F. Soriani A.

A potential mechanism for the cooperation of integrins and activated TGF-β receptor complexes may be their co-localization in caveolar vesicles (33Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G.

Another possibility is that integrin-dependent adhesion to ECM regulates scaffolding proteins that bring the signaling intermediaries together.The microscopy results in Fig. 8 illustrate that blocking either integrin β1 stimulation or inhibiting p38MAPK kinase activity can abrogate TGF-β-mediated EMT. Blocking integrin β1 caused a phenotypic change independent of TGF-β that is possibly unrelated to p38MAPK activity. This was evident since the integrin β-neutralizing antibody alone resulted in the loss of ZO-1 junctional localization. There is recent evidence showing integrin β1 co-localization together with apical tight junction-associated ZO-1 and occludin proteins (36Tafazoli F. Holmstrom A. Forsberg A. Magnusson K.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5335-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The disruption of this association may explain our result. Alternatively, the neutralizing antibody may cause a loss of cell polarity. E-cadherin, an epithelial marker localized at adherence junctions, was not affected by blocking integrin-β1 adhesion. Although the role of integrins in the maintenance of cell-cell junctions is not entirely clear and further complicates the interpretation of these results, it is evident that p38MAPK activity and integrin adhesion are necessary for TGF-β-induced EMT.In conclusion we have presented data indicating that TGF-β can stimulate p38MAPK activation at a lower functional TβRII threshold than the activation of Smad2 and AKT. Furthermore, TGF-β-dependent p38MAPK activation is dependent on integrin β1-ECM interactions and TGF-β-induced epithelial cell EMT is both p38MAPK activation- and integrin-β1-mediated. Taken together these data suggest that functional TβRII dosage as well as cooperative signaling between the TGF-β receptor and integrins may influence the phenotypic fate of epithelial cells in vivo. The extracellular microenvironment plays a critical role in the ability of an epithelial cell to transition to a more plastic phenotype. This is exemplified by the influence that TGF-β and ECM components have one basic epithelial cell functions such as the morphology, polarity, and adhesion through TGF-β receptors and integrin function. Based on the common downstream signaling molecules and overlapping cellular consequences induced by TGF-β and integrins, we hypothesized that there may be cooperation between the two pathways in EMT. We utilized an inducible system expressing DNIIR in mammary epithelial cells and employed an integrin β1 antibody to explore potential cross-talk between the two cell surface receptors. Effectively limiting TβRII activity by the induction of DNIIR expression was able to block TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, SMAD-mediated transcriptional activation, and EMT. TGF-β-induced Smad2, and AKT phosphorylation was blocked by the expression of DNIIR. Yet, the induced expression of the cytoplasmically truncated TβRII at the levels that blocked the other measured responses did not block TGF-β-mediated p38MAPK activation. The potential for a lower TβRII threshold for p38MAPK activation was indicated by the results using cells with a TβRII null background, T47D. Blocking integrin-β1-mediated adhesion resulted in the inhibition of TGF-β-mediated activation of p38MAPK. Further, TGF-β-mediated EMT was blocked both by the neutralizing integrin β1antibody and by limiting p38MAPK activity with a DNp38MAPK-β-expressing adenovirus. However, as DNIIR expressing cells are insensitive to TGF-β-mediated EMT progression, our data suggest that p38MAPK activation is necessary but not sufficient for the fibroblastic transition of NMuMG cells. We investigated TGF-β signaling in NMuMG cells expressing an inducible DNIIR gene to assess the effect of a functional reduction of TβRII expression. The NMuMG cells were used as a model system for the expression of DNIIR because TGF-β induces both growth arrest and EMT in these cells (6Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A.

The expression of DNIIR at higher levels limited TGF-β-induced growth inhibition and diminished transcriptional induction of the luciferase reporters in NMuMG cells (Fig. 1). Similar DNIIR expression levels were also observed to block TGF-β-mediated Smad2/3 nuclear translocation, loss of ZO-1 tight junction expression, and the conversion to a fibroblastic morphology (Fig. 2). To identify signaling pathways that may be regulated in the presence of DNIIR expression subsequent studies were performed in the presence of 5 μm ponasterone. The results in Fig. 3suggested that expression levels of DNIIR sufficient to desensitize the NMuMG cells to TGF-β-induced Smad2 and AKT activation still permitted TGF-β stimulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation.

Aptamers are typified by high affinity and specificity for their cognate proteins (reviewed in Refs. 29Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev.

Ellington A.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 5-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be considered as oligonucleotide analogs of antibodies. However, as nucleic acids, aptamers are fundamentally distinct from antibodies. In having small size (8–15 kDa) relative to antibodies (150 kDa), aptamers are candidates for rapid tumor penetration and blood clearance. These are useful attributes for noninvasive diagnosis of disease (32Hicke B.J. Stephens A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 923-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may provide advantages over antibodies and fragments thereof, which demonstrate slower tissue penetration and clearance rates. To identify an aptamer for investigation of tumor-targeting and blood clearance properties, we describe herein a SELEX process to identify TN-C aptamers and then focus attention on a single aptamer, TTA1. The SELEX process uses large (1014-1015sequences) oligonucleotide pools to identify binding species,i.e. aptamers, to a variety of purified molecular targets. In addition to generating aptamers against purified proteins/small molecules, SELEX technology can generate aptamers to cells (33Morris K.N. Jensen K.B. Julin C.M. Weil M. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2902-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and tissues. 2A. Stephens, personal communication. 2A. Stephens, personal communication. The advantages of complex targets include freedom from the need to define and purify a molecular target, and presentation of proteins in native folding and glycosylation states. For complex SELEX experiments, identifying optimal selection conditions is theoretically possible (34Vant-Hull B. Payano-Baez A. Davis R.H. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 579-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but remains a challenging task. In contrast, selection against purified protein allows ready experimental manipulation to achieve optimal enrichment of high-affinity aptamers (35Irvine D. Tuerk C. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 739-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and requires no deconvolution to identify the cognate protein (or lipid, oligosaccharide, nucleic acid, etc.). Relative to cells and tissues, purified proteins often exhibit lower nonspecific binding of nucleic acids, and therefore selections proceed more rapidly. Because each has advantages, we elected to use both purified protein and cells as target sources to obtain TN-C ligands. A previous SELEX experiment targeting U251 glioblastoma cells identified a DNA aptamer that binds to tenascin-C, 3H. Chen and D. Daniels, personal communication. 3H. Chen and D. Daniels, personal communication. demonstrating that TN-C is a selectable target on U251 cells. The ssDNA aptamer displays greatly reduced binding affinity at physiological temperatures, 4B. Hicke, data not shown. 4B. Hicke, data not shown. perhaps because these initial cell SELEX experiments were performed at 4 °C. Thus the aptamer has relatively low affinity (Kd∼100 nm) at 37 °C and, being composed of DNA, is susceptible to nuclease activity in vivo. These features render the DNA aptamer unsuitable for in vivo applications. To identify aptamers for use as tumor-targeting agents, we undertook SELEX experiments at 37 °C using a nuclease-stabilized 2′-F pyrimidine oligonucleotide library. U251 cells, derived from a human glioblastoma, were obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility Tumor Repository and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit, Ft. Collins, CO) to 90% confluency on tissue culture-treated polystyrene. Viability was checked using trypan blue staining. Human TN-C (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; other sources were inferior in purity and activity) was stored as frozen aliquots at −80 °C. After thawing, preparations could be stored for at least 2 months at 4 °C without loss of aptamer binding activity. Purified recombinant tenascin-C fragments (36Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Harold P. Erickson, Duke University. Human and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were obtained from Sigma. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon (Alameda, CA), and aptamer synthesis was performed at NeXstar Pharmaceuticals as described (37Wincott F. DiRenzo A. Shaffer C. Grimm S. Tracz D. Workman C. Sweedler D. Gonzalez C. Scaringe S. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Specialty phosphoramidites were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA; (CH2CH2O)6 = Spacer 18; hexylamine; 3′dT polystyrene support), JBL Laboratories (San Luis Obispo, CA; 2′-F C and 2′-F U), or Proligo (Boulder, CO; PAC-protected 2′-OCH3-G, rG, and rA). 5′-amine-containing oligonucleotides were conjugated to succinimidyl biotin (Pierce) in 30% dimethyl formamide, 200 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, at 25 °C for 15 min and purified on polyacrylamide gels. Alternatively, aptamer transcripts were 5′-biotinylated using a method described elsewhere. 5United States Patent No. 60/034,651 filed January 8, 1997. In brief, transcription of DNA templates is initiated with a 5-fold excess of a modified GMP over GTP in order to efficiently place a unique biotin on the 5′ end of the transcript. The modified GMP bears a hexyl amine moiety on the 5′ position that has been conjugated to biotin using the succinimidyl chemistry described above. These procedures were generally performed as described (38Fitzwater T. Polisky B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To prepare the initiating random library, double-stranded transcription templates were prepared by Klenow fragment extension of 40N7a ssDNA: 5′-TCGCGCGAGTCGTCTG(40N)CCGCATCGTCCTCCC-3′. The reverse complement of this sequence is the “sense” strand, representing the fixed sequences that span the random regions shown for individuals in Fig. 5. This was done using the 5N7 primer: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGACGATGCGG-3′, which contains the T7 polymerase promoter (underlined). The32P-body labeled library was prepared with T7 RNA polymerase; all transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 2′-F pyrimidine nucleotides and 2′-OH purine nucleotides. For cell selections, U251 cells were grown to 90% confluence on 150-mm-diameter tissue culture plates and washed three times with 10 ml of binding buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with MgCl2 and CaCl2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.05% bovine serum albumin). 1500 pmol of 32P body-labeled library was then incubated with the cells in 10 ml of binding buffer for 45 min with gentle shaking. Unbound oligonucleotides were removed using seven washes (10 min each) of 10-ml binding buffer, typically removing >99% of input radioactivity. A final 20–40-min wash of 5 ml included 10 mm EDTA that caused U251 cells to detach. Cells were pelleted (5 min at 300 × g) and the supernatant removed (the EDTA elution). Plates were then treated with 1 ml of Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the remaining cells/extracellular matrix were removed using a cell scraper. To form the final Trizol elution, pelleted cells from the EDTA elution were added to the Trizol extraction from the plate. After the first round of selection, the EDTA elution pool and Trizol elution pools were kept separate. In the Trizol arm, EDTA-sensitive aptamers were eluted and discarded before Trizol elution. All washes and incubations were at 37 °C in binding buffer. For EDTA elutions, the sample was extracted three times with a 1:1 mixture of phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform. To recover additional radioactivity, organic phases were back-extracted with 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and an additional volume of chloroform. Nucleic acid was then precipitated twice using 2 m NH4OH and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. For the Trizol elution, an additional 0.2 volume of chloroform was added to facilitate phase separation. The aqueous phase was then extracted twice with phenol:chloroform and once with chloroform and then treated with 5–10 μg of RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C to degrade contaminating cellular RNA (the aptamers are resistant to RNase A by virtue of 2′-F-modified pyrimidines). Organic phases were back-extracted as described for the EDTA elution. To precipitate nucleic acids, 0.25 volume of 0.8 m sodium citrate, 1.2m sodium chloride was added along with 0.25 volume of isopropanol. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and transcription were performed as described (38Fitzwater T. Polisky B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two synthetic primers, 5N7 (see above) and 3N7a (5′-TCGCGCGAGTCGTCTG-3′), were used for RT-PCR. To monitor aptamer pool complexity, renaturation rates were measured as described (39Charlton J. Smith D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These procedures were performed as described (40Drolet D.W. Jenison R.D. Smith D.E. Pratt D. Hicke B.J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 1999; 2: 271-278PubMed Google Scholar). For each round, 96-well Lumino plates (Labsystems, Needham Heights, MA) were coated for 2 h at room temperature with 200 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing tenascin-C. Control wells lacked tenascin-C in this initial coating step. After being coated, the wells were blocked using HBSMC buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 g/liter human serum albumin) for rounds 1–5. For rounds 6–8, wells were blocked with HBSMC buffer containing 1 g/liter casein (I-block; Tropix). This switch of blocking agent was performed to decrease background binding of aptamer pools to the plate surface. Binding and wash buffer consisted of HBSMC buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. The aptamer pool was diluted into 100 μl of binding buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the protein-coated wells. After binding, six washes of 200 μl each were performed. The wells were then emptied and placed on top of a 95 °C heat block for 5 min (“heat elution”). Standard avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV)-reverse transcriptase reactions (50 μl) were performed at 48 °C directly in the well, and the reaction products were utilized for standard PCR and transcription reactions. Cloning and sequencing used standard procedures. To measure aptamer pool binding, U251 cells were grown to confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates (Falcon 3047, Becton Dickinson). After the cells were washed with binding buffer,32P body-labeled aptamer pools were incubated with cells in binding buffer for 40 min at 37 °C. Unbound radioactivity was removed by aspiration, and two 10-s washes were performed. Trizol was used to collect bound cpm, which were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For SPR, aptamer pools were 5′-biotinylated (described above) and immobilized to a streptavidin-containing surface (SA chip, BIACORE 2000, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at a level of ∼1000 response units. Running buffer was HBSMC containing 0.005% Tween 20 (P20, Biacore AB). A reference flow cell for each experiment consisted of a random sequence oligonucleotide pool. Kinetic constants for TN-9 binding to TNfbg (the bacterially expressed fibrinogen-like domain) were determined using standard methods (41Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 42Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filter partitioning assays were performed as described (43Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7692) Google Scholar). Briefly,32P end-labeled oligonucleotides at 0.5 × 10−10m were incubated with increasing concentrations of TN-C in HBSMC buffer + 0.01% (w/v) human serum albumin at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were then filtered over nitrocellulose, and bound cpm were quantitated. Data were fit to obtain binding constants as described (44Green L.S. Jellinek D. Jenison R. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Janjic N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14413-14424Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To measure binding of aptamers to protein immobilized on plates, anti-tenascin-C monoclonal antibodies (mTN12, mouse TN-specific, Sigma; HxBO6, human TN-specific, Harold Erickson, Duke University) were adsorbed to MicroLite-2 96-well plates (Dynex Technologies) in HBSMC buffer for 18 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed four times with HBSMC buffer and blocked using 200 μl of HBSMC buffer + 0.1% (v/v) I-block (Tropix) for 2 h at 22 °C. Tenascin-C was then captured by incubation with serum-free medium from cells expressing mouse TN-C (3t12, ATCC) or human TN-C (U251, described above) for 18 h at 4 °C. After six washes with 200 μl of HBSMC buffer containing 0.1% I-block and 0.05% Tween 20 (HBSMCIT buffer), 150 μl of 5′-biotinylated aptamer was incubated with each well for 30 min at 37 °C. This was followed by three washes of 10 s each (aptamers tend to have rapid on and off rates relative to antibodies) with HBSMCIT buffer, incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 3–5 washes in HBSMCIT. Bound aptamer/streptavidin-AP complexes were quantified by chemiluminescent detection using CSPD/Sapphire (Tropix/ABI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 700 μl of disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate, 1.2 ml of Sapphire were added to 10 ml of diethanolamine buffer, and 150 μl of the solution was added to each well. After 15 min at 22 °C in the dark, chemiluminescence was detected using a luminometer (LB 96P, Berthold, Nashua, NH). To identify aptamers to TN-C, a tripartite SELEX experiment was carried out as diagrammed in Fig. 1. In the first arm, purified TN-C was used. The second arm consisted of selection against a TN-C-expressing glioblastoma cell line, U251. This arm was subdivided into EDTA and Trizol “elutions” to recover bound aptamers. A third arm was a crossover from cell selections onto purified protein selections. Human TN-C was adsorbed to polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates. To initiate selections, a random aptamer pool consisting of 1014oligonucleotides was generated using RNA polymerase. The oligonucleotides contained 2′-F pyrimidines and 2′-OH purines with a 40-nucleotide random sequence region flanked by fixed sequences for RT-PCR. Selections were performed according to Drolet et al.(40Drolet D.W. Jenison R.D. Smith D.E. Pratt D. Hicke B.J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 1999; 2: 271-278PubMed Google Scholar), essentially consisting of protein-oligonucleotide incubations, washes to remove unbound oligonucleotides, and RT-PCR amplification of the bound oligonucleotides. The amounts of protein with each well in a 96-well plate and the amount of input RNA are indicated in TableI.Table ITenascin-C, tumor cell, and crossover SELEX procedures: RNA and protein inputTenascin-C SELEX experimentRoundpmol protein/wellpmol RNA/well112 (6 wells)200 (6 wells)21220031220041220052336233723380.23.3Tumor cell SELEX experimentRoundPlate diameterpmol RNA/platemmE1/T12 × 1501500E2/T21501500E3/T31501500E4/T41501500E5/T51501500E6/T61501500E7/T71501500E8/T81501500E9/T91501500Crossover SELEX experiment: cells to Tenascin-CRoundpmol protein/wellpmol RNA/wellE9P1/T9P1233E9P2/T9P2233For the purified protein selections, protein input into each well represents the quantity of protein incubated with each well for adsorption, which was then incubated in buffer with the indicated quantity of RNA.

For the tumor cell SELEX experiment, U251 glioblastoma cells were grown to confluence in tissue culture plates for each round. Open table in a new tab For the purified protein selections, protein input into each well represents the quantity of protein incubated with each well for adsorption, which was then incubated in buffer with the indicated quantity of RNA. Decreases in protein and RNA input occurred as the pool affinities improved. For the tumor cell SELEX experiment, U251 glioblastoma cells were grown to confluence in tissue culture plates for each round. A qualitative assessment of PCR amplification indicated that background binding of the RNA pools to polystyrene without associated tenascin-C (“no protein” control) was increasing through the initial five rounds. At round 6, the blocking agent was switched from human serum albumin to casein, which resulted in dramatically decreased aptamer pool binding to the no protein control wells. Progress was quantitated by measuring the affinity of 32P-labeled aptamer pools for TN-C using a nitrocellulose filter capture assay (45Yarus M. Berg P. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 450-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After five rounds, a slight improvement in binding was evident. Coincident with the switch in blocking agent, the amount of TN-C binding in the aptamer pool rose dramatically in round 6. By round 8, affinity had increased at least 1000-fold to an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 3 × 10−9m. As no further affinity improvement was evident in the subsequent round, selection was deemed complete at round 8. A second experiment used human U251 glioblastoma cells as the target source. These cells construct an ECM containing abundant TN-C (46Ventimiglia J.B. Wikstrand C.J. Ostrowski L.E. Bourdon M.A. Lightner V.A. Bigner D.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 36: 41-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence and incubated with 1014 sequences of a random oligonucleotide pool (identical to that described above) at 37 °C for 1 h. After extensive washing, a final wash buffer containing 10 mm EDTA was applied to elute EDTA-sensitive aptamers. Because nucleic acid structures and nucleic acid-protein interactions often utilize divalent cations, it was expected that EDTA would elute a subset of cell-bound aptamers. The cells were solubilized, nucleic acids were extracted using Trizol™, a reagent that combines chaotropic denaturation of proteins with organic extraction of nucleic acids, and then the remaining aptamers were collected. Thus the EDTA served to elute a subset of bound aptamers, and the subsequent Trizol elution collected all remaining aptamers along with cellular RNAs. Aptamers from both EDTA and Trizol elutions were amplified by RT-PCR and transcribed, closing the first round of this SELEX experiment. Unlike the purified protein SELEX experiment, cell and input RNA concentrations remained constant throughout nine rounds of selection (Table I). The progress of the cell selections was monitored by measuring the binding of radiolabeled aptamer pools to U251 cells. To analyze the EDTA elution SELEX experiment, Fig.2A compares binding of a control aptamer pool to rounds 3, 5, and 9. The control aptamer pool bound the cells detectably, and binding was saturable. Relative to this nonspecific binding, rounds 3, 5, and 9 showed progressively increasing binding. Similar to the EDTA elution pools, the Trizol pools showed increased binding compared with a random aptamer pool (Fig. 2B). The T9 (Trizol round 9) pool showed less apparent binding than the T5 pool. This was due to increased binding to the polystyrene surface (data not shown). This outcome suggests that Trizol-eluted aptamers bound to the polystyrene surface, directing selective pressure away from cell binding and toward polystyrene binding. The cell binding analysis demonstrated pool evolution toward U251 binding. However, this analysis did not fully evaluate the progression of the tumor cell SELEX experiment; this is because a pool of low-affinity ligands for an abundant protein would show higher cell binding than a pool of high-affinity ligands for a rare protein. For many applications, the latter pool is desirable. Therefore we employed another measure of progression, aptamer pool complexity, which can be estimated by measuring nucleic acid renaturation rates (Cot analysis) (39Charlton J. Smith D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Decreasing pool complexity serves as a proxy for convergence upon a high-affinity solution. The Cot analysis predicted that the E9 pool would contain ∼100 different oligonucleotide sequences, whereas the T9 pool would contained ∼50,000 sequences (data not shown). Taken together, the cell binding andCot analyses indicated that EDTA was more effective than Trizol in driving pool convergence toward cell binding. To determine whether the U251 aptamer pools contain TN-C aptamers, binding was investigated using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. Aptamer pools were biotinylated at the 5′ terminus and immobilized, via streptavidin, onto the surface"

We report that primary cells from PARP-1−/− animals are impaired in κB-dependent transcriptional activation induced by different stimuli involved in inflammatory and genotoxic stress signaling. PARP-1 was also required for p65-mediated transcriptional activation. PARP-1 enzymatic inhibitors did not inhibit the transcriptional activation of a κB-dependent reporter gene in wild type cells. Remarkably, neither the enzymatic activity nor the DNA binding activity of PARP-1 was required for κB-dependent transcriptional activation in PARP-1−/− cells complemented with different PARP-1 mutants. However, PARP-1 interacted in vitro directly with both subunits of NF-κB (p50 and p65), and mapping of the interaction domains revealed that both subunits bind to different PARP-1 domains. Furthermore, a PARP-1 mutant lacking the enzymatic and DNA binding activity interacted comparably to the wild type PARP-1 with p65 or p50. Finally, we showed that PARP-1 is activating the natural inducible nitric-oxide synthase and P-selectin promoter in a κB-dependent manner upon stimulation of the cells with inflammatory stimuli or cotransfection of p65. Our results provide evidence that neither the DNA binding nor the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 but its direct protein-protein interaction with both subunits of NF-κB is required for its coactivator function, thus expanding the role of PARP-1 as an essential and novel classical transcriptional coactivator for κB-dependent gene expression in vivo.

PARP-1, originally named positive cofactor 1 (PC1) (3Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), is the best understood example of these (4D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). So far four additional PARPs were identified as follows: PARP-2, PARP-3, vault-PARP, and the tankyrase (5Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 6Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J.

Strikingly, the homology between these proteins is limited to the C-terminal half of PARP-1, whereas they all differ in their N-terminal portion. PARP-1 is a nuclear chromatin-associated protein of which one molecule is present per 1000 base pairs of DNA that detects specifically DNA strand breaks (4D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In response to DNA strand damage caused by environmental genotoxic agents and endogenous cellular reactions, PARP-1 is activated by DNA strand breaks and initiates an energy-consuming cycle by transferring ADP-ribose units from NAD+ to nuclear proteins, including PARP-1 itself (4D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The result of this process is a rapid depletion of the intracellular NAD+ and ATP, which leads to cellular dysfunction and death (8Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that such a cellular suicide mechanism is responsible for cellular injury in response to oxygen-derived free radicals NO and peroxynitrite (9Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 10Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Wong H. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 350-358PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of PARP-1 is still under heavy debate. From studies using pharmacological inhibitors of PARP, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been suggested to regulate gene expression and gene amplification, cellular differentiation, malignant transformation, cellular division, DNA replication, as well as apoptotic death (1Althaus F.R. Richter C. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 1-237PubMed Google Scholar, 4D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

However, recent studies using cells from PARP-1−/− mice have failed to demonstrate a role for PARP-1 in most of the suggested cellular processes, although it appears that PARP-1 has an important role in maintaining genomic stability (12Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,13Wang Z.Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M.

In addition, studies using these PARP-1−/− mice showed that PARP-1−/− mice were protected against myocardial infarct, stroke, streptozotocin-induced diabetes, neuronal damage induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine, as well as LPS-induced septic shock, indicating that PARP-1 is involved in the regulation of the pathogenesis of these events (14Kuhnle S.

However, the clarification of the physiological role of PARP-1 requires further study.NF-κB encompasses a family of inducible transcription factors including p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB (reviewed in Ref. 17May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These proteins share a conserved 300 amino acid region within their amino termini, termed Rel homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and interaction with heterologous transcription factors. They exist as homo- or heterodimers with a wide range of DNA binding and activation potentials. Although all Rel family members bind to DNA, only p65, c-Rel, and RelB contain a transactivation domain. The prototypical form, NF-κB, is a heterodimer consisting of the two subunits p50 and p65 (18Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5539) Google Scholar). In most unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive transcription factor in a complex with one of the several inhibitors of NF-κB (IκBα, -β, or -ε) (19Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 20Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4041) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with extracellular stimuli leads to the rapid phosphorylation of IκB that results in ubiquitination of IκB and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome pathway. Dissociation of NF-κB unmasks nuclear localization sequences of the p65 and p50, which leads to nuclear translocation and binding of NF-κB to specific κB consensus sequences in the chromatin and activation of specific subsets of genes (20Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4041) Google Scholar). The stimuli include cytokines such as interleukin-1 or TNF-α, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), phorbol esters, UV light, γ-irradiation, or potent oxidants (21Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3411) Google Scholar). The NF-κB response occurs in virtually all cell types, in combination with a variety of coactivators. Therefore, it is no surprise that the genes activated by NF-κB will also vary depending on which other activators are present in the cell (22Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NF-κB plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (23Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4567) Google Scholar). NF-κB has additionally been implicated as an important regulator of cellular events such as cell proliferation and apoptosis and to be associated in neurodegenerative processes (24Grilli M. Memo M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Grilli M. Memo M. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in p50−/− mice ischemic damage is drastically reduced (26Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which leads to the idea of a cell death-promoting role of NF-κB in ischemia and injury. On the other hand, there is emerging data that NF-κB may counteract cell death in global ischemia (24Grilli M. Memo M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 27Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Wellmann H. Volk B. Kaltschmidt C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9409-9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Our group and others (28Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 29Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) have provided earlier evidence that PARP-1 might be required in vivo for specific κB-dependent gene expression. We showed that κB-dependent transcriptional activation was severely affected in immortalized PARP-1−/− cells after treatment of the cells with TNF-α, etoposide, and UV-C. We have found that the nuclear translocation was not affected in PARP-1−/− cells and that PARP-1 was forming an immunoprecipitable nuclear complex with the large subunit p65 of NF-κB. The molecular mechanism of PARP-1 contribution for κB-dependent gene expression was not clear.In the present study, we extended the list of substances unable to induce NF-κB in primary PARP-1−/− fibroblasts. Expression of p65 in primary PARP-1−/− fibroblasts resulted in severely reduced activation of a κB-dependent promoter. Furthermore, we investigated to what extent the enzymatic and the DNA binding activity of PARP-1 are required for κB-dependent transcriptional activation. Experiments with enzymatic inhibitors and complementation experiments of primary PARP-1−/− fibroblasts with expression plasmids expressing different forms of PARP-1 surprisingly revealed that the transcriptional coactivation of PARP-1 was taking place independently of its enzymatic activity or its ability to bind DNA. However, biochemical experiments confirmed that PARP-1 interacts directly with both subunits of NF-κB, and mapping of the interaction domains revealed that both subunits are interacting with different domain of PARP-1. Finally, we provide evidence that PARP-1 regulates together with NF-κB the gene expression of the natural iNOS and P-selectin promoter. Together our results provide strong evidence that PARP-1 is truly functioning as a specific transcriptional coactivator and thus provide an explanation of why PARP-1−/− animals are protected against different NF-κB-dependent diseases such as septic shock and epithelial dysfunction in diabetes type I.DISCUSSIONGrowing experimental evidence suggests that PARP-1 can function as a repressor or coactivator of transcription factors. Our initial observations revealed that immortalized PARP-1−/− cells show a defect in κB-specific transcriptional activation in vivo and that PARP-1 is forming a complex with NF-κB (28Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Here we have corroborated the molecular details of this initial observation. We showed that different proinflammatory or genotoxic substances lacked the ability to induce NF-κB in primary PARP-1−/− cells. Simultaneous expression of PARP-1 and p65 in primary PARP-1−/− fibroblasts results in synergistic activation of a κB-dependent reporter gene. Transfection experiments with inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 confirmed that the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 is not required in vivo for κB-dependent gene expression from a transiently transfected or integrated reporter gene. Complementation experiments of PARP-1−/− cells with a PARP-1 expression plasmid lacking both the DNA binding and enzymatic activity confirmed that PARP-1 does not have to bind to DNA for the activation of basal κB-dependent gene expression. Neither were both PARP-1 activities required when κB-dependent gene expression was activated by p65 overexpression or induced by proinflammatory (such as TNF-α and LPS) or genotoxic substances (etoposide, UV-C, or CPT). We further showed that PARP-1 interacts in vitro directly with both subunits of NF-κB through different domains. Finally, we showed that PARP-1 is necessary and sufficient for κB-dependent transcriptional activation of the iNOS and P-selectin promoter induced either by p65 overexpression or in response to TNF-α and LPS.The observations that complementation of PARP-1−/− cells with wild type PARP-1 restored the basal as well NF-κB-dependent gene expression induced by different proinflammatory or genotoxic substances implicate that PARP-1 is playing a critical and central role downstream of two completely different signaling pathways. The hypothesis is further strengthened by the fact that p65-mediated gene expression is also dependent on PARP-1 (Fig. 1 B) and exclude that PARP-1 is involved in the activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade as recently proposed (36Le Page C. Sanceau J. Drapier J.C. Wietzerbin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these experiments provide evidence that PARP-1 cannot be replaced by the other isoforms of PARP-1 such as PARP-2 or PARP-3.PARP-1 was recently identified by Meisterernst and co-workers (3Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as an active component of upstream factor stimulatory activity-derived cofactor PC1 that could increase the specificity of the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription (37Slattery E. Dignam J.D. Matsui T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5955-5959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies (38Kretzschmar M. Meisterernst M. Scheidereit C. Li G. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have suggested that full activation of transcription by NF-κB in cell-free systems required a crude upstream factor stimulatory activity coactivator fraction in addition to general initiation factors. PARP-1/PC1 was thought to provide an architectural function together with the other upstream factor stimulatory activity-derived positive cofactors PC3/Dr2/topoisomerase I and PC4/single-stranded DNA-binding protein in stabilizing the preinitiation complex (40Kaiser K. Meisterernst M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 342-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). p65 has also been reported previously to interact directly through its transactivation domain with other coactivators (42Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), the TATA box-binding protein, and several TATA box-binding protein-associated factors (39Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 43Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions of p65 might also explain why overexpression of p65 in PARP-1−/− cells resulted in reduced but still detectable gene expression (see Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, PARP-1 is found to be associated with regions actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II in undamaged cells (44Desnoyers S. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 159: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PARP-1 increases the transcriptional activity of several transcription factors (39Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H.

Transcription factors such as retinoid X receptor and AP-2 were reported to tightly associate with PARP-1in vivo (46Kannan P., Yu, Y. Wankhade S. Tainsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 47Miyamoto T. Kakizawa T. Hashizume K. Mol. Cell.

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of transcription factors could prevent both their binding to DNA and the formation of active transcription complexes (4D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). NF-κB was recently reported to be modified by PARP-1, and this modification was negatively affecting its DNA binding activity (49Kameoka M. Ota K. Tetsuka T. Tanaka Y. Itaya A. Okamoto T. Yoshihara K. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We could, however, neither confirm ribosylation of NF-κB in vitro or in vivo using different preparations of PARP-1 or an antibody against ADP-ribose polymers (data not shown) nor could we observe a decreased NF-κB DNA binding activity after treatment of primary fibroblasts with PARP-1 inhibitors such as 3AB and 2,3-Bis(2-pyridyl)quinoxaline (data not shown). Our observation is furthermore strengthened by a recent report (50Soriano F.G. Virag L. Szabo C. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showing that a specific PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 did not affect DNA binding of NF-κB.Reports (36Le Page C. Sanceau J. Drapier J.C. Wietzerbin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have also described an inhibitory effect of benzamide and nicotinamide on the expression of other κB-dependent genes in PARP-1−/− mice, implying that PARP-1 enzymatic activity is playing a role in κB-dependent gene expression. Since our results do not confirm that the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 is required for κB-dependent transcriptional activation, we hypothesize that the inhibitory effect observed with benzamide and nicotinamide on κB-dependent gene expression may be mediated by other proteins, since these substances exert also other effects (51Heine H. Ulmer A.J. Flad H.D. Hauschildt S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4899-4908PubMed Google Scholar).The observation that PARP-1 DNA binding activity is not required for κB-dependent gene expression provides additional evidence that transcriptional coactivation by PARP-1 is not caused by DNA nicks in the transfected plasmids or near the integrated reporter gene, which would tether PARP-1 randomly to the enhancer elements, but that PARP-1 is fulfilling its coactivator function through specific protein-protein contact to both subunits of NF-κB. Together, PARP-1 might therefore not only act as a bridging factor but may also function synergistically with other cofactors in stabilizing the interactions between NF-κB and the basal transcription machinery, thereby facilitating the formation and subsequent activation of the preinitiation complexin vivo. Whether PARP-1 is interacting directly with components of the basal transcription machinery or other coactivators of NF-κB remains to be determined.Our results implicated that NF-κB together with PARP-1 is responsiblein vivo for the activation of the iNOS and P-selectin which has been implicated in several diseases (9Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 10Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Wong H. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 350-358PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is supported by the observation of different groups (16Pieper A.A. Brat D.J. Krug D.K. Watkins C.C. Gupta A. Blackshaw S. Verma A. Wang Z.Q. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 29Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R.

Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that showed that gene expression of different κB-dependent genes such as iNOS, P-selectin, the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and TNF-α is suppressed in PARP-1−/− mice. The fact that PARP-1−/− mice do not show the same phenotype as p65−/− animals indicate that only a subset of κB-dependent genes are PARP-1-dependent and that the requirement of PARP-1 for κB-dependent gene expression may be dependent on the tissue and development stage-specific expression of PARP-1.Bacterial membrane component LPS, when injected into mice, causes a shock-like state leading to death. The mechanism by which LPS induces endotoxic shock is related to its ability to activate the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors, enabling the expression of several critical genes involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock (23Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4567) Google Scholar). These results explain the extreme resistance of PARP-1−/− mice to lethality induced by LPS (14Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. Wendel A. Leist M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Brain injury induces a cascade of signaling events that stimulate NF-κB activation in injured neurons and in injury-responsive glial cells. Data from studies using mice lacking the p50 subunit of NF-κB suggest that, overall, NF-κB is playing a dual role in ischemic neuronal death. Whereas activation of NF-κB in neurons increases their survival after a stroke, activation of NF-κB in microglia promotes ischemic neuronal degeneration (53Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar).Diabetic patients frequently suffer from endothelial dysfunction and vascular alterations. Endothelial cells incubated in high glucose exhibited production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species by the nitric oxidase that gene expression is regulated by NF-κB. The high level of oxygen species consequently resulted in single strand DNA breaks, PARP-1 activation, and associated metabolic impairment (50Soriano F.G. Virag L. Szabo C. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Our results provide evidence that PARP-1 is a novel and essential transcriptional coactivator of NF-κB in vivo in response to different stimuli and implicate the following model (Fig. 7). Upon activation of cells after septic shock, stroke, or streptozotocin-induced diabetes type I, NF-κB is induced and activates in concert with PARP-1 certain genes (such as iNOS and P-selectin). The enzymatic and DNA binding activities of PARP-1 are not required for this process. The ability of several expressed gene products to activate NF-κB results in a persistent activation of NF-κB (Fig. 7 A). The cellular iNOS induction results on the other hand in an increase of intracellular NO up to a micromolar concentration (54Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In comparison, the two other isoforms, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase which are constitutively activated in neuronal and endothelial cells, synthesize NO only in the nanomolar concentration (55de la Torre J.C. Stefano G.B. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 34: 119-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). NO is converted into a cytotoxic derivative, peroxynitrite. The high concentration of peroxynitrite induces a high number of DNA damage that leads to an excessive activation of PARP-1 and a depletion of cellular energy resulting in mitochondrial free radical generation and cell necrosis that finally leads to enhanced systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, or neurodegeneration (Fig. 7 B). Thus, PARP-1 may regulate cell necrosis at two levels, first through its coactivator function for NF-κB and second by depleting the intracellular NAD+ and ATP. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 improves the adverse clinical effects in different pathologies associated with inflammation after cell death (56Szabo C. Dawson V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Since the enzymatic and DNA binding activities are not required for κB-dependent transcriptional activation after treatment of cells with proinflammatory or genotoxic substances, we propose that the observed anti-inflammatory effects of the PARP-1 inhibitors do not influence PARP-1 coactivator function but inhibit the NAD+ and ATP depletion and subsequently also cell necrosis and tissue damage. The mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1)1 belongs to a large family of enzymes"
https://openalex.org/W2060328944,"α-Synuclein (αS) is a pre-synaptic protein that has been implicated as a possible causative agent in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Two autosomal dominant missense mutations in the αS gene are associated with early onset PD. Because αS is found in an aggregated fibrillar form in the Lewy body deposits characteristic of Parkinson's patients, aggregation of the protein is believed to be related to its involvement in the disease process. The wild type (WT) and early onset mutants A30P and A53T display diverse in vitro aggregation kinetics even though the gross physicochemical and morphological properties of the mutants are highly similar. We used high resolution solution NMR spectroscopy to compare the structural and dynamic properties of the A53T and A30P mutants with those of WT αS in the free state. We found that the A30P mutation disrupts a region of residual helical structure that exists in the WT protein, whereas the A53T mutation results in a slight enhancement of a small region around the site of mutation with a preference for extended conformations. Based on these results and on the anticipated effects of these mutations on elements of secondary structure, we proposed a model of how these two PD-linked mutations influence αS fibril formation that is consistent with the documented differences in the fibrillization kinetics of the two mutants. α-Synuclein (αS) is a pre-synaptic protein that has been implicated as a possible causative agent in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Although the precise cellular function of αS remains obscure, a number of recent observations have highlighted its relevance to human pathology. Among those are genetic studies identifying several European kindred with heritable early onset PD that carry polymorphisms within the coding region of the αS gene resulting in one of two amino acid substitutions, A53T or A30P (5Polymeropoulos M.H.

Further substantiation of the role of αS in PD arose from the finding that antibodies to αS epitopes decorate Lewy bodies extracted from affected brain regions of PD patients (7Arima K. Mizutani T.

Additional connections between αS and other neurological diseases continue to accumulate (4Kruger R. Muller T. Riess O. J. Neural Transm. 2000; 107: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For instance αS reportedly binds to and induces the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) of Alzheimer's disease (14Yoshimoto M. Iwai A. Kang D. Otero D.A. Xia Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9141-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Jensen P.H. Hojrup P. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen L. Olesen O.F. Gliemann J. Jakes R. Biochem.

The fact that aggregated αS is a major component of Lewy bodies in the brains of PD patients suggests that some aspect of αS aggregation may be relevant to PD pathology. The fibrillar morphology of aggregated αS for both the WT and the PD-linked mutants is generally similar to that found in Lewy bodies extracts (17Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mutations do not exert their pathological effects by changing the structural characteristics of the mature fibril state. In contrast, the rates of oligomer and fibril formation do differ among the αS variants (17Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat.

Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the kinetics of αS aggregation may be coupled to the toxic event(s) leading to early onset of disease. However, the appealingly simple hypothesis that accelerated fibril formation leads to early onset PD is apparently at odds with in vitro observations demonstrating that A30P fibrils take longer to form than WT fibrils (23Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Whereas in vivo fibril formation rates may differ from those observedin vitro, evaluation of this possibility awaits experiments in intact cellular or animal models comparing WT and mutant αS aggregation kinetics. Because neither differences in mature fibril morphology nor in the rate of formation of mature fibrils provides a ready explanation of how αS mutations are linked to PD etiology, a hypothesis has emerged that some oligomeric state of αS preceding the mature fibril may be the relevant toxic agent (24Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In vitro kinetics data indicate that αS probably populates several intermediate conformations, both monomeric and oligomeric (17Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 25Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), on the pathway to the mature fibril form, and pre-fibrillar αS oligomers have also been visualized using atomic force microscopy (23Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar), providing candidates for the hypothetical toxic species. The PD-linked mutations A53T and A30P apparently alter the transition rates between the various intermediates along the fibril formation pathway and may therefore lead to a build up of a potentially toxic oligomeric intermediate, without necessarily accelerating the formation of mature αS fibrils. This model reconciles the apparent link between αS aggregation and disease with the observation that the rate of in vitro mature fibril formation is not itself a good predictor of pathogenicity. A thorough understanding of αS fibril formation will require the characterization of all states of the reaction process and the transitions that link them. In the present work we focus on the starting point of the process, the free monomer state of WT, and the PD-related mutants of αS. The free monomer is largely unstructured (26Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) and therefore not amenable to classical crystallographic or NMR structure determinations. However, NMR techniques can still be used to ascertain the structural properties of such proteins on a residue-by-residue basis (see for example Ref. 27Yao J. Chung J. Eliezer D. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3561-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our previous NMR study of the free WT protein revealed interesting secondary structural propensity near the site of the A30P PD mutation (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mutations may modulate structural or dynamic properties of the free protein and thereby influence the intermolecular interactions required for the aggregation process. Here we use NMR to study the effects of PD-linked mutations on the residual structure and dynamics of free monomeric αS. Our results reveal that the secondary structure of the free disordered state of WT αS is, in fact, altered by the disease-linked mutations A30P and A53T. Moreover, the effects of the two mutations differ significantly. The A30P mutation strongly attenuates the helical propensity found in the N-terminal region of WT αS, whereas the A53T mutation leaves this region unperturbed, exerting a more modest and local influence on structural propensity. We present an interpretation of these results that suggests how the PD-linked mutations may enhance production of an oligomeric (potentially toxic) pre-fibrillar intermediate. The dynamic properties of the αS backbone reveal several distinct regions of modestly differing flexibility. An increased degree of slow motions in the N-terminal region of the WT protein appears well correlated with the residual helical propensity that was observed previously (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In the acidic C-terminal region a short segment containing several hydrophobic and proline amino acid residues and preceding a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site also exhibits an increase in slower motions. Somewhat surprisingly, the central hydrophobic region of αS (residues 61–95) corresponding to the non-amyloid β-component (NAC) peptide, which is found in Alzheimer's amyloid plaques (29Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) and which interacts with the Aβ peptide in vitro (30Han H. Weinreb P.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), is relatively flexible with respect to the rest of the protein. Plasmids containing constructs for WT and mutant αS under control of the T7 promoter were generously provided by Dr. Peter Lansbury (Harvard Medical School). Proteins were expressed and purified, and NMR samples were prepared at 100 μm protein concentration in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, as described previously (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). All NMR data were collected at 10 °C using a Varian Unity INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer. Triple resonance data for backbone resonance assignments were acquired as for the wild type (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), with typical spectral widths being 5,400-Hz in the direct dimension, 1,600-Hz in the nitrogen dimension, 1,100-Hz in the carbonyl dimension, 10,000-Hz for the Cα, Cβ dimension, and 3,400-Hz for the Cα dimension, and acquisition times ranged from 36 to 96 h, depending on the sensitivity of the experiment in question, with 1,024 complex data points acquired in the direct dimension and 64 complex data points in each indirect dimension. Despite the low protein concentration, adequate signal to noise was achieved because the flexible nature of the αS backbone (see below) leads to narrow, relatively intense resonances. Data were processed using the program nmrPipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar). Because quantitative comparisons of peak heights and chemical shifts among different spectra were required, the same processing protocol was used for all spectra where possible. We employed a processing scheme that maximizes the number of resolved peaks while retaining adequate sensitivity to resolve broadened peaks. Spectra were apodized with a 54° shifted sine-squared function and digitally filtered with a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian matched filter to sharpen resonances in the directly detected 1H dimension. Following Fourier transformation of the direct dimension, linear prediction of the15N dimension was used to double the number of15N points. In the relaxation experiments, a total of 92 resonances (of a possible 135 non-proline residues in αS) was adequately resolved in each of the three measurements (R 1, R 2, NOE), whereas the remainder were excluded from the analysis. Processed spectra were analyzed using the program NMRview (33Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). Assignments and Cα chemical shifts were obtained using the same set of triple resonance experiments used in our previous study of the WT protein (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Duplicate triple resonance spectra collected on different samples of all three αS variants, prepared identically but months apart, showed that the Cα chemical shifts are generally reproducible to better than 0.2 ppm with a few deviations as large as 0.4 ppm. Secondary shift values reported here are the differences between the measured Cα chemical shift and the empirical random coil value for the appropriate amino acid type (34Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). To estimate the degree of helical propensity in contiguous segments of αS, two methods based on Cα chemical shifts were used. In the first method the observed Cα secondary shifts were normalized by the empirically determined secondary shift expected for that residue type in a fully helical conformation (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), summed, and normalized by the number of residues in the segment. In the second method, the Cα secondary shifts were averaged and then normalized by the average (over all residue types) Cα secondary shift for residues in fully helical conformations. The two estimates were in good agreement. NMR 15N relaxation data were acquired with modern versions of pulse sequences based on those described by Farrow (36Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar),incorporating pulsed field gradients to reduce the solvent signal, to correct for imperfections in π pulses and to filter coherence transfer pathways prior to detection. Data were collected using a spectral width of 5,400 Hz with 1,024 complex points in the direct dimension and a spectral width of 1,600-Hz with 64 complex points in the nitrogen dimension. R 1 andR 2 data were collected for a total of about 36 h each. Spectra used for R 1 analysis were collected using relaxation delay times in the following order (in ms): 10, 1800, 20, 1280, 40, 640, 80, 320, 160, 10, 640, and 80.R 2 data were measured using a pulse sequence employing a Carr Purcell Meiboom Gill pulse train with the following relaxation delays (in ms): 14.4, 115.2, 28.8, 86.4, 43.2, 57.6, 14.4, 115.2, 460.8, and 230.4. Duplicate spectra were collected at several time points to facilitate error estimation. The delay between π pulses in the Carr Purcell Meiboom Gill pulse train of theR 2 measurements was 990 μs. For determination of R 1 (spin-lattice) andR 2 (spin-spin) relaxation rates resonance heights were extracted and fit as a function of the relaxation delay time using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fitting routines in NMRview (33Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). The relaxation rates were extracted by fitting to a two-parameter exponential model of the data, because adding a third (constant) parameter to the model did not significantly improve the fitting statistics. Steady state NOE values are reported as the ratio of peak heights in paired spectra collected with and without an initial period (4 s) of proton saturation during the 5-s recycle delay. The acquisition time for each individual spectrum was 12 h, and four pairs of spectra (total of 96 h) were collected for each sample. The variance of the pairwise ratios was used to estimate the experimental uncertainty. The reduced spectral density formalism (37Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 38Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Szabo A. Torchia D.A. Kay L.E. J. Biomol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was used to analyze further the αS relaxation data. This mathematical approach makes no assumptions about the microscopic details of the atomic motions (37Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and appears to be more suitable for analyzing unstructured proteins than the model free formalism (40Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3395) Google Scholar, 41Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1872) Google Scholar) that assumes that the motion of the protein is adequately described by two rotational correlation times, one global and a second describing local motions. Given the lack of stable global structure of free αS (26Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), the notion of an overall rotational correlation time becomes problematic (39Lefevre J.F. Dayie K.T. Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Spectral densities were calculated using in-house code-setting chemical shift anisotropy equal to −170 ppm (42Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and the amide bond length equal to 1.02 Å (37Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The input relaxation rates and corresponding uncertainties were determined using NMRview fitting routines and a standard error propagation assuming uncorrelated random errors was used to obtain the final uncertainties. We previously observed (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) that residues 18–31 of free WT αS display positive Cα secondary shifts indicative of a significant preference for helical secondary structure. This contiguous region is long enough to accommodate multiple helical turns signaling the presence of transiently populated helical conformations. A quantitative analysis of the Cα secondary chemical shifts in this region (see “Material and Methods”) indicates that, on average, helical conformations are populated approximately 10% of the time. Presumably these are in rapid exchange with non-helical conformations. A similar structural analysis of Cα secondary shifts of PD-associated mutants A53T and A30P (Fig.1) reveals that these two mutations have qualitatively different effects on structural preferences in the free state. A striking result is that the helical propensity of residues 18–31 found in the WT is absent in A30P (Fig. 1 b), with an average population of α-helical conformation (calculated as above) of zero. In contrast, the A53T mutation (Fig. 1 c) leaves the helical character of this region intact. Instead, A53T exhibits a slightly enhanced (but still very weak) local preference for extended, β-sheet-like conformations around the site of the mutation. As expected, secondary chemical shifts distant from mutation sites are similar in all variants studied. This observation is consistent with the interpretation that αS is largely disordered in the free state and that mutations have no global effects on the structural properties of the protein. In addition to residues 18–31, the Cα secondary shifts of the entire N-terminal region of αS that is believed to adopt helical structure upon lipid binding (residues 1–100 (28Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 43Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34393-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar)) exhibit a slight bias toward the helical (positive) direction (Fig. 1). In the acidic C-terminal domain, the secondary Cα shifts are more evenly distributed around zero but with short negative stretches that may be indicative of small regions of extended bond angles, possibly suggesting β-turn-like conformations. The relaxation rates of backbone 15N amide magnetization are a function of backbone motions, particularly those that occur at linear combinations of the Larmor frequencies of the nuclei involved (45Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 243-300Google Scholar). As a result, measurements of 15N relaxation rates can provide information on protein mobility and dynamics, particularly in the ps-ns time scale. The longitudinal (spin-lattice) and transverse (spin-spin) relaxation rates, as well as the steady state NOE, of resolved resonances in the proton-nitrogen correlation spectra of both WT αS and the two mutants are shown in Fig. 2. The steady state NOE is most sensitive to faster motions, and R 2 is most sensitive to slower motions on the relevant (ps-ns) time scale, whereasR 1 is typically somewhat less informative (46Eliezer D. Chung J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Typical values of the NOE and R 2 parameters for residues in the core of well structured proteins are around 0.8 and 10 s−1. Lower values of the NOE parameter are indicative of a greater degree of fast motions, whereas higher values ofR 2 indicate a greater degree of slower motions. Clearly, the relaxation parameters observed for all three αS variants indicate a much greater mobility than that found in well structured proteins and are consistent with previous results indicating that all three variants are predominantly unfolded. Nevertheless, some degree of heterogeneity is present in the data. The first noteworthy feature is a peak in the WT R 2 data around residue 20 that is reasonably well correlated with the stretch of transient helical structures indicated by the Cα secondary shifts. An additional feature is a peak in the R 2 data of all three variants around residue 122. This region includes several proline and hydrophobic residues and immediately precedes a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site at Tyr-125. Finally, the central hydrophobic region of the protein (residues 61–95), which corresponds to the NAC peptide that is found as a minor component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (29Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), exhibits a slight decrease in both NOE andR 2 values. This region of αS exhibits the most pronounced hydrophobic character within the protein, and interestingly the pattern of the R 2 values in this region closely matches its hydrophobicity pattern. The spectral density functions of each αS variant at each of three different frequencies, J(0), J(ωN), andJ(0.87·ωH), are shown in Fig.3. The spectral density function is the Fourier transform of the time correlation function of bond vector orientation and describes the relative amount of NH bond vector fluctuations that occur at a given frequency. Thus, this treatment of the data allows a more direct evaluation of the relative degree of motions at the three different frequencies or time scales. Typically, the spectral densities show a high degree of fidelity to the relaxation rates from which they are derived, with J(0) closely correlating to R 2, J(ωN) toR 1, and J(0.87·ωH) to the heteronuclear NOE. This is the case here as well, and the features observed in the relaxation parameters are also evident in the spectral density data. The discovery of a genetic link between PD and αS has made it clear that αS can play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the majority of PD cases occur in individuals who carry the WT αS gene. It seems likely then that the familial early onset mutations emphasize or enhance some property that is already inherent in WT αS. To date, the only observable effect of these mutationsin vitro has been to alter the fibrillization kinetics of the protein. When combined with the observation that"

In this report, we demonstrate that the CD44-binding domain of OPN involves a region containing amino acid residues from 121 to 140 and that both threonine and serine at positions 137 and 147, respectively, are essential for the survival stimulatory effect of OPN. Substitution of either residue with alanine results into a dominant negative mutant that overrides the survival effect of IL-3. Upon binding to the CD44 receptor, the wild-type OPN but not the inactive mutant induces activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt. Last, we demonstrate that two waves of Akt activation are detected in IL-3-treated cells and that the survival promoting effect of OPN is mediated predominantly through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.

Lee F. Miyajima A. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar).

The α subunit is primarily responsible for cytokine binding, whereas the β subunit is mainly used for signal transduction (1Arai K. Lee F. Miyajima A. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev.

Osteopontin (OPN) is an acidic phosphoprotein that is secreted by osteoblasts, macrophages, cardiac fibroblasts, activated T cells, and many other cell types (16Denhardt D.T. Guo X.

Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Many cellular processes, including cell attachment, spreading and migration, homing of lymphocytes, and other hematopoietic cells and vascular remodeling are thought to involve OPN binding to its cell surface receptors (16Denhardt D.T.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Using OPN-null mutant mice as a model system, OPN was demonstrated to have a role in the growth or survival of metastatic cells (23Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Liaw L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5206-5215PubMed Google Scholar), tissue remodeling (24Liaw L. Birk D.E. Ballas C.B. Whitsitt J.S. Davidson J.M. Hogan B.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the type-1 immune response (25Ashkar S. Weber G.F. Panoutsakopoulou V. Sanchirico M.E. Jansson M. Zawaideh S. Rittling S.R. Denhardt D.T. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 2000; 287: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these activities of OPN remain largely unclear. By use of a PCR-based subtraction cloning approach, we have previously identifiedosteopontin to be a gene induced by the membrane-distal region of the β subunit between amino acids 573 and 755 of the human GM-CSF receptor (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that, in response to stimulation with IL-3 or GM-CSF, OPN is induced and released into the medium of cultured cells and that, through binding to the cell surface receptor CD44, it contributes to the survival activities of these two cytokines (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into OPN's mechanism of action in cytokine-triggered cell survival response, in this report, we have undertaken a structure-function study of the OPN molecule. We demonstrate that both threonine and serine at positions 137 and 147, respectively, are essential for the survival promoting effect of OPN and that substitution of either amino acid residue with alanine results in a dominant negative mutant that overrides the survival effect of IL-3 on IL-3-dependent cells. We further show that, via binding to the CD44 receptor, the wild-type OPN but not the inactive mutant activates the PI3K/Akt (PKB) kinase cascade and activation of the latter signaling pathway plays a major role in the survival promoting effect of OPN in IL-3-dependent cells. Ba/F3 is a murine IL-3-dependent pro-B-cell line and was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% conditioned medium (CM) from WEHI-3B cells as a source of IL-3. The αβ755 and αβ573 derivatives of Ba/F3 cells have been described previously (13Chao J.-R. Wang J.-M. Lee S.-F. Peng H.-W. Lin Y.-H. Chou C.-H. Li J.-C. Huang H.-M. Chou C.-K. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y.

The αβ755 cells behave like Ba/F3 cells overexpressing the wild-type hGM-CSF receptors (αβwt) and are capable of synthesizing OPN and fully resistant to apoptosis in medium containing either mIL-3 or hGM-CSF (13Chao J.-R.

DNAkt-9h and -27h are two clones of Ba/F3 derivatives stably overexpressing the dominant negative mutant of Akt, AktK179M (27Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Neo is a mixture of Ba/F3 cells transfected with an empty expression vector (pCDNA3, Invitrogen). Both DNAkt-9h and -27h cells are more susceptible to IL-3 removal-induced apoptosis than the parental cells (Ref. 28Wang J.-M. Chao J.-R. Chen W. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 8below). Ba/F3Akt*-A1 and Ba/F3Akt*-D2 are two clones of Ba/F3 derivatives which stably overexpress the constitutively active form of the Akt protein as previously described (28Wang J.-M. Chao J.-R. Chen W. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary IL-3-dependent cells were isolated essentially as described by Rodriguez-Tarduchy et al. (29Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was flushed from the femurs of BALB/c mice with RPMI 1640 and cultured for 48 h in the same medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% CM from WEHI-3B cells. Then, the cells remaining in suspension were separated from the adherent population and maintained in medium containing 20 units/ml murine IL-3 (mIL-3) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 10 to 14 days before analysis. For all experiments described in the text, unless otherwise indicated, the recombinant mIL-3 and hGM-CSF (Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) were used at concentrations of 10 units/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively. CHOP is a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing the polyoma virus large T antigen (30Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by James W. Dennis (Mt. Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada). CHOP cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The mouse OPN expression vector (pcDNA3-OPN-HA) has been previously described (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This vector directed the synthesis of OPN fused at its COOH terminus with the HA tag (LDMYPYDVPDYASSPG). The expression vectors encoding the OPN/T123A, OPN/T132A, OPN/T137A, OPN/S147A, and OPN/S156A mutants were constructed by standard PCR-assisted mutagenesis-coupled cloning methods. The template used for PCR amplification was pcDNA3-OPN-HA. The first PCR reaction was performed with the antisense primer (5′-AGAGGTGAGGTCCTCATC-3′) together with one of the following mutant primers (underlined nucleotides denote those differ from the wild type sequences): OPN/T123A (5′-GAGACCGTCGCTGCTAGTACAC-3“), OPN/T132A (5′-GACACTTTCGCTCCAATCGTCC-3′), OPN/T137A (5′-ATCGTCCCTGCAGTCGATGTCC-3′), OPN/S147A (5′-CGAGGTGATGCCTTGGCTTA-3′), and OPN/S156A (5′-AGGTCAAAGGCTAGGAGTTTC-3′). The second PCR reaction was performed with the sense primer: 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGAGATTGGCAGTGATT-3′ and the PCR fragments obtained from the first PCR reaction. The resultant EcoRI-AvaII cDNA fragments together with the AvaII-ApaI fragment from the pcDNA-OPN-HA vector were ligated into the EcoRI andApaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The identities of all OPN mutants in these expression vectors were confirmed by direct sequencing. CHOP cells were transiently transfected with various OPN expression vectors by liposome-mediated gene transfer as previously described (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, the pre-formed DNA-lipid complex (12 μg of DNA mixed with 25 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.)) was added to 106 cells cultured in a volume of 10 ml that had been seeded 1 day earlier. After incubation for 4 h in serum-free medium, the transfected cells were incubated for 24 h in regular growth medium. The latter was then removed, filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size filter, and used as CM for the various assays as described. Immunoblotting assay with OPN-specific antibody (R & D Systems) indicated that under the same transfection conditions, except for the S156A mutant, the wild-type OPN and various other mutants present in the CM were all expressed at a very similar level (see Fig. 1 B, below). With antibody immunodepletion assay, we have previously demonstrated that the survival promoting activity of CM from cells transfected with the wild type vector was entirely due to the presence of OPN in the CM (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The survival stimulatory effect of OPN was analyzed essentially as previously described (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, αβ573 cells which lost the ability to synthesize OPN in growth medium containing hGM-CSF were cultured in the presence or absence of CM (30%, v/v) from CHOP cells transiently transfected with wild type or mutant OPN expression vectors. At various times after culturing, the number of viable or apoptotic cells was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method or with an ELISA cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. To examine the dominant negative effect of the mutant protein, CM containing wild-type OPN was first mixed with CM (1:1) from CHOP cells transfected with mutant OPN or GFP expression vector prior to being added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 50% (v/v). Cell lysates or CM from CHOP cells transiently transfected with various OPN expression vectors were subjected to immunoblot analysis as previously described (13Chao J.-R. Wang J.-M. Lee S.-F. Peng H.-W. Lin Y.-H. Chou C.-H. Li J.-C. Huang H.-M. Chou C.-K. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4883-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μg of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with antibodies to OPN (R & D Systems) or to HA tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse IgG and an ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of the activation status of the AKT (PKB) protein, cells to be analyzed were lysed in the lysis buffer for the PI 3-kinase assay (see below) and equal amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibody specific to the active form of AKT (phospho-Akt Ser473) or to all forms of Akt (both from Cell Signaling Technology). Cells (107) to be analyzed were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed on ice with 1 ml of lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 2 mm orthovanadate). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (UBI, clone 4G10) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex after brought down with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (0.5% LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6), and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The immune complex was then mixed with 10 μl of 2 mg/ml PI (phosphatidylinositol, Sigma) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 40 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 μm ATP, and 5 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1n HCl and the mixture was extracted with 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The lipid was spotted onto potassium oxalate (1%)-treated TLC plate and the plate developed by chromatography in CHCl3, MeOH, 4 m NH4OH (9:7:2). The radiolabeled lipid was visualized by autoradiography. To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of the OPN-CD44 signaling in the survival pathway of IL-3, we first undertook a structure-function analysis of the OPN molecule. We have previously reported that mutant OPN lacking the internal region between amino acid residues 79 and 140 (BOPN Δ79–140) is completely devoid of the survival stimulation activity (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region of the OPN molecule may contain a domain(s) important for activation of the CD44 receptor. To examine this possibility, the peptide competition experiment was first carried out. In this experiment, the standard assay for demonstrating OPNs survival promoting activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” was performed in the presence of various amounts of synthetic peptides covering amino acid residues 81–100, 101–120, 121–140, or 143–147 (GRGDS) of the mouse OPN molecule. As illustrated in Table I, among different peptides tested, the peptide covering residues 121 to 140 inhibited wild-type OPNs activity most effectively (ID50, 20 μm), suggesting that this region of OPN is involved in binding to the CD44 receptor.Table IInhibition of OPN activity by synthetic peptidesName of peptideID501-aDose required to inhibit 50% of OPNs growth promoting activity in the standard assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”μmAA1-bSynthetic peptides covering amino acid residues 81–100, 101–120, or 121–140 of the mouse OPN.81–10085AA 101–120190AA 121–14020GRGDS1801-a Dose required to inhibit 50% of OPNs growth promoting activity in the standard assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b Synthetic peptides covering amino acid residues 81–100, 101–120, or 121–140 of the mouse OPN. Open table in a new tab A sequence alignment of OPN from mouse, rat, and human species (31Craig A.M. Smith J.-H. Dendardt D.T. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) revealed that 7 amino acid residues in the region covering positions 121–140 are highly conserved (Fig.1 A, underlined residues). Of these 7 residues, three threonines at positions 123, 132, and 137 were each mutagenized into alanine by the standard site-directed mutagenesis approach and the survival promoting activities of these mutants were compared with that of the wild-type protein. Fig. 1 B shows that mutation at position 123 or 132 did not significantly affect OPNs activity, whereas mutation at position 137 completely abolished the survival promoting activity of OPN. As a comparison, mutants with mutations that fall outside of the putative receptor-binding domain were also generated. The serine residues at positions 147 and 156 were randomly selected and were each mutagenized into alanine. Unexpectedly, the S147A mutant completely lost activity, whereas the S156A still manifested full activity even though its expression level was much lower than that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Taken together, these results indicate that Thr137 and Ser147 are both essential for the survival promoting activity of OPN. As shown in Table I, the GRGDS peptide did not significantly inhibit OPNs activity until a much higher dose (ID50, 180 μm) was applied in the assay. This result suggests that the GRGDS residues at positions 143–147 may not be involved in direct contact with the CD44 receptor. This result further suggests that the inactive mutant S147A may still retain a full receptor binding ability and may even exert a dominant negative effect on the wild-type molecule. To test this possibility, conditioned medium from CHOP cells transiently transfected with the S147A mutant was added to the standard OPN activity assay as described in Fig. 1. Fig.2 shows that indeed the S147A mutant completely abolished wild-type OPNs activity (panel A). Unexpectedly, under the same conditions, the other inactive mutant T137A whose mutation falls in the putative receptor-binding domain also exerted a dominant negative effect on the wild-type molecule, albeit its inhibitory effect was weaker than that of S147A (Fig. 2,panel B; see “Discussion”). Blocking the OPN-CD44 pathway by neutralizing antibodies to OPN or CD44 inhibits the survival promoting activity of IL-3 (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We next examined whether these two dominant negative mutants could achieve a similar blocking effect. Fig. 3 shows that the S147A mutant effectively overrode the survival activity of IL-3 both in αβ573 cell line (panel A) and in primary IL-3-dependent cells (panel B). Consistent with results shown above, the T137A mutant that had a weaker dominant negative effect on the wild-type protein was less effective in blocking the survival activity of IL-3 (Fig. 3, panels A andB). We have previously demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt (PKB) pathway plays an important role in the survival activity of IL-3 in Ba/F3 cells (28Wang J.-M. Chao J.-R. Chen W. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next tested whether OPN also mediated its survival promoting activity through activation of this survival pathway. Out of five independent experiments, we consistently observed that, under our experimental conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), the wild-type OPN but not the S147A mutant stimulated activation of PI3K (Fig. 4, panel A) and Akt (Fig. 4, panel B) with a strength that was ∼40% of that achieved by IL-3. Furthermore, OPN induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in Ba/F3 cells was mediated through the CD44 receptor, because this activation effect was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with neutralizing antibody to CD44 (clone KM114, Fig.5) but not to integrin αVsubunit (αV, Fig. 5).Figure 5OPN activates PI3K and Akt through CD44 but not integrin αV-containing receptors. αβ573 cells were treated essentially as described in the legend to Fig. 4 except that specific antibodies as indicated ontop of the figure were added to cells 1 h prior to stimulation with OPN for 10 min. After treatments, cells were lysed and the cell lysates were analyzed for PI3K activity (panel A) or for the activation status of the Akt kinase (panel B) as described in the legend to Fig. 4. KM114 and αV are neutralizing antibodies to CD44 and integrin αV subunit, respectively (both from Pharmingen). “r” and “h” refer to isotype-matched control IgG for KM114 and αV, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the fact that the OPN gene is activated within 3 h treatment of cells with IL-3 (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that IL-3 and OPN both activate the PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. 4), we were curious to test whether two waves of Akt activation could be detected in cells stimulated with IL-3. In this experiment, both αβ755 and αβ573 cells were tested, as they all produce OPN in response to IL-3 stimulation (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, following IL-3 treatment, in both cell lines Akt activation was first observed at the 5–30-min time point and the second wave of activation appeared around the 3-h time point where the OPN gene was markedly activated by the IL-3 signaling pathway (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, upon stimulation with hGM-CSF, the two-wave activation kinetics of Akt was only observed in OPN-producing αβ755 cells, but not in αβ573 cells that, under such conditions, do not produce OPN (Fig. 6 B). We next examined whether activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway played a role in the survival activity of OPN. To address this issue, the survival promoting assay of OPN was carried out in cells pretreated with PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, or in Ba/F3 cells stably overexpressing the dominant negative mutant of Akt (DNAkt). As shown in Fig. 7, both wortmannin and LY294002 effectively (>90%) blocked OPNs anti-apoptotic activity, indicating that a majority of OPNs survival stimulatory effect is mediated through activation of PI3K. On the other hand, the survival stimulatory effect of OPN was only partially compromised in Ba/F3 derivatives stably overexpressing the dominant negative mutant of Akt (Fig.8 A). Under our experimental conditions, whereas 60–70% inhibition of cell death was achieved by OPN in control cells (Neo, Fig. 8 B, right panel), ∼30–40% inhibition was observed in cells overexpressing DNAkt (clones 9h and 27h, Fig. 8 B, right panel). Considering the fact that the S147A mutant effectively (70–90%) inhibited the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-3 (Fig. 3) and that the latter activity was mediated predominantly (>90%) through the PI3K/Akt pathway in the Ba/F3 cell system (28Wang J.-M. Chao J.-R. Chen W. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the partially inhibitory effect (30–40%) of DNAkt observed in the results shown in Fig. 8 was somewhat unexpected. To clarify this issue, we next examined whether overexpression of the constitutively active form of Akt (Akt*) would significantly reverse the inhibitory effect of the S147A mutant on the survival activity of IL-3. Fig. 9shows that a majority of the inhibitory effect of S147A on IL-3 was indeed reversed in cells stably overexpressing Akt* (clones A1 and D2). These results suggest that the partially inhibitory effect of DNAkt on OPN in the stable lines tested (Fig. 8) is likely due to incomplete inhibition of the endogenous Akt activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a major role in OPNs survival promoting activity in IL-3-dependent cells. Whether there is any other minor pathway(s) involved in this case remains to be determined. The PI3K/Akt (PKB) signaling pathway plays an important role in the survival response induced by a variety of growth factors, matrix adhesion, and oncogene transformation (27Kulik G. Klippel A.

A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the survival promoting effect of OPN in IL-3-dependent cells also involves activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. OPN protects endothelial cells from serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis via interaction with integrin αVβ3 and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (40Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-apoptotic activity of OPN in IL-3-dependent cells is mediated predominantly through interaction with the CD44 receptor (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These results suggest that OPN exert its survival activity in a cell type-specific mechanism. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by IL-3 (39 and this study) as well as by OPN, a downstream effector gene product of IL-3 (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activation kinetics of PI3-K and Akt by OPN (within 5–10 min stimulation) is very similar to that stimulated by IL-3. The weaker activation effect of OPN (Fig. 4) could be either due to an intrinsic property of the OPN-CD44 interaction or due to the limitation of our experimental conditions where the maximal effect of OPN might not yet be achieved with the amounts of conditioned medium (50%) used in the assay. Given that IL-3 induction of OPN expression occurs at a much later time point (∼3 h, see Ref. 26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that IL-3-triggered early activation of the PI3K/Akt kinase cascade is mediated through induction of OPN expression. In fact, following cytokine treatment of cells, two waves of Akt activation were observed in cells under conditions where OPN was produced (e.g.αβ755 cells stimulated with IL-3 or hGM-CSF, and αβ573 cells stimulated with IL-3), but not in the same cells when OPN expression was not induced (e.g. αβ573 cells stimulated with hGM-CSF). Our results strongly suggest that the early wave of Akt activation is mediated through the interaction between IL-3 and its receptor, whereas the second wave of Akt activation is mediated mainly through the OPN-CD44 pathway. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is crucial to the survival activity of IL-3 (28Wang J.-M. Chao J.-R. Chen W. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that IL-3-dependent cells (at least in the Ba/F3 cell system) may have evolved to adopt a positive autoregulatory mechanism by which the PI3K/Akt survival pathway can be first activated from the IL-3 receptor itself and later from its downstream effector gene product such as OPN (Fig. 10). In this way, the crucial survival signal can thus be effectively activated. Mutational studies revealed that both Thr137 and Ser147 residues are critical for OPN to assume a conformation that can activate the CD44 receptor. However, it is not clear why S147A has a prominent dominant negative effect, whereas the T137A mutant only exerts a partially inhibitory effect on OPN. One possibility is that these two mutants may differ in their ability to compete with the wild-type protein for binding to the CD44 receptor. However, more experiments including a detailed structural analysis of the wild-type OPN molecule are required to reveal the exact mechanism(s) responsible for differential properties of these two mutants. On the other hand, several post-translational variants of OPN have been identified (17Rodan G.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation status affects OPNs ability to interact with the integrin receptor (25Ashkar S. Weber G.F. Panoutsakopoulou V. Sanchirico M.E. Jansson M. Zawaideh S. Rittling S.R. Denhardt D.T. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 2000; 287: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether post-translational modification of either Thr137 or Ser147 residue (or both) is required for OPNs anti-apoptotic activity. OPN expression is increased in the blood of patients with metastatic disease (41Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Gracey C.F. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas overexpression of OPN in benign cells leads to increased metastasis (42Oates A.J. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar), reduced production of OPN by an antisense approach inhibits the tumorigenicity of transformed cell lines (43Behrend E.I. Craig A.M. Wilson S.M. Denhardt D.T. Chambers A.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 832-837PubMed Google Scholar, 44Gardner H.A. Berse B. Senger D.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2321-2326PubMed Google Scholar, 45Su L. Mukherjee A.B. Mukherjee B.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2163-2169PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that OPN has a survival promoting activity (26Lin Y.-H. Huang C.-J. Chao J.-R. Chen S.-T. Lee S.-F. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) further helps us interpret why a large variety of malignant cells have evolved to produce an increased level of OPN and have a growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the identification of S147A to be an effective dominant negative mutant of OPN implies that S147A may have a useful application in the therapy of certain types of metastatic tumor that involve deregulated expression of OPN."
https://openalex.org/W2141134151,"We have identified a third member of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family. At the protein level JAM3 displays 36 and 32% identity to JAM2 and JAM1, respectively. The coding region is distributed over 9 exons and maps to chromosome 11q25. The gene shows widespread tissue expression with higher levels apparent in the kidney, brain, and placenta. At the cellular level we show expression of JAM3 transcript within endothelial cells. Our major finding is that JAM3 and JAM2 are binding partners. Thus, JAM3 ectodomain binds firmly to JAM2-Fc. This heterotypic interaction is maintained when JAM3-Fc is used to capture Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing full-length JAM2. In static adhesion assays we show that JAM3 is unable to bind to leukocyte cell lines. This is consistent with the lack of JAM2 expression. However, using JAM2-Fc pull-down experiments in combination with polyclonal anti-JAM3 serum, we demonstrate that JAM3 is the previously uncharacterized 43-kDa counter-receptor that mediates JAM2 adhesion to T cells. Most significantly we demonstrate up-regulation of JAM3 protein on peripheral blood lymphocytes following activation. Finally we show the utility of JAM3 ectodomain as an inhibitor of JAM2 adhesion.

Dejana E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). During development, different vascular beds acquire specialized features in accord with organ function (2Garlanda C. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity extends to the type and extent of intercellular contacts that form between opposing endothelial cells (3Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 863-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This results in varying permeabilities throughout the vascular tree. For example, the blood-brain barrier shows high electrical resistance and impedes penetration of proteins, peptides, and drugs from the vasculature into the brain parenchyma (5Mayhan W.G. Microcirculation. 2001; 8: 89-104PubMed Google Scholar). This property contrasts with that of the fenestrated endothelia found for example in the kidney peritubular capillaries and ascending vasa recta, which presents a semipermeable barrier (6Michel C.C. Microcirculation. 1995; 2: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In addition to regulation of solute permeability, intercellular contacts serve to impede leukocyte egress. However, during inflammation leukocytes must pass between endothelial cells to reach the interstitial space. Selective recruitment of leukocytes is achieved by differential expression/up-regulation of adhesion molecules within the microvasculature (7Ley K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Similarly, regional expression of homing receptors facilitates lymphocyte targeting to lymphoid organs (8Wiedle G. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2001; 38: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Adhesion proteins targeted to cell-cell borders are ideally situated to participate in leukocyte emigration. The role of PECAM in this regard is well established (9Muller W.A. Randolph G.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More recently the novel junctional adhesion protein (JAM)1 has emerged as a player in this arena. Conceivably, differential expression of intercellular adhesion proteins could act as a filter to regulate leukocyte transmigration.Partial amino acid sequencing of human junctional adhesion molecule 1 was reported as early as 1995 where it was described as a 32–35-kDa membrane receptor reactive with mAb F11 in platelets (10Naik U.P. Ehrlich Y.H. Kornecki E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ability of this antibody to induce vesicular secretion and aggregation in human platelets was recorded even earlier (11Kornecki E. Walkowiak B. Naik U.P. Ehrlich Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10042-10048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not until 1998 that the complete sequence of a mouse homologue was characterized (12Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P.J. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E.

Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The term junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) stemmed from its localization at tight junctions in endothelial and epithelial cells (12Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P.J. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Participation of JAM1 in the inflammatory process was revealed by the ability of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to modulate monocyte transmigration through the vessel wall (12Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P.J. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E.

Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P. Brock T.A. J. Biol.

However, low levels of transcript are detectable within many tissues: a pattern indicative of endothelial expression. Indeed immunostaining confirms this prediction. JAM2 is detected in both large and small vessels of various tissues in addition to high endothelial venules (24Palmeri D. van Zante A. Huang C.C. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19139-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The enhanced expression within the microvasculature of the heart reflects endothelial heterogeneity. Similar to JAM1, immunolocalization defines JAM2 as a protein that is targeted to cell-cell borders (23Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P. Brock T.A. J.

Evidence that JAM2 functions as an adhesion protein is provided by capture of human T cell lines by JAM2 ectodomain. This property is mediated, at least in part by an uncharacterized 43-kDa cell surface protein (23Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34750-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In this report we describe the isolation and sequencing of yet another member to the junctional adhesion molecule family, namely JAM3. We provide conclusive evidence that JAM3 is the uncharacterized 43-kDa counter-receptor on HSB cells that mediates JAM2 interactions.RESULTSSearching of the expressed sequence tag database for sequences similar to JAM2 resulted in the assembly of a partial JAM3 transcript. The expressed sequence tags used for assembly were derived from libraries of fetal brain (AW162934), fetal liver/spleen (H71948), and retinoblastoma (BE783472, BE783711). Amplification of the JAM3 transcript was performed from fetal brain.The full open reading frame for human JAM3 is encoded by 930 bases (GenBankTM accession number AF356518) and, at the DNA level, displays 53% identity with human JAM2 and JAM1. Multiple sequence alignment of the human JAM proteins reveals 36% identity of JAM3 with JAM2 and 32% identity with JAM1 (Fig.1 A). SignalP V1.1 predicts that the JAM3 signal sequence will be cleaved after Gly30. The ectodomain possesses two Ig-like folds and sequence profiles lead us to conclude that the N-terminal domain is a V-type while the membrane proximal domain is a C2-type (26Smith D.K. Xue H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 530-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The intrachain disulfide bonds that stabilize each Ig fold are predicted between Cys53-Cys115 and Cys160-Cys219. The C2-domain also possesses 2 additional cysteine residues, Cys144 and Cys230that may form a second disulfide bridge within the fold (Fig.1 B). These residues are preserved in JAM2. Two potentialN-linked glycosylation sites are found at amino acids 104 and 192. The former is conserved only between JAM2 and JAM3 while the latter is preserved in all three adhesion molecules. The short intracellular tail consists of 46 amino acids and possesses a C-terminal binding motif for PDZ domains and a PKC phosphorylation consensus.JAM3 localizes to 11q25 and the open reading frame is interrupted by 8 introns (Table I). The sequences bordering the splice-site junctions universally follow the GT/AG rule. The open reading frame spans over ≈88 kilobases of genomic DNA. TableII compares the gene structure of the JAM family members. For all three genes, the intron separating the signal sequence is considerably larger than the others. The remaining coding exons are all found within a fairly compact region. There is remarkable conservation of gene structure and phase of introns which points to their evolutionary relationship. In the ectodomain, both immunoglobulin folds one and two of all three JAMs are encoded by multiple exons.

A more detailed examination of the brain reveals transcription throughout all areas examined (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether JAM3 is expressed in endothelial cells, we next probed mRNA derived from primary cultures of human aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells in addition to the ECV cell line (Fig. 2 C). The JAM3 transcript is clearly detectable in primary endothelial cells of both origins but was not detectable in the immortalized ECV cell line.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of JAM3 expression.

Thus we next tested the ability of immobilized human JAM3 to capture various leukocytes.

Therefore it was reasonable to assume that JAM3 would maintain this characteristic. Using purified recombinant Fc-fusion protein and immobilized JAM3 ectodomain, we were able to detect only weak binding to JAM3-Fc. This amounted to about 2-fold above nonspecific binding to mouse IgG2a or the unrelated adhesion protein, VCAM (Fig.4). However, most strikingly, when JAM2-Fc was added to the assay a very strong heterotypic interaction was apparent. JAM1 was not functional in this regard.Figure 4Direct recombinant JAM interactions in vitro. Wells (96) were coated with cleaved recombinant JAM3 ectodomain (364 nm) and probed for direct binding to equimolar concentrations of JAM3, JAM1, JAM2, and VCAM Fc fusion proteins and IgG2a.

Our previous studies with JAM2 demonstrated that an uncharacterized ≈43-kDa surface membrane protein participated in T cell (HSB) binding (23Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34750-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These observations led us to ask whether JAM3 and the 43-kDa protein were homologous.To first determine whether JAM3 was specifically expressed in T cell lines, we performed quantitative real time PCR in the various leukocytes used for adhesion. Expression levels were compared with those of JAM1 and JAM2. Consistent with the binding assay (Fig. 3), Table III shows that JAM3 is only found in the HSB and HPB-ALL T cell lines, and is absent from RAMOS, HL-60, and K562. JAM2 levels are nonexistent throughout, while JAM1 expression is particularly strong.Table IIIQuantitation of JAM transcripts in leukocytes by qrtPCRJAM3JAM2JAM1HSB0.61 ± 0.110.00 ± 0.000.39 ± 0.06HPB-ALL0.49 ± 0.170.00 ± 0.000.41 ± 0.17RAMOS0.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.37 ± 0.07HL600.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.28 ± 0.06K5620.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.001.46 ± 0.11Total mRNA was prepared from cell lines as shown and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR utilizing the 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan reagents.

Open table in a new tab To provide conclusive proof and to directly probe JAM3 at the protein level, we developed a mouse polyclonal anti-human JAM3 antibody. To test the specificity and utility of the antibody we performed flow cytometric analysis of HSB and HL-60 cells. Fig.6 shows that anti-JAM3 only labels the T cell line, consistent with transcript analysis. The data also demonstrates surface expression of JAM3 and thus its availability for binding to JAM2.Figure 6Cell surface expression of JAM3 on HSB T cells as determined by flow cytometry. The HL-60 (upper panel) and HSB (lower panel) leukocyte cell lines were incubated with 1:500 dilution of NMS and mouse anti-human JAM3 (anti-JAM3) polyclonal sera.

A representative profile (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the strong circumstantial evidence for a direct interaction between JAM2-Fc and JAM3 expressed in HSB cells, we again employed the anti-JAM3 serum. As a first step, we captured the 43-kDa HSB biotinylated membrane protein with JAM2-Fc/protein A. Interacting proteins were eluted from JAM2 at pH 9.0 and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Fig. 7 demonstrates that the anti-JAM3 serum, but not the NMS specifically precipitates the 43-kDa band.Figure 7Precipitation of JAM3 from HSB cells by JAM2-Fc. Plasma membranes from intact HSB cells were surface biotinylated and specific proteins captured with JAM2-Fc and protein A. Protein was retrieved from the complex by elution at pH 9.0, and the sample was either directly analyzed (lane 1) or subjected to a round of immunoprecipitation using anti-JAM3 serum (lane 2) or NMS (lane 3). Bands were viewed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and ECL following electrophoresis and transfer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested whether soluble JAM3 could act as a competitive inhibitor. In the first approach, JAM2-Fc was used to pull down interacting proteins in the presence or absence of excess JAM3 ectodomain. Fig. 8 A shows that the intensity of the 43-kDa band is significantly attenuated in the presence of soluble JAM3. To extend this observation and show inhibition at the level of cell adhesion, binding of JAM2-Fc to HSB cells was performed with the inclusion of soluble JAM3 in the binding buffer. Fig. 8 B shows that JAM3 is very effective at preventing JAM2 capture of HSB cells. That this inhibition was specific for the JAM2/JAM3 heterotypic interaction was confirmed by the lack of effect on VCAM adhesion, which is dependent upon integrin (29Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y.

Yet clearly JAM3 is expressed in T cell lines. This suggested that JAM3 may be regulated following T cell activation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting and activated T cells for surface expression of JAM3 protein using the polyclonal antiserum. Fig.9 is a representative experiment of six. The upper panel shows that the intensity of staining of both resting and activated T cells is fairly equivalent with preimmune serum. In contrast, a clear shift to the right occurs for activated T cells, but not resting T cells, stained with anti-JAM3 serum. This result proves that JAM3 expression is enhanced within 48 h of T cell activation.Figure 9Increased surface expression of JAM3 following activation of T cells.

Endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 is mainly expressed by endothelial cells and regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (Lassalle, P., Molet, S., Janin, A., Heyden, J.

This proteoglycan represents the major form either secreted by cell lines or circulating in the human bloodstream. Because this proteoglycan is specifically secreted by endothelial cells, we propose to name it endocan. The glycosaminoglycan component of endocan consists of a single DS chain covalently attached to serine 137. Endocan dose-dependently increased the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)-mediated proliferation of human embryonic kidney cells, whereas the nonglycanated form of endocan did not. Moreover, DS chains purified from endocan mimicked the endocan-mediated increase of cell proliferation in the presence of HGF/SF. Overall, our results demonstrate that endocan is a novel soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan produced by endothelial cells. Endocan regulates HGF/SF-mediated mitogenic activity and may support the function of HGF/SF not only in embryogenesis and tissue repair after injury but also in tumor progression.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can potentiate HGF/SF signaling. We previously described an endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM-1) that is interestingly restricted to endothelial cells and to the lung and kidney (39Lassalle P. Molet S. Janin A. Heyden J.V. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Devos R. Tonnel A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20458-20464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The synthesis and secretion of ESM-1 are up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide and down-regulated by interferon-γ (40Bechard D. Meignin V. Scherpereel A. Oudin S. Kervoaze G. Bertheau P. Janin A. Tonnel A. Lassalle P. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ESM-1 can regulate CD11a/CD18 integrin (LFA-1)-mediated activation of leukocytes through binding to the LFA-1 and its ability to inhibit ICAM-1 binding (41Bechard D. Scherpereel A. Hammad H. Gentina T. Tsicopoulos A. Aumercier M. Pestel J. Dessaint J.P. Tonnel A.B. Lassalle P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the major form of ESM-1 consists of a heavily glycosylated 165-amino acid mature polypeptides. The carbohydrate moiety of ESM-1 is a single chain of the glycosaminoglycan DS covalently linked to serine 137. ESM-1 promotes the HGF/SF-mediated proliferation of human embryonic kidney cells, in a similar way to heparin. This activity is strictly dependent on the presence of the DS chain. These findings indicate that ESM-1 may be directly and specifically involved in the regulation of HGF/SF activities. Because ESM-1 is specifically secreted by endothelial cells as a proteoglycan we propose to rename ESM-1 as “endocan.” CHO cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. SV40-transfected human endothelial cells (SV1 cells) (42Lassalle P. LaGrou C. Delneste Y. Sanceau J. Coll J. Torpier G. Wietzerbin J. Stehelin D. Tonnel A.B. Capron A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640, containing 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cell line) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. 293 cells used for the test of proliferation were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin. Proteinase K and chondroitinase ABC were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; chondroitinases B, ACI, and C were from Sigma; and heparinase III was from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Human HGF/SF was from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and heparin was from Sigma. Anti-endocan monoclonal antibodies were produced and purified as described previously (40Bechard D. Meignin V. Scherpereel A. Oudin S. Kervoaze G. Bertheau P. Janin A. Tonnel A. Lassalle P. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The full-length endocan cDNA was excised from the pCDM8 vector, purified, and inserted intoXho I-Hin dIII-digested pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The construct was transfected into CHO and 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by selection with G418 (1000 or 300 μg/ml, respectively). Stably transfected cell lines were obtained by limit dilution, and the resulting cell lines were named CHO-Endocan and 293-Endocan. Two potential O- glycosylation sites in the endocan polypeptide, serine 137 and threonine 120, were predicted by the NetOglyc 2.0 Prediction Server. The codons for serine 137 and threonine 120 in the endocan cDNA were each mutated to an alanine codon by PCR with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The resulting alanine mutations in the cDNA were confirmed by sequencing on an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). The mutated cDNAs were then transfected into 293 cells to obtain transient and stable transfectants (293-S137A/endocan and 293-T120A/endocan cell lines). The cell lines were cultured in suspension in medium without fetal calf serum (CHO-SFM II and 293-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 3–4 days in culture, the medium was collected and stored at −20 °C until use. The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 8, before application to a column (2.5 × 10 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and then eluted with a gradient of 0.8–1m NaCl in the same buffer. Collected fractions were adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and applied to an immunoaffinity column made by immobilizing an anti-endocan mAb (MEC4) on Affi-Gel Hz Hydrazide gel, following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). After washing with 0.2m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, endocan was eluted with 3 m MgCl2, concentrated, and dialyzed against the same solution using an Ultrafree 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The final material was then quantified by immunoassay for endocan, and its purity was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue or Alcian Blue staining. The nonglycosylated form of endocan (S137A/endocan) was purified in only one step by immunoaffinity chromatography. The degree of purity of WT/endocan and S137A/endocan was checked by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75/200 HR 10/30 columns (0.13 × 30 cm;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and yielded a single peak. The preparations were shown to be endotoxin-free by the limulus amebocyte lysate test (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). Eight hundred ml of spent plasma, kindly provided by the Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine (Lille, France), was first precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed against 0.2m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The dialysate was applied to a 50-ml Affi-Gel pre-column (Bio-Rad) prior to immunoaffinity chromatography, which was then performed as described above. Cells in 80-cm2 flasks were lysed by incubation in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and an anti-protease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. One μg of anti-endocan mAb (MEP19) or ICAM-1 mAb (clone 164B) was added to the cleared lysates and cell supernatants and incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Fifty microliters of anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the samples at 4 °C for 90 min, and then the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer, and then twice with PBS. The beads were resuspended in 20–40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, centrifuged, and the polypeptides separated by SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard procedures. After a blocking step, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with endocan mAb (MEP14) at 1 μg/ml, followed by a 1-h incubation with an anti-mouse Fc horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactivity was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For amino acid sequence analysis, purified endocan was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) after SDS-PAGE and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue. The protein band of 50 kDa was excised from the membrane, and the N-terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation on an ABI 473A protein sequencer. To determine the size of the glycosaminoglycan chains, purified endocan was digested with proteinase K with an enzyme:endocan ratio of 1:50 (w/w) in 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 56 °C for 3 h. The sample was then incubated overnight with 0.5 ml of DEAE-Sepharose at 4 °C. The DEAE-Sepharose was poured into a Bio-Spin chromatography column (0.5 × 3 cm; Bio-Rad) and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer. GAG chains were eluted with 1 ml of 1.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and then aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Losses of GAG chains during purification were estimated by applying untreated endocan to the same volume of DEAE-Sepharose; from an input of 120 μg, 100 μg of endocan was recovered in 1 ml of elution buffer. Thus, total endocan input to the digest was adjusted to give a final estimated GAG concentration of 200 μg/ml. Samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue or Alcian Blue staining. To determine the nature of the glycosaminoglycan substitution, purified endocan was digested with several specific enzymes, namely chondroitinase ABC (0.5 unit/mg in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 3 h), chondroitinase B (200 unit/mg in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5, at 25 °C for 2 h), chondroitinase ACI (1 unit/ml in 250 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.3, at 37 °C for 2 h), chondroitinase C (80–120 units/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C for 3 h), and heparinase III (0.1 mm calcium acetate, 1 mm sodium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7, overnight at room temperature). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 293-Endocan cells were cultured in suspension in 250 ml of 293 SFM medium until the end of the log phase of cell division. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 250 ml of fresh medium containing 5 μCi/ml d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cell supernatants were processed for the purification of endocan as described above, in two steps including DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography followed by immunoaffinity chromatography. This yielded a specific activity of 24,000 cpm/μg of endocan. The 3H-labeled GAG chains were released from endocan by β-elimination with 50 mm NaOH, 1 mNaBH4 at 45 °C for 24 h. After neutralization with 1 m acetic acid, the GAG was precipitated by addition of 3 volumes of ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate at −20 °C. The GAG precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol, re-centrifuged, air-dried, and then re-dissolved in water. To remove some residual 3H-labeled small oligosaccharides (probably O- linked glycosylation), the sample was applied to a 0.5-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose and washed with PBS. The GAG chains were step eluted with 1 ml of 1.5m NaCl. The sample was then desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated in distilled water and concentrated by centrifugal evaporation. [3H]GAG chains (40,000 cpm) were exhaustively digested to disaccharides with two additions of 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 24 h. Digests were boiled and centrifuged to remove protein and then diluted to 1 ml with distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. Samples were applied to a 5-μm Hypersil (0.46 × 25 cm; ThermoQuest, Runcorn UK) strong anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography column equilibrated in water pH 3.5. After a wash with pH 3.5 water, the disaccharides were resolved over a linear gradient of 0–0.4m NaCl, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and counted for radioactivity. The3H-labeled disaccharides were identified by comparison with the elution positions of known CS/DS and heparan disaccharide standards monitored by on-line UV detection at 232 nm. Analyses were performed on duplicate enzyme digests. [3H]GAG chains (50,000 cpm) were exhaustively digested with either chondroitinase ACI (40 mIU in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) or chondroitinase B (8 mIU in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). Digests were initiated with half the enzyme and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, followed by the addition of the second enzyme aliquot and incubation for a further 2 h. Digests were then boiled and centrifuged to remove the protein, and the cleared supernatants were applied to a Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration column (1 × 170 cm) equlibrated with 0.1 m NaCl and run at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and counted for radioactivity. The V o and V tvalues of the column were determined with undegraded GAG and sodium dichromate, respectively. The percentage of galactosaminyl bonds cleaved by each of the specific enzymes was calculated from the distribution of 3H radiolabel across peaks corresponding to known oligosaccharide size fractions, relative to the total eluted3H radiolabel, by the use of a standard algorithm. Control platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared from blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate (30 healthy donors) by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min. All the reagents were purchased from Stago Diagnostica (France). Three parameters were evaluated, by adding endocan or buffer or heparin to PPP. Activated partial thromboplastin time explores the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation (FI, FII, FV, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, and FXII). Deficit or inhibition of one of these factors enhances coagulation time of the reactive mixture (PPP, cephalin, activator, and CaCl2). Thrombin clotting time is performed on PPP + thrombin. With a standard concentration of thrombin, the clotting time of plasma is constant. Abnormalities of fibrin formation induce an increase of the coagulation time. Anti-Xa activity of heparin, or of other inhibitors acting on FXa, is detected by this competitive assay. The studied sample (PPP + endocan, buffer, or heparin) is mixed with FXa and a FXa-specific chromogenic substrate. The final coloration is inversely proportional to the inhibitor concentration. This global sensitive assay can detect platelet or plasmatic abnormality inducing a lag time or a decrease of thrombin generation. In five healthy donors, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate by centrifugation at 150 × g for 10 min. Thrombin generation test was performed for each subject, in samples without endocan, with unfractionated calcium heparinate (0.5 IU anti-Xa/ml) or with 0.2, 0.5, or 1 μg/ml endocan (final concentration). Endocan was added 10 min before the assay. At 37 °C, 1 ml of plasma was mixed with 1 ml of CaCl2. Aliquots of 0.1 ml were removed from the reaction each minute for 15 min. Clots formed in the reactive mixture were regularly removed. Aliquots were mixed with 0.2 ml of fibrinogen (Sigma, 4/1000 in Owren buffer) at 37 °C, and clotting time was measured for each aliquot. Thrombin formed in the reactive mixture acts on fibrinogen, inducing fibrin formation. The clotting activity was maximal between 4 and 8 min and then decreased on account of neutralization of thrombin by anti-thrombin. For native endocan, 50 μg of purified WT/endocan or S137A/endocan in 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, were chromatographed on Superdex 200 or Superdex 75 HR10/30 columns (0.13 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively, using a Bio-Rad Biologic Chromatography System (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in the same buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and endocan was detected by a specific ELISA. The following proteins in the low and high molecular mass calibration kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as standards: ribonuclease A (bovine pancreas, 13.7 kDa), ovalbumin (hen egg, 43 kDa), albumin (bovine serum, 67 kDa), aldolase (rabbit muscle, 158 kDa), ferritin (horse spleen, 440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (bovine thyroid, 669 kDa). Molecular weight standards were run immediately after WT/endocan and S137A/endocan. The elution times of the standards were used to construct a standard linear curve,K av = f (log MR), to determine the apparent molecular mass of WT/endocan and S137A/endocan. Growth-promoting activity was determined by measuring [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into 293 cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104/well in Techno Plastic Products (TPP) 96-well microplates and maintained for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with transferrin and insulin. Recombinant human HGF/SF was diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and added to triplicate wells to obtain a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. WT/endocan, S137A/endocan, and the purified GAG derived from endocan or heparin were added alone or together with HGF/SF, as indicated in the figure legends. After 96 h 0.5 μCi of [methyl- 3H]thymidine/well was added for 16 h and [methyl- 3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined on a TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Co., Rungis, France). Assays were performed in triplicate. Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction test. Binding reactions were carried out at 20 °C in an IAsys Auto+ dual channel resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Saxon Hill, Cambridge, UK) using streptavidin-derivatized aminosilane surfaces as described (43Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44Fernig D.G. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycan Protocols. 171.

Here, we examined the effect of elevated temperature on the oligomerization and structural changes of α-synuclein in the early stage of aggregation and show that self-assembly is crucial for the stabilization of a partially folded conformation. The efficiency of α-synuclein oligomerization increased proportional to the temperature increase, both in purified form and in crude cytosolic preparation. This oligomerization coincided with a small but reproducible change in the circular dichroism spectrum and an increase in the 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid binding. The hydrodynamic dimensions of the dimer measured by size exclusion chromatography suggest a pre-molten globule-like structure. These data suggest that partially folded α-synuclein, which is unstable in the monomeric form, is stabilized by self-assembly and that these oligomers may evolve into the fibril nucleus.

Parkinson's disease dementia with Lewy body Lewy body 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid Deposition of aggregated forms of α-synuclein in neuronal or glial cytoplasm is a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD),1 dementia with Lewy body (DLB), Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease, and multiple system atrophy (1Lucking C.B.

The transgenic flies that express human α-synuclein in various levels produced behavioral and pathological phenotypes that resemble human PD, including an age-dependent onset of dopaminergic neuronal loss, fibrous Lewy body (LB)-like inclusions, and a progress decline of locomotor activity (9Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice that express human α-synuclein also produced neuronal inclusions and dopaminergic presynaptic degeneration in striatum (10Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly suggest that α-synuclein, in its aggregated forms, is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. α-Synuclein spontaneously forms fibrils that are rich in cross-β structure by a nucleation-dependent mechanism (11Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 12Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Interestingly, monomeric α-synuclein does not contain any stable structure, hence the term “natively unfolded” has been proposed to describe this protein (13Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), whereas fibrillar and some pre-fibrillar oligomeric forms of this protein are highly structured (8Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11604-11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transition from monomer to fibril is a process of acquiring structure. The fibrillization process appears to be a multistep process, because various forms of pre-fibrillar oligomeric species have been identified during fibril formation in vitro (6Conway K.A. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 15Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, structural changes in the early stages of oligomerization are poorly understood. It has been reported previously that either an increase in temperature or a decrease in pH level rapidly transformed natively unfolded α-synuclein into a partially folded conformation and that this structural transition was fully reversible (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Moreover, the same study showed a tight correlation between the increase of this intermediate and the enhanced formation of α-synuclein fibrils (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the oligomerization and concomitant structural changes of α-synuclein in prolonged incubations at high temperature conditions, both in vivo and in vitro, to obtain insights into the molecular mechanism of the rate-limiting, early stage of oligomerization. Expression in Escherichia coli and purification of α-synuclein were performed as described previously (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol.

Methods. 1998; 16: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the cytosol. Purified recombinant α-synuclein (1 μg) or COS-7 cytosol preparation (total protein 10 μg) was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in a final volume of 200 μl at different temperatures for up to 3 days. Aliquots were removed at given time points and subjected to Western blot analysis according to the procedure of Lee et al. (18Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The primary antibody against α-synuclein used in this study was LB509 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). CD spectra were obtained on an AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) using an α-synuclein concentration of ∼1.0 mg/ml at 23 °C as described previously (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). A stock solution of 1 mm ANS (Sigma) was prepared in distilled, deionized water. The concentration of the dye was determined by its absorption at 350 nm. The [ANS]/[protein] ratio in all experiments was kept equal to 5. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 23 °C in 1 ml of semi-micro quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with a 1-cm excitation light path. Emission spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm with excitation at 350 nm in increments of 1 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and a slit-width of 1 nm for both excitation and emission. Data were processed using DataMax software. Size-exclusion measurements were performed on a Sephadex 200 column calibrated with a set of native globular proteins of known molecular masses as described elsewhere (6Conway K.A. Lee S.-J.

The hydrodynamic dimensions (Stokes radii,RS) of α-synuclein in different associated forms were recalculated from apparent molecular masses,Mapp , determined by gel-filtration chromatography using Equation 1 (19Uversky V.N.

Incubation of α-synuclein at high temperature induces a partially folded conformation (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This structural transformation was completely reversible when the heat treatment was transient. If the partially folded conformation serves as an intermediate of the fibril assembly, populating this structure for a longer period of time should induce the self-assembly and trap the structure in oligomeric forms. Here, we tested whether sustained heat treatment, thereby sustaining partially folded conformation, can stabilize the structure and initiate the oligomerization. Incubation of purified wild type human recombinant α-synuclein at different temperatures for up to 3 days resulted in a temperature-dependent, progressive aggregation. The incubation at 65 °C showed small oligomers at day 1, and at day 3 larger aggregates were detected with increased amounts of small oligomers (Fig. 1 A). Although oligomerization at 50 °C was slower but apparent at day 3 no oligomer of any size was detectable at 37 °C or room temperature for incubations up to 3 days. To test whether the self-assembly of α-synuclein occurs in complex cytosolic milieu, cytosolic preparations were obtained from COS-7 cells that express α-synuclein from recombinant adenoviral vector and incubated at different temperatures for up to 3 days. Oligomerization of the cytosolic α-synuclein showed similar kinetics and temperature dependence to the purified protein (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the source of the protein does not affect the overall conformational behavior of the protein. Moreover, the fact that the pattern of small oligomeric species in the cytosolic preparation was almost identical to that of the purified protein confirms that the oligomeric species of α-synuclein formed in the cytosolic preparation were the result of the selective self-assembly rather than heteromeric association with other cytosolic proteins. To analyze the conformational properties of the oligomeric forms, structural changes induced in α-synuclein during the incubation of this protein at different temperatures were studied by far-UV CD spectroscopy and ANS fluorescence. To this end, aliquots of 1.0 mg/ml α-synuclein solution were incubated at the given temperature for the desired amount of time, cooled to room temperature (23 °C), and then subjected to far-UV CD or fluorescence analysis. Far-UV CD spectra of human recombinant α-synuclein were measured at 23 °C after the different durations of incubation at 65 °C. At early time points (up to 1 day), α-synuclein shows a far-UV CD spectrum typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain (Fig.2 A). This includes the characteristic minimum in the vicinity of 198 nm and low amplitude in the 210–230-nm region. In agreement with earlier studies (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), this spectrum was absolutely super-imposable with that measured for the non-heated protein, reflecting complete reversibility of the temperature-induced structural changes. However, when α-synuclein was incubated at 65 °C for longer time, irreversible changes in the shape of its far-UV CD spectrum were observed (Fig. 2 A). A decrease in the minimum at 198 nm was accompanied by an increase in negative intensity around 222 nm, reflecting formation of a small amount of ordered secondary structure. This process was completed in 6 days, and longer incubation of α-synuclein at 65 °C was not accompanied by further structural changes (Fig. 2 B). The efficiency of accumulation of this trapped conformation was temperature-dependent. This was demonstrated in Fig.3 A by a temperature-sensitive loss of reversibility in heat-induced structural changes, measured after prolonged incubations at different temperatures. Here the protein was incubated at desired temperatures for 6 days, cooled down to room temperature, and then analyzed by far-UV CD spectra at 23 °C. Larger changes in the secondary structure were observed when the protein was incubated at higher temperature (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the partially folded conformation is more effectively trapped at high temperature. Close correlation between the structural changes and the oligomerization suggests that as a result of prolonged incubation at elevated temperatures, a small amount of ordered secondary structure was stabilized by the self-assembly of partially folded α-synuclein. Interestingly, the CD spectrum of this trapped conformation was similar to that of the partially folded monomeric conformer induced by low pH levels or high temperature (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar).Figure 3Effect of incubation at different temperatures on the structural properties of α-synuclein. Far-UV CD spectrum (A) or (B) ANS fluorescence spectrum of α-synuclein as a function of incubation temperature are shown. Spectra were measured after 6 days of α-synuclein incubation at 23 °C (yellow curve), 37 °C (green curve), 50 °C (red curve), and 65 °C (black curve). The spectrum measured for the non-incubated protein is shown for comparison (blue dashed curve). Measurements were carried out at 23 °C. Protein concentration was 1.0 mg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Non-native partially folded conformations of proteins are characterized by the presence of solvent-exposed hydrophobic clusters to which ANS binds. This interaction results in a considerable increase in the ANS fluorescence intensity and in a pronounced blue shift of the fluorescence emission maximum (22Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the change of ANS fluorescence to monitor the gain of structure in α-synuclein upon incubation and oligomerization. Incubation of α-synuclein at different temperatures led to a large enhancement of the dye fluorescence intensity, which paralleled the gain of secondary structure and the oligomerization (Fig. 3 B). The characteristic blue shift of the ANS fluorescence maximum from ∼515 to ∼475 nm indicative of binding was also observed after incubation at 65 °C. This reflects the temperature-induced transformation of α-synuclein from the natively unfolded state to the partially folded conformation. Because the unfolding of a protein is associated with an increase in the hydrodynamic volume, hydrodynamic parameters are very useful in predicting the degree of folding. It is well known that the hydrodynamic radius of globular proteins increases by ∼15–20% as they transform into the molten globule state (19Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 20Uversky V.N. Int. J. Biochromatogr. 1994; 1: 103-114Google Scholar,23Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrodynamic volume of the pre-molten globule conformation is even larger (23Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Uversky V.N. Ptitsyn O.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2782-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been established that native, molten globule, pre-molten globule, and unfolded conformations of globular proteins possess very different molecular mass dependences of their hydrodynamic radii, RS (19Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 21Uversky, V. N. (2001) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar, 25Tanford C. Adv.

Thus, equilibrium conformations can easily be discriminated by the degree of compactness of the polypeptide chain. Hydrodynamic properties of monomeric and dimeric forms of α-synuclein were studied by gel-filtration chromatography (TableI). In the case of monomeric α-synuclein, the experimentally determined value (RS = 31.3 Å) perfectly matched the value calculated for a natively unfolded protein of 14,460 Da (RS = 31.6 Å) (see “Materials and Methods”). RS measured for the dimer (RS = 36.3 Å) coincided with expected dimension of a pre-molten globule protein with a molecular mass of 28,920 Da (RS = 36.2 Å). Therefore, the partially folded pre-molten globule-like conformation of α-synuclein seems to be stabilized as the protein undergoes a highly selective self-assembly process during prolonged incubation at elevated temperatures.Table IHydrodynamic dimensions of monomeric and dimeric α-synucleinMeasured RSPredicted RSMonomer31.3Unfolded 14,460-Da protein31.6Dimer36.3Pre-molten globule-like 28,920-Da protein36.2Stokes radii (RS) were measured by Sephadex 200 gel filtration column chromatography, which was calibrated with blue dextran (2,000 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Open table in a new tab Stokes radii (RS) were measured by Sephadex 200 gel filtration column chromatography, which was calibrated with blue dextran (2,000 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). In the previous study, it was shown that a partially folded state of α-synuclein might be induced immediately in elevated temperatures and low pH conditions and that these structural changes were fully reversible (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that the sustained presence of the partially folded state by prolonged incubation at elevated temperatures induces oligomerization of α-synuclein, and this oligomerization coincides with the stabilization of a pre-molten globule conformation. These results are consistent with the model depicted in Fig.4. Under normal conditions, the occurrence of the partially folded monomeric form of α-synuclein is very rare, because the equilibrium between the unfolded monomer and the partially folded monomer strongly favors the natively unfolded form. However, in the event of prolonged elevation of the concentration of the partially folded form, which in the monomeric form is in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state, some of the partially folded molecules undergo self-assembly to form dimers and small oligomers. This self-assembly stabilizes the pre-molten globule conformation because of the slow rate of dissociation of the oligomers. The dynamic relationship between the pre-molten globule-like dimer (or oligomers) and the fibril nucleus is still hypothetical. However, because fibril formation was enhanced under conditions that increase the concentration of the partially folded conformation, it is reasonable to predict that the small oligomers with pre-molten globule structure are the earliest oligomeric intermediates for the fibrillization process and evolve into fibril nuclei. This model predicts that one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of LB-related diseases is the shift of the equilibrium between the unfolded monomer and partially folded monomer in favor of the latter and that the identification of physiological factors that influence this event will increases our understanding on these diseases. Our data show that the heat treatment induced oligomerization not only from the purified α-synuclein but also from the crude cytosolic preparation from COS-7 cells that expressed α-synuclein. It is important to note that the Western blot profile of small oligomers formed in cytosolic preparation appears identical to that formed from the purified protein. These data suggest that the oligomerization was initiated by selective self-association between the partially folded α-synuclein conformers rather than by heteromeric association of α-synuclein with other proteins in a complex cytosolic milieu. This model is supported by the biochemical analyses of brain extracts from PD, DLB, or multiple system atrophy. Western blotting showed that brains from the individuals suffered from these diseases contained the 36-kDa α-synuclein immunoreactive protein, as in our in vitro oligomerization study, but age-matched controls did not (27Campbell B.C.

Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Li Q.X. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pattern of oligomers on the Western analysis with LBs isolated from DLB was strikingly similar to the one obtained in the present study. Both the isolated LB and the oligomers produced in our study contained 36- and 52-kDa immunoreactive proteins, as well as much larger aggregated proteins (30Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that our in vitro oligomerization study produced the same oligomeric species found in human LB preparations suggests that our experimental observations may reflect the in vivo mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation in the early stage of pathogenesis. Recent studies also suggest the role of pre-fibrillar oligomeric α-synuclein as a pathogenic species. For example, pre-fibrillar oligomers bind to lipid membranes more readily than does monomer or fibril, and a subset of them possesses channel-forming activity in bilayer membranes, implicating a potential biological activity that might confer toxicity (14Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the structural details of early stage, oligomeric intermediates may increase our understanding on the biological activities of these pre-fibrillar species, as well as the fibril-forming process."

However, the precise mechanisms of this inhibition have not been determined. We hypothesized that activation of PPARγ in vascular injury could attenuate VSMC growth and matrix production during vascular lesion formation. Since connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a key factor regulating extracellular matrix production, abrogation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced CTGF production by PPARγ activation may be one of the mechanisms through which PPARγ agonists inhibit neointima formation after vascular injury. In this study, we demonstrate that the PPARγ natural ligand (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2) and a synthetic ligand (GW7845) significantly inhibit TGF-β-induced CTGF production in a dose-dependent manner in HASMCs. In addition, suppression of CTGF mRNA expression is relieved by pretreatment with an antagonist of PPARγ (GW9662), suggesting that the inhibition of CTGF expression is mediated by PPARγ. To elucidate further the molecular mechanism by which PPARγ inhibits CTGF expression, an ∼2-kilobase pair CTGF promoter was cloned. We found that PPARγ activation inhibits TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, and suppression of CTGF promoter activity by PPARγ activation is completely rescued by overexpression of Smad3, but not by Smad4. Furthermore, PPARγ physically interacts with Smad3 but not Smad4 in vitro in glutathioneS-transferase pull-down experiments.

TGF-β signaling is initiated upon its binding to two cell membrane receptors termed type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII). Both receptors are serine/threonine kinases, and binding by TGF-β results in phosphorylation of TβRI and TβRII. Smad proteins are the primary substrates known to date for phosphorylated TGF-β receptors. The phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 by TGF-β receptor causes their association with Smad4. The Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus and bind to cofactors that determine the choice of the target gene (7Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). In addition to Smad proteins, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases are reported to be involved in TGF-β signaling (8Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H.

It was reported that thiazolidinediones (TZD), a class of antidiabetic drugs that are specific ligands of PPARγ, inhibit neointima formation after balloon injury (16Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P.

Based on the studies above, we hypothesized that the up-regulation of PPARγ gene expression induced by cytokines and growth factors in response to vascular injury may function as a countervailing influence that attenuates VSMC growth and matrix production during lesion formation. To understand the role of PPARγ in VSMC, we used commercially available filter-based microarrays from Research Genetics (GF-211, Huntsville, AL) to quantitate changes in expression of mRNAs in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Over 50 genes are either up- or down-regulated by at least 2-fold after treatment with PPARγ ligands. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was one of the genes most down-regulated by PPARγ activators (−5.6-, −6.5-, and −8-fold by ciglitazone, GW7845, and 15-d-PGJ2, respectively). Therefore, we postulated that CTGF down-regulation by PPARγ activation might be one of the mechanisms by which PPARγ agonists inhibit neointima formation. In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of PPARγ inhibits TGF-β-induced CTGF expression in HASMCs by interfering with the Smad3 signaling pathway.

Briefly, we designed two human PPARγ1 primers: 1) 5′-gatctagaaccATGGCCATGGTTGACACAGAG-3′ which contains theXbaI linker (small letters), Kozak sequence (in bold), and human PPARγ1 sequence nt 173–193 of GenBankTM accession number L40904 (capital letters), and 2) 5′-gtctcgagTCTCTGCTAGTACAAGTCCT TG-3′ which contains the XhoI linker (small letters) and human PPARγ1 sequence nt 1594–1615 of GenBankTMaccession number L40904 (capital letters). With these two primers, we amplified an ∼1.4-kb fragment from human vascular smooth muscle cells by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This fragment was digested by XbaI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3(−). After sequencing this fragment, the resultant plasmid was designated as pcDNA3-hPPARγ1. HASMCs were purchased from BioWhittaker (San Diego, CA) and cultured in smooth muscle cell growth medium-2 containing 5% FBS, 2 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor, 0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 5 μg/ml bovine insulin. For all experiments, early passage (5Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol.

Each agonist examined was added 60 min before the addition of human recombinant TGF-β1. The HepG2 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%(v/v) FBS in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Twenty μg of total RNA, isolated from each condition by using acid/guanidinium thiocyanate, was subjected to electrophoresis through 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After transferring to nylon membranes (Bio-Rad), the RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by a UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were generated by using the random primer labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Blots were pre-hybridized, hybridized, and washed once with 1× SSC at 65 °C and once with 0.1× SSC, 1.0% SDS (w/v) at 65 °C over 1 h. The lane loading differences were normalized by using a GAPDH cDNA probe. Cell culture medium was removed and concentrated with a Biomax Column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) after 24 h of TGF-β1 stimulation. The cells were harvested and lysed in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 1% Triton X-100; 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 1 mmsodium vanadate; 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin; 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Thirty μg of total cell lysate or concentrated cell medium were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, blots were incubated with specific antibodies against PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or CTGF (Torrey Pines Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoactivity was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 661-base pair human CTGF promoter (GenBankTM accession number X92511) was used to search the human genome data base and found to match an ∼61-kb DNA fragment (GenBankTM accession number AL354866) from chromosome 6, the map position of CTGF. Based on this ∼61-kb DNA sequence, we designed two primers to amplify an ∼2-kb CTGF promoter by polymerase chain reaction. This CTGF promoter (nt −2065 to nt +72) was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3 basic, Promega). We designated this CTGF promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid as pCTGF-Luc. HepG2 cells, grown to 50–60% confluence in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, were transiently transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with reporter and expression plasmids as described. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression plasmid was co-transfected as the control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by using a corresponding empty vector mock DNA. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h in the same medium containing the appropriate reagents for the experiments. The reporter luciferase assay kit (Promega) was used with a luminometer (Victor II, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to measure luciferase activity in the cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activity was normalized by GFP. Recombinant PPARγ1 was transcribed and translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. GST, GST-Smad3, and GST-Smad4 were produced in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten μg of GST-Smad3 or GST-Smad4 fusion protein, loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads, was incubated with 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled PPARγ1 for 2 h in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The PPARγ ligand, GW7845 (at a final concentration of 1 μm), was added at the beginning of incubation. After washing four times with binding buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. Then the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. We directly measured collagen synthesis as described previously (21Kolpakov V. Gorden D. Kulik T.J. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 305-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 90% confluent HASMCs were rendered quiescent in media supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h and subsequently stimulated with GW7845 (0.1, 0.5, 1 μmol/liter) for 1 h before stimulation with TGF-β1 (4 ng/ml) and sodium ascorbate (10 μg/ml) for 48 h. Control cultures were incubated with ascorbate plus vehicle. HASMCs were pulsed for the last 24 h with 15 μCi/mll-[3H]proline (100 mCi/mmol) in proline-free DMEM. During this period the medium was supplemented with dialyzed 1% FBS, fresh sodium ascorbate (10 μg/ml), and β-aminoproprionitrile (80 μg/ml). The medium was mixed with buffer containing 0.65 mol/liter NaCl, 100 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 4.7 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.25 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide, and 50 μg/ml BSA. Samples were split into two equal portions, and highly specific collagenase (Sigma type VII, 10 units/ml) was added to one portion. The samples were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, and undigested proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. The pellets were washed, air-dried, and dissolved in 0.1n NaOH. Radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The rate of collagen synthesis, relative to that of all proline-containing proteins, was calculated assuming that the number of proline residues in collagen is 5.4-fold higher than that in noncollagen proteins. To understand the role of PPARγ in VSMC, we compared the expression of ∼4100 genes in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in response to PPARγ activators using a human known gene filter (Research Genetics, GF-211, Huntsville, AL). Passage 7 HASMCs were grown to 80–90% confluence, made quiescent by serum starvation for 24 h, and then stimulated with 10 μmol/liter ciglitazone, 1 μmol/liter GW7845, or 5 μmol/liter 15-d-PGJ2 for 16 h. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which is a key regulator of extracellular matrix production, was down-regulated about −5.6-, −6.5-, and −8.0-fold by ciglitazone, GW7845, and 15-d-PGJ2 respectively (data not shown). This led us to postulate that CTGF is a PPARγ target gene in VSMCs. To understand the biological relevance of CTGF regulation by PPARγ, we investigated whether PPARγ activators regulate TGF-β-induced CTGF mRNA expression in HASMCs. Cells were pretreated with an increasing concentration of 15-d-PGJ2 (1, 5, 10 μmol/liter) or GW7845 (0.1, 0.5, 1 μmol/liter) for 1 h and were subsequently stimulated with TGF-β1 (4 ng/ml) for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 1, A andB, both PPARγ activators inhibit TGF-β-induced CTGF mRNA expression in HASMCs in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of 15-d-PGJ2 and GW7845 on CTGF protein levels in the culture medium of TGF-β-stimulated cells were next examined. Consistent with previous work (4Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.M. Do D.D. Godoy N. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we found that CTGF protein was undetectable in untreated HASMCs by Western blotting analysis, whereas TGF-β significantly induced CTGF protein production and secretion (Fig. 1, C and D). Interestingly, both 15-d-PGJ2 (5 μmol/liter) and GW7845 (1 μmol/liter) dramatically inhibited TGF-β-induced CTGF secretion. Taken together, the results showed that the inhibition of CTGF expression by PPARγ ligands is more profound at the protein level than at the mRNA level, suggesting that PPARγ ligands might be exerting some translational or post-translational effects on CTGF expression. In addition, the inhibition of CTGF expression by PPARγ ligands was not due to cell death because neither 15-d-PGJ2 (10 μmol/liter) nor GW7845 (1 μmol/liter) was toxic to HASMCs (viability = 100%, data not shown). Taken together, the data indicate that PPARγ activation inhibits TGF-β-induced CTGF production at both the mRNA and protein levels. If the suppression of CTGF expression is mediated by PPARγ, we would expect that the PPARγ-specific antagonist would negate this effect. GW9662 from GlaxoSmithKline has been shown to be a PPARγ-specific antagonist (18Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 22Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, HASMCs were pretreated with or without GW9662 at 1 μmol/liter for 30 min prior to the addition of 15-d-PGJ2 (5 μmol/liter) or GW7845 (1 μmol/liter) and were subsequently stimulated with TGF-β (4 ng/ml) for 6 h. Northern blotting analysis showed that the suppression of TGF-β-induced CTGF mRNA by GW7845 is abrogated by GW9662 (Fig.2 A), whereas the effect of 15-d-PGJ2 on CTGF mRNA expression is partially reversed by GW9662 (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that the effect of GW7845 on TGF-β-induced CTGF expression is largely mediated by PPARγ. However, the inhibition of 15-d-PGJ2 on TGF-β-induced CTGF expression is only in part through PPARγ. The data suggest that 15-d-PGJ2 activates a PPARγ-independent signaling pathway to repress CTGF expression in addition to the activation of PPARγ. To study the molecular mechanisms by which PPARγ activation inhibited CTGF expression, we cloned the human CTGF promoter using the human genome data base as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.3, the TATA box (TATAAAA) is located at nt −33 to nt −27 of the human CTGF promoter. Sequence analysis of this CTGF promoter revealed that there are two putative NF-κB sites and two putative AP-1 sites. In addition, a putative Smads-binding site (SBE) was reported at nt −175 to nt −167 (CAGACGGAG) (6Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we did not find any putative PPARγ-like elements. Cloning of this ∼2-kb human CTGF promoter has provided a powerful tool with which to study the mechanism of the regulation of CTGF gene expression. To understand the transcriptional regulation of CTGF gene expression, we transiently transfected pCTGF-Luc with Smad3, Smad4, Smad3/Smad4, p65, or c-Jun/c-FosB expression plasmids into the HepG2 cell line, which is a well established cell model for testing TGF-β signaling. As shown in Fig. 4, CTGF promoter activity was increased about 1.9-, 3.2-, and 1.8-fold by overexpression of Smad3, Smad3/Smad4, or c-Jun/c-FosB, respectively. However, overexpression of Smad4 or p65 did not affect CTGF promoter activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the Smad3, Smad3-Smad4 complex, and AP1 regulate the transcriptional activity of CTGF promoter. To examine further the mechanisms by which PPARγ activation inhibits TGF-β-induced CTGF expression, we investigated the regulation of the CTGF promoter in HepG2 cells. Since PPARγ is not expressed in the HepG2 cell (Fig. 5 C), it is a good model to test the role of PPARγ in mediating the inhibitory effects of PPARγ ligands on TGF-β-induced CTGF expression. Without transfecting the PPARγ expression plasmid, treatment of HepG2 cells with GW7845 (1 μmol/liter) had no effect on CTGF promoter activation induced by TGF-β (Fig. 5 A). When an increasing concentration of PPARγ expression plasmid (50, 100, and 150 ng/well) was transfected into these cells, GW7845 strongly inhibited TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activation in a PPARγ dose-dependent manner. In addition, we transfected the constant PPARγ expression plasmid (150 ng/well) to HepG2 cells to test the effect of GW7845 at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μmol/liter on CTGF promoter activation. We also found that PPARγ inhibited TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activation in a GW7845 dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These results suggest that GW7845 inhibits TGF-β-induced CTGF expression at the transcriptional level in a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. Because activation of the CTGF promoter depended on a combinatorial interaction between Smad3, Smad4, and AP1, we investigated the minimal promoter containing the binding sites only for Smad3 and Smad4 to determine whether they were targets for negative regulation by PPARγ ligands. Co-transfection of a luciferase reporter construct containing three tandem repeats of SBE with an increasing concentration of PPARγ expression plasmid into HepG2 cells showed that GW7845 also effectively inhibited SBE activity in a PPARγ-dependent manner (Fig.5 B). These data suggest that PPARγ inhibits CTGF promoter activation by interfering with Smad3/Smad4. To examine whether overexpression of Smad3 and/or Smad4 abrogate the PPARγ inhibition on TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activation, we overexpressed Smad3 and/or Smad4 in HepG2 cells by transient transfection. As shown in Fig.6 A, overexpression of Smad3 or Smad3/Smad4 abrogated the PPARγ inhibition on TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activation. However, overexpression of Smad4 alone had no effect. Similar results were observed by using the minimal promoter containing SBE (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that PPARγ directly antagonizes the effects of Smad3. The antagonistic relationship between Smad3 and PPARγ suggests a direct interaction between Smad3 and PPARγ. To determine whether PPARγ directly interacts with Smad3, an in vitro binding assay was performed with bacterially generated GST-Smad3 fusion protein and in vitro transcribed/translated PPARγ. A matrix-bound GST-Smad3, but not GST, retained [35S]methionine-labeled PPARγ in the presence or absence of the PPARγ ligand (Fig.7 A). The presence of GW7845, a PPARγ ligand in the assay mixture, significantly increased this physical interaction. In addition, we demonstrated that both GST and GST-Smad4 did not retain PPARγ (Fig. 7 B). These data indicate that PPARγ physically interacts with Smad3 but not Smad4. We examined the effect of PPARγ activation on the rate of collagen synthesis in HASMCs by metabolically labeling cells with l-[3H]proline. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the relative rate of collagen synthesis was increased ∼2.5-fold by TGF-β (4 ng/ml) stimulation. GW7845 (0.1–1 μmol/liter) inhibited TGF-β-induced collagen synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GW7845 had no effect on the basal level of collagen synthesis in HASMCs. Similar results were observed when using the PPARγ natural ligand, 15-d-PGJ2 (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that PPARγ activation inhibits TGF-β-induced collagen synthesis that is likely to be mediated by inhibition of CTGF expression. The results of these studies demonstrate that PPARγ activation inhibits TGF-β-induced CTGF expression in HASMCs by directly interfering with the Smad3 signaling pathway. Because CTGF is a key factor in the regulation of extracellular matrix production, this repression of CTGF expression by PPARγ activation may be one of the mechanisms through which PPARγ agonists inhibit neointimal formation after vascular lesion. It is postulated that pathological changes in vessel structure are induced in part by transcription factors that govern cell growth, death, differentiation, inflammation, and matrix production. PPARs are a family of ligand-activated nuclear transcriptional factors that are emerging as important determinants of vascular function and structure (10Ricote M. Huang J. Fajas L. Li A. Welch J.

Recent studies have documented that the expression of PPARγ is up-regulated in intimal VSMC (23Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that thiazolidinediones (TZD), a class of anti-diabetic drugs that function as synthetic ligands of PPARγ, inhibit neointima formation after balloon injury in association with decreased DNA synthesis (23Law R.E.

In this study, we have extended these observations by documenting that both synthetic and natural ligands of PPARγ promote a decrease in the expression of CTGF as well as collagen III in VSMC. In addition, previous studies (3Oemar B.S. Luscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.M. Do D.D. Godoy N. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) have well documented that CTGF plays an important role in atherosclerosis and restenosis by mediating the effects of TGF-β-induced extracellular matrix production and by stimulating collagen and fibronectin production in fibroblasts (25Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H. Grotendorst G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest a novel anti-fibrotic mechanism by which PPARγ activation may reduce vascular lesion formation via decreasing CTGF expression. Recently, it was reported (26Wang M. Wise S.C. Leff T. Su T.Z. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S.

Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) that there are PPARγ-independent effects of PPARγ ligands (i.e. TZD) at high doses. In addition, the PPARγ natural ligand 15-d-PGJ2 has many functions other than that of a PPARγ activator (29Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). In this study, we documented that the high affinity PPARγ ligand, GW7845, had the effect of inhibiting TGF-β-induced CTGF expression, beside TZD and 15-d-PGJ2, in HASMCs. By using the PPARγ-specific antagonist, GW9662 (18Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 22Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), from GlaxoSmithKline, we demonstrated that the effect of GW7845 on TGF-β-induced CTGF expression was essentially mediated by PPARγ. However, the inhibition of 15-d-PGJ2 on TGF-β-induced CTGF expression was partly due to PPARγ activation, suggesting that 15-d-PGJ2 can activate other PPARγ-independent signaling pathways to repress CTGF expression. Interestingly, it was recently reported that 15-d-PGJ2 inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 expression, not only by activation of PPARγ but also by directly inhibiting NF-κB as well as by modification of IκB (29Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Cloning of this ∼2-kb human CTGF promoter provided a powerful tool with which to study the mechanisms of regulation of CTGF gene expression. Sequence analysis of this CTGF promoter revealed that there were two putative NF-κB sites, two putative AP-1 sites, and a putative SBE. It is interesting to document that Smad3 and Smad4 have a synergistic effect on activating the CTGF promoter. This may represent the fact that overexpression of Smad4 can translocate more Smad3 into the nucleus (7Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). In this study, our data document that activation of the CTGF promoter depends on Smad3/Smad4 and c-Jun/c-Fos but not on NF-κB. At present, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of NF-κB in the regulation of CTGF expression. To understand better the transcriptional regulation of CTGF, we are currently performing a systematic deletion mapping analysis of this promoter, which is beyond the scope of this study. Smad proteins are the primary TGF-β receptor substrates capable of signal transduction. The Smad complex translocates into the nucleus and binds to cofactors that determine the choice of target genes. Smad proteins consist of two conserved globular domains known as the MH1 (Mad homology 1) and the MH2 domains, coupled by a linker region. The MH1 domain recognizes the Smad-binding site in the target gene promoter, whereas the MH2 domain binds to transcriptional coactivators such as p300 and CREB-binding protein in competition with the corepressors such as Ski and SnoN (7Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that PPARγ directly interacts with Smad proteins, we performed a series of transfection/reporter experiments. Overexpression of Smad3 or Smad3/Smad4 but not Smad4 completely abrogates the PPARγ inhibition on TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activation. In addition, using an in vitro binding assay, we demonstrate that PPARγ physically interacts with Smad3 but not Smad4. Taken together, our data suggest that PPARγ can inhibit TGF-β-induced CTGF expression in HASMCs by directly interacting with Smad3. Although we have documented that PPARγ activation inhibits TGF-β-induced activation of CTGF through a Smad3-dependent mechanism, it will be interesting to know whether TGF-β directly regulates PPARγ gene expression in VSMCs. Recently, it was reported (30Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Feng J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1241-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that TGF-β could decrease the expression of CD36, the macrophage type B receptor that is a well characterized PPARγ target gene, by phosphorylation of PPARγ through the mitogen-activated protein kinase. Although we have not detected CD36 in HASMCs, using both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses (data not shown), this provocative paper stimulated us to examine the effect of TGF-β on PPARγ gene expression. We found that TGF-β inhibits PPARγ gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in VSMCs. 2M. Fu, J. Zhang, X. Zhu, D. E. Myles, T. M. Willson, X. Liu, and Y. E. Chen, unpublished data. Taken together, our data suggest that the inhibition of CD36 expression by TGF-β stimulation may be mediated by PPARγ at multiple levels including phosphorylation of PPARγ, repression of PPARγ gene expression, and the interaction of PPARγ and Smad3. Studies are underway to determine the mechanisms of TGF-β-induced PPARγ inhibition. In conclusion, we show for the first time that CTGF, which is a key regulator of extracellular matrix production and plays an important role in atherosclerosis and restenosis, is a PPARγ-regulated gene. We have documented that activation of PPARγ abrogates TGF-β-induced CTGF expression by directly interfering with the Smad3 signaling pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that abrogation of TGF-β-induced CTGF production by PPARγ activation may be one of the mechanisms through which PPARγ agonists inhibit neointimal formation after vascular lesion.

Recent data showed that cysteine oxidation rather than tyrosine nitration is responsible for TH inactivation after peroxynitrite exposure in vitro (Kuhn, D. M., Aretha, C. W., and Geddes, T. J. (1999) J. Neurosci. 19, 10289–10294). However, re-examination of the reaction of peroxynitrite with purified TH failed to produce cysteine oxidation but resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration and inactivation. Cysteine oxidation is only observed after partial unfolding of the protein. Tyrosine residue 423 and to lesser extent tyrosine residues 428 and 432 are modified by nitration. Mutation of Tyr423 to Phe resulted in decreased nitration as compared with wild type protein without loss of activity. Stopped-flow experiments reveal a second order rate constant of (3.8 ± 0.9) × 103m−1s−1 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C for the reaction of peroxynitrite with TH. Collectively, the data indicate that peroxynitrite reacts with the metal center of the protein and results primarily in the nitration of tyrosine residue 423, which is responsible for the inactivation of TH. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is modified by nitration after exposure of mice to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophenylpyridine. The temporal association of tyrosine nitration with inactivation of TH activityin vitro suggests that this covalent post-translational modification is responsible for the in vivo loss of TH function (Ara, J., Przedborski, S., Naini, A.

Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1995; 70: 103-220PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of ability to synthesize catecholamines is an important step in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases (2Calne D.B. Langston J.W. Lancet. 1983; 2: 1457-1459Abstract PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 3MacGeer P.L. Itagaki S. Akiyama H. McGeer E.G. Ann. Neurol. 1989; 24: 574-576Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 4Nagatsu T.

Rowland L.P. Merritt's Neurology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, New York2000: 679-693Google Scholar). Early loss of TH activity followed by a decline in TH protein is thought to contribute to the dopamine deficiency and phenotypic expression in PD and the MPTP mouse model (4Nagatsu T. Neurochem. Res. 1990; 15: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Tyrosine hydroxylase is a selective target for nitration following administration of the parkinsonian toxin MPTP to mice and following exposure of PC12 cells to either peroxynitrite or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridiniun ion (7Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Nitration of one or more tyrosine residues of TH was temporally associated with loss of enzymatic activity. The magnitude of inactivation was proportional to the number of TH molecules that were nitrated in PC12 cells. In the mouse striatum, the tyrosine nitration-mediated loss in TH activity parallels the decline in dopamine levels whereas the levels of TH protein remain unchanged for the first 6 h post-MPTP injection (7Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, a recent report indicated that exposure of recombinant purified TH to peroxynitrite in vitro results not only in nitration of tyrosine residues but also in the formation of covalently linked dimers and oxidation of cysteine residues (8Kuhn D.M. Aretha C.W. Geddes T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10289-10294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same report also indicated that cysteine oxidation rather than tyrosine nitration is responsible for the loss of TH enzymatic activity (8Kuhn D.M. Aretha C.W. Geddes T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10289-10294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine appear to be the principal amino acids in proteins modified by peroxynitrite in vitro(9Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). To resolve the apparent differences, the reaction of peroxynitrite with recombinant purified rat TH in vitro was re-examined, and no evidence of cysteine oxidation was found. Oxidation of one cysteine residue per molecule of TH was observed only at high peroxynitrite concentrations, and three cysteine residues were oxidized in partially unfolded protein. Amino acid analysis failed to show any alteration of methionine, tryptophan, or any other amino acid residues. Digestion and sequence analysis of peptides indicated that nitration of tyrosine 423 is the primary residue modified by peroxynitrite, which was further confirmed by a significant decrease in nitration of the Tyr423 → Phe mutant TH expressed inEscherichia coli. In addition, no loss of TH enzymatic activity was detected after peroxynitrite treatment of the Tyr423 → Phe mutant TH. Stopped flow experiments revealed reactivity with the ferrous iron in TH typical of metalloproteins reacting with peroxynitrite (15Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Cassina A.M. Hodara R. Souza J.M. Thomson L. Castro L. Ischiropoulos H. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6689-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The absence of other amino acid modifications at low peroxynitrite concentrations suggests that nitration of tyrosine 423 is responsible for the inactivation of TH by peroxynitrite. Recombinant tyrosine hydroxylase was isolated from BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coliexpressing the full-length cDNA clone isolated from a rat pheochromocytoma library (18Walker S. Liu X. Roskoski R. Vrana K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1206: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). E. coli were grown in LB broth in the presence of 0.1 mm FeSO4 to midlog phase and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for another 2 h. Addition of FeSO4 is essential to retain functional protein, because in the absence of ferrous iron salt, only 60% of the purified GST-TH fusion contained metal (19Quinsey N.S. Lenaghan C.M. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The E. colipellets were suspended in a 10-fold excess of 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.2 (w/v), and homogenized according to the method of Wanget al. (20Wang Y. Citron B.A. Ribeiro P. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mixture was sonicated with four 30-s pulses at 20% power. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume. The mixture was then sonicated with ten 30-s pulses. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and removed. The pellet was resuspended and sonicated once again. The combined supernatants were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The fraction between 30 and 42% was purified further by column chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B. Tyrosine hydroxylase was eluted with a KCl gradient (0–0.7 m) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The purity of peak fractions was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue and was found to be greater than 95%. Tyrosine hydroxylase was assayed by the release of [3H]H2O from [3H]tyrosine in the presence of catalase (21Reinhard Jr., J.F. Smith G.K. Nichol C.A. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Ribeiro P. Pigeon D. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16207-16211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of purified tyrosine hydroxylase was assayed in a volume of 30 μl containing the following additions: 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 1 mm6(R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (Alexis), 1500 units/ml catalase, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm FeSO4, 0.10 mm tyrosine, 500,000 dpm ofl-[ring-3,5-3H]tyrosine (specific activity 50 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, 300 μl of a cold suspension containing 7.5% activated charcoal in 1n HCl was added to each tube. After vortexing and centrifugation, 100 μl of supernatant was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Blanks contained buffer instead of enzyme. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from sodium nitrite and acidified hydrogen peroxide, as previously described (23Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), and treated with manganese dioxide to remove residual hydrogen peroxide. The concentration of peroxynitrite was determined spectrophotometrically by the measurement of absorption at 302 nm in 1 n NaOH (ε = 1670m−1.cm−1). Dilutions in 0.1n NaOH were made immediately before use to achieve the desired concentrations. The protein was first dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. Tyrosine hydroxylase was then diluted to a final concentration of 18 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4, and finally treated with one bolus of 25–500 μm peroxynitrite (1% v/v) at room temperature while stirring. In reverse order experiments, peroxynitrite was added to the buffer before TH addition. The effect of peroxynitrite on TH sulfhydryl content was determined by ThioGlo-1 assay (24Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzene) (DTNB) reaction (25Ellman G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and by labeling with 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide (DAMBI) (26Viner R.I. Williams T.D. Schöneich C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A 26 mm solution of ThioGlo-1 (Covalent Associates Inc., MA) was prepared in acetonitrile. The protein (0.2 μm) was incubated with 7 m guanidine HCl overnight in phosphate buffer, 50 mm, pH 7.4, before ThioGlo-1 addition. ThioGlo-1 (10 μm) was added to the denatured TH, and the incubation was continued for another 7 h at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy with the excitation wavelength set at 384 nm and the emission at 513 nm. The emission values of a series ofN-acetyl-l-cysteine standards modified with ThioGlo-1 were used to establish a standard curve of fluorescence. Amino acid analysis of TH was performed by hydrolyzing the protein either in the gas phase (HCl) or with methanesulfonic acid. Gas phase acid hydrolysis was achieved with 6n HCl and 1% (w/v) phenol under vacuum (∼40 millitorr) at 115 °C for 22 h, as described by Meltzer et al.(27Meltzer N.M. Tous G.I. Gruber S. Stein S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein hydrolysates were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Varian 9012) on an Inertsil C18 ODS3 column (250 × 4.6 mm) using pre-column derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) and absorbance detection at 254 nm (Varian 9050). Samples were dissolved in mobile phase, injected onto the column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (phase A) at 40 °C, and eluted at 1 ml/min by an increase of mobile phase B (75% acetonitrile/25% phase A) to 11% at 15 min, to 14% at 17 min, to 36% at 39 min, and to 45% at 48 min. Amino acids were quantified using the chromatographic peak area, compared with both an amino acid standard (Pierce), and hydrolysis of a known concentration of bovine serum albumin hydrolyzed under similar conditions. Methane sulfonic acid hydrolysis of protein samples was used for the determination of tryptophan, methionine, and methionine sulfoxide, which are usually unstable under conditions of HCl hydrolysis. Samples were hydrolyzed with 4 m methane sulfonic acid at 115 °C for 22 h in an evacuated chamber (∼40 millitorr). After hydrolysis, samples were neutralized by the addition of an equal volume of 3.5m NaOH. They were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-18T column (150 × 4.6 mm), following pre-column derivatization with ortho-phenyldialdehyde (OPA), and fluorescence detection (330 and 450 nm, excitation and emission wavelength, respectively) as described previously (28Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Samples were injected onto the column equilibrated at 35 °C with mobile phase A, containing 95% 25 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) and 5% tetrahydrofuran, and eluted at 0.7 ml/min by the following gradient of mobile phase B (95% methanol and 5% tetrahydrofuran): 0–15% B between 0 and 0.5 min, 15–45% B from 10 to 20 min, and 45–100% B between 30 and 40 min. Amino acids were quantified as described above for the PITC method. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J720 instrument at room temperature in a 0.2-mm path length cell with the concentration of protein being ∼0.2 mg/ml. Curves were baseline-corrected and smoothed by the algorithm provided by Jasco. Mean residue ellipticity, [Θ]MR, is expressed in deg × cm2/dmol using mean residue masses of 110. After treatment with peroxynitrite, TH (0.5 μg) was subjected to a 10%-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with either a polyclonal anti-TH (Calbiochem) or an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody. The blots were blocked with 10% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h, prior to antibody addition. The polyclonal anti- TH antibody was used at 1:10,000 dilution in 1% dry milk for 2 h, and the anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution for 3 h. The anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody was pre-conjugated with the secondary antibody in 3% dry milk overnight at 4 °C. After several washings, probed membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution. After washing, immunoreactive signals were revealed using a chemiluminescence assay (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples containing untreated or peroxynitrite-treated TH were incubated with freshly prepared solution of Streptomyces griseus protease (Pronase, Sigma Chemical Co.) to yield 0.1 mg of protease/mg of protein. Pronase-treated samples were incubated for 18 h at 50 °C and centrifuged through a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off filter. Samples were then dried down, re-suspended in 40 μl of water of HPLC quality, and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. HPLC with electrochemical detection was performed on an ESA model 5600 CoulArray instrument equipped with eight-channel detector operating in the oxidative mode at specified potentials (channel/potential (in mV) = 1, 400; 2, 450; 3, 500; 4, 640; 5, 660; 6, 680; 7, 810; and 8, 810). Analyte separation was conducted on a TOSOHAAS (Montgomeryville, PA) reverse-phase ODS 80-TM C-18 analytical column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 25 cm; 5-μm particle size) using isocratic elution consisted of 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm citric acid, pH 4.7, with 10% methanol. The concentration of 3-nitrotyrosine was determined from the area under the curve using a standard curve of authentic 3-nitrotyrosine from the seventh electrode. The kinetics of peroxynitrite reaction with TH were studied with or without removing the iron from TH. Accordingly, the same preparation of the enzyme was divided in two parts. One fraction was incubated with ferrous ammonium sulfate (1 mm) for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain the holoenzyme with full complement of iron, and the other was dialyzed against 1,10-phenantroline (1 mm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.35 at 4 °C, to obtain the apoenzyme (29Haavik J. Le Bourdelles B. Martinez A. Flatmark T. Mallet J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, fractions of the TH holoenzyme were incubated either with β-mercaptoethanol (10 mm) or withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 10 mm) for 30 min at 4 °C. Enzyme preparations were then extensively dialyzed against 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.35 at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (A 1% = 10.4 cm−1) (29Haavik J. Le Bourdelles B. Martinez A. Flatmark T. Mallet J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which correlated well with Bradford protein measurements. The cysteine content in the enzyme was determined by the reaction of 4 μm protein with 0.2 mm of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzene) (DTNB) in the absence or presence of 6m guanidine at pH 7.8 and room temperature for 90 min. The cysteine concentration was determined by the absorbance at 412 nm (ε = 13,600 m−1·cm−1) (25Ellman G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The rate constant at 37 °C could not be evaluated due to protein aggregation, which significantly interfered with the absorbance determinations. The kinetics of peroxynitrite decay in the presence of TH at pH 7.4 and 25 °C were followed in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, SF17MV) at 302 nm. An initial rate approach was used to analyze the data, the first 1 s was fitted to a linear plot, and the apparent rate constant of peroxynitrite decay was determined as the ratio between the slope (−dA/dt) and the difference between the initial and final absorbance (A o − A f). After subtracting the apparent rate constant of peroxynitrite decay in the absence of enzyme and dividing by the enzyme concentration, we determined the second order rate constant of peroxynitrite reaction with the enzyme. To assure the accuracy of the determination, 200 absorbance measurements were acquired during the first 1 s of the reaction, and 200 points were acquired until more than 99.9% peroxynitrite had decomposed (1–20 s) (13Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Quijano C. Hernandez-Saavedra D. Castro L. McCord J.M.

Un-reacted control or nitrated TH (18 μm) was exhaustively dialyzed against 100 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. The TH samples were then treated with endoproteinase AspN from Pseudomonas fragi(Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, WI) at a ratio 1:100 w/w (proteinase/TH) overnight at 37 °C. The samples were dried down and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were analyzed by a Hewlett Packard HPLC system with a diode array detector using an octadecyl silica gel reverse-phase column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Jupiter, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in ultra pure water (solvent A) and acetonitrile as solvent B. Peptides were eluted using an increasing linear gradient of B from 0% to 45% in 60 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC detector was set at 210, 275, and 365 nm. The peptides with absorbance at 365 nm were collected and subjected to conventional Edman degradation at the Protein Core Facility at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA). To elucidate a possible role for Tyr423 as a substrate for nitration, the mutant Tyr423 → Phe were created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Wild type TH (25 ng) was used as the DNA template to create Tyr423 → Phe. The conditions utilized are outlined in previous studies (31Yohrling I.V.G.J. Mockus S.M. Vrana K.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Vrana K.E. Rucker P. Kumer S.C. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The primers used (but not previously reported) were as follows: TH Y423F Sense, 5′-GCA GCT GTG CAG CCC TTC CAA GAT CAA ACC TAC C-3′; Antisense, 5′-G GTA GGT TTG ATC TTG GAA GGG CTG CAC AGC TGC-3′. The underlined nucleotides highlight the mutated codons for amino acid 423. The DNA Sequencing and Gene Analysis Facility of the Molecular Genetics Program (Wake Forest University School of Medicine) performed a complete DNA sequencing by using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems 377 Prism automated DNA sequencer. Complete DNA sequencing was done to verify the presence of the appropriate mutation in the coding sequences of all recombinant proteins. This also established that the non-polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (Tyr423 → Phe) did not introduce extraneous mutations. All recombinant proteins were expressed using the approach detailed above for the wild type TH. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, the partially purified wild type and Tyr423 → Phe mutant TH (2 mg/ml) were reacted with several concentrations of peroxynitrite under identical conditions, in phosphate buffer (0.1 m) containing DTPA (0.1 mm) at pH 7.4. For some experiments, partially purified wild type and Tyr423 → Phe mutant TH were treated with 5 mm NEM for 2 h at 37 °C. The proteins were then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the activity was determined. The activity of TH was assayed by the release of [3H]H2O from [3H]tyrosine in the presence of catalase. The specific activity of the partially purified Tyr423 → Phe mutant TH was 20% of the wild type TH. Purified recombinant rat TH was reacted with different concentrations of peroxynitrite, and fractions of the treated and control protein were analyzed for activity and for the concentration of reduced cysteine residues. Exposure to peroxynitrite resulted in a dose-dependent inactivation of TH activity (Table I). The concentration of cysteine residues in TH was determined by three different methods: ThioGlo-1, a maleimide-derivatized naphthopyranone, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzene) (DTNB), and 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide (DAMBI) labeling (24Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Ellman G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 26Viner R.I. Williams T.D. Schöneich C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Data in Table I show that in the unreacted protein seven cysteine residues are detected per TH monomer as predicted from the rat TH sequence. No evidence for cysteine oxidation was observed after treatment with up to 250 μm peroxynitrite whereas the TH enzymatic activity was already inhibited by more than 50%. With higher peroxynitrite concentration (500 μm), one cysteine residue per monomer is oxidized. The same results are obtained with DTNB and DAMBI labeling (not shown). These data suggest that TH activity was inhibited after exposure to peroxynitrite without evidence for oxidation of cysteine residues. Moreover, in addition to cysteine oxidation, the reaction of proteins in simple buffers with peroxynitrite has been shown to modify methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine residues (10Pryor W.A. Jin X.

https://openalex.org/W2077972980,"The folding of β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>-m), the protein forming amyloid deposits in dialysis-related amyloidosis, involves formation of a partially folded conformation named I<sub>2</sub>, which slowly converts into the native fold, N. Here we show that the partially folded species I<sub>2</sub> can be separated from N by capillary electrophoresis. Data obtained with this technique and analysis of kinetic data obtained with intrinsic fluorescence indicate that the I<sub>2</sub> conformation is populated to ∼14 ± 8% at equilibrium under conditions of pH and temperature close to physiological. In the presence of fibrils extracted from patients, the I<sub>2</sub> conformer has a 5-fold higher propensity to aggregate than N, as indicated by the thioflavine T test and light scattering measurements. A mechanism of aggregation of β<sub>2</sub>-m <i>in vivo</i> involving the association of the preformed fibrils with the fraction of I<sub>2</sub> existing at equilibrium is proposed from these results. The possibility of isolating and quantifying a partially folded conformer of β<sub>2</sub>-m involved in the amyloidogenesis process provides new opportunities to monitor hemodialytic procedures aimed at the reduction of such species from the pool of circulating β<sub>2</sub>-m but also to design new pharmaceutical approaches that consider such species as a putative molecular target."
https://openalex.org/W2048838964,"A variant of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching allows us to observe the diffusion of photosynthetic complexes in cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes in vivo. The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcussp. PCC7942 is a wonderful model organism for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, because it has a favorable membrane geometry and is well characterized and transformable. In Synechococcus7942 (as in other cyanobacteria) we find that photosystem II is immobile, but phycobilisomes diffuse rapidly on the membrane surface. The diffusion coefficient is 3 × 10−10cm2 s−1 at 30 °C. This shows that the association of phycobilisomes with reaction centers is dynamic; there are no stable phycobilisome-reaction center complexes in vivo. We report the effects of mutations that change the phycobilisome size and membrane lipid composition. 1) In a mutant with no phycobilisome rods, the phycobilisomes remain mobile with a slightly faster diffusion coefficient. This confirms that the diffusion we observe is of intact phycobilisomes rather than detached rod elements. The faster diffusion coefficient in the mutant indicates that the rate of diffusion is partly determined by the phycobilisome size. 2) The temperature dependence of the phycobilisome diffusion coefficient indicates that the phycobilisomes have no integral membrane domain. It is likely that association with the membrane is mediated by multiple weak interactions with lipid head groups. 3) Changing the lipid composition of the thylakoid membrane has a dramatic effect on phycobilisome mobility. The results cannot be explained in terms of changes in the fluidity of the membrane; they suggest that lipids play a role in controlling phycobilisome-reaction center interaction.

The results cannot be explained in terms of changes in the fluidity of the membrane; they suggest that lipids play a role in controlling phycobilisome-reaction center interaction. fluorescence recovery afterphotobleaching Phycobilisomes are the major accessory light-harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria. They consist of large highly ordered aggregates of phycobiliproteins and linker proteins attached to the cytoplasmic surface of the thylakoid membrane (for review see Refs. 1Grossman A.R. Schaefer M.R. Chiang G.G. Collier J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 725-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2MacColl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The structures of some phycobiliproteins and phycobilisome subcomplexes are known to high resolution (1Grossman A.R. Schaefer M.R. Chiang G.G. Collier J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 725-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2MacColl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, in structural terms we know little about the association of phycobilisomes with reaction centers and with the thylakoid membrane. Phycobilisomes have often been assumed to act as the light-harvesting antennae for photosystem II alone. However, energy transfer studies on a photosystem II-free mutant (3Mullineaux C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 71-77Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and wild-type cells (4Mullineaux C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 285-292Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) indicate that phycobilisomes can also interact and efficiently transfer energy to photosystem I. Up to approximately half of the light energy absorbed by phycobilisomes may be transferred to photosystem I, depending on the adaptation of the cells (3Mullineaux C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 71-77Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Specific components of the phycobilisome cores are required for energy transfer to photosystem I as they are for photosystem II (5Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 169-179Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results imply that phycobilisomes can interact structurally with photosystem I as well as with photosystem II. The association of the phycobilisomes with the membrane does not depend on the presence of reaction centers. In vivo, phycobilisomes are assembled and are membrane-associated even when no reaction centers are present (6Yu J. Wu Q. Mao H. Zhao N. Vermaas W.F.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 625-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the association of phycobilisomes with membranes is unclear. Phycobilisomes are largely composed of hydrophilic protein subunits (1Grossman A.R. Schaefer M.R. Chiang G.G. Collier J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 725-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2MacColl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The ApcE protein, a high molecular weight component of the phycobilisome core, seems to play a crucial role in phycobilisome-membrane association (7Redlinger T. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Capuano V. Braux A. Tandeau de Marsac N. Houmard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7239-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sequence analysis did not reveal any likely membrane-spanning domain (9Houmard J. Capuano V. Colombano M.V. Coursin T. Tandeau de Marsac N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2152-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although phase partitioning suggests a hydrophobic region on the protein (10Sidler W.A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1994: 139-216Crossref Google Scholar). It has been suggested that membrane association may be mediated by an acyl group attached to ApcE (11Bald D. Kruip J. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 49: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the deletion of the “PB-loop”, the main candidate for a membrane-association domain, had no obvious effect on phycobilisome assembly or function (12Ajlani G. Vernotte C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phycobilisomes in vitrodissociate into their component subunits, unless they are maintained in quite specific high ionic strength buffers (13Katoh T. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 313-318Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, it is difficult to explore the nature of phycobilisome-membrane coupling in vitro by changing the ionic strength of the medium. Phycobilisomes remain functionally coupled to membranes or reaction centers in vitro in a high phosphate medium (14Clement-Metral J. Gantt E. Redlinger T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and detergent treatment is generally required to separate intact phycobilisomes from thylakoid membranes (15Glazer A.N. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 304-312Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have previously used fluorescence recoveryafter photobleaching (FRAP)1 to probe the mobility of phycobilisomes in vivo in the elongated cyanobacterium Dactylococcopsis salina (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The technique involves the use of a highly focused confocal laser spot to bleach the fluorescent pigments in a line across the cell. Subsequent changes in the bleaching pattern indicate diffusion of the pigment-protein complexes and may be used to calculate the diffusion coefficient (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that phycobilisomes diffused rapidly on the membrane surface, whereas photosystem II was immobile (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The result implies that there are no stable phycobilisome-reaction center complexes (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we, report studies of the mobility of phycobilisomes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942. This organism has thylakoid membranes arranged as regular concentric cylinder aligned along the long axis of the cell (18Sherman D.M. Troyan T.A. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a favorable configuration for our FRAP technique (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Synechococcus 7942 is well characterized and transformable, making it an excellent model system for our studies. The availability of mutants allows us to probe the factors affecting the mobility of the phycobilisomes. We find that phycobilisomes diffuse slightly faster in a mutant in which the phycobilisome rod elements are missing (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), indicating that the size of the phycobilisomes plays a role in determining their rate of diffusion. The temperature dependence of the phycobilisome diffusion coefficient suggests that the phycobilisomes have no integral membrane domain. In a mutant in which the unsaturation of fatty acids in the thylakoid membrane lipids is increased (20Gombos Z. Kanervo E. Tszvetkova N. Sakamoto T. Aro E.-M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), resulting in increased thylakoid membrane fluidity, there is a large and unexpected decrease in phycobilisome mobility, which suggests that lipids play a crucial role in controlling phycobilisome-reaction center interaction. We discuss the possible physiological role(s) of phycobilisome mobility. Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 was grown in BG11 medium (21Castenholz R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 68-93Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 mmNaHCO3. For the R2HECAT mutant (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the growth medium was supplemented with chloramphenicol at 5 μg/ml, and for thedesA+ transformant (20Gombos Z. Kanervo E. Tszvetkova N. Sakamoto T. Aro E.-M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the medium was supplemented with kanamycin at 50 μg/ml. Liquid cultures were grown in an orbital shaking incubator at 30 °C with white illumination at approximately 10 microeinsteins m−2s−1. For use in FRAP measurements, the cells were elongated by treatment with thiobendazole, a treatment that resulted in increased mean cell length without any detectable alteration in photosynthetic function (22Sarcina M. Mullineaux C.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 191: 25-29Crossref Google Scholar). FRAP experiments were carried out at Central Laboratory of the Research Councils Daresbury Laboratory using the scanning confocal microscope Syclops with a 633-nm helium-neon laser or a 442-nm helium-cadmium laser (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was selected using a Schott RG665 red glass filter, transmitting light at above approximately 665 nm. Under these conditions, excitation with 442-nm light allows observation of fluorescence predominantly from photosystem II, and excitation with 633-nm light allows observation of fluorescence predominantly from phycobilisome cores (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cells were spread on 1.5% agar containing BG11 growth medium covered with a glass coverslip and placed on a temperature-controlled stage under the microscope objective lens. A × 40 oil immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.3) was used with 20 μm pinholes to create a confocal spot with full-width at half-maximum dimensions of approximately 0.9 μm in the Z-direction and 0.3 μm in the XY-plane. Cells aligned in the Y-direction were selected. The confocal spot was scanned for approximately 1 s in the X-direction across the middle of the cell to create the bleach. The confocal spot was then scanned in the XY-plane to record a sequence of images of the cell at 3-s intervals. Images were analyzed using Optimas software (Optimas Corporation). A one-dimensional bleaching profile was extracted by integrating across the cell in the X-direction. The base-line fluorescence from the unbleached cell was subtracted, and the bleaching profile was then fitted to a Gaussian curve using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) to obtain a measurement of the bleach depth. Diffusion coefficients were obtained by plotting maximum bleach depthversus time using Equation 1, C(t)=C0R0[R02+8Dt]−1/2Equation 1 where C (t) is the bleach depth at time t, C 0 is the initial bleach depth, R 0 is the initial half-width (1/e2) of the bleach, and D is the diffusion coefficient. The equation describes one-dimensional diffusion in the case where the initial bleaching profile has a Gaussian form (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded in an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 77 K in a Perkin-Elmer LS50 luminescence spectrometer fitted with a liquid nitrogen sample housing. Cells (5 μm chlorophyll in BG11 medium) were injected into 4-mm diameter silica tubes and dark-adapted for 10 min at 30 °C before freezing in liquid nitrogen. The excitation and emission slit-widths were 5 nm. The chlorophylls and phycobilin pigments of cyanobacteria can be selectively excited, allowing the phycobilisomes or the photosystem II reaction centers to be visualized in fluorescence images (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Figs. 1 and2 show FRAP images sequences showing the mobility of photosystem II and phycobilisomes, respectively. In the case of photosystem II (Fig. 1), we could detect no diffusion on the timescale of the measurement. The same result was observed in D. salina (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, phycobilisomes diffused rapidly (Fig. 2). At 30 °C, the average diffusion coefficient for phycobilisomes was (3.1 ± 1.0) × 10−10cm2·s−1. The diffusion coefficient is comparable, although slightly faster than that previously measured inDactylococcopsis (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Synechococcus cells were much smaller than those of Dactylococcopsis, therefore, the experiment was carried out on a smaller scale with a bleach width of approximately 1–2 μm rather than 5–7 μm inDactylococcopsis (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The recovery of fluorescence was much faster in Synechococcus with 90% recovery typically occurring in approximately 5 s rather than 1–2 min as inDactylococcopsis. However, the different time scales reflect the much smaller scale of the Synechococcus experiment rather than any major difference in the diffusion coefficient.Figure 2Phycobilisome diffusion. This figure depicts FRAP image sequence showing fluorescence from the phycobilisomes in wild-type cells of Synechococcus 7942 at 30 °C. The scale bar is 3 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have explored the effect of the phycobilisome size by measuring the phycobilisome diffusion coefficient in a mutant lacking the phycobilisome rod elements. The mutant R2HECAT (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) lacks the cpcA, cpcB,cpcD, cpcE, cpcF, cpcH, andcpcI genes coding for the α- and β-subunits of phycocyanin and rod-linker polypeptides (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, the phycobilisome cores are still assembled and functional (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The phycobilisome cores have a molecular mass of 1200–1300 kDa (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and dimensions of approximately 22 × 11 × 12 nm (23Glazer A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 29-51Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The intact phycobilisomes of wild-type cells are hemidiscoidal structures with a typical molecular mass of approximately 6000 kDa and typically a longest diameter of approximately 60 nm (23Glazer A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 29-51Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). At 30 °C, the mean diffusion coefficient for the phycobilisome cores in R2HECAT was (7.1 ± 0.8) × 10−10cm2·s−1. This result compares with a mean diffusion coefficient of (3.1 ± 1.0) × 10−10cm2·s−1 in the wild-type. This is a significant difference (Student's t test, p= 0.0062). Thus, phycobilisome diffusion at growth temperature is faster by a factor of 2.3 ± 0.7 in the R2HECAT mutant. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient for phycobilisomes provides a way to explore the interaction of the phycobilisomes with the membrane. Upon cooling below normal growth temperature, all biological membranes undergo a lipid phase transition from the liquid-crystalline to the gel phase. In the thylakoid membranes of Synechococcus 7942, this transition occurs at approximately 10 °C below growth temperature,i.e. at around 20 °C (24Murata N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have used FRAP with a lipid-soluble fluorescent marker to show that phase transition decreases the lipid diffusion coefficient by a factor of approximately 6 upon cooling from 30 to 20 °C or below. 2M. Sarcina, M. Tobin, N. Murata, and C. W. Mullineaux, unpublished data. Phase transition would be expected to have a major effect on the lateral mobility of integral membrane proteins. However, we found that temperature does not have a strong influence on the diffusion coefficient of phycobilisomes (Fig. 3). Upon cooling from 30 to 10 °C, there is no significant change in the phycobilisome diffusion coefficient. At the intermediate temperature of 20 °C, phycobilisome diffusion is slightly faster by a factor of 2.1 ± 0.7 (Fig. 3). Mutants in which the thylakoid membrane lipid composition is altered provide a further opportunity to explore the interaction between phycobilisomes and membranes. We have used desA+, a transformant ofSynechococcus 7942 that contains desA,the Δ12 fatty acid desaturase gene from Synechocystis 6803 (20Gombos Z. Kanervo E. Tszvetkova N. Sakamoto T. Aro E.-M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As a result, desA+cells contain approximately 40% 16:2/16:0 and 18:2/16:0 glycerolipids, whereas both species are absent in the wild-type (20Gombos Z. Kanervo E. Tszvetkova N. Sakamoto T. Aro E.-M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fatty acid desaturation would be expected to increase the fluidity of the membrane. We have used FRAP with a fluorescent lipid-soluble marker to show that the lipid diffusion coefficient at 30 °C is approximately six times faster indesA+ cells than it is in the wild-type.2 The effect of desA on phycobilisome diffusion is shown in Figs. 3 and4. Unexpectedly, we found that phycobilisome diffusion was far slower in desA+than in the wild-type (Figs. 3 and 4). At 30 °C, the mean phycobilisome diffusion coefficient indesA+ was (2.5 ± 1.2) 10−12cm2·s−1, slower than in the wild-type by a factor of 120 ± 70 (Fig. 3). Cooling the cells to 20 or 10 °C led to an increase in the phycobilisome diffusion coefficient indesA+ (Fig. 3). Absorption spectra for wild-type and desA+ cells indicated no significant changes in the content of chlorophyll and phycobilins (data not shown). Fluorescence emission spectra recorded with chlorophyll excitation (435 nm) provide an indication of the photosystem II/photosystem I ratio (25Mann N.H. Novac N. Mullineaux C.W. Newman J. Bailey S. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Again, there were no significant differences between wild-type anddesA+ cells. However,desA+ differed significantly from the wild-type in fluorescence emission spectra recorded with phycocyanin (600 nm) excitation (Fig. 5). As compared with the wild-type, desA+ showed a blue shift in the phycocyanin fluorescence peak at approximately 650 nm and a marked increase in fluorescence at 680 nm. This peak comes both from photosystem II and from long wavelength pigments in the phycobilisome core. A specific increase in this peak with no comparable increase in the photosystem II peak at 695 nm suggests a decrease in the efficiency of energy transfer from phycobilisomes to reaction centers (5Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 169-179Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results show that phycobilisomes in Synechococcus 7942 diffuse rapidly, whereas the photosystem II reaction centers are immobile (Figs. 1 and 2). We previously found the same pattern in another cyanobacterium, D. salina (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In qualitative terms we have found the same pattern in other cyanobacteria, includingSynechocystis 6803 (data not shown), although the small size and unfavorable membrane conformation of Synechocystis means that we cannot measure diffusion coefficients accurately in this cyanobacterium. The results indicate that the association between phycobilisomes and reaction centers is transient and unstable (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar,26van Thor J.J. Mullineaux C.W. Matthijs H.C.P. Hellingwerf K.J. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 430-443Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and that this is generally the case in cyanobacteria. The phycobilisome diffusion coefficients measured inSynechococcus (Fig. 3) and Dactylococcopsis (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are not very different; the mean diffusion coefficient at growth temperature is faster by a factor of approximately 2 inSynechococcus. We have interpreted our FRAP results in terms of the movement of intact phycobilisomes (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26van Thor J.J. Mullineaux C.W. Matthijs H.C.P. Hellingwerf K.J. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 430-443Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), because we excite the phycobilisomes with short wavelength light predominantly absorbed by phycocyanin in the phycobilisome rods and observe long-wavelength fluorescence predominantly from the phycobilisome cores (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the spectral overlap makes it hard to completely exclude an alternative possibility that the phycobilisome cores are immobile and that the diffusion we see is of rod elements, which may not be stably coupled to the phycobilisome cores in vivo. We have further investigated this problem using a mutant (R2HECAT), which lacks phycobilisome rods but contains stably assembled and functional phycobilisome cores (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We find that the phycobilisomes are mobile in this mutant. Because the rod elements are lacking, the cores must be moving. Thus, the diffusion we observe in the wild-type is most probably that of intact fully assembled phycobilisomes. The diffusion of many membrane-associated proteins is strongly influenced by the interactions in the cytoplasmic domain. There are several proteins in which truncation of the cytoplasmic domain leads to an increased lateral diffusion coefficient (27Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both specific and nonspecific interactions with cytosolic components can contribute to a drag, which reduces lateral mobility (27Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cytosolic crowding is likely to have a major influence on the diffusion rate of any component of the cytoplasmic domain with the diffusion of large molecules being impeded more than that of small molecules (28Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Phycobilisomes are large protein complexes predominantly in the cytoplasm. They are present in high concentrations covering much of the cytoplasmic surface of the thylakoid membrane (29Mustardy L. Cunningham F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The R2HECAT mutant (19Bhalerao R.P. Gillbro T. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) gives us the opportunity to investigate the extent to which phycobilisome mass, crowding, and drag in the cytoplasmic phase influence the rate of diffusion of the phycobilisomes. Because the mutant contains only phycobilisome cores, the phycobilisomes are effectively approximately three times smaller in terms of longest diameter and five times smaller in terms of mass (23Glazer A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 29-51Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We find that at growth temperature the phycobilisomes diffuse slightly faster in R2HECAT than in the wild-type; the mean diffusion coefficient is faster by a factor of 2.3 ± 0.7. Thus, we can observe a small but significant effect of reducing the phycobilisome size. Phycobilisomes interact with the membrane whether or not reaction centers are present. Phycobilisomes are assembled and are membrane-associated even in the absence of photosystem II (30Bittersmann E. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1098: 105-116Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), photosystem I (31Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), or both reaction centers (6Yu J. Wu Q. Mao H. Zhao N. Vermaas W.F.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 625-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, detergent treatment is still required to isolate intact phycobilisomes, indicating a strong interaction with the membrane (6Yu J. Wu Q. Mao H. Zhao N. Vermaas W.F.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 625-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when phycobilisomes diffuse, we imagine them decoupling from a reaction center but remaining attached to the membrane surface. The phycobilisome will then diffuse freely on the membrane surface before coupling to another reaction center (16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the interaction of the phycobilisomes with the membrane is unclear. The ApcE protein or “anchor polypeptide” of the phycobilisome core is implicated in the interaction with the membrane (7Redlinger T. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Capuano V. Braux A. Tandeau de Marsac N. Houmard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7239-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Houmard J. Capuano V. Colombano M.V. Coursin T. Tandeau de Marsac N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2152-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Proposals for the association of ApcE with the membrane have included an integral membrane domain (7Redlinger T. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or a covalently attached acyl group (11Bald D. Kruip J. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 49: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, we found that cooling below the phase transition temperature of the membrane had no significant effect on the mobility of phycobilisomes (Fig. 3). Under the same conditions, the diffusion coefficient of a lipid-soluble fluorescent marker was reduced by a factor of six.2 This finding strongly suggests that there is no integral membrane component of any kind in the phycobilisome. Instead, we propose that phycobilisomes interact with lipid head groups at the membrane surface. A precedent for this kind of interaction is spectrin, a component of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Spectrin is proposed to interact with the membrane via multiple weak interactions with lipid head groups (32O'Toole P.J. Wolfe C. Ladha S. Cherry R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1419: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As with phycobilisomes, spectrin can diffuse rapidly on the membrane surface, and the diffusion coefficient is not strongly affected by cooling to the phase transition temperature of the membrane (32O'Toole P.J. Wolfe C. Ladha S. Cherry R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1419: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the individual protein-lipid interactions are weak, multiple interactions lead to a strong association with the membrane surface (32O'Toole P.J. Wolfe C. Ladha S. Cherry R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1419: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have measured the rates of phycobilisome diffusion in cells of the desA+transformant, which contains approximately 40% of glycerolipids with diunsaturated acyl chains, species that are absent in the wild-type (20Gombos Z. Kanervo E. Tszvetkova N. Sakamoto T. Aro E.-M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This process results in a lower phase transition temperature and a more fluid thylakoid membrane. Unexpectedly, we found that phycobilisome diffusion was slower in desA+, by a factor of approximately 120 at 30 °C (Figs. 3 and 4). This cannot be a direct consequence of the membrane fluidity change, because the membrane is more fluid in desA+. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the interaction with the reaction centers is stabilized in desA+. We know that photosystem II is immobile (Fig. 1). Therefore, if the binding of phycobilisomes to photosystem II is stabilized, the diffusion coefficient for phycobilisomes will be reduced. Changes in low temperature fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 5) also suggest an altered phycobilisome-reaction center interaction indesA+. How could lipid desaturation alter phycobilisome-reaction center interaction? Perhaps specific lipids or the general lipid environment of the membrane play a crucial role in mediating phycobilisome-reaction center interaction. It is also possible that the effect is indirect, the change in phycobilisome-reaction center coupling may be a physiological response to some alteration in conditions in the desA+cells. Whichever possibility is correct, it is clear that the lipid composition of the membrane strongly influences the interaction of phycobilisomes with reaction centers. It would be very interesting to observe the diffusion of phycobilisomes in mutants lacking photosystem II or photosystem I reaction centers. We would predict that phycobilisomes should diffuse faster in such mutants. Unfortunately, such mutants are not available in Synechococcus 7942, which is an obligate photoautotroph (33Zhang C.-C. Jeanjean R. Joset F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 285-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants lacking photosystem II and/or photosystem I have been made in Synechocystis 6803 (34Vermaas W.F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 181-186Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Synechococcus 7002 (35Shen G. Bryant D.A. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but the small cell size of these organisms precludes quantitative FRAP measurements.2 Phycobilisome mobility is characteristic of all of the cyanobacteria that we have examined including D. salina(16Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar), Synechococcus 7942 (this study), and several other species (data not shown). What physiological role(s) could it play? Three possible explanations are explored below. The physiological adaptation mechanism known as state transitions involves the redistribution of phycobilisomes between photosystem II and photosystem I. This mechanism presumably requires movement of the phycobilisomes (26van Thor J.J. Mullineaux C.W. Matthijs H.C.P. Hellingwerf K.J. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 430-443Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, state transitions occur on a time scale of a few seconds to approximately a minute. At the diffusion rates we observe, we can estimate that a phycobilisome could diffuse from photosystem II to photosystem I in approximately 15 ms, assuming a typical concentration of reaction centers in the membrane exists (17Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the rate at which state transitions occur is controlled by the signal transduction pathway rather than by the diffusion of the complexes. We could predict that state transitions could still occur whether the diffusion rate of phycobilisomes were hundreds of times slower. In fact, we found that state transitions occur normally in thedesA+ transformant (data not shown), although phycobilisome diffusion is approximately 120 times slower than in the wild-type (Fig. 3). Phycobilisomes are large complexes that normally occupy much of the cytoplasmic surface of the thylakoid membrane (29Mustardy L. Cunningham F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It could be argued that phycobilisome mobility is necessary to allow the access of ribosomes, proteases, and regulatory enzymes to the membrane surface in order to allow synthesis, turnover, and regulation of thylakoid membrane components. One prediction of this idea would be that the turnover of the D1 polypeptide should be slower in the desA+ transformant in which phycobilisome mobility is greatly reduced. However, it appears that D1 turnover is actually faster in desA+ than in the wild-type (36Sippola K. Kanervo E. Murata N. Aro E.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phycobilisomes are mobile on the same time scale as the secondary electron transport reactions. Could phycobilisomes decouple from photochemically “closed” reaction centers and reassociate with open reaction centers, thus minimizing the wasteful transfer of excitons to closed reaction centers? In this model, phycobilisome mobility would be a way to allow a limited pool of phycobilisomes to act as efficient light-harvesting antennae for a much larger pool of reaction centers. The altered phycobilisome mobility in the desA+and R2HECAT mutants will provide us with an approach to test these ideas. We thank Petter Gustafsson (University of Umeå, Sweden) for the gift of the R2HECAT mutant and Norio Murata (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan) for the gift of the desA+ transformant."

We previously showed that NRG mediates survival of PC12-ErbB4 cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or tumor necrosis factor-α treatment. In the present study we show that NRG induces a significant protective effect from H2O2-induced death. This effect of NRG is mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathway since NRG failed to rescue cells from H2O2 insult in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. Furthermore, the downstream effector of PI3K, protein kinase B/AKT, is activated by NRG in the presence of H2O2, and protein kinase B/AKT activation is inhibited by LY294002. In addition, our results demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation induced by H2O2 is inhibited by NRG. LY294002, which blocks NRG-mediated rescue, increases ROS levels. Moreover, both H2O2-induced ROS elevation and cell death are reduced by expression of activated PI3K. These results suggest that PI3K-dependent pathways may regulate toxic levels of ROS generated by oxidative stress.

NRG and its receptors mediate various biological effects depending on the cell type examined. Several studies exist to demonstrate that NRG can serve as a differentiation factor for astrocytes (10Pinkas-Kramarski R. Eilam R. Spiegler O. Lavi S. Liu N. Chang D. Wen D. Schwartz M. Yarden Y.

Moreover, it was demonstrated that axon-derived neuregulin promotes oligodendrocyte survival in the developing rat optic nerve (15Fernandez P.A. Tang D.G. Cheng L. Prochiantz A. Mudge A.W. Raff M.C. Neuron. 2000; 28: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and that neuregulin in the central nervous system diminishes autoimmune demyelination, promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor expansion, and enhances remyelination (16Marchionni M.A. Cannella B. Hoban C. Gao Y.L. Garcia-Arenas R. Lawson D. Happel E. Noel F. Tofilon P. Gwynne D. Raine C.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 468: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, neuregulin affects neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth of developing rat retina (17Bermingham-McDonogh O. McCabe K.L. Reh T.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1427-1438PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by several cellular metabolic reactions. Cells also possess antioxidant systems to control the redox state, which is important for their survival. ROS that cause oxidative stress have been implicated in several diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (18Dreher D. Junod A.F. Eur. J.

In addition, several studies indicate that nontoxic levels of ROS may play an essential role as signaling molecules regulating cell growth and differentiation (20Mills E.M. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X.

Oxidative stress such as H2O2treatment induces apoptotic cell death in both PC12 cells and cultured neurons (25Enokido Y. Hatanaka H.

The PC12 cell model has been extensively used to study the signaling pathways leading to neuronal differentiation induced by neurotrophins such as NGF compare with the signaling pathways leading to mitogenesis induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (27Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Dichter M.A. Tischler A.S. Greene L.A.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that many growth factors and neurotrophins can promote neuronal survival of several classes of neurons. Among these factors are insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NGF, NT3, and NT4/5 (32Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 33Chen M.G. Chen J.S. Calissano P. Levi-Montalcini R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The PC12 system has also been used to study the effects of neurotrophic factors on cell survival. After stimulation by tumor necrosis factor-α or when deprived of growth factors, these cells die apoptotically, and NGFs can maintain their long term survival (34Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 35Haviv R. Stein R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The survival effect induced by NGFs in PC12 cells requires the activation of the PI3K-signaling pathway (37Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F.

It was also demonstrated that NGF protects PC12 cells and neurons from oxidative stress-induced death (39Kamata H. Tanaka C. Yagisawa H. Hirata H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 212: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that ErbB-4 receptor stably expressed in PC12 cells mediate NRG-induced signals and neurite outgrowth that is indistinguishable from those mediated by NGF-activated Trk receptor (40Vaskovsky A. Lupowitz Z. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that NRG rescues PC12-ErbB-4 cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or tumor necrosis factor treatment (41Erlich S. Goldshmidt Y. Lupowitz Z. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because in various pathological conditions oxidative stress may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and NRGs mediate similar effects as NGFs, we examined the effect of NRGs on H2O2-induced toxicity and analyzed the intracellular mechanism of the NRG-mediated protection from oxidative stress. Epidermal growth factor (human recombinant) was purchased from Sigma. NGF (mouse submaxillary gland) was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Human recombinant NRGβ was from R&D Systems Inc. A monoclonal anti-phosphorylated PKB/Akt and a monoclonal anti Pan-PKB/Akt antibody were from New England BioLabs Inc. 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was purchased from Sigma. PD98059 was purchased from Promega (Madison, MI). LY294002 and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. Solubilization buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. PC12 cells and PC12 cells that express ErbB-4 (40Vaskovsky A. Lupowitz Z. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics, 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 7.5% horse serum (HS). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air, and the medium was changed every 3–4 days. Cells were passaged when 90% confluent using 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells were induced to differentiate by growing on collagen-coated plates at 2 × 104 cells/ml in the presence of 50 ng/ml NGF for 7 days. Before experiments were performed, cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were resuspended and seeded on collagen-coated 96-well plates at 7.5 × 103cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS and 2.5% HS and treated without or with H2O2 for 30 min in the presence or absence of either NRG or NGF at 50 ng/ml for comparison of long term factor activity. Cell survival was determined by using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl]tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which determines mitochondrial activity in living cells (42Mosman T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46225) Google Scholar). 0.1 mg/ml MTT was incubated with the analyzed cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Living cells can transform the tetrazolium ring into dark blue formazan crystals, which can be quantified by reading the optical density at 550–650 nm after lysis of the cells with acidic isopropanol. Staining of nuclei with the fluorescent DNA dye 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was used to estimate the number of dying cells. Cells were scored for apoptosis by nuclear morphology. Treated cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, washed three times with PBS, and then stained with DAPI solution (1 μg/ml) for 10 min. After washing with PBS and mounting, the cells were photographed. The instrument used was an Olympus optical inverted phase-contrast microscope model IX70 (×20 magnification). Cells were exposed to the indicated stimuli. After treatment, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. For direct electrophoretic analysis, boiling gel sample buffer was added to cell lysates. Lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 10% gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 0.02m Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 6% milk and blotted with 1 μg/ml primary antibodies for 2 h followed by 0.5 μg/ml secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Measurement of intracellular ROS generation was determined using the DCFH-DA assay (43Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). DCHF-DA was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with DMEM lacking phenol red to a final concentration of 100 μm. Cells were plated on collagen-coated 48-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% FBS and 7.5% HS. After 24 h, medium was replaced by DMEM containing 2.5% FBS and 2.5% HS for 1 h. Cells were treated for 30 min with 0.5 mm H2O2 in the presence or absence of the indicated growth factors or drugs. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing growth factors or drugs for the indicated time periods. Cells were then loaded with 100 μm DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C. The loading was terminated by washing the cells with DMEM lacking phenol red containing 2.5% FBS and 2.5% HS. The cells were either photographed by an Olympus optical inverted phase-contrast microscope model IX70 (×100 magnification), or the DCF fluorescence was monitored using a microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-TEK Instruments, FL500) with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength 530 nm. The increase in fluorescence for each treatment was calculated by the relative fluorescence of each treatment compared with the control untreated cells normalized by the number of cells as determined by the MTT assay. One day before transfection, PC12-ErbB-4 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. To each well 300 μl of DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture (2 μg of DNA and 30 μg of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.)) were added according to the manufacture's instructions. Each transfection was performed four times. After incubation of cells for 5 h with the DNA LipofectAMINE mixture, equal volume of fresh medium was added, and incubation was continued. Medium was replaced 24 h later, and cells were treated with H2O2 for 30 min. The viability of the transfected cells in all experiments was monitored 72 h after transfection by measuring the activity of SEAP in the medium of the transfected cells. The ratio of the different DNA species in each transfection was 10:1 for pSG5/5′MycTp110αCAAX or pcDNA3 and reporter plasmid (secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)). The vector pSG5/5′MycTp110αCAAX was obtained from Prof. J. Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) (44Wennström S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). pCMV-SEAP was obtained from Prof. R. Stein (Tel-Aviv University, Israel). SEAP activity was assayed as described previously (45Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene. 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium (200 μl) from transfected cells was collected and spun for 2 min at 10,000 ×g. The supernatant was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, and then aliquots (25 μl) from each treatment were incubated with 200 μl of SEAP buffer (1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm l-homoarginine) containing 5 mg/mlp-nitrophenylphosphate at 37 °C until a yellow color developed. The plates were read on a micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at wavelength 405 nm. We used PC12 cells stably expressing the ErbB-4 receptor (40Vaskovsky A. Lupowitz Z. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to study the effect of NRG on oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was induced by H2O2. Exposure of the cells to 0.5 mm H2O2 for 30 min induced a marked reduction in cell viability resulting in 80% cell death 3 days post-treatment (Fig. 1). The death induced by H2O2 treatment appeared to have the characteristics of apoptosis; the cells shrunk and their nuclei were condensed or fragmented (Fig. 2). Treatment of the PC12-ErbB-4 cells with NRG (100 ng/ml) completely abolished the H2O2-induced toxicity (Fig. 1). NGF (50 ng/ml) furnished a comparable protection from the H2O2-induced cell death. We next examined whether NRG can also protect differentiated PC12-ErbB-4 cells that exhibit a sympathetic neuronal cell phenotype from H2O2-induced cell death. For this aim, we performed experiments using PC12-ErbB-4 cells that were induced to differentiate by NGF treatment for 1 week. Early experiments showed that the differentiated cells were more resistant to cell death induced by H2O2 (not shown). However H2O2 at a concentration of 1 mminduced cell death comparable with that observed with 0.5 mm in the non-differentiated cells. As shown in Figs. 1 and2, incubation of differentiated PC12-ErbB-4 cells with NRG or with NGF inhibited apoptotic cell death induced by 1 mmH2O2.Figure 2NRG-rescue from apoptosis induced by H2O2 treatment. PC12-ErbB-4 cells were tested for nuclei morphology analysis. PC12-ErbB-4 cultures were grown and treated as described in Fig. 1. The incubation was terminated by cell fixation and staining with the DNA-intercalating dye 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindol dihydrochloride (DAPI). A, the resulting fluorescent photomicrographs are shown. B, quantification of the results presented in A was performed by counting 20 random fields (about 100 cells/field). Condensed or fragmented nuclei were considered as apoptotic cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells were calculated from the total cell number in the field. Note that in H2O2 treatment, more apoptotic nuclei are observed although the total number of cells is reduced because of cell death. The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. of 20 determinations. CON, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine which signaling pathway is involved in the protective effect of NRG in H2O2-treated PC12-ErbB-4 cells, we used pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002), Erk (PD98059), p38 (SB203580), and protein kinase C (GF109203X). These are prominent signaling pathways known to be activated by NRG (46Pinkas-Kramarski R. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were treated for 30 min with H2O2 in the absence or presence of NRG (100 ng/ml) and in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3, none of the inhibitors except LY294002 could block the NRG-mediated protection from H2O2-induced cell death. This was apparent in both the differentiated and the non-differentiated cells (Fig. 3). We have previously shown that PI3K inhibition induces apoptosis of PC12-ErbB-4 cells, namely, cell death occurs also in the presence of NGF or NRG (41Erlich S. Goldshmidt Y. Lupowitz Z. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The addition of LY294002 as well as other inhibitors (not shown) by themselves could reduce cell viability (78% cell death induced by LY294002). These results suggest that inhibition of PI3K pathway (and also other signaling pathways) has a toxic effect on the cells and that the toxic effect of PI3K inhibitor is not prevented by activation of ErbB-4. However, the toxic effect of the other inhibitors used was prevented by NRG (41Erlich S. Goldshmidt Y. Lupowitz Z. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The inability of NRG to rescue cells after treatment with LY294002 indicates that PI3K activity may be required for the NRG protection from H2O2-induced cell death and encouraged us to further investigate the involvement of PI3K activation induced by NRG. Because PI3K and its downstream effector PKB/Akt are frequently associated with cell survival, we examined whether PKB/Akt is involved in the PI3K-dependent protection of NRG from H2O2-induced cell death. As shown in Fig.4 A, NRG, but not H2O2, induced sustained PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Although in the presence of H2O2, NRG-induced activation of PKB/Akt was reduced, a significant sustained activation was observed. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited the NRG-induced activation of PKB/Akt both in the presence or absence of H2O2(Fig. 4 B). Taken together the results presented in Figs. 3and 4 indicate that PI3K and PKB/Akt activation may be involved in the NRG-mediated rescue of PC12-ErbB-4 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. Previous studies demonstrated that H2O2 could induce ROS elevation in PC12 cells and that a marked elevation in ROS leads to cell death (47Calderon F.H. Bonnefont A. Munoz F.J. Fernandez V. Videla L.A. Inestrosa N.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway is involved in NRG-mediated rescue of PC12-ErbB-4 cells from H2O2-induced death, we examined the effect of NRG on ROS generation. Cells were plated in 48-well collagen-coated plates at a density of 105cells/well in media containing 2.5% HS and 2.5% FBS. Wells were pretreated with 20 μm LY294002 for 1 h and then treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 with or without NRG (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. The medium was then replaced, and NRG and LY294002 treatments were continued for 48 h. After 48 h, medium was replaced to DMEM without phenol red, and cells were preloaded with 100 μm DCFH-DA for 30 min. After two washes, DCF fluorescence intensity was measured, and the number of cells was determined by the MTT assay. The relative DCF fluorescence was determined relative to cell number. As shown in Fig.5 A, H2O2 treatment induced a dramatic increase in ROS levels. NRG blocked the H2O2-induced elevation in ROS (Fig. 5). Consistent with the involvement of PI3K in the protection induced by NRG, LY294002 blocked the NRG-mediated reduction in ROS levels as measured by DCF-fluorescence (Fig. 5,B and C). These results indicate that NRG can abolish the H2O2-induced production of ROS and that PI3K mediates this effect. To further examine the role of PI3K in rescue from oxidative stress induced by H2O2we transfected PC12-ErbB-4 cells with the constitutively active PI3K expression vectors (p110-CAAX). The constitutive activity of PI3K in the transfected cells was confirmed by measuring phosphorylation of Akt, as can be seen in Fig.6 A. In subsequent experiments cells were co-transfected with p110-CAAX or empty vector (pcDNA3) and SEAP reporter gene. The effect of constitutively active PI3K on viability of H2O2-treated cells was examined by SEAP activity in the co-transfected cultures. As shown in Fig.6 B, transfection with p110-CAAX increased the activity of SEAP in both H2O2-treated and in untreated cells. SEAP activity in the pcDNA3-transfected cells was reduced after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 6 B). These results show that constitutively active PI3K can rescue PC12-ErbB4 cells from oxidative stress. In addition, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the survival effect of activated PI3K (Fig.6 B). In a different set of experiments, cells were transiently co-transfected with p110-CAAX expression vector or empty vector (pcDNA3) and red fluorescent plasmid (pDsRed1). This enabled visualization of the co-transfected cells. One-day post-transfections cells were treated with H2O2 as described above, and 3 h or 2 days post-treatment they were loaded with the fluorophore DCFH-DA. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 6, C and D. As shown, H2O2 increased ROS levels in the cells at 3 h and 2 days post-H2O2 treatment, and this increase was blocked in cells that express the activated PI3K. These results suggest that PI3K activity can regulate ROS levels even in the absence of NRG. Taken together these results and the ability of PI3K inhibitor to block NRG-mediated rescue and to block NRG inhibition of ROS elevation induced by H2O2 indicate that the PI3K pathway may function as a junction to regulate toxic levels of ROS in the cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to neuronal dysfunction under a variety of pathological conditions. Previous studies showed that NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor can rescue neuronal and PC12 cells from death induced by oxidative stress. In the present study, we demonstrate that NRG protects PC12-ErbB-4 cells from oxidative stress via the PI3K-PKB/Akt-dependent pathway. We show that the protective effects of NRG are mediated by modulation of ROS levels in the cells and that this modulation depends on the PI3K pathway. Specifically, we show that H2O2induces ROS elevation and death of PC12-ErbB-4 cells, where activation of PI3K by NRG inhibited ROS production and cell death. Indeed, overexpression of activated PI3K reduced the toxic levels of ROS in the cells and protected them from H2O2-induced death. These results are schematically summarized in Fig.7. Oxidative stress including H2O2 treatment results in activation of several signaling pathways (48Rhee S.G. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). These pathways include the p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and Erk pathways, which can mediate a variety of cellular responses. It was previously shown that NRG can activate p38-, Erk-, and PI3K-signaling pathways (49Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin J.B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 50Daly J.M. Olayioye M.A. Wong A.M. Neve R. Lane H.A. Maurer F.G. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3440-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Using the p38 inhibitor SB203580, we demonstrated that inhibition of the p38-signaling pathway does not prevent NRG-mediated rescue from H2O2-induced cell death. Several studies demonstrate that NGF, epidermal growth factor, and NRG can increase Erk activation. It was demonstrated that sustained Erk activation correlates with neuronal differentiation, and transient Erk activation correlates with cell proliferation (31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 40Vaskovsky A. Lupowitz Z. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J.

In the present study we found that PD98059, the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor, did not inhibit NRG-mediated survival. Together these results indicate that in PC12-ErbB4 cells, p38 and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways do not mediate NRG-induced rescue from H2O2. Although PI3K is a well known signaling pathway involved in cell protection under various stresses, little is known about its role in protection against oxidative stress. One of the downstream effectors of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt. Akt is involved in promotion of cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis and possibly plays a role in PI3K-mediated neuronal cell survival (53Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway delivers an anti-apoptotic signal in human glioblastoma against H2O2-induced apoptosis (54Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that in cardiomyocytes, the PI3K-PKB/Akt-S6K pathway promotes cell survival against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (55Hong F. Kwon S.J. Jhun B.S. Kim S.S. Ha J. Kim S.J. Sohn N.W. Kang C. Kang I. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that NRG protects PC12-ErbB-4 cells from H2O2-induced death (Figs. 1 and 2). The protection conveyed by NRG is mediated via the PI3K pathway because LY294002 inhibited this effect (Fig. 3). In addition, we show that NRG activates PKB/Akt in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Also, LY294002 inhibits NRG-induced PKB/Akt activation in the presence and in the absence of H2O2 (Fig. 4). These results indicate that PI3K-PKB/Akt pathways regulate NRG-mediated rescue from H2O2-induced cell death. ROS such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and H2O2 are continuously produced by the cells, and their levels are regulated by a number of enzymes and physiological antioxidants. Excessive generation of ROS has been associated with cytotoxicity in a variety of pathological conditions and in both PC12 and cultured neurons (25Enokido Y. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1990; 536: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Kamata H. Tanaka C. Yagisawa H. Hirata H. Neurosci.

Neurotrophins regulate neuronal survival and are neuroprotective in certain models of injury including oxidative stress (58Perez-Polo J.R. Foreman P.J. Jackson G.R. Shan D. Taglialatela G.

It was previously shown that NGF is able to protect PC12 cells from oxidative stress by increasing catalase activity and GSH levels (61Jackson G.R. Apffel L. Werrbach-Perez K. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 62Pan Z. Perez-Polo R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that NRG reduces ROS levels in H2O2-treated PC12-ErbB-4 cells (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the effect of NRG on cell viability may be because of the reduction in ROS levels. Moreover, our results demonstrate that PI3K inhibitor, which in itself blocks NRG-mediated rescue also blocks the NRG-mediated reduction in H2O2-induced ROS elevation. Thus, ROS levels appear to be regulated by PI3K. Consistent with this notion, the H2O2-induced ROS elevation and cell death were blocked by the expression of activated PI3K (Fig. 6). Hence, we suggest that PI3K-dependent pathways may regulate toxic levels of ROS generated by oxidative stress. We thank Prof. Y. Kloog for critically reading this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1565835249,"The PDX-1 homeodomain transcription factor regulates pancreatic development and adult islet β cell function. Expression of the <i>pdx-1</i> gene is almost exclusively localized to β cells within the adult endocrine pancreas. Islet β cell-selective transcription is controlled by evolutionarily conserved subdomain sequences (termed Areas I (−2839 to −2520 base pairs (bp)), II (−2252 to −2023 bp), and III (−1939 to −1664 bp)) found within the 5′-flanking region of the <i>pdx-1</i> gene. Areas I and II are independently capable of directing β cell-selective reporter gene activity in transfection assays, with Area I-mediated stimulation dependent upon binding of hepatic nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β), a key regulator of islet β cell function. To identify other transactivators of Area I, highly conserved sequence segments within this subdomain were mutagenized, and their effect on activation was determined. Several of the sensitive sites were found by transcription factor data base analysis to potentially bind endodermally expressed transcription factors, including HNF1α (−2758 to −2746 bp, Segment 2), HNF4 (−2742 to −2730 bp, Segment 4; −2683 to −2671 bp, Segment 7–8), and HNF6 (−2727 to −2715 bp, Segment 5). HNF1α, but not HNF4 and HNF6, binds specifically to Area I sequences <i>in vitro</i>. HNF1α was also shown to specifically activate Area I-driven transcription through Segment 2. In addition, PDX-1 itself was found to stimulate Area I activation. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay performed with PDX-1 antisera also demonstrated that this factor bound to Area I within the endogenous <i>pdx-1</i> gene in β cells. Our results indicate that regulatory factors binding to Area I conserved sequences contribute to the selective transcription pattern of the <i>pdx-1</i> gene and that control is mediated by endodermal regulators like HNF1α, HNF3β, and PDX-1."
https://openalex.org/W1981626036,"We demonstrated previously that the integral membrane protein giantin has the Golgi localization signal at the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Misumi, Y., Sohda, M., Tashiro, A., Sato, H., and Ikehara, Y. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 6867–6873). In the present study, using this domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified a novel protein interacting with giantin. The 3.6-kilobase mRNA encoding a 528-amino acid protein of 60 kDa designated GCP60 was ubiquitously expressed and was especially abundant in the testis and ovary. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that GCP60 was co-localized with giantin in the Golgi complex. GCP60 was found to be a peripheral protein associated with the Golgi membrane, where a COOH-terminal domain of GCP60 interacts with the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of giantin. Overexpression of the COOH-terminal domain of GCP60 caused disassembly of the Golgi structure and blocked protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Taken together, these results suggest that GCP60 is involved in the maintenance of the Golgi structure by interacting with giantin, affecting protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi.

Taken together, these results suggest that GCP60 is involved in the maintenance of the Golgi structure by interacting with giantin, affecting protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein glutathioneS-transferase N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I fused with GFP polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus acyl-CoA binding motif-like charged amino acid-rich The Golgi complex is comprised of structurally distinct subcompartments and plays a key role in sorting and modification of proteins exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 (1Rothman J.E.

Protein transport from the ER to the Golgi and through the Golgi compartments is mediated by small vesicles and requires a number of soluble and membrane proteins (1Rothman J.E. Orci L.

These include coat protein complex (COPI and COPII) and the GTPases ARF and Sar1p for vesicle budding,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein (SNAP), and SNAP receptors for vesicle docking and fusion. In addition, p115 is known to function in tethering of vesicles with membranes before their complete docking (6Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.S. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J.

Available evidence indicates that the vesicular transport system functions not only in the delivery of proteins to their final destinations but also in maintenance of the Golgi structure. Brefeldin A blocks the budding and formation of transport vesicles by inhibiting a GDP/GTP exchange of ARF (8Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D.

The inhibition of vesicular transport causes redistribution of Golgi components to the ER, resulting in disassembly of the Golgi stack (10Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y.

The Golgi structure is reformed immediately after removal of the drug. These observations suggest that the Golgi structure is maintained by vesicular transport-dependent supply of the resident Golgi components and their balanced recycling between the ER and Golgi. Despite these findings, the mechanism for vesicular transport alone may not be sufficient to explain the formation of the unique Golgi structure with the ordered stacking, close apposition, and constant spacing of stacked cisternae in mammalian cells. There must be other components that would be responsible for the formation or structural arrangement of the subcompartments in the Golgi complex. Attempts on this line, mostly using antibodies from patients with autoimmune diseases, have identified an increasing number of new Golgi-associated proteins. These proteins, named the golgin family, have a long coiled-coil domain and include cytoplasmic peripheral proteins such as golgin-245/p230 (14Fritzler M.J. Lung C.-C. Hamel J.C. Griffith K.J.

Although the functions of these Golgi proteins remain largely unknown, GM130 was found to be involved in tethering of transport vesicles to the Golgi membrane by interacting with p115 (6Sönnichsen B.

In addition, recent studies have shown that giantin is also present in COPI vesicles and interacts with p115, contributing to the formation of a tethering bridge before vesicle docking (6Sönnichsen B.

Giantin contains a large NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain (>370 kDa) and a COOH-terminal membrane-anchoring domain without a luminal extension (22Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 23Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Funct. 1997; 22: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized protein is initially inserted into the ER membrane and then transported to the Golgi (27Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our previous study has demonstrated that giantin contains the Golgi localization signal at the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of about 100 residues adjacent to the membrane anchor domain (28Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggests that giantin is localized to the Golgi membrane by a protein-protein interaction rather than by the protein-lipid interaction that is proposed for other Golgi membrane proteins such as glycosyltransferases (3Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the present study, using the Golgi-targeting domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we have identified a novel protein that interacts with giantin and characterized its involvement in vesicular transport and maintenance of the Golgi structure. The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (positions 2804–3162) of rat giantin (26Toki C. Fujiwara T. Sohda M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct.

EGY48 harboring the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was transformed with the bait plasmid and the HeLa cell cDNA library generated in pB42AD vector (29Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar) (CLONTECH). Screening was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activities expressed by the specific interaction between the bait and prey constructs were measured using o-nitrophenyl-galactoside as a substrate (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 74Google Scholar). Of about 106 clones screened, 1 positive cDNA clone (2.6 kilobase pairs) was obtained and designated B8, which was found to contain an incomplete open reading frame. A cDNA clone (3.6 kilobase pairs) containing a complete open reading frame (GCP60) was isolated from the λZAPII cDNA library of HeLa cells by the plaque hybridization method (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled B8 cDNA as a probe. Northern blotting was carried out using a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg/lane), which was hybridized with32P-labeled B8 cDNA or human β-actin cDNA as a probe (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a chimeric protein of B8 fused to the COOH terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was constructed in expression vector pGEX4T-1 (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and designated GST-B8. The recombinant protein was expressed in and purified from bacteria and injected into rabbits to raise anti-GST-B8 antibodies as described previously (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The anti-GST antibody was removed from the antiserum by passing it through GST-coupled Sepharose 4B beads, and the remaining antibody was used as anti-GCP60, unless otherwise indicated. In some experiments, we used rabbit anti-GCP60N, which was raised against the NH2-terminal region (positions 1–175) of GCP60 and prepared by essentially the same procedures as described above. cDNAs encoding the entire coding region of GCP60 (wild type) and B8 were ligated to a position downstream of the sequence encoding the Met-FLAG tag in pSG5 expression vector so that the products could be recognized by the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (28Misumi Y.

The COOH-terminally deleted mutant M1 was prepared by introducing a termination codon into an appropriate site of the wild type plasmid. The NH2-terminally deleted mutants D1, D2, and D3 were obtained by amplification of B8 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction with a set of 25-mer primers synthesized for the indicated positions shown in Fig. 7 A. The mutant cDNA sequences (D1−D3) obtained were verified and ligated in frame to pEGFP-1 for GFP-fused proteins. The plasmid forN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase fused with GFP (NAGFP) (32Shima D.T.

Shima (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). The constructs in the pSG5 expression vector were transfected into COS-1 cells or HeLa cells with the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). All constructs were also ligated to pB42AD for the yeast two-hybrid assay. HeLa cells (4 × 106 cells/dish) or COS-1 cells (5 × 106 cells/dish) were labeled with [35S]methionine (4 MBq/dish) at 37 °C for 5 h (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-GCP60 as described previously (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

The samples, when indicated, were treated with alkaline phosphatase (50 units/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, at 37 °C for 30 min (31Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yano A. Takami N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5385-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) before immunoprecipitation. A postnuclear supernatant fraction was prepared from HeLa cells or transfected COS-1 cells and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h into membrane and cytosol fractions as described previously (31Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yano A. Takami N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5385-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A Golgi-enriched fraction was prepared by flotation of the postnuclear supernatant fraction in a sucrose density gradient as described previously (28Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5385-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (5% or 10% gels) followed by immunoblotting with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies (at a 1:1000 dilution for each antibody). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL kit (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A Golgi-enriched fraction and immunoprecipitates with the indicated antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE (5% gels) and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with GST or GST-B8 (2 mg/ml) at 25 °C for 1 h, then incubated with goat anti-GST antibody (1:1000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, and finally incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immunocomplex was visualized with the ECL kit. HeLa cells or COS-1 cells with or without transfection were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (17Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When indicated, cells were treated with nocodazole (50 μg/ml) or brefeldin A (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C before immunostaining. Primary antibodies and their final dilutions were as follows: rabbit anti-GCP60 serum, 1:100; guinea pig anti-giantin/GCP372 serum, 1:50 (Ref. 28Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody, 1:100 (Eastman Kodak Co.). TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50; DAKO), TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:50; DAKO), or Alexa488-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (1:50; Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) was used as a secondary antibody. Immunoelectron microscopy was carried out by the pre-embedding silver enhancement immunogold method (33Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 1 h, cryoprotected with 35% sucrose and 14% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were thawed and reacted with anti-GCP60 antibody, followed by incubation with the colloidal gold (1.4 nm, diameter)-conjugated secondary antibody. The gold labeling was intensified with a silver enhancement kit (Nano Probes, Yaphank, NY). Protein transport from the ER to the Golgi was examined using the temperature-sensitive glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G/ts045). COS-1 cells were transfected with the pSG5 plasmid containing the cDNA construct of VSV-G/ts045 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-VSV-G/ts045) (34Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirshceberg K. Zaar K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). After incubation at 39.5 °C for 12 h, cells were transferred to 32 °C and incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were fixed and observed for the GFP image. When indicated, FLAG-tagged GCP60 constructs (wild type, B8, and D3) were transfected into COS-1 cells together with the GFP-VSV-G/ts045 plasmid. Cells were fixed, stained with anti-FLAG antibody, and observed for each construct of GCP60 and the GFP image of VSV-G/ts045. The assay was performed according to the method of Golemis et al. (29Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). EGY48 harboring the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was transformed with pLexA/giantin2804–3161 and pB42AD/GCP60 or its deletion mutants. Transformants were plated on agar plates with synthetic media containing dextrose lacking Ura, His, and Trp and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. Surviving transformants were streaked on a plate containing galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside without Ura, His, Trp, and Leu and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. We demonstrated previously that giantin has a Golgi localization signal in the COOH-terminal region (positions 2804–3162), which contains three coiled-coil domains, I, II, and III (Fig.1 A, top) (28Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The entire region containing the three domains was inserted into the LexA fusion vector and used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening system for identification of a protein that interacts with giantin. We screened the HeLa cell cDNA library in the pB42AD fusion vector and obtained a 2.6-kilobase pair cDNA clone, B8, which was not a full-length cDNA but encoded a partial sequence with 211 amino acids (B8p). The interaction of B8p with each domain of giantin was analyzed by the two-hybrid system, demonstrating that B8p specifically interacts with domain III of giantin, although not as efficiently as it does with the entire COOH-terminal region (Fig. 1 A). We further examined the in vitro interaction of B8 with giantin by an overlay assay. A Golgi fraction and immunoprecipitates obtained with the indicated antibodies were separated by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with GST or GST-B8p. The bound GST-B8p was detected as a single band corresponding to giantin in the Golgi fraction (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 5) and as two bands in the giantin immunoprecipitate (lanes 3 and 6). The faster-migrating band of the two bands (lane 3) appears to be a degradation product containing the COOH-terminal region of giantin, whereas another major band (about 180 kDa) detected on the immunoblot (lane 6) may be the NH2-terminal counterpart with which GST-B8p does not interact. GST-B8p, however, was found not to interact with GM130 (lanes 4 and 7), a Golgi matrix protein (18Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the B8 product specifically interacts with giantin both in vivo andin vitro. We obtained a 3.6-kilobase pair cDNA clone from the HeLa cell library by the plaque hybridization method using B8 cDNA as a probe. The cDNA contained a complete open reading frame encoding a protein of 528 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 60 kDa (Fig.2 A) that we designated GCP60 (Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa). The B8p sequence was found in the COOH-terminal half of GCP60 starting with the Pro328 residue. GCP60 contains the following characteristic domains (Fig. 2 A): proline-rich domain (positions 36–45), acyl-CoA binding motif-like (ACB) domain (Ref. 35Kragelund B.B. Poulsen K. Andersen K.V. Baldursson T. Kroll J.B. Neergard T.B. Jepsen J. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Poulsen F.M. Knudsen J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2386-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar; positions 104–164), charged amino acid-rich (CAR) domain (positions 182–240), and glutamine-rich domain (positions 241–308). In addition, a bipartite motif of the nuclear localization signal (36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A, italic letters in positions 215–231) is contained in the CAR domain. A similarity search revealed that there are GCP60 homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (47.5% identity) and Drosophila melanogaster (40.6% identity) (Fig. 2 B), although these homologues have not been identified at the protein level. No related proteins were found inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and plants. Fig. 2 Cshows an alignment of the ACB domain sequence of GCP60 with the corresponding sequences of acyl-CoA-binding protein and Δ3-cis-Δ2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (37Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the GCP60 domain has a 33–43% identity with these proteins. Hydropathy analysis predicts that GCP60 does not contain a hydrophobic domain that could participate in membrane localization (data not shown). A long hydrophilic region corresponding to the CAR domain (positions 182–240) is also predicted to have a high probability of coiled-coil formation (38Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). The highly charged coiled-coil structure is thought to form a homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization of proteins stabilized by ionic interaction (39Lee S.C. Kim I.G. Marekov L.N. O'Koefe E.J.

For expression of B8 and GCP60, a GFP-fused B8 cDNA (GFP-B8) and a FLAG-tagged GCP60 cDNA were prepared (Fig. 3 A) and transfected into COS-1 cells. The GFP-B8 chimera was detected by the GFP image, whereas GCP60 was detected by immunofluorescence staining with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3 B). Both the expressed proteins were localized to a juxtanuclear region corresponding to the Golgi complex, where giantin was co-localized as detected with anti-giantin. Cells expressing FLAG-tagged GCP60 were labeled with [35S]methionine and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. GCP60 expressed in the transfected cells was heavily labeled and had the same molecular mass (65 kDa) as the endogenous protein from control cells (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2). GCP60 was found to be phosphorylated because32Pi was incorporated into the protein (data not shown). In addition, when the 35S-labeled protein was treated with alkaline phosphatase, its molecular mass was slightly reduced (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). Thus, the apparent molecular mass of GCP60, which is slightly higher than the calculated mass (60 kDa), may be due in part to its phosphorylation. The GCP60 mRNA level was examined by Northern blotting of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues with 32P-labeled B8 cDNA (Fig.4 A). A single 3.7-kilobase message was detected in all the tissues examined and was especially abundant in testis and ovary, indicating that GCP60 is ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 4 A). The ubiquitous expression of GCP60 was also examined in cultured cells from different species by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting, for which polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant human GCP60 were used. The antibodies were found to cross-react well with the antigen in cells derived from other species including monkey COS-1 cells, Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K1 cells, and rat NRK cells, confirming its localization in the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 4 B) and a single band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 C). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that the endogenous GCP60 in HeLa cells was co-localized with giantin to the juxtanuclear region (Fig.5 A). The intracellular localization of GCP60 was examined in more detail by immunoelectron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 B, immunoreactive gold particles were detected on the characteristic stack and related structures of the Golgi complex. The subcellular distribution of GCP60 was also examined by cell fractionation and immunoblotting (Fig.5 C). When a postnuclear supernatant fraction was separated into membranes and cytosol, 30–40% of the total GCP60 was recovered in the membrane fraction. The majority of the membrane-associated GCP60 was recovered in the Golgi-enriched fraction. When the Golgi membranes were treated with 1 m KCl and separated into membranes and supernatant by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h, GCP60 was completely dissociated from the membranes into the soluble fraction. In addition, membrane-associated GCP60 was found to be completely digested with a mixture of trypsin and chymostrypsin in the absence of a detergent (data not shown). The results indicate that GCP60, although primarily present as"

Western blot analyses of microvillus membranes and immunoelectron microscopy of kidney sections showed that mAb 1D11 recognizes a 110-kDa protein highly expressed on the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells. Immunoaffinity chromatography was used to isolate the antigen against which mAb 1D11 is directed. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein identified it as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) (EC 3.4.14.15), which was confirmed by assays of DPPIV enzyme activity. We also evaluated the distribution of the NHE3-DPPIV complex in microdomains of rabbit renal brush border. In contrast to the previously described NHE3-megalin complex, which principally resides in a dense membrane population (coated pits) in which NHE3 is inactive, the NHE3-DPPIV complex was predominantly in the microvillar fraction in which NHE3 is active. Serial precipitation experiments confirmed that anti-megalin and anti-DPPIV antibodies co-precipitate different pools of NHE3. Taken together, these studies revealed an unexpected association of the brush border Na+-H+ exchanger NHE3 with dipeptidyl peptidase IV in the proximal tubule.

The polarized expression and regulation of a transporter such as NHE3 necessarily involves interactions with other proteins. Recent studies have indicated that NHE3 is capable of binding calmodulin (12Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Noel J. Schmitt B. Orlowski J. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

These interactions have generally been characterized in nonepithelial cells transfected to overexpress NHE3. We have been investigating whether NHE3 exists in assemblies with other proteins in native kidney membranes. We previously reported that the sedimentation coefficient for NHE3 solubilized from renal membranes is greater than predicted for monomeric NHE3, indicating the presence of multimeric complexes (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that are associated with NHE3 in native renal kidney membranes, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against affinity-purified NHE3 protein complexes from solubilized microvillus membranes. The study of one of these antibodies, mAb 10A3, demonstrated that a significant pool of NHE3 exists in a complex with the scavenger receptor megalin in the kidney brush border (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that NHE3 is expressed in different microdomains of the brush border and that the NHE3-megalin complex principally resides in a dense membrane compartment most likely representing coated pits (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We now report the detailed characterization of a second mAb (1D11) that specifically co-precipitates NHE3 from solubilized microvillus membranes isolated from rabbit renal cortex. We demonstrate that the antigen for mAb 1D11 is dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, also known as CD26) and thus that NHE3 resides in an oligomeric complex with DPPIV in the renal proximal tubule. We also show that the NHE3-DPPIV complex is primarily located in the microvillar microdomain of the kidney brush border. These findings raise the possibility that association with DPPIV may affect NHE3 surface expression and/or activity. In a previous publication, we described in detail the development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to a restricted region of the C terminus of NHE3 (18Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAb 2B9 was raised to a fusion protein (fpNHE3–702-832) that reproduced the C-terminal 131 amino acids of rabbit NHE3. This antibody was used as purified IgG from hybridoma supernatants. For immunoblotting experiments, we also used a previously characterized anti-NHE3 polyclonal antibody raised in goats to fpNHE3–702-832 (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a previous paper, we described the development and characterization of mAb 10A3 to rabbit megalin (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A mAb (mouse IgG) to villin was purchased from AMAC, Inc. (Westbrook, Maine). A polyclonal antibody raised to the renal brush border Na/Pi cotransporter, NaPi-2, was a gift from Dr. Heini Murer and Dr. Jurg Biber, Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich-Irchel, Zurich, Switzerland (19Levi M. Lotscher M. Sorribas V. Custer M. Arar M. Kaissling B. Murer H. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F900-F908PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat (heavy and light chain-specific), goat anti-mouse (γ chain-specific) and goat anti-rabbit (heavy and light chain-specific) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain) was also purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The procedure for development of monoclonal antibodies against affinity-purified NHE3 complexes as well as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed for screening the hybridoma supernatants have been previously described in detail (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). mAbs were purified from hybridoma supernatants by affinity chromatography using protein G-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. Piscataway, NJ) according to manufacturer's protocols. Purified monoclonal antibody (1–10 mg/ml) to which was added bovine serum albumin at 1 mg/ml was stored in 50% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline at −20 °C. Immediately after kidney removal from male New Zealand White rabbits (Gabrielle Farms, Woodstock, CT), cortices were separated at 4 °C and homogenized in HEPES buffer containing the protease inhibitors (Sigma) pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μg/ml), and K2EDTA (1 mm). Microvillus membrane vesicles were prepared using a method based on Mg2+ precipitation and differential centrifugation as previously described (20Aronson P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (21Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rabbit renal microvillus membranes were solubilized at 4 °C in TBS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors as described above. The samples were subjected to either low speed (15,000 ×g for 10 min) or high speed (200,000 × gfor 1 h) centrifugation using a table top (HermleTMmodel Z230M, National Labnet Co., Woodbridge, NJ) centrifuge or a Beckman ultracentrifuge, respectively. 50 μg of primary antibodies were added to the supernatants, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected using 5 mg/sample of protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed five times in solubilization buffer and then prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Protein samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) from polyacrylamide gels at 500 mA for 5 h at 4 °C with a Transphor transfer electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) and stained with Ponceau S in 0.5% trichloroacetic acid. Entire sheets of PVDF membranes containing transferred proteins were incubated first in Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 1–3 h to block nonspecific binding of antibody, followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody. Primary antibodies were diluted in Blotto in concentrations ranging from 1:1000 to 1:5000. The membranes were then washed five times in Blotto and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Bound antibody was detected with ECL-enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's protocols. Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exposed to membranes for 1–3 min, were developed in an x-ray film processor (100 Plus, All Pro Imaging Corp). In some experiments membranes were stripped and reprobed with additional primary antibodies (see Fig. 6 A). The stripping procedure consists of incubating the PVDF membranes in 2% SDS, 50 mmTris-buffer, pH 6.9, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 60 min at 70 °C. Rabbit kidneys were perfused with pyridoxal phosphate fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 75 mm lysine, and 10 mmsodium periodate in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and fixed tissue was processed and stained using the immunoperoxidase method exactly as described previously (23Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections of Epon-embedded tissue were examined using a Zeiss 910 electron microscope. An immunoaffinity chromatography matrix was prepared by covalently coupling mAb 1D11 to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) through a rabbit anti-mouse IgG bridge (24Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microvillus membrane vesicles (1 mg) solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm K2EDTA in phosphate-buffer saline were incubated with the immunoaffinity matrix for 16 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the matrix was washed twice with salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, 20 °C), four times with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, 4 °C), and finally twice more with salt wash buffer. Bound antigen was eluted by incubating the matrix with immunoaffinity elution buffer (50 mm glycine-HCl, 0.1% Triton, pH 2.7) for 2 min at 4 °C. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris base. This was repeated four times, and the eluates were pooled and then concentrated to ∼60 μl. After separation of the immunoaffinity chromatography eluate by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a PVDF membrane as above, the single major band at 110 kDa after Coomassie Blue staining was cut from the blot for N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation at the HHMI Biopolymer Laboratory and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Microvillus membranes (1 mg) were solubilized and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography as above. Fifty μl of the starting material (5% of initial volume) were saved for subsequent Western blot analysis and enzyme assays. Similarly, 5% of the total volume of the solubilized microvillus membranes after incubation with the column (flow-through), as well as the eluate from the column, were concentrated to 50 μl for subsequent assays. Thus, all samples used for Western blot analysis and enzyme assays (see Fig. 5) were matched for initial content of microvillus membranes. Of the 50-μl samples of each fraction (5% of total yield), 15 μl were used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and 15 μl were used for each of the two enzyme assays. Both dipeptidyl peptidase IV (25Hino M. Fuyamada H. Hayakawa T. Nagatsu T. Oya H. Clin. Chem. 1976; 22: 1256-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (26Szasz G. Clin. Chem. 1969; 15: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) activities were assayed by measuring the release of p-nitroaniline resulting from the hydrolysis of glycylproline p-nitroanilide tosylate and γ-glutamyl p-nitroanilide (Sigma), respectively. For the DPPIV assay, 15 μl of each fraction obtained from the immunoaffinity column were added to 1 ml reaction mixture containing 1.5 mm glycylprolyl-p-nitroanilide tosylate and 75 mm glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 8.7. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 3 ml of m acetate buffer, pH 4.2. For the γ-GTP assay, 15 μl of each fraction were added to 2 ml of reaction mixture containing 4.2 mm l-γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, 52.5 mm glycylglycine, 10.5 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm ammediol buffer, pH 9.3, and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. Determination of p-nitroaniline liberated enzymatically was based on the absorbance at 380 nm. Post mitochondrial microsomes were prepared and separated on 15–25% OptiPrepTM gradients essentially as described previously (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 1-ml fractions were manually collected from the top and stored at −70 °C. Dense vesicles, which are enriched in megalin, were pooled from fractions 5–7 in the gradient (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a previous paper, we described the generation of mAbs against affinity-purified NHE3 protein complexes (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were selected based on ability to immunoprecipitate NHE3. One mAb (10A3) was characterized in detail and was found to be directed at megalin. Studies with mAb 10A3 revealed that a significant pool of renal brush border NHE3 resides in oligomeric complexes with megalin (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study we characterize a second mAb, 1D11, that was also generated against affinity-purified NHE3 protein complexes and was found to immunoprecipitate NHE3. We first evaluated whether 1D11 is directed to NHE3 or to an associated protein. The left half of Fig.1 shows the results of an immunoblotting experiment in which rabbit renal microvillus membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with mAb 1D11, a mAb against NHE3, and a polyclonal antibody to another brush border membrane protein, the Na/Pi cotransporter NaPi-2. mAb 1D11 was found to label a 110-kDa protein that is distinct from the 80-kDa monomeric form of NHE3. We next verified whether mAb 1D11 specifically co-precipitates NHE3. Shown in the right half of Fig. 1 are the results of an immunoprecipitation experiment in which rabbit renal microvillus membrane proteins solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 were immunoprecipitated with mAb 1D11. The immune complexes were prepared for immunoblotting and probed with mAb 1D11, an anti-NHE3 mAb and anti-NaPi-2 antibody. Both the 110-kDa 1D11 antigen and NHE3 were co-precipitated by mAb 1D11. In contrast, mAb 1D11 did not co-precipitate NaPi-2, indicating that the interaction between the 1D11 antigen and NHE3 is specific. In the studies above, immunoprecipitation was performed using solubilized microvillus membrane proteins after clearing by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. But we have previously reported that a significant amount of NHE3 can be pelleted from detergent-solubilized membranes when centrifuged at high speed for a longer time (200,000 × g for 1 h), indicating that some of the transporter in the solubilized extract resides in large, insoluble aggregates (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Co-localization of NHE3 and the 1D11 antigen in such insoluble aggregates could in principle account for their apparent co-precipitation from the low-speed supernatants of detergent-solubilized renal microvillus membranes in Fig. 1. Arguing against this possibility is the lack of co-precipitation of another brush border membrane protein, NaPi-2. Nevertheless, to verify that NHE3 and the 1D11 antigen could also be co-precipitated from the truly soluble supernatant, we performed additional immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2) using both the low speed (15,000 × g) and high speed (200,000 ×g) supernatants of Triton X-100 solubilized renal microvillus membranes. These supernatants were precipitated either with a mAb to NHE3, mAb 1D11, or a mAb to the microvillar core protein villin. The immunocomplexes were prepared for immunoblotting and probed with a polyclonal Ab to NHE3. Shown in Fig. 2, mAb 1D11 immunoprecipitates NHE3 from truly solubilized microvillus membranes but does not precipitate villin. Although mAb 1D11 specifically immunoprecipitates NHE3, we were unable to demonstrate that the anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9 co-precipitates the 110-kDa 1D11 antigen (not shown). Of interest in this regard, we had previously found that when NHE3 is complexed with megalin, the C-terminal epitope for anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9 is blocked from antibody binding (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether 1D11 also immunoprecipitates a pool of NHE3 not recognized by anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9. To this end, serial immunoprecipitation was performed three times with mAb 2B9, resulting in progressive depletion of the NHE3 available for binding to this antibody, as shown in Fig. 3. To determine whether there was any remaining NHE3 that was complexed with the 1D11 antigen and that mAb 2B9 was not able to recognize, a fourth immunoprecipitation was performed from the same sample using mAb 1D11. As seen in Fig. 3, an appreciable amount of NHE3 that could not be precipitated by anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9 was co-precipitated by mAb 1D11. These findings indicate that the C-terminal epitope for binding of mAb 2B9 to NHE3 is occluded when NHE3 is complexed with the 110-kDa 1D11 antigen. Having demonstrated that the 110-kDa 1D11 antigen and NHE3 are specifically associated, our first step in the characterization of the 1D11 antigen was to determine the subcellular sites of its expression in proximal tubule cells. As seen by immunoelectron microscopy in Fig. 4, mAb 1D11 stained the brush border of proximal tubule cells. In contrast to the predominantly coated pit staining previously observed for anti-megalin mAb 10A3 (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), mAb 1D11 very strongly labeled the microvillar domain of the brush border, although staining of the intermicrovillar pit regions was also detected. The findings in Fig. 4indicate that the 110-kDa 1D11 antigen is a brush border membrane protein. To isolate the protein against which mAb 1D11 is directed, immunoaffinity chromatography was carried out by use of a column to which mAb 1D11 was covalently bound. The bound antigen from solubilized microvillus membranes was eluted using a low pH buffer. The eluate was concentrated, subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The single major protein was cut from the blot and submitted for N-terminal sequencing. The following sequence was obtained: MKTPXKVLLG. A data base search indicated that nine of nine of the identified amino acids matched human, mouse, and rat dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5). Given the possibility that DPPIV may have been a contaminant in the 110-kDa region of the blot submitted for N-terminal amino acid sequencing, we performed measurements of enzymatic activity to verify that the major protein band isolated on the mAb 1D11 immunoaffinity column actually represents DPPIV. Solubilized microvillus membranes were incubated with the 1D11 immunoaffinity column. Samples of the solubilized microvillus membrane starting material (SM) applied to the column, the flow-through (FT) representing solubilized microvillus membranes after incubation with the column, and the eluate from the column were compared both for the presence of the 110-kDa 1D11 antigen by Western blotting (Fig.5 A) and for enzymatic activity (Fig. 5 B). As illustrated in Fig. 5, the 1D11 antigen was completely depleted from the flow-through and was recovered in the eluate. These findings correlated with virtually complete depletion of DPPIV enzymatic activity from the flow-through with recovery in the eluate. In contrast, activity of another brush border membrane enzyme, γ-glutamyltransferase, was not depleted in the flow-through and was not recovered in the eluate from the 1D11 immunoaffinity column. These results confirm that the 1D11 antigen is DPPIV. In view of our previous findings that NHE3 is expressed in different microdomains of the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells and that the NHE3-megalin complex principally resides in a dense membrane compartment most likely representing coated pits (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it was of interest to similarly examine in which microdomain the NHE3-DPPIV complex is expressed. For this purpose, we performed both immunoblotting (Fig. 6 A) and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 B) experiments using microvillus membrane vesicles (MMV) isolated by divalent cation aggregation (20Aronson P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and dense membrane vesicles (DV) isolated by density fractionation of total renal cortical membranes (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The immunoblotting experiments were performed using equal amounts of protein from either microvilli or dense vesicles to analyze semi-quantitatively the expression of DPPIV in these sub-compartments. Illustrated in Fig. 6 A, megalin is more highly expressed in dense vesicles compared with microvilli, villin is predominantly expressed in microvilli, and NHE3 is equally distributed between these two microdomains as previously reported (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We observed that DPPIV is much more abundant in microvilli than in dense vesicles, confirming previous findings that DPPIV is a protein of the microvillar microdomain (23Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the relative abundance of the NHE3-DPPIV complex in these two membrane compartments, we then performed immunoprecipitation with mAb 1D11 and analyzed the precipitates for the presence of NHE3 by Western blotting. Shown in Fig. 6 B, although NHE3 abundance was essentially the same in solubilized microvillus membrane vesicles (MMV) and dense vesicles (DV), a greater quantity of NHE3 was co-precipitated by mAb 1D11 from microvilli compared with dense vesicles. These results contrast with previous findings indicating that the NHE3-megalin complex is most abundant in the dense vesicles, which likely represent intermicrovillar coated pits (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The findings in Fig. 6 suggest that the pools of NHE3 associated with DPPIV and megalin have distinct patterns of distribution. To further explore the relationship between these pools of NHE3, we performed serial immunoprecipitation experiments using mAbs 1D11 (anti-DPPIV) and 10A3 (anti-megalin). Shown in Fig.7 A, serial precipitation with mAb 1D11 led to progressive depletion of the amount of NHE3 that co-precipitates with DPPIV. To determine whether there was any remaining NHE3 that was not associated with DPPIV but was associated with megalin, a fourth immunoprecipitation was performed from the same sample using anti-megalin mAb 10A3. As seen in Fig. 7 A, a substantial amount of NHE3 that could not be precipitated by anti-DPPIV mAb 1D11 was co-precipitated by mAb 10A3, indicating that a pool of NHE3 exists that is complexed with megalin but not with DPPIV. Similarly, shown in Fig. 7 B, after serial immunoprecipitation by anti-megalin mAb 10A3, an additional quantity of NHE3 was precipitated by anti-DPPIV mAb 1D11, indicating that a pool of NHE3 exists that is complexed with DPPIV but not with megalin. Finally, we found that precipitation of megalin from solubilized microvillus membranes by anti-DPPIV mAb 1D11 was only faintly detected, and precipitation of DPPIV by anti-megalin mAb 10A3 was not detected at all (data not shown). Taken together, the findings in Figs. 6 and 7indicate that the pools of NHE3 complexed with megalin and DPPIV are largely distinct and preferentially reside in different microdomains of the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells. In the present study we have shown that mAb 1D11 directed to DPPIV co-precipitates NHE3 from solubilized microvillus membranes isolated from rabbit kidney, suggesting that NHE3 and DPPIV are associated in an oligomeric complex. Our finding that anti-DPPIV mAb 1D11 co-precipitates neither NaPi-2 nor villin from solubilized microvillus membranes indicates the specificity of the interaction between NHE3 and DPPIV. DPPIV, also known as CD26, is a plasma membrane protein expressed in many types of epithelial and nonepithelial cells (27Hong W.J. Petell J.K. Swank D. Sanford J. Hixson D.C. Doyle D. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is a highly specific serine protease that cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from peptides with a penultimate proline or alanine (28Kenny A.J. Booth A.G. George S.G. Ingram J. Kershaw D. Wood E.J. Young A.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Through this action, it is able to degrade and inactivate several peptides, including glucagon-like peptide-1, neuropeptide Y, substance P and β chemokines such as eotaxin, stromal derived factor-1, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) (29Mentlein R. Regul. Pept. 1999; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). In addition to its catalytic activity, DPPIV also functions as a binding protein. At the T-cell surface, DPPIV binds to the soluble extracellular enzyme adenosine deaminase (30Kameoka J. Tanaka T. Nojima Y. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and DPPIV is closely involved in mediating cell entry of human immunodeficiency virus (31Ohtsuki T. Tsuda H. Morimoto C. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2000; 22: 152-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for a signaling role for DPPIV/CD26 in T-cell activation (32Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The kidney is a principal site of expression of DPPIV, where it is one of the major brush border membrane proteins (28Kenny A.J. Booth A.G. George S.G. Ingram J. Kershaw D. Wood E.J. Young A.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, its physiological role in kidney tissue other than as a peptidase remains unclear. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that other proteases are capable of regulating the activity of membrane transporters in kidney and other tissues. For example, a 329-amino acid protein has been cloned that belongs to the serine protease family and activates the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel by an indirect effect not involving direct proteolysis of the channel subunits (33Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Initially isolated from Xenopus kidney epithelial cells (A6 cells), this channel-activating protease-1 has a mammalian homologue that regulates epithelial sodium channel activity in kidney collecting duct cells (34Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Pfister C. Bens M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Hummler E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the epithelial sodium channel by the serine protease prostasin, which is probably an orthologue of channel-activating protease-1, has also been reported (35Adachi M. Kitamura K. Miyoshi T. Narikiyo T. Iwashita K. Shiraishi N. Nonoguchi H. Tomita K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of chloride and potassium channels by trypsin acting upon the proteinase-activated receptor-2 has been described in pancreatic and collecting tubule cells (36Bertog M. Letz B. Kong W. Steinhoff M. Higgins M.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Fromter E. Bunnett N.W. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Nguyen T.D. Moody M.W. Steinhoff M. Okolo C. Koh D.S. Bunnett N.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In view of this emerging evidence for regulation of transporters by proteases, it is possible that DPPIV may play a similar role in modulating the activity of NHE3. Indeed, although we found that preincubation with the DPPIV inhibitor diprotin A had no effect on NHE3 activity in rabbit renal microvillus membrane vesicles (results not shown), we have observed in preliminary studies that diprotin A inhibits NHE3 activity in OK cells, a proximal tubule cell line (38Girardi A.C.C. Knauf F. Aronson P.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 4AGoogle Scholar). The apical brush border of proximal tubule cells is composed of two microdomains, the microvilli and the intermicrovillar coated pits (39Rodman J.S. Seidman L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that NHE3 is equally abundant in microvillus membrane vesicles and in a population of non-microvillar dense membrane vesicles that likely represent the intermicrovillar coated pits (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, we identified a pool of NHE3 that is associated in oligomeric complexes with the scavenger receptor megalin and found that NHE3-megalin complexes are principally concentrated in the intermicrovillar coated pit microdomain of the renal brush border where NHE3 in inactive (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that the NHE3-DPPIV complex is more abundant in microvilli, where NHE3 is active, than in intermicrovillar coated pits. Serial immunoprecipitation experiments using mAbs 1D11 (anti-DPPIV) and 10A3 (anti-megalin) have revealed that the pools of NHE3 complexed with DPPIV and megalin are largely distinct. A third pool of NHE3 can be defined by precipitation by anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9, which co-precipitates neither megalin nor DPPIV because its epitope within the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of NHE3 is occluded when NHE3 is complexed with either of these proteins. As in the case of NHE3 associated with DPPIV, the pool of NHE3 precipitable by mAb 2B9 is more abundant in microvilli than in the intermicrovillar microdomain (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, taking our present and previous results together, there are at least three forms of NHE3 in the renal brush border: NHE3-megalin complexes that predominately reside in the coated pits, NHE3-DPPIV complexes that are mainly present in the microvilli, and NHE3 that is also largely microvillar but is free of association with megalin or DPPIV. We have previously shown that intermicrovillar NHE3, much of which is complexed with megalin, is inactive (17Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10161-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of “free” NHE3 and DPPIV-associated NHE3 to the measured Na+-H+ exchange activity in renal microvillus membrane vesicles remain to be defined. Also unknown is the relationship of any of these three forms of NHE3 to the regulatory proteins NHERF (11Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and E3KARP (14Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To date, we have been unable to demonstrate co-precipitation of NHERF or E3KARP from renal microvillus membranes by anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9 or anti-megalin mAb 10A3 under the conditions we have used for membrane solubilization. 2D. Biemesderfer and P. S. Aronson, unpublished observations.However, a substantial fraction of renal brush border NHE3 is detergent insoluble (16Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since NHERF and E3KARP bind the cytoskeletal protein ezrin (40Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 41Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), it is possible that in native kidney tissue they predominantly associate with NHE3 that is detergent-insoluble and hence is not available for immunoprecipitation under the conditions of our experiments. In conclusion, we have demonstrated an unexpected association of Na+-H+ exchanger isoform NHE3 with dipeptidyl peptidase IV in microvillus membranes isolated from proximal tubule cells. Inhibition of DPPIV reduces NHE3 activity in a proximal tubule cell line (38Girardi A.C.C. Knauf F. Aronson P.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 4AGoogle Scholar). Given that DPPIV is a multifunctional protein with known activities as a peptidase, binding protein, and signaling molecule, our findings raise the possibility that association with DPPIV regulates NHE3 by directly or indirectly affecting its surface expression and/or activity."

These receptors bind a large number of chemokines, peptides of typically 8–10 kDa and contain cysteine residues at defined positions. Activation of chemokine receptors results in the dissociation of Gα from Gβγ proteins, triggering a series of signaling events leading to chemotaxis and other cellular functions (1Zlotnik A.

Kaposi's sarcoma is characterized by angiogenic proliferation of mesenchymal cells, resulting in abundant vascular spaces filled with red blood cells and surrounded by spindle cells. KSHV DNA is found in spindle cells as well as endothelial cells in the lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma, suggesting that the viral DNA encodes proteins that contribute to overgrowth of vascular endothelial cells (4Moore P.S.

Analysis of the KSHV sequence has led to the identification of an open reading frame (ORF-74) that encodes a putative GPCR, which bears structural similarity to CXCR1 and CXCR2, the two human receptors for IL-8 (5Cesarman E.

When expressed in transfected cell lines, KSHV-GPCR binds a large number of chemokines (7Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Unlike most other chemokine receptors that depend on agonist binding for activation, the KSHV-derived receptor is a constitutively active GPCR. Exogenous expression of KSHV-GPCR results in cell proliferation and foci formation (7Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KSHV-GPCR induces oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells leading to tumor growth in nude mice (8Bais C.

The transformed cells promote a switch of surrounding endothelial cells to an angiogenic phenotype due to increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (8Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O.

However, KSHV-GPCR differs from most chemokine receptors in that it is a viral oncogene that transforms host cells and stimulates tumor growth. Therefore it is important to determine the proximal signaling events including the G proteins that couple to this constitutively active GPCR.Recent studies conducted in this and other laboratories have demonstrated activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by GPCRs (18Mutoh H.

Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). Numerous environmental signals can induce NF-κB activation, which in turn regulates the expression of a large number of genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (25Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB has been suggested and recently demonstrated to play an important function in autocrine production of several CXC chemokines through the IL-8 receptors (26Ye R.D. Pan Z. Kravchenko V. Browning D.D. Prossnitz E.R. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar, 27Devalaraja M.N. Wang D.Z. Ballard D.W. Richmond A.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L1129-L1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In melanoma cells, autocrine production of growth-regulated oncogene-α (GRO-α; also termed melanoma growth stimulatory activity or MGSA) is associated with cell proliferation similar to that observed in KSHV-GPCR-transfected cells (27Devalaraja M.N. Wang D.Z. Ballard D.W. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1372-1377PubMed Google Scholar, 29Norgauer J. Metzner B. Schraufstatter I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1132-1137PubMed Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to determine whether KSHV-GPCR, like its mammalian homologs, can also activate NF-κB. Here we report that KSHV-GPCR stimulates constitutive NF-κB activation and induces IL-8 secretion in transfected HeLa cells. We further demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G protein, Gα13, together with Gαq, Gαi/o, and Gβγ proteins, plays an important role in KSHV-GPCR-mediated activation of NF-κB and secretion of IL-8. NF-κB activation by KSHV-GPCR was reported by others while this work was being completed (30Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar) and after initial submission of the manuscript (31Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Couty J.P. Geras-Raaka E. Weksler B.B. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33805-33811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that expression of KSHV-GPCR results in constitutive NF-κB transactivation. This function is mediated by several G proteins including the PTX-sensitive Gαi/o, the PTX-insensitive Gαq and Gα13, and Gβγ proteins. Because the roles of Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gβγ in NF-κB activation have been characterized previously with another GPCR (37Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and recently with KSHV-GPCR (30Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar, 32Couty J.P. Geras-Raaka E. Weksler B.B. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33805-33811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), our study is focused on the activation of Gα13 and RhoA by KSHV-GPCR. The involvement of Gα13 and RhoA in KSHV-GPCR signaling is evidenced by the following observations. 1) Expression of wild type Gα13 enhances KSHV-GPCR-induced NF-κB activation. 2) Inhibition of Gα13 by p115RGS, a RGS specific for Gα13, reduces NF-κB activation by KSHV-GPCR. 3) Stress fiber formation has been observed in stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells that express KSHV-GPCR, indicating RhoA activation. 4) A dominant negative mutant of RhoA partially inhibits KSHV-GPCR-induced NF-κB activation. 5) The C3 exoenzyme, a specific inhibitor of RhoA, reduces NF-κB activation by KSHV-GPCR. 6) The above inhibitors and dominant negative constructs also effectively inhibit NF-κB activation stimulated by a constitutively active Gα13 mutant. We did not observe complete inhibition by any of the above agents except IκBαM, indicating the involvement of multiple G proteins in KSHV-GPCR-induced NF-κB activation.The observation that activated Gα13, but not activated Gαq, stimulates IL-8 secretion provides additional evidence for a role of Gα13 in functional coupling with KSHV-GPCR. The underlying mechanism is not clear at this time, but may include the possibilities of translational inhibition of the IL-8 message by Gαq and lack of a necessary component for its efficient translation. This finding is similar to an earlier report indicating that C5a induces transcription of the IL-1 message but does not provide a translational signal (52Schindler R. Gelfand J.A. Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C5a receptor is known for coupling to Gαi and Gα16, a member of the Gαq family, but not to Gα13. Further experiments will be necessary to thoroughly investigate the differences between Gαq and Gα13 in stimulating IL-8 biosynthesis. Gαq has been shown to mediate KSHV-GPCR-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates as this function is resistant to PTX treatment (7Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Using the −272 IL-8 luciferase reporter, we demonstrated that Gαq is a potent inducer of IL-8 transcription. Therefore, Gαq may indirectly participate in IL-8 biosynthesis by up-regulating the IL-8 message.Results obtained from this study suggest activation of RhoA by KSHV-GPCR. RhoA is a member of the Rho small GTPases that regulate cytoskeleton rearrangement and other important cellular functions such as cell cycle progression through G1 (53Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Thus, the stimulated cell proliferation by KSHV-GPCR may be attributed in part to Rho-mediated alteration of cell cycle. Consistent with a previous observation that the Rho GTPases activate c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinases but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (53Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), KSHV-GPCR has been shown to activate JNK and p38 but not ERK (8Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). These findings combined suggest that KSHV-GPCR stimulates cell proliferation through activation of Rho GTPases, but probably not Ras, which has been known to stimulate ERK activation through Raf and ERK kinase. We are currently investigating the role of other Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, in KSHV-GPCR-mediated functions.RhoA is an effector of Gα13, and GPCRs that couple to Gα13 activate cellular functions in part through this small GTPase. A recent study demonstrates that G2A, a stress-inducible GPCR expressed in immature T and B lymphocyte progenitors (54Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A. Le Beau M.M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12334-12339Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), couples to Gα13 and activates RhoA (55Kabarowski J.H. Feramisco J.D. Le L.Q. Gu J.L. Luoh S.W. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12109-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of G2A in NIH 3T3 cells results in oncogenic transformation characterized by loss of contact inhibition, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in mice (45Zohn I.E. Klinger M. Karp X. Kirk H. Symons M. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that G2A is a GPCR that utilizes Gα13 and RhoA for oncogenic transformation. Like G2A, KSHV-GPCR also induces cellular proliferation, cell transformation, and tumorigenicity in nude mice (7Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 8Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A.

Nature. 1998; 394: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, both receptors are absent from cells under resting conditions, but are induced to express by either environmental stress or viral infection. These similarities suggest that the two receptors share certain components of their signaling pathways.NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of cytokine and growth factor genes (24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). NF-κB also regulates the expression of several genes coding for anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 (24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of NF-κB may be partially responsible for the accelerated proliferation of cells that express KSHV-GPCR (7Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Of potential interest is that NF-κB activation by KSHV-GPCR leads to expression of IL-8, a CXC chemokine that binds KSHV-GPCR as well as the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (11Gershengorn M.C. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Expression of another CXC chemokine, GRO-α/MGSA, is also induced by NF-κB (50Anisowicz A. Messineo M. Lee S.W. Sager R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 520-527PubMed Google Scholar, 56Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although the cells used in the current study did not secrete GRO-α/MGSA when stimulated by a variety of NF-κB activators including TNFα (data not shown). In several cell models, binding of the above two CXC chemokines to CXCR2 induces activation of the receptor and is responsible for the proliferation of these cells through an autocrine mechanism (29Norgauer J. Metzner B. Schraufstatter I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1132-1137PubMed Google Scholar, 57Haghnegahdar H. Du J. Wang D. Strieter R.M. Burdick M.D. Nanney L.B. Cardwell N. Luan J. Shattuck-Brandt R. Richmond A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 58Takamori H. Oades Z.G. Hoch O.C. Burger M. Schraufstatter I.U. Pancreas. 2000; 21: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 59Burger M. Burger J.A. Hoch R.C. Oades Z. Takamori H. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2017-2022PubMed Google Scholar). Since both IL-8 and GRO-α/MGSA have been shown to bind and activate KSHV-GPCR, a potential function of the secreted IL-8 could be autocrine stimulation through KSHV-GPCR similar to that seen with CXCR2 (59Burger M. Burger J.A. Hoch R.C. Oades Z. Takamori H. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2017-2022PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that KSHV-GPCR-induced activation of NF-κB and secretion of IL-8 contribute to the proliferation of cells that express this constitutively active receptor.A characteristic feature of Kaposi's sarcoma is overgrowth of vascular endothelial cells. It has been shown in transgenic mice that KSHV-GPCR is primarily responsible for the vascular overgrowth found in Kaposi's sarcoma (10Yang B.T. Chen S.C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M. Sullivan L. Jenh C.H. Narula S.K. Chensue S.W. Lira S.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). KSHV-GPCR activates hypoxia-inducing factor 1α, resulting in increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (17Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor has been shown to play an important role in KSHV-GPCR-stimulated angiogenesis (8Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 10Yang B.T. Chen S.C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M. Sullivan L. Jenh C.H. Narula S.K. Chensue S.W. Lira S.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is notable that IL-8 and a number of CXC chemokines bearing the NH2-terminal Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) sequence can stimulate proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and therefore are angiogenic factors (60Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 61Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Arenberg D.A. Addison C.L. Ehlert J.E. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). These CXC chemokines bind and activate CXCR2, expressed in vascular endothelial cells, and stimulate the growth of these cells (62Addison C.L. Daniel T.O. Burdick M.D. Liu H. Ehlert J.E. Xue Y.Y. Buechi L. Walz A. Richmond A. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5269-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Therefore, KSHV-GPCR-stimulated activation of NF-κB and the resultant secretion of IL-8 may contribute to angiogenesis and vascular overgrowth as seen in Kaposi's sarcoma. Interestingly, the ELR+ GRO-α/MGSA could further stimulate IL-8 secretion, whereas the angiostatic and ELR−CXC chemokine IP-10 (61Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Arenberg D.A. Addison C.L. Ehlert J.E. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited the induced IL-8 secretion. These results suggest that chemokines can positively and negatively regulate angiogenic factor production in cells that express KSHV-GPCR.While this paper was in review, Schwarz and Murphy (31Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reported secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in cells transfected to express KSHV-GPCR. Although the study does not lead to identification of the G proteins that couples KSHV-GPCR, the findings suggest that more than one G protein is involved in KSHV-GPCR signaling. This work also demonstrates that the ability of KSHV-GPCR to activate NF-κB and AP-1 is preserved in several cell lines. In another recent publication, Couty et al. (32Couty J.P. Geras-Raaka E. Weksler B.B. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33805-33811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) demonstrated with strong evidence that KSHV-GPCR can couple to Gi/o and Gq. They also displayed constitutive NF-κB activation in the transfected mouse lung endothelial cells, that could be further increased by the KSHV-GPCR agonist GRO-α (32Couty J.P. Geras-Raaka E. Weksler B.B. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33805-33811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since Gαq and the phospholipase Cβ pathway is not constitutively activated by this receptor in mouse lung endothelial cells, the inability of PTX and transducin to completely block constitutive activation of NF-κB in mouse lung endothelial cells suggests the presence of another signaling molecule, possibly a G protein, in coupling the receptor for this function. Furthermore, Couty et al. (32Couty J.P. Geras-Raaka E. Weksler B.B. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33805-33811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that KSHV-GPCR stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via a PTX-insensitive mechanism. Thus, our finding that Gα13 functionally couples KSHV-GPCR for NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion complements these recent reports and demonstrates for the first time that a chemokine receptor can utilize Gα13 for transcriptional regulation. With the recent identification of US28 as another constitutively active chemokine receptor of viral origin (41Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether expression of a constitutively active GPCR is a general mechanism by which viruses and environmental stress regulate homeostasis of host cells. Chemokine receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 that share a characteristic 7-transmembrane domain structure. Recent studies have demonstrated that chemokine receptors play important roles in lymphocyte homing, migration of phagocytes to inflammatory sites, and entry of HIV-1 into host cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Zlotnik A. Morales J. Hedrick J.A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Murdoch C. Finn A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3032-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors bind a large number of chemokines, peptides of typically 8–10 kDa and contain cysteine residues at defined positions. Activation of chemokine receptors results in the dissociation of Gα from Gβγ proteins, triggering a series of signaling events leading to chemotaxis and other cellular functions (1Zlotnik A. Morales J. Hedrick J.A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Murdoch C. Finn A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3032-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human herpesvirus 8 is a recently identified γ-herpesvirus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and hence is also named Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (3Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (4926) Google Scholar, 4Moore P.S. Gao S.J. Dominguez G. Cesarman E. Lungu O. Knowles D.M. Garber R.

Kaposi's sarcoma is characterized by angiogenic proliferation of mesenchymal cells, resulting in abundant vascular spaces filled with red blood cells and surrounded by spindle cells. KSHV DNA is found in spindle cells as well as endothelial cells in the lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma, suggesting that the viral DNA encodes proteins that contribute to overgrowth of vascular endothelial cells (4M"

The ileal bile acid transporter on the apical membrane of enterocytes mediates the intestinal uptake of bile salts, but little is known about the bile salt secretion from the basolateral membrane of enterocytes into blood. In the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), is expressed, which has the ability to transport bile salts. We hypothesized that MRP3 might play a role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts by transporting them from enterocytes into circulating blood through the up-regulation of MRP3expression, so we investigated the transcriptional control ofMRP3 in response to bile salts. MRP3 mRNA levels were increased about 3-fold in human colon cells by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the promoter assay, the promoter activity ofMRP3 was increased about 3-fold over the basal promoter activity when treated with CDCA, and the putative bile salt-responsive elements exist in the region −229/−138 including two α-1 fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF)-like elements. Constructs with a specific mutation in the consensus sequence of FTF elements showed no increase in basal transcriptional activity following CDCA treatment. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts, specific binding of FTF to FTF-like elements was observed when treated with CDCA. The expression of FTF mRNA levels were also markedly enhanced in response to CDCA, and overexpression of FTF specifically activated the MRP3 promoter activity about 4-fold over the basal promoter activity. FTF thus might play a key role not only in the bile salt synthetic pathway in hepatocytes but also in the bile salt excretion pathway in enterocytes through the regulation of MRP3 expression.

In the synthetic pathway in the liver, bile salts exert negative feedback regulation on their own synthesis from cholesterol. CYP7A1,1 which is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in a major bile salt synthetic pathway, is under transcriptional control through a specific bile salt nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (7Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 8Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G.

Transcription of the CYP7A1 gene is turned down by bile acids through the interaction of an orphan nuclear receptor FTF with the supressor small heterodimer partner, which is up-regulated by binding of FXR to bile acids (7Makishima M.

In view of the excretion/efflux pathway of bile salts, several transporters that are expressed in the liver and/or gut confer enterohepatic circulation by exporting bile salts. In the liver, intracellular bile salts are uptaken from circulating blood through the basolateral membrane transporter, NTCP, and they are excreted into the bile duct mainly by BSEP in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocytes (1Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). MRP2, a member of the MRP superfamily, expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, may also export bile salts into the bile duct (11Kuipers F. Enserink M. Havinga R. van der Steen A.B. Hardonk M.J. Fevery J. Vonk R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the gut, bile salts enter the enterocytes through the ileal apical membrane sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and interact with FXR, resulting in up-regulation of the gene encoding cytosolic ileal bile acid-binding protein, which facilitates intracellular transport of bile salts and protects enterocytes from the detergent effects of bile salts (7Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 12Oelkers P. Dawson P.A.

Members of the MRP family mediate unidirectional ATP-dependent transport of anionic conjugates and amphiphilic anions (17Keppler D. Jedlitschky G. Leier I.

In rats receiving common bile duct ligation, estrogen treatment, and administration of endotoxin as acquired cholestasis models, basolateral Ntcp was down-regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, and also canalicular Bsep was initially diminished but partially recovered as common bile duct ligation continues (28Gartung C.

The expression of Mrp2 is down-regulated in these animal models of cholestasis through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events (30Lee J. Boyer J.L. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the expression of Mrp3 was induced (31Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol.

In humans, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease, is characterized by a defect in the transfer of endogenous and exogenous anionic conjugates from hepatocytes into the bile because of mutations in MRP2 gene (33Paulusma C.C.

It was reported that MRP3 was up-regulated in a patient with Dubin-Johnson syndrome (27Koenig J. Rost D. Cui Y.H. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). MRP3 thus appears to compensate for the impaired function of MRP2 in the liver and respond to bile salts at transcriptional levels. These experiments suggest that bile salt transporters in hepatocytes respond to cholestasis in a direction that tends to diminish retention of bile salts in the liver, resulting in protection of the tissue from further injury (30Lee J. Boyer J.L. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Relevant studies demonstrated that MRP3 transports the bile salts, 17β-estradiol, and some anti-cancer drugs (23Uchiumi T. Hinoshita E. Haga S. Nakamura T. Tanaka T. Toh S. Furukawa M. Kawabe T.

While the expression of MRP1 and MDR1 is high in hepatocytes, expression of both MRP1 and MDR1 as well as BSEP is very low or absent in enterocytes. By contrast, expression of MRP3 appears in the basolateral enterocyte membrane of humans and rats, suggesting that MRP3 might be responsible for the intestinal transport of organic anions (18Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar, 27Koenig J. Rost D. Cui Y.H. Keppler D.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). Since MRP3, which transports bile salts, is localized in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, MRP3 may play a role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts by transporting them from enterocytes into circulating blood to prevent the accumulation of intracellular bile salts. Furthermore, since expression of apical bile salt transporter is induced by bile salts (38Stravitz R.T. Sanyal A.J. Pandak W.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Beets J.W. Dawson P.A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1599-1608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that MRP3 expression could be up-regulated in a coordinated fashion in response to bile salts in the enterocytes. In this study, MRP3 mRNA was found to be up-regulated in response to bile salts in enterocytes, and we examined whether bile salts affect transcriptional control ofMRP3 gene in enterocytes. We observed that FTF-like elements are responsible for the up-regulation of MRP3 gene in response to bile salts. We would propose a novel idea that MRP3 may play a role in bile salts homeostasis through enterohepatic circulation at transcriptional levels. As an in vitro model, we used Caco2 cells from a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, which retain many of the characteristics of normal enterocytes (39Meunier V. Bourrie M. Berger Y. Fabre G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1995; 11: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 40Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Chu X.Y. Tamai I. Tsuji A. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C). The medium contained 0.292 mg/ml glutamine, 100 mg/ml kanamycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (41Tanaka T. Uchiumi T. Hinoshita E. Inokuchi A. Toh S. Wada M. Takano H. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CDCA, TCDCA, taurocholic acid, taurolithocholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid were purchased from Sigma. To study the effect of bile salts treatment on intestinal MRP3 mRNA expression in vitro, cells were cultured for 48 h with 0–100 μm CDCA, TCDCA, taurocholic acid, taurolithocholic acid, or ursodeoxycholic acid and were treated with 100 μm CDCA for 0–48 h. For the preparation of nuclear extracts, cells were treated with 100 μm CDCA for 12 h. Total RNA was isolated using an Rneasy spin column (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA samples (15 μg/lane) were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and were transferred to a membrane as described by Tanaka et al. (41Tanaka T. Uchiumi T. Hinoshita E. Inokuchi A. Toh S. Wada M. Takano H. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The membranes were prehybridized and hybridized with α-32P-labeled probes (41Tanaka T. Uchiumi T. Hinoshita E. Inokuchi A. Toh S. Wada M. Takano H. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An MRP3 cDNA probe (285 bp) was produced by PCR using the primer pair 5′-GTCTTTGTTCCAGACGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-GGAGATGAAGAACAGGCAGG-3′. AFTF cDNA probe (1109 bp) was digested from the pCI-FTF vector by BamHI. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography and was analyzed using a Fujix Bas 2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). A human placental genomic library in λEMBL3 was screened with a fragment of the 5′-untranslated region ofMRP3 cDNA obtained by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. Several restriction fragments were subcloned into the pUC18 plasmid. Chain elongation and termination were performed using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan), and the nucleotides were sequenced using a DNA-sequencing system (model 377; Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using GeneWorks software (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA). To functionally characterize the 5′-flanking region of the human MRP3 gene, a series of 5′ deletions ranging from −1958 to −13 bp of the upstream sequence from the ATG codon were amplified using PCR from the subcloned pUC18 plasmid with KOD Dash polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan). The upstream primers contained a 5′-flanking SacI restriction site, whereas the downstream primers were flanked by the HindIII site. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which was subsequently digested with SacI and HindIII. The fragments of the 5′ region of the MRP3 gene were ligated into the SacI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). All plasmids were analyzed by restriction digestion, and the promoter inserts were sequenced. Site-directed mutagenesis of the FTF in p-520 MRP3 Luci was performed by a PCR-based method. Two FTF-like elements exist in p-520 MRP3 Luci; we named the upper region site 1 and the lower region site 2. The promoter sequences were amplified first with Taq polymerase, a 5′-primer (GAGCTCAGCTTCCTGATTGAGC), and a 3′-primer that introduces a specific mutation into the FTF site 1 region (CGCCGTGCTACATGCCCCCCCAC) or into the FTF site 2 region (ACCTCTGCCCTACATTCCCTCCCA), and another pair, a 5′-primer that introduces specific mutation into the FTF site 1 region (GTGGGGGGGCATGTAGCACGGCG) or into the FTF site 2 region (TGGGAGGGAATGTAGGGCAGAGGT) and a 3′-primer (ACCGCGCTCGCCTTCCTTGC). A second PCR was then performed with Taq polymerase using the first PCR products as a template. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector, which was subsequently digested withSacI and HindIII. The fragments were ligated into the SacI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Cells were transiently transfected by the LipofectAMINE method. Briefly, a mixture of 50 μg of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 1 μg of reporter plasmid was transfected into the cells and kept there for 6 h, and then fresh medium was added. The 100 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega) plasmid containing Renilla luciferase driven by the CMV promoter was co-transfected as a transfection control. The pGL3-control vector (Promega) containing SV40 promoter-enhancer and promoterless pGL3-basic vector were transfected as positive and negative controls of promoter activity, respectively. The 200 ng of pCI-FTF was transfected into COS7 cells with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 100 ng of pRL-CMV. Luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega). Promoter activities are given as mean ± S.D. of triplicate transfections. The level of significance of promoter activities in the presence of regular substrates was determined using Student's t test. Nuclear extracts (6 μg of protein) were prepared as described (42Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I. Naito S. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10550-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) previously, and they were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 1 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in the absence or presence of various competitors. Next, the samples were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gel (polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 79:1) in a Tris borate buffer. The gel was exposed to an imaging plate and analyzed using a Fujix BAS 2000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). The DNA sequence of the sense strand of each oligonucleotide is listed in Fig. 6 A. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of the crude serum was used. To examine whether the expression of ABC transporters appearing in enterocytes is altered by bile salts, we performed Northern blot analysis by using Caco2 cells. Treatment with 100 μm concentrations of several series of bile salts, CDCA, TCDCA, taurocholic acid, and taurolithocholic acid, for 48 h increased MRP3 mRNA levels about 3–5-fold in Caco2 cells, while ursodeoxycholic acid treatment did not enhanceMRP3 mRNA expression (Fig. 1 A). We next examined dose response to bile salt and time kinetics for up-regulation of the MRP3 gene by CDCA. Treatment with CDCA for 48 h increased mRNA levels of MRP3 about 2–5-fold in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum increase observed at 10–100 μm (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, there was no increase of mRNA levels of the ABC transporters MDR1 and MRP2, which are expressed on the apical membrane of enterocytes by CDCA treatment (Fig. 1 B). In the time kinetic analysis with CDCA treatment,MRP3 mRNA levels were increased 2–4-fold when treated for more than 6 h with 100 μm CDCA, and maximal increase was observed at 12 h (Fig. 1 C). We determined by nuclear run-on assay that the up-regulation of MRP3 gene by CDCA was due to transcriptional control and observed enhanced transcription activity of MRP3 in the nuclear run-on assay when treated with bile salt (data not shown). We then cloned the MRP3 promoter region up to −1.9 kilobases from the ATG codon, and a series of promoter deletions were constructed in the reporter gene vector pGL3 basic vector (Fig. 2). By making a computer-aided analysis with the TFMATRIX transcription factor binding site profile data base, we identified several consensus motifs for transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 2). The luciferase activity by a series of 5′-deleted promoter constructs after 48 h of transfection without CDCA treatment (Fig. 2). Compared with p-311, the luciferase activity decreased to 50% when p-229 was assayed, suggesting that a putative positive cis-element was located in the −311/−229 region. Furthermore, we observed more than a 50% decrease in the luciferase activity by p-138 compared with p-311. These results suggest that a positive regulatory element is localized in the −311/−138 region in transfected cells. We next investigated which region of MRP3promoter was responsible for CDCA-induced activation. The luciferase activity of p-520, p-311, and p-229 was about 2–4-fold increased compared with the luciferase activity of untreated control when treated with 100 μm CDCA for 24 h. By contrast, the luciferase activity of p-138 was not increased by CDCA (Fig. 3). These results suggest that an element responsible for MRP3 promoter activation by CDCA is located between −229 and −138. This region contains two putative FTF binding elements (−222/−218 and −199/−195).Figure 3Alteration of MRP3 promoter-luciferase activity in response to CDCA in Caco2 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with one of these plasmids and pRL-CMV with or without a 100 μm concentration of the CDCA for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activities were corrected for differences in transfection efficiency byRenilla luciferase activity and were normalized to the activity of pGL3-basic vector transfected in cells. Data are shown as the means ± S.D.

Introduction of the specific mutation into either FTF1 or FTF2 and into both FTF1 and FTF2 completely inhibited CDCA-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that both of the two FTF-like elements have a regulatory role in the alteration of MRP3 expression in response to CDCA. The p-520mut1, p-520mut2, and p-520mut3 constructs showed no apparent change of the basal transcriptional activity in the absence of CDCA treatment, suggesting that these mutations did not affect the basalMRP3 promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). To investigate whetherMRP3 transcription activated by CDCA was altered by the interplay of FTF, we performed EMSA to study interaction ofMRP3 promoter with FTF sequence by using nuclear extracts of Caco2 cells after CDCA treatment for 12 h. The DNA sequence of the sense strand of oligonucleotide, FTF, is listed in Fig. 5 A. We also made three types of mutant oligonucleotides containing the internal mutations of FTF binding elements of oligonucleotides FTF1, FTF2, and FTF3 (Mut-FTF1, Mut-FTF2, and Mut-FTF3, respectively). In addition, we made Mut-FTF4, oligonucleotides containing the internal mutations between the two FTF binding elements (Fig. 5 A). EMSA was performed using the radiolabeled FTF as a probe. The retarded band (a) was observed when the probe FTF interacted with nuclear extracts of CDCA-treated cells (Fig. 5 B). The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was demonstrated by appropriate competition assays. The upper retarded band (a) was almost completely obscured by a 20-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides FTF, FTF1, and FTF2 (Fig. 5 B). The exogenous addition of excess amounts of mutant oligonucleotides Mut-FTF1 and Mut-FTF2, containing mutations of one of the FTF binding elements, and Mut-FTF4, containing the internal mutations between the two FTF binding elements, could also inhibit the protein binding to the probe FTF (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, Mut-FTF3, oligonucleotides containing mutations in both of the two FTF binding elements, did not obscure the retarded band (a) (Fig. 5 B). To examine whether the nuclear factor interacting with the FTF element on MRP3 promoter is FTF, we used a specific antibody developed against the FTF. Nuclear extract was preincubated with antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to the DNA binding domain of FTF, and the retarded band was abolished (Fig. 6), but preimmune serum did not affect the retarded band. The protein that bound to the probe FTF appears to be FTF. We examined whether the expression of the FTF gene was affected by CDCA. In Northern blot analysis by using Caco2 cells treated with or without 100 μm of CDCA for 48 h, we observed that humanFTF mRNA levels were markedly increased by treatment with CDCA (Fig. 7). We next confirmed if FTF could directly modulate MRP3 promoter activity when FTF was overexpressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 8). The luciferase activity of p-520 was about 3-fold increased when 200 ng of pCI-FTF was co-transfected. By contrast, introduction of the specific mutation into either FTF1 or FTF2 and into both FTF1 and FTF2 completely inhibited FTF-induced luciferase activity.Figure 8Alteration of MRP3 promoter-luciferase activity by overexpression of FTF in COS7 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with one of these plasmids and pRL-CMV with or without 200 ng of pCI-FTF for 48 h and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activities were corrected for differences in transfection efficiency by Renilla luciferase activity and were normalized to the activity of pGL3-basic vector transfected in cells.

These findings suggest that a basolateral export system via MRP3 may secrete bile salts into portal blood and protect enterocytes from further intracellular accumulation of bile salts. However, it remains to be determined whether MRP3 is directly involved in the efflux pathway for bile salts in enterocytes. We observed that transcriptional control by FTF was an underlying mechanism for the up-regulation of theMRP3 gene in enterocytes by bile salts. In our present study, the luciferase activity driven by p-520, p-311, and p-229 was increased about 3-fold over the basal level when treated with 100 μm of CDCA for 12 h, but the luciferase activity driven by p-138 was not changed, and the alteration of MRP3promoter activity was comparable with induction of cellularMRP3 mRNA levels. These findings suggested that putative bile salt-responsive elements existed in the region between −229 and −138 (Fig. 3). This region contains two FTF-like elements (−222/−218 and −199/−195), suggesting the close involvement of FTF in bile salt-induced up-regulation of the MRP3 gene in enterocytes. FTF, a member of the Ftz-F1 family of orphan receptors, is expressed in the liver, pancreas, and gut, and it plays a role in hepatocyte bile salt synthesis. Feedback repression by bile salts of theCYP7A1 gene is mediated through interaction of FTF with its heterodimeric partner, the small heterodimer partner, induced by bile salt receptor FXR (10Nitta M.

Furthermore, FTF appears to be essential for both expression and bile acid-mediated regulation of sterol 12α-hydroxylase (9del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration these results together, FTF appears to play an important role in the maintenance of bile acids and cholesterol homeostasis. Several series of promoter constructs with a specific mutation in the consensus sequence of FTF showed no increase of the basal transcriptional activity by CDCA (Fig. 4 B). Both FTF-like elements seem likely to have a regulatory role in MRP3expression in response to CDCA. These mutations of FTF-like elements did not affect the basal transcriptional activity (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, FTF appears to play a key role in the basal gene expression of both CYP7A1 and 12α-hydroxylase (9del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The regulatory involvement of FTF in MRP3 gene expression might be different from CYP7A1 and 12α-hydroxylase gene expression. One could argue if any other factor might have a regulatory role in the basal expression of MRP3 gene. Our previous study indicated that the liver-abundant transcription factor C/EBPβ at −356/−343 is required for the expression of another MRP family member, MRP2, in hepatocytes (41Tanaka T. Uchiumi T. Hinoshita E. Inokuchi A. Toh S. Wada M. Takano H. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The MRP3promoter also contains C/EBPβ at −820/−520 and C/EBPα at −520/−461 (Fig. 2). However, deletion constructs of these sequences at −820/−520 and at −520/−461 showed significant promoter activity in enterocytes (Fig. 2). The MRP3 gene is abundantly expressed in colon, small intestine, and liver in human (23Uchiumi T. Hinoshita E. Haga S. Nakamura T. Tanaka T. Toh S. Furukawa M. Kawabe T. Wada M. Kagotani K. Okumura K. Kohno K. Akiyama S. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 9: 103-110Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but C/EBPα and C/EBPβ might not be responsible for expression of theMRP3 gene in human colon cells. Treatment with oxysterol, ligands of LXR, in fibroblasts or macrophages dramatically enhanced expression of the putative cholesterol/phospholipid ABC transporter ABCA1 through an oxysterol receptor, LXR (46Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). A relevant study by Repa et al. (47Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) has also demonstrated that both LXR and FXR are the retinoid X receptor heterodimeric partners that mediate expression of ABCA1 andCYP7A1 genes, resulting in regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Although the LXR motif exists at −311/−229 on the humanMRP3 promoter, our present study showed that the bile salt-responsive element was −229/−138. Moreover, MRP3promoter sequence does not contain the motifs corresponding to FXR and retinoid X receptor, suggesting the existence of pleiotropic regulatory mechanisms for expression of other relevant genes involving bile acids homeostasis. In EMSA, a specific protein-DNA binding activity was observed when treated with CDCA (Fig. 5 B). This protein-DNA binding activity was abolished when anti-FTF antibody was exogenously added, suggesting that the binding protein is in fact FTF (Fig. 6). Binding of the nuclear factor (FTF) to the oligonucleotide FTF binding sites was almost completely blocked by the unlabeled oligonucleotides and also by oligonucleotide containing the internal mutation of one of the two FTF sites (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, there appeared to be no competition resulting from the presence of the oligonucleotides containing mutation in both FTF sites. It appears likely that FTF binds to the two FTF sites on the MRP3 promoter and also that the FTF binding to both FTF sites is requisite for bile salt-inducedMRP3 promoter activation. The expression levels of FTF mRNA as well asMRP3 mRNA were markedly increased by CDCA (Fig. 7). Overexpression of FTF enhanced MRP3 promoter activity but not when mutations were introduced in one or two FTF-like elements in the MRP3 promoter (Fig. 8). These results suggested that bile salts might up-regulate the MRP3 gene through transcriptional control by altering the expression levels of FTF and also by interacting with as yet unidentified co-factors. Since bile acids do not act as ligand of FTF (45del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), another factor mediating bile acid-dependent induction might be required. Further study is needed to know whether any other factor could also be responsible for bile acid-induced regulation in addition to FTF. Bile salts often exert negative feedback regulation on their own synthesis in hepatocytes and interruption of the enterohepatic circulation enhanced cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, suggesting that a similar molecular basis of interaction of FTF and its two sites is responsible for bile acid-induced regulation of cholesterol bile acid biosynthesis and bile acid efflux transporter, MRP3. A recent study reported that FTF was induced by bile acid-activated FXR in hepatocytes (48Chen W. Owsley E. Yang Y. Stroup D. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1402-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and might play its critical role in bile salt-induced alteration of relevant gene expression. FTF gene in enterocytes thus appears to be regulated in a way similar to the event in hepatocytes. In conclusion, bile acid enhanced the expression of an ABC transporter, MRP3, which is known to efflux bile acids in human colon cells. This up-regulation of MRP3 by bile acid was mediated through binding of FTF to its binding sites on the MRP3 promoter. The results of these recent studies indicate that during enterohepatic circulation of bile salts, the transcription factor FTF may play a key role not only in bile acid biosynthesis in the liver but also in expression of MRP3 in the gut in response to bile acids (Fig. 9). We suspect that the ABC transporter, MRP3, might also be involved in cholesterol/bile acid homeostasis. We thank Dr. David W. Russell for anti-FTF antibodies and Dr. Luc Belanger for pCI-FTF plasmid.

The extracted myosin (1–2 μg/15-mm length) was sufficient to define the actomyosin dissociation reaction in flash photolysis using caged-ATP (Weiss, S., Chizhov, I., and Geeves, M. A. (2000) J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil.21, 423–432). The ADP inhibition of the dissociation reaction was also studied to give the ADP affinity for actomyosin (K AD). The apparent second order rate constant of actomyosin dissociation gets faster (K 1 k +2 = 0.17 −0.26 μm−1.s−1), whereas the affinity for ADP is weakened (250–930 μm) in the isoform order I, IIA, IIX, IIB. Both sets of values correlate well with the measured maximum shortening velocity (V 0) of the parent fibers. If the value of K AD is controlled largely by the rate constant of ADP release (k −AD), then the estimated value ofk −AD is sufficiently low to limitV 0. In contrast, [ATP]K 1 k +2 at a physiological concentration of 5 mm ATP would be 2.5–6 times faster than k −AD.

It is now clear that all of these properties are to a large extent determined by the isoforms of the myosin heavy chains expressed in individual muscle cells (6Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structure-function studies have attempted to define the underlying molecular basis of these differing mechanochemical properties of myosins within the skeletal muscle myosins and in the wider family of myosins. It is generally accepted that the sequence of events in the actomyosin cross-bridge cycle is essentially the same for all muscle myosins. The different properties can therefore be attributed to modulation of the rates and equilibrium constants (and hence free energy changes) of individual molecular events by changes in myosin sequence. Early studies suggest a correlation between the maximum shortening velocity of a muscle fiber (i.e. the velocity in the absence of any mechanical load) and the overall ATPase rate (8Barany M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50 (suppl.): 197-218Crossref Scopus (1385) Google Scholar) for a range of muscle types, since both reflect the underlying speed of the cross-bridge cycle. Detailed biochemical kinetic studies of myosin isoforms were pioneered in 1980 by Marston and Taylor (9Marston S.B. Taylor E.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 573-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) using four different muscle types of the chicken. They found that the relative rates of most of the steps in the ATPase cycle varied with myosin isoform but that most events remained too fast to contribute to defining the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis and, thus, the overall rate of energy transduction. For example, the rate of the ATP cleavage step was too fast to limit the overall cycling rate. They proposed that the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle was associated with the overall rate of reattachment of actin to the myosin products complex (M·ADP·Pi) and the product (Pi and ADP) release. In a paper of great insight, Siemankowski et al. (10Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) estimate the rate of release of ADP from the actomyosin complex for a series of myosins isolated from a wide variety of sources including different muscle types (smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle) and different species (chicken, rat, rabbit). This work proposed that the rate of ADP release from a myosin was a major contributor to defining the maximum shortening velocity of a muscle expressing that myosin. Recently the focus of attention has largely switched to studies of myosins of defined sequence and 3-dimensional structure. Such studies have examined naturally occurring variants of myosin to look for structure-function relationships. The overexpression of modified versions of myosin have allowed the investigation of chimeric myosins and myosins carrying specific mutations (e.g. cardiac myopathy point mutations) to pinpoint the parts of myosin responsible for particular properties (11Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 12Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In a series of recent studies the mechanochemical properties of single muscle fibers and the myosins isolated from such fibers were compared (3Bottinelli R. Canepari M. Reggiani C. Stienen G.J. J. Physiol. 1994; 481: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Bottinelli R. Betto R. Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J.

Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In particular, the work showed that significant changes in shortening velocity have been observed in muscle fibers expressing myosin isoforms that have few differences in sequence. For example the β-isoform of rat and human myosin heavy chain (β-MHC1 or MHC-I) are >95% identical in the myosin motor domain, with only 14 nonconservative point mutations throughout the 860-amino acid sequence, yet differ in motility properties; the myosins differ by a factor of 2 in the in vitro motility assays, and muscle fibers expressing the myosin have a 2-fold difference in maximum shortening velocity (16Canepari M. Rossi R. Pellegrino M.A. Bottinelli R. Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore considered that a study of the biochemical kinetic properties of the mammalian myosin isoforms may prove of interest in testing the hypothesis of Siemankowski et al. (10Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) on a series of closely related myosins whose contractile and energetic properties are well characterized. Although there have been many studies of the mechanical properties of mammalian muscle fibers (both intact and skinned), biochemical characterization of mammalian-striated MHC isoforms has been limited because of the difficulty of isolating pure heavy chain isoforms. There is no effective overexpression system for mammalian-striated muscle myosin isoforms. Isolation of myosin from bulk muscle (as used by Siemankowski and White (17Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) results in a preparation containing mixed isoforms, since most mammalian muscles contain multiple myosin isoforms. In contrast, single isolated muscle fibers often contain a single MHC isoform (18Staron R.S. Pette D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 409: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the amount of myosin that can be isolated from a 2-cm-long single muscle fiber of rat is sufficient to characterize the ATP-induced dissociation reaction and the affinity of ADP for actomyosin using a flash photolysis apparatus developed for this purpose (19Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We report here the first kinetic characterization of all four MHC skeletal isoforms (type I, IIA, IIB, and IIX) expressed in adult rat muscle and show that both the rate of ATP induced dissociation of actomyosin and the rate of release of ADP from actomyosin becomes faster as the maximum shortening velocity of muscle fibers expressing the MHC isoform increases. The myosin used in these measurements was extracted from 15-mm-long single muscle fibers dissected from bundles of fresh soleus and psoas rat muscle. The fibers were manually dissected, chemically skinned (according to Bottinelliet al. (4Bottinelli R. Betto R. Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)), and cut in two segments. The smaller segment (∼2 mm) was dissolved in 20 μl of standard buffer solution (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar) and used for MHC isoform identification by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels prepared according to Talmadge and Roy (21Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was run for 24 h at 250 V. Gels were silver-stained, and in the region of the myosin heavy chain (molecular mass, ∼220 kDa) four bands were separated corresponding to the four MHC isoforms. Fig. 1 A shows a gel with one example each of a fiber expressing a single MHC together with a sample containing a mixture of all four isoforms. The major part of the fiber (∼13 mm) was incubated in 30 μl of myosin extraction buffer (100 mmKH2PO4, 50 mmK2HPO4, 0.3 m KCl) for 3 h on ice, after which the fiber was removed and discarded. The myosin solution was dialyzed twice in a microdialysis system developed with Prof. J. Sparrow (University of York) against 0.5 ml of experimental buffer containing 500 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, and 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.0 and used without further purification. Rabbit actin was purified by the method of Spudich and Watt (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its molar concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (ε1% = 1.104 cm−1) and a molecular mass of 42 kDa (23West J.J. Nagy B. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phalloidin-stabilized F-actin was used in all experiments and was made by incubating 10 μm F-actin and 10 μm phalloidin in experimental buffer overnight (24Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Caged ATP (cATP; ATP-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester) was prepared by selective alkylation of ATP with 1(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester as described by Walker et al.(25Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The flash photolysis system was constructed in Canterbury and has been described in detail by Weisset al. (2000) (19Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The quartz sample cuvette (1.5 × 1.5 × 20 mm, standard sample volume of 20 μl) in the core of the optical system can be exposed to a 5-ns flash from a Nd-YAG laser (Surelite I-10, Continuum) with a pulse energy of up to 70 mJ (and a maximum of 15 mJ used in these experiments) at a wavelength of 355 nm. This provides light for the release of ATP from the cATP and was used to liberate up to 45 μm ATP from 0.5–1 mm cATP at a rate of 90 s−1. The optical bench was designed for simultaneous time-resolved detection of transmission changes and light-scattering changes. For detection a 100-W halogen lamp (Xenophot HLX 12 V, Osram) was used. The sample was exposed to white light of wavelengths of >389 nm (KV 389 filter, Schott, Germany) to prevent photolysis of cATP by light of a shorter wavelength). The speed and extent of ATP release from cATP in each transient were estimated via transmission changes at 405 nm, which monitors the photochemical breakdown of cATP (19Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Light scattering at 90° to the incident light was used to monitor the dissociation of actomyosin. 50,000 data points were collected per transient then compressed to 560 data points on a quasi-logarithmic time scale for computer analysis using Microcal Origin 6.0 Professional (26Chizhov I.

To reuse the same sample in multiple flash experiments, the sample contained sufficient additional enzymes to break down either ATP (0.03 units/μl hexakinase, 1 mm glucose, and 100 μm Ap5A) or ATP and ADP (0.01 units/μl apyrase) on a minute time scale. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of the differences between the means was assessed by variance analysis followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. A probability of less than 5% was considered significant. The kinetic model of actomyosin dissociation by ATP and its inhibition by ADP is defined by Scheme I, and the kinetic equation used to analyze the reaction is shown in Equation 1, where A,M, T, and D are actin, myosin heads, ATP, and ADP respectively. K 1 (=k +1/k −1) is the association constant for formation of the A·M·T complex, andk +2 is the rate constant for the isomerization of A·M·T to A-M·T; the subsequent dissociation of actin from this complex is assumed to be very fast. K AD(=k −AD/k +AD) defines the dissociation constant for ADP binding to A·M (17Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol.

Single soleus fibers yielded myosin preparations of pure isoforms of MHC-I (38%), MHC-IIA (32%), and preparations containing mixed isoforms (30%). For psoas fibers, the preparations gave isolated isoforms of 47% pure MHC-IIB and 49% pure MHC-IIX. Mixed isoforms were found in 4% of the psoas fibers. Muscle fibers that did not contain a pure isoform were discarded, and pure myosin isoforms were extracted from the remaining fibers into a final volume of less than 50 μl using micro incubation and dialysis methods. Comparison of the staining intensities of the gel in Fig.1 B shows that the extraction method provides yields of ∼2 μg of myosin with little contamination with actin or other proteins. The figure also suggests that more than 2/3 of the total myosin content of the fiber was extracted using this method. Thus, it is unlikely that any major improvements can be made in the quantity of myosin extracted. The binding of ATP to actomyosin causes fast and irreversible dissociation of the complex, and after all the ATP is hydrolyzed, the complex reforms. The rate of hydrolysis of ATP by actomyosin under these conditions is relatively slow (>10 min for 45 μm ATP under the conditions used), and to allow a faster elimination of ATP and ADP, apyrase was added to the samples. Weiss et al. (19Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) show that the presence of apyrase has little effect on the observed rate of the dissociation reaction. This procedure allows the same sample to be reused a number of times with different flash intensities to vary the [ATP] released. 15 μl of the extracted myosin solution in experimental buffer were mixed with 5 μl of reaction mix to give a final volume of 20 μl containing ∼0.15 μm myosin, 0.5 μmphalloidin-stabilized actin and 0.5 mm cATP, 10 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml apyrase. As shown in Fig.2 A for a sample of MHC-IIB, irradiation by a series of laser pulses of different intensities released a range of ATP concentrations. The concentration of ATP liberated in each flash was estimated from the decay of the absorbance of 405 nm, which monitors the formation and decay of the aci-nitro photolysis intermediate (19Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The same sample was used for all the transients shown in Fig. 2 A, and after each transient was recorded, the sample was left for 3 min for all the ATP to be hydrolyzed before the next flash. The decrease in light scattering was described by a single exponential, and the best fit to a single exponential is superimposed in each case. The observed rate constant (k obs) of each reaction was linearly dependent upon [ATP]. Fig. 2 B shows the dependence ofk obs on [ATP] for each of the four MHC isoforms isolated. In each case a linear relationship was observed, and the slope of the fitted line defined the apparent second order rate constant of the ATP-induced dissociation reaction (K 1 k +2, Scheme 1). The plots show different slopes for each isoform except for IIB and IIX, which were very similar. The pooled data from a series of measurements using at least six individual fibers for each myosin isoform are given in Table I. These show that the differences between isoforms IIX and IIB are not statistically significant, whereas all other comparisons are significant.Table IComparison of the experimental values for the four MHC isoforms of rat skeletal muscleV 0ATPase activityK 1 k +2K ADL s −1nmol mm −3 s −1μm −1 s −1μmMHC-I1.05 ± 0.370.045 ± 0.0060.172 ± 0.019 (9)250 ± 17MHC-IIA2.33 ± 0.290.168 ± 0.0260.21 ± 0.027 (6)483 ± 30MHC-IIX3.07 ± 0.70.178 ± 0.0230.27 ± 0.032 (5)753 ± 52MHC-IIB3.69 ± 1.010.230 ± 0.010.255 ± 0.019 (6)934 ± 39The values for V 0 (in segment length, L, per second) and ATPase activity were taken from Bottinelli et al.(3,4).

The competition between ADP and ATP for the myosin nucleotide site provides a method to determine the affinity of ADP for the actomyosin complex (17Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, ADP will reduce the affinity of myosin for actin, and at the low protein concentrations used here, this results in a loss of signal amplitude (Fig. 3 A). To counteract this loss of amplitude, the protein concentrations were increased to 1 μm actin and 0.75 μm myosin. To have sufficient myosin for these experiments, five fibers of the same isoform content were pooled for the extraction procedure. The incubation mixtures contained hexakinase and glucose to remove ATP but leave ADP present; additionally, the myokinase inhibitor Ap5A was added as a precaution against interconversion of ADP and ATP. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3 A for MHC-IIB. The first flash in the absence of ADP shows a single exponential decay of scattering as in Fig. 2 A. The amount of ATP released in each flash was calculated by analysis of the transmission changes at 405 nm as before. After allowing 5 min for the elimination of the ATP, ADP was added to the sample (maximum added volume 2 μl) along with a small amount of cATP to replenish that used in the previous flash. The procedure was repeated for a series 4–6 ADP concentrations. Single exponential light-scattering transients were observed in each measurement, with both the k obs and the amplitude of the reaction decreasing as ADP concentration increased. The decrease in k obs is predicted from Equation1 and Scheme 1. The decrease in amplitude was because of the dilution effect and the lower affinity of actin for the myosin·ADP complex. The ADP concentration in each case was calculated as the sum of the ADP added and the ADP that built up through the hydrolysis of the ATP released in each flash. This procedure has been validated using the well characterized rabbit muscle myosin subfragment 1 (S1). The values of k obs were corrected according to Equation 1for the small variations in the amount of ATP released in each flash and then plotted against the ADP concentration as shown in Fig.3 B for each myosin isoform. The data was fitted to Equation1, and the best curve was superimposed. Each MHC isoform gave a distinct value of K AD, and pooled data from three different experiments (Table I) show the differences to be significant. Thermodynamic coupling between actin and ADP binding to myosin (17Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Woodward S.K. Manstein D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8619-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) predicts that the weaker the affinity of actomyosin for ADP, the weaker the affinity of myosin·ADP for actin. Light-scattering measurements are not very reliable for amplitude data because of factors like micro air bubbles and dust particles. However there was a clear trend for the MHC isoforms IIX and IIB to show a more pronounced loss of the amplitude of the light-scattering transients as ADP concentration was increased compared with isoforms I and IIA. This is consistent with weaker affinity of actin for isoforms IIX and IIB in the presence of ADP. To date no satisfactory overexpression system exists for mammalian skeletal muscle myosin, and bulk preparations of myosin from tissue results in isolation of mixed isoforms. The majority of single muscle fibers do, however, contain single isoforms, and we have shown that we can extract sufficient myosin from single fibers for our measurements. Using our flash photolysis method, we were able to determine the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of and the ADP affinity for the actomyosin complex for all of the four skeletal muscle isoforms of adult rat. Measurements of this kind were previously not possible with these μg quantities of myosin. We obtained ∼2 μg of pure myosin isoforms from 15-mm single fibers of the rat psoas (MHC-IIB, MHC-IIX) and soleus (MHC-I and MHC-IIA). This amount is sufficient to determine the second order rate constant of ATP-induced dissociation with the flash photolysis apparatus, whereas it would be too small an amount to obtain results from traditional stopped flow methods (24Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). High ADP concentrations lower the affinity of myosin for actin and decrease the dissociation signal. The amount of protein from one fiber is therefore not sufficient to measure the ADP affinity to actomyosin over a wide range of ADP concentrations. For this experiment, a higher myosin concentration is needed. Five fibers for which the same isoform type has been confirmed by electrophoresis were pooled, and the myosin was extracted. The total amount of protein is still far less than would be needed using traditional methods. Our results for both the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of actomyosin and the ADP affinity for actomyosin are significantly different for the four isoforms with the exception of the dissociation rate constantsK 1 k +2 between MHCs IIX and IIB (Table I). The values were highly reproducible, showing the effectiveness of the flash photolysis method for the measurement with small amounts of actomyosin as well as the dependence of these values on the myosin heavy chain isoform. The value of K 1 k +2increases in the isoform order MHC-I, MHC-IIA, MHC-IIX, MHC-IIB, and the affinity of ADP for actomyosin (K AD) weakens in the same sequence. The only exception is the MHC-IIX and IIB values for K 1 k +2, which do not differ significantly. The values for these constants change in the same sequence as the increase in shortening velocity and ATPase activity of whole fibers determined previously by Bottinelli et al. (3Bottinelli R. Canepari M. Reggiani C. Stienen G.J. J. Physiol. 1994; 481: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,4Bottinelli R. Betto R. Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the correlation betweenV 0 and K AD and betweenV 0 andK 1 k +2. It has been proposed that the net rate of detachment of actomyosin cross-bridges after completion of the power stroke limits the shortening velocity in muscle fibers. The rate of release of ADP from the cross-bridge followed by the binding of ATP and the subsequent detachment of myosin from actin control the overall rate of cross-bridge detachment. Of these two events the release of ADP has been suggested to be the rate-limiting step (10Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Our data show that both the rate of ATP binding (K 1 k +2) and the affinity of ADP (K AD), which is related to the rate of ADP release (k −AD), show good correlation with shortening velocity. Although suggestive of an important role ofK 1 k +2 andK AD in determining shortening velocity, such a correlation does not establish whether either one of the steps actually determines shortening velocity alone or the relative contribution of each of them. To evaluate more carefully the contribution of these events to shortening velocity, we must estimateK 1 k +2 andK AD values under the more physiological conditions used to measure shortening velocities and quantitatively compare them. This will also allow the comparison ofk −AD, which, we will suggest, can limit shortening velocity, with the value of k min(rate of the event limiting shortening velocity) estimated from the maximum shortening velocity of single muscle fibers (10Siem"
https://openalex.org/W2023106260,"The majority of breast cancers metastasizing to bone secrete parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). PTHrP induces local osteolysis that leads to activation of bone matrix-borne transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). In turn, TGF beta stimulates PTHrP expression and, thereby, accelerates bone destruction. We studied the mechanism by which TGF beta activates PTHrP in invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that TGF beta 1 up-regulates specifically the level of PTHrP P3 promoter-derived RNA in an actinomycin D-sensitive fashion. Transient transfection studies revealed that TGF beta 1 and its effector Smad3 are able to activate the P3 promoter. This effect depended upon an AGAC box and a previously described Ets binding site. Addition of Ets1 greatly enhanced the Smad3/TGF beta-mediated activation. Ets2 had also some effect, whereas other Ets proteins, Elf-1, Ese-1, and Erf-1, failed to cooperate with Smad3. In comparison, Ets1 did not increase Smad3/TGF beta-induced stimulation of the TGF beta-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) promoter. Smad3 and Smad4 were able to specifically interact with the PTHrP P3-AGAC box and to bind to the P3 promoter together with Ets1. Inhibition of endogenous Ets1 expression by calphostin C abrogated TGF beta-induced up-regulation of the P3 transcript, whereas it did not affect the TGF beta effect on PAI expression. In TGF beta receptor II- and Ets1-deficient, noninvasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, TGF beta 1 neither influenced endogenous PTHrP expression nor stimulated the PTHrP P3 promoter. These data suggest that TGF beta activates PTHrP expression by specifically up-regulating transcription from the PTHrP P3 promoter through a novel Smad3/Ets1 synergism."

Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in VCAM-1 promoter activity. The upstream promoter region of VCAM-1 contains a thrombin response element, two nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) motifs, and a tandem GATA motif. In transient transfection assays, mutation of the thrombin response element had no effect on thrombin induction. In contrast, mutation of either NF-κB site resulted in a complete loss of induction, whereas a mutation of the two GATA motifs resulted in a significant reduction in thrombin stimulation. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts from thrombin-treated endothelial cells displayed markedly increased binding to the tandem NF-κB and GATA motifs. The NF-κB complex was supershifted with anti-p65 antibodies, but not with antibodies to RelB, c-Rel, p50, or p52.

Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease derived from the zymogen prothrombin, is a key component of the coagulation cascade, serving to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. In addition, thrombin plays a role in inflammation by activating a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and leukocytes. Most of these cellular effects are mediated by PAR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor. Thrombin cleaves the receptor, unmasking a tethered ligand, which is then free to activate the receptor (14Vu T.K.

Given that chronic inflammation is characterized by increased monocyte-endothelial cell interactions, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which thrombin induces VCAM-1 expression may provide important insight about the link between coagulation and chronic inflammatory disease states. In the present study, we have examined the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie thrombin-mediated induction of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. We show that the effect of thrombin on VCAM-1 expression is mediated by a combination of NF-κB and GATA motifs in the upstream promoter region. These findings are the first to demonstrate a link between thrombin signaling and GATA binding activity. Human thrombin, leech hirudin, angiotensin II, and thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP; SFLLRNPNDKYEPF) were obtained from Sigma. Human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB were obtained from Peprotec (Rocky Hill, NJ). Mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-TNF-α antibody was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics, La Jolla, CA) were cultured in EGM-2 MV complete medium. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). HUVEC were used within the first 8 passages. For construction of the VCAM-1-luc plasmid, human VCAM-1 promoter, a region spanning −1716 to +119 bp (generously provided by Dr. Tatsuhiko Kodama, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) was cloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A series of point mutations were introduced into the VCAM-1 promoter by polymerase chain reaction methodology. To generate NF-κB mut-luc, two polymerase chain reaction fragments (A and B) were amplified from VCAM-1-luc. Fragment A was generated from forward primer with an NsiI site (5′-AAAATCATGCATTAGATATTGTAGAAGTAG-3′) and reverse primer with aPstI site (5′-CTTTTTTCCCTGGCTCTGCAGTGGGTT-3′). Fragment B was generated from forward primer with PstI and NF-κB point mutation sites (5′-TGGCTCTGCAGAGTGCCTTTCCGGTTGAAGCCATTTCGGTCCGCCTCTGCAAC-3′) and reverse primer with a SacII site (5′-CAGATACCGCGGAGTGAAATAGAAAG TCTG-3′). Fragment A was digested withNsiI and PstI, whereas fragment B was digested with PstI and SacII. Fragments A and B were then inserted into NsiI/SacII-digested VCAM-1-luc in a three-way ligation. The resulting plasmid introduced two NF-κB point mutations: GGGTTTCCCC → GCCTTTCCGG and GGGATTTCCC → GCCATTTCGG. A similar strategy was used to introduce the following mutations into 5′NF-κB mut: GGGTTTCCCC → GCCTTTCCGG; 3′NF-κB mut, GGGATTTCCC → GCCATTTCGG; thrombin response element (TRE) mut, CCCACCCC → CCCATATG; and GATA mut, TTATCT → TTAAAT and AGATAG → ATTTAG. All point mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. To generate the pGEM-hVCAM1, a 254-bp human VCAM-1 cDNA fragment, a covered region from bp 1755 to 2009, was amplified from reverse-transcribed HUVEC total RNA and subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). pTRI-hGAPDH was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). For construction of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK)-luc, aBglII/HindIII fragment of pRL-TK (Promega) was cloned into the pGL3-basic vector. To generate GATA4-TK-luc, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two copies of the tandem GATA motifs from the VCAM-1 promoter (5′-ATTGTCCTTTATCTTTCCAGTAAAGATAGCCTT-3′) was cloned intoNheI-digested TK-luc plasmid vector. Insert direction was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. HUVEC were cultured in 100-mm culture dishes, and then the culture medium was replaced with serum-starved medium (EBM-2 plus 0.5% FBS). 18 h later, HUVEC were incubated with 1.5 units/ml human thrombin (Sigma), with 20 ng/ml TNF-α (Life Technologies, Inc.), or with serum-starved medium alone. Cells were harvested for total RNA 4, 7, and 24 h following thrombin treatment and 4 h following TNF-α treatment, using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). Forin vitro transcription, VCAM-1- and GAPDH-specific32P-labeled riboprobes were synthesized from pGEM-hVCAM1 and pTRI-hGAPDH, respectively. Both riboprobes were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase (Ambion) and purified with a G-50 spun column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNase protection assays were performed with a RPA III kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVEC and HEK-293 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as instructed by the manufacturer. Either 1 × 105 cells/well of HUVEC or 2 × 105cells/well of HEK-293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates 18–24 h before transfection. For HUVEC transfections, 0.5 μg of the reporter gene construct and 50 ng of a control plasmid containing theRenilla luciferase reporter gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (pRL-CMV) (Promega) were incubated with 2 μl of FuGENE 6. 24 h later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times and cultured for 18 h in serum-starved medium (EBM-2 plus 0.5% FBS). The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of cytokines for 6 h, at which time cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). For HEK-293 cell transfections, 0.05 pmol of the test construct, 0.075 pmol of the GATA expression vector, and 30 ng of pRL-CMV were incubated with 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6. Two days later, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment and purified by spun column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5 μg of HUVEC nuclear extracts were incubated with 10 fmol of 32P-labeled probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 3 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA) for 20 min at the room temperature, followed by 30 min at 4 °C. To test the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with antibodies of p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at room temperature, or with antibodies of GATA-2 (a generous gift from Dr. Stuart Orkin, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and GATA-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. In competition studies, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides for 20 min at room temperature, then added to the reaction mixture. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mmEDTA). The loaded gel was fixed with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid, then autoradiographed. In a previous study, thrombin was shown to induce VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells (20Kaplanski G. Marin V. Fabrigoule M. Boulay V. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Kaplanski S. Farnarier C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm these results, we employed RNase protection assays with a probe that is specific for the human VCAM-1 gene and total RNA derived from control and thrombin- and TNF-α-treated HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 1(A and B), the incubation of HUVEC in the presence of 1.5 units/ml thrombin or 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 4 h resulted in 39.8- or 48.0-fold stimulation of VCAM-1 mRNA, respectively (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 7). Following thrombin treatment, VCAM-1 mRNA levels remained elevated at 7 h and approached base-line levels by 24 h (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). We next wished to determine whether the effect of thrombin on VCAM-1 mRNA expression was mediated by the VCAM-1 promoter. HUVEC were transiently transfected with the VCAM-1-luc plasmid that contains a 1.8-kilobase pair region of the human VCAM-1 promoter (between −1716 and +119) coupled to the luciferase reporter gene. Transfected HUVEC were grown in the absence or presence of thrombin and assayed for luciferase activity 6 h later. As shown in Fig. 2 A, thrombin resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of reporter gene activity, with maximal induction occurring at a concentration of 1.5 units/ml. Furthermore, the addition of the specific thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the thrombin-mediated VCAM-1 promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). In subsequent studies, we analyzed the effects of TRAP, a 14-amino acid peptide representing the new amino terminus of PAR-1 generated after thrombin cleavage, on VCAM-1 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 3, thrombin and TRAP induced VCAM-1 promoter activity by 3.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. These results suggest that thrombin-induced activation of the VCAM-1 promoter is mediated by cleavage of PAR-1. The VCAM-1 promoter was induced 4.3-fold by TNF-α. The addition of VEGF resulted in a slight increase in promoter activity, whereas PDGF-BB and angiotensin II had no such effect (Fig. 3).Figure 3VCAM-1 promoter activity in endothelial cells is induced by TRAP and TNF-α. HUVEC were transiently transfected with VCAM-1-luc and exposed to 1.5 units/ml thrombin, 20 nmol/ml TRAP, 20 ng/ml TNF-α, 20 ng/ml VEGF, 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, or 10 nmol/ml angiotensin II for 6 h. The results show the means and standard deviations of luciferase light units (relative to untreated cells) obtained in triplicate from at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, to rule out the possibility that thrombin stimulation of the VCAM-1 promoter was mediated by TNF-α release, transfected cells were treated with TNF-α or thrombin in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies. In these experiments, thrombin-mediated induction of promoter activity was unaltered by pre-incubation with antibody at concentrations that otherwise inhibited the effects of TNF-α (data not shown). The human VCAM-1 promoter contains a consensus TRE at −319 relative to the start site of transcription (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether this regulatory element was involved in transducing the thrombin signal, a plasmid containing a point mutation of the TRE sequence was transfected into HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the TRE mutant retained thrombin and TRAP responsiveness, suggesting that this sequence is not essential for thrombin-mediated activation of VCAM-1. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a radiolabeled VCAM TRE element probe was incubated with nuclear extracts derived from HUVEC treated in the presence or absence of thrombin. DNA binding activity was similar in both treated and untreated cells (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 5). The VCAM-1 promoter has tandem NF-κB motifs located at the positions −65 and −75 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 5 A). To assess the role of the NF-κB elements in mediating thrombin stimulation of the VCAM-1 promoter, the two NF-κB sites were mutated and the resulting plasmid was transfected into HUVEC. The double mutation resulted in complete abrogation of response to thrombin, TRAP, and TNF-α (Fig. 5 B). To determine the relative contribution of the two NF-κB motifs in transducing the thrombin response, the 5′ or 3′ NF-κB motifs were individually mutated. As shown in Fig. 5 B, each mutation completely blocked the response to thrombin, TRAP, and TNF-α. Taken together, these results suggest that both NF-κB motifs on the VCAM-1 promoter are necessary for thrombin-mediated activation of the VCAM-1 promoter. To determine the effect of thrombin on NF-κB binding activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out. To that end, a radiolabeled probe containing the two adjacent NF-κB sites (Fig. 6 A) was incubated with nuclear extracts derived from untreated and thrombin-treated HUVEC. Incubation with nuclear extracts from untreated, thrombin-treated, or TNF-α-treated HUVEC resulted in specific DNA-protein complexes (open arrows, Fig. 6 B, lanes 2, 5, and 8). These DNA-protein complexes were inhibited by the addition of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled self-competitor (Fig. 6 B,lanes 3, 6, and 9), but not by the same concentration of unlabeled NF-κB mutant competitor (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4, 7, and 10). The faster migrating DNA-protein complex (closed arrow) was nonspecific, as it was inhibited by the addition of both wild type and mutant competitors (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2–10). Importantly, the addition of thrombin or TNF-α resulted in a marked increase in DNA binding activity (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 5 and8 with lane 2). To test the relative importance of the two NF-κB motifs in mediating this effect, mobility shift assays were carried out with radiolabeled probes containing a mutation of either the 5′ or 3′ NF-κB motif. As shown in Fig. 6 C, each single mutation resulted in a significant reduction of basal as well as thrombin- and TNF-α-stimulated DNA-protein complex formation. Together with the transfection data, these results suggest that both NF-κB motifs are involved in mediating the thrombin response.Figure 6Thrombin induces binding of p65 homodimers to the tandem NF-κB motif. A, schematic representation of the probe sequences used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The consensus NF-κB motifs areunderlined. The mutated bases are represented byasterisks. B, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with 32P-labeled NF-κB probe and 5 μg of nuclear extract from HUVEC treated in the absence (−) or presence of 1.5 units/ml thrombin (+ Thrombin) or 20 ng/ml TNF-α (+TNF-α). In competition assays, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type (lanes 3, 6, and9) or mutant (lanes 4, 7, and10) NF-κB probe was added to the reaction mixture. Theopen arrows indicate specific DNA-protein complexes. The closed arrow indicates nonspecific DNA-protein complex. C, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described above, using radiolabeled wild type NF-κB probe (lanes 1, 4, 7, and10), 5′ NF-κB mut (5′ mut) probe (lanes 2,5, 8, and 11), or 3′ NF-κB mut (3′ mut) probe (lanes 3, 6, 9, and12). The open arrows indicate specific DNA-protein complexes. The closed arrow indicates nonspecific DNA-protein complex. D, nuclear extracts from untreated (−) or thrombin-treated (+ Thrombin) were incubated in the absence (lanes 2 and 3) or presence of antibodies against p65 (lane 4), RelB (lane 5), c-Rel (lane 6), p50 (lane 7), and p52 (lane 8) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The asterisk indicates the supershifted complex. E, nuclear extracts from untreated (−) or TNF-α-treated (+ TNF-α) HUVEC were incubated with antibodies against p65 (lane 4), RelB (lane 5), c-Rel (lane 6), p50 (lane 7), and p52 (lane 8). The asterisk indicates the supershifted complex. The results are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next performed supershift experiments with specific antibodies to p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 to determine the identity of proteins in the thrombin-induced NF-κB binding complex. The addition of anti-p65 antibody resulted in a supershift of the specific DNA-protein complexes (asterisk, Fig. 6 D,lane 4), whereas the addition of antibodies to RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 had no such effect. A similar pattern was observed in the TNF-α-treated cells (asterisk, Fig. 6 E,lane 4). To verify that the anti-p50 antibody was capable of supershifting DNA-protein complexes under these conditions, mobility shift assays were carried out with nuclear extracts from TNF-α-treated HEK-293 cells and a radiolabeled probe containing NF-κB motifs from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (23Hayashi T. Faustman D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8646-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, the anti-p50 antibody did indeed cause a supershift of the specific DNA-protein complex (data not shown). Together, these findings indicate that thrombin stimulates binding of p65 homodimers to the VCAM-1 NF-κB motifs. The human VCAM-1 promoter contains two consensus GATA binding sites, at −244 and −259 relative to the start site of transcription (Fig. 7 A). In a recent study, the GATA motifs were shown to play a role in mediating TNF-α induction of VCAM-1 (12Umetani M. Mataki C. Minegishi N. Yamamoto M. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To test whether the GATA elements in the VCAM-1 promoter are also involved in transducing the thrombin signal, the GATA sites were mutated and the resulting plasmid was transfected into HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the GATA mutation resulted in a significant decrease in promoter response to thrombin, TRAP, and TNF-α. The above results raised the possibility that thrombin induces GATA binding to the GATA motifs in the VCAM-1 promoter. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled GATA probe encompassing the two GATA binding motifs (Fig. 8 A). As shown in Fig. 8 B, incubation of probe with nuclear extract from untreated, thrombin-treated, or TNF-α-treated cells resulted in specific DNA-protein complexes (closed and open arrows, Fig. 8 B, lanes 2,5, and 8). The DNA-protein complexes were inhibited by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled self-competitor (Fig. 8 B, lanes 3, 6, and 9). In contrast, DNA-protein binding was unaltered in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe containing a mutation of the GATA sites (Fig. 8 B, lanes 4,7, and 10). Nuclear extracts from thrombin- or TNF-α-treated endothelial cells displayed markedly increased GATA binding activity (Fig. 8 B, compare lanes 5 and8 with lane 2). To determine the identity of proteins in the thrombin-induced GATA motif binding complex, the binding reactions were incubated with anti-GATA-2 or anti-GATA-3 antibodies. The addition of an anti-GATA-2 antibody from Dr. Stuart Orkin resulted in a supershift of the upper DNA-protein complex (Fig. 8 B, lane 12), whereas the addition of anti-GATA-3, anti-GATA-6, or anti-RelB antibodies had no such effect (Fig. 8 B, lanes 13 and14 show anti-GATA-3 and anti-RelB, respectively). Together with the transfection results, these findings suggest that thrombin induces binding of GATA-2 to the GATA motifs and that this effect is necessary for full induction of the VCAM-1 promoter. To determine whether one or both GATA proteins were binding to one or both GATA motifs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out with a radiolabeled probe containing a point mutation of either the 5′ or 3′ GATA element. The incubation of these mutant probes with nuclear extract resulted in a double-banded DNA-protein complex that corresponded to the faster migrating complex of the wild type probe (closed arrow, Fig. 8 C, lanes 5 and 7). In addition, the faster and slower migrating complexes on the wild type probe were both inhibited by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled 5′ or 3′ GATA mutant probe (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that the slower migrating complex (open arrow, Fig. 8 B,lanes 2, 5, and 8) represents a GATA dimer. The above studies suggest that the GATA motifs in the VCAM-1 promoter are necessary for full thrombin stimulation. To determine whether the GATA elements are sufficient for transducing the thrombin signal, we transfected HUVEC with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies of the tandem VCAM-1 GATA motif (GATA4-TK-luc) linked to the minimal herpes simplex virus TK promoter. As shown in Fig. 9, GATA4-TK-luc activity was stimulated 2.4-fold by thrombin and 1.6-fold by TNF-α. In contrast, the parental TK-luc plasmid failed to respond to thrombin or TNF-α (data not shown). Together with the previous results, these findings suggest that the GATA motifs are both necessary and sufficient for mediating the thrombin response. GATA-2 has a tissue-specific expression pattern. To study the correlation of the vascular selective expression of VCAM-1 and GATA-2, we performed transactivation assays in which VCAM-1-luc construct was co-transfected with human GATA-2 expression plasmid (pMT2-hGATA2) in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig."

FH proteins link cellular signaling pathways to the actin cytoskeleton and serum response factor-dependent transcription. In these studies, the role of FHOS in Rho family GTPase signaling pathways was analyzed. FHOS interacted with the polybasic domain in the Rac1 C terminus in a guanine nucleotide-independent manner but did not interact with RhoA, Cdc42Hs, Rac2, or Rac3. Intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions between the C terminus of FHOS and an N-terminal region partially overlapping the Rac1 interaction domain were also identified. FHOS truncation mutants lacking the N- or C-terminal autoregulatory domains stimulated transcription of a c-fos serum response element (SRE)-driven reporter. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant (N17 and V12) Rac1 proteins repressed SRE induction by the N-terminal FHOS deletion mutant but not by the C-terminal FHOS deletion mutant. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the localization of the mutant FHOS proteins might contribute to their differential responses to Rac1. Wild-type FHOS and the N-terminal deletion mutant localized to the perinuclear region and membrane edges. In contrast, the C-terminal FHOS mutants were diffusely localized.

DRFs preferentially interact with GTP-bound Rho proteins and are inhibited by Rho inactivation (2Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M.

The product of formin-related gene in leukocytes (FRL) was recently shown to interact with Rac1 but not with RhoA or Cdc42Hs (15Yayoshi-Yamamoto S. Taniuchi I. Watanabe T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6872-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, FH proteins appear to interact with specific Rho family GTPases. One effect of Rho family GTPase and DRF activation is the induction of gene transcription from the SRE (5Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 6Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The SRE is a short gene-regulatory sequence that is sufficient to activate transcription of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos and β-actin, in response to growth factor stimulation (24Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal activation of the c-fos SRE requires the formation of a complex between the ubiquitous transcription factor, SRF (25Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and certain Ets domain proteins, such as Elk1 and SAP1, that are collectively referred to as ternary complex factors (TCF). TCFs potentiate SRE transcriptional activation when they are phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases in response to Ras/Raf or Rac1/Cdc42/PAK signals (21Bar-Sagi D. Hall A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). SRF activity is controlled independently of TCF activation and is induced by activated forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). RhoA-induced activation is essential for SRE-serum responsiveness and requires the FH proteins, DRF1 (mDia1) and DRF2 (mDia2) (5Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 6Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 16: 16Google Scholar). Rho activation, however, is not required for Rac1 or Cdc42-induced SRF activation (29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple pathways target the SRF and TCF complex at the c-fos SRE, and distinct Rac1 signals affect both subunits of the complex. FHOS is a member of the formin homology (FH) family of proteins that is expressed at high levels in human splenic cells (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). FHOS contains all the conserved domains, including FH1, FH2, and FH3 domains, and a coiled-coil, that are characteristic of FH proteins. In this report, the identification of a C-terminal autoregulatory domain and a GTPase binding domain are described. The role of FHOS in Rho GTPase signaling pathways is also examined. In contrast to DRFs (mDia1 and mDia2), which are downstream effectors of GTP-bound RhoA, FHOS binds to Rac1 in a guanine nucleotide-independent manner. Deletion of either the N or C termini created active forms of FHOS that stimulated transcription from the SRE. The N-terminal deletion mutant was localized to membrane ruffles, and its ability to activate the SRE was blocked by overexpression of several Rac1 proteins. These data identify novel functions for FH proteins and Rac1 in the cell. The pCMV5-HA-FHOS full-length and HA-FHOS-(1–1010) expression plasmids were previously described (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription reactions, these FHOS sequences were excised from pCMV5 with Asp718 andBamHI or Asp718 and SmaI, respectively, and subcloned into pKS-Bluescript (pKS). pCMV5-HA- and pKS-FHOS-(1–421) were constructed by subcloning the Asp718/HindIII fragment from pCMV5-HA-FHOS into the base vectors. Similarly, pKS-FHOS-(1–321) is theAsp718/SalI fragment frompCMV5-HA-FHOS. pKS-FHOS-(1–717) was amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) frompCMV5-HA-FHOS with gene-specific oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) containing Asp718 orBamHI restriction sites (GATGGTACCATGGCGGGCGGGGAAGA and TACGGATCCGGTGGCAGTGTGGT AGGCCGATGTTGATG). FHOS-(469–1165) was constructed by amplifying a 248-base pair region ofpKS-FHOS between nucleotides 1408 and 1648 with oligonucleotides containing Asp718 or BglII restriction sites (AAGGTACCATGCCCAATGAGGCGG and CTAGATCTGAAAAGTCCAGGTCC), respectively. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pKS-FHOS in place of the wild-type 5′-sequence. The fidelity of the Pfu polymerase and subcloning reactions was verified by automated DNA sequencing. FHOS-(1–717) and -(469–1165) were subcloned from pKS into the pCMV5-HA vector (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with Asp718 andBamHI. For yeast two-hybrid assays, pAS-2-1-FHOS-(1–328) and -(1–421) were generated by subcloning theEcoRI/SalI or EcoRI/BamHI fragments from the respective pCMV5-HA-FHOS vectors intopAS2-1 (CLONTECH). FHOS-(491–1165) was created by subcloning the 2-kilobase pair PstI fragment ofpCMV5-HA-FHOS-(1–1165) into pAS2-1. pAS2-1-FHOS-(855–1165) was made by removing the SalI fragment from pAS-2-1-FHOS-(491–1165). To generatepAS2-1-FHOS-(668–1165), the FHOS sequence was amplified by PCR with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides, GTTGAATTCGAACACCTCTTTGAGTC and GTTGGATCCTCCAGGGTCCAGATAGAT (Integrated DNA Technologies). The purified PCR product was then subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites ofpAS2-1.

GST-GTPase fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli, DH5α, during a 3-h induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were lysed by resuspension in Buffer A (10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) (2Watanabe N.

Insoluble material was separated by centrifugation. GST fusion proteins were purified from the lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the beads three times in Buffer A, fusion protein concentrations were estimated by comparison to bovine serum albumin standards in Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. For reactions in the presence of GDP or GTPγS (Sigma), 10 μm GST-GTPases on Sepharose beads were preloaded overnight with 1 mm guanine nucleotide (2Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled FHOS proteins were in vitrotranscribed and translated with the TNT T3 or T7-Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega). One-tenth of the lysate was incubated with 400 pmol of each nucleotide-loaded or -unloaded GST-GTPase-beads for 90 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in Buffer A containing the appropriate guanine nucleotide. Proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE. The lower portion of each gel was stained with Coomassie dye to verify equal loading of the GST-GTPases to the reactions (data not shown). The upper portions of the gels were fixed in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid, incubated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to film. For immunoprecipitation assays, two 10-cm plates of confluent MDA-231 cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in 1 ml of modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were precleared with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm, the lysates were collected and incubated overnight with 4 μg of anti-Rac mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or a control IgG mAb (MOPC-21, Sigma). Immune complexes were collected with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times with modified RIPA buffer, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore). Rac1 and FHOS were detected by immunoblotting with murine Rac1 (1:1000, UBI) and FHOS-(1:600) (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dried milk. Proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and autoradiography. For yeast two-hybrid assays S. cerevisiae strain Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1-901 ade2-101 ura3-52 leu2-3, −112 +URA3::GAL→lacZ, LYS2::GAL→HIS3) were co-transformed with the indicated pAS-2-1-FHOS expression plasmid andpACT-FHOS-(904–1165) (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast were selected on SD media lacking leucine (Leu), tryptophan (Trp), and histidine (His). Five individual colonies were restreaked onto SD media lacking His-Trp-Leu (HWL) in the presence or absence of 50 mm 2-aminotriazole. COS7 cells were seeded at a density of 5.2 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well). Cells were allowed to adhere and grow for 4–16 h in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containingl-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS (BioWhittaker). The pSRE, pAP-1, and NFκB luciferase (Luc) reporter plasmids contain three, four, and four tandem copies of the respective promoter element fused to the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase TATA-like promoter (CLONTECH). The SRE sequence is identical to the SRE in the c-fos promoter (24Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter plasmids (0.5 μg) were mixed with 100 ng ofpCMV5-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and the indicatedpCMV5-HA-FHOS or Rac expression vectors. Cells were transfected by incubation with reporter and expression plasmid mixtures in D-PBS (BioWhittaker) containing 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by a 2.5-h incubation in DMEM containing 5% FBS and 80 μm chloroquine. After removal of the media, cells were shocked for 2.5 min with DMEM containing 10% Me2SO and 5% FBS. The cells were then washed with d-PBS and incubated for 16–40 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. Luciferase activity was measured with the Luciferase Assay Systems (Promega) as instructed by the manufacturer. SEAP activity was measured as described previously (36Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 37Westendorf J.J. Yamamoto C.M. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Selsted M.E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 322-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency with the SEAP values for each sample. Fold activation was determined relative to samples transfected withpCMV5. Values represent the mean of three independent transfections ± standard error of the mean. NIH3T3 were grown on coverslips and transfected with the indicated FHOS expression plasmids with Superfect (Qiagen). C2C12 cells were transduced with the indicatedMSCV-HA-FHOS vector using conventional methods (38Norris P.S. Jepsen K. Haas M. J. Virol. Methods. 1998; 75: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Forty hours later, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, lysed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked for 30 min in IF buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Tween 20, 1× PBS). Cells were incubated sequentially in IF buffer containing anti-HA mAb (clone 12CA5, Sigma), anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes), and anti-Rac1-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.4% n-propyl gallate. Endogenous FHOS was detected in HeLa cells with FHOS antiserum (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA was counterstained for 5 min with Hoescht's dye (5 μg/ml) as indicated. FHOS is a recently described member of the Formin/Diaphanous family of proteins. Formin homology proteins interact with and are downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases (2Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 3Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A.

To determine its molecular function, FHOS was tested for its ability to associate with the most frequently studied members of the Rho subfamily of GTPases, Cdc42Hs, Rac1, and RhoA. FHOS interacted with Rac1 but not with Cdc42Hs or RhoA (Fig.1 A). The interactions between FHOS and Rac1 were detected in the presence of either GDP or GTPγS (Fig. 1, A and B) and the absence of guanine nucleotides (Fig. 1 B). FHOS did not associate with Rac2 or Rac3, which are the Rho family GTPases that are most identical to Rac1, in any condition (Fig. 1 B). To verify the interaction between FHOS and Rac1 in vivo, lysates from human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-231, were immunoprecipitated with Rac1 mAb. FHOS was detected in the Rac1 immune complexes by immunoblotting but not in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, Rac1 co-localized with FHOS in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (Fig.1 D). Thus FHOS interacts specifically with the Rho GTPase, Rac1, in an apparently guanine nucleotide-independent manner. The interaction between FHOS and Rac1, but not with Rac2 or Rac3, was somewhat surprising given the extensive sequence similarity between the three proteins (31Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The extreme C termini of Rac proteins, however, are poorly conserved (Fig. 2 A), and thus it was hypothesized that the C terminus of Rac1 may mediate the interaction with FHOS. FHOS was tested for interactions with Rac1 and Rac2 chimeras in which the polybasic regions (amino acids 183–188) of each protein are interchanged (Fig. 2, A andB) (33Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). FHOS interacted with GST-Rac1 and the GST-Rac2 chimera containing the Rac1 polybasic domain (Rac2→1) but did not interact with GST, GST-Rac2, or the GST-Rac1 chimera containing six amino acids from Rac2 (Rac1→2) (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that the polybasic domain in the Rac1 C terminus mediates interactions with FHOS. To determine the region of FHOS that interacted with Rac1, truncated FHOS proteins (Fig.3 A) were incubated with GST or GST-Rac1 in the absence of guanine nucleotides. Rac1 interacted with full-length FHOS-(1–1165) as well as with FHOS proteins (1–717 and 469–1165) that retained the F"

The mechanism of action may involve the regulatory β1 subunit. We used β1 subunit knockout (β1−/−) mice to test the hypothesis that the regulatory β1 subunit is essential for the activation of BK channels by tamoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen (a major biologically active metabolite), and 17β-estradiol in native myocytes. Patch clamp recordings demonstrate BK channels from β1−/− mice were similar to wild type with the exception of markedly reduced Ca2+/voltage sensitivity and faster activation kinetics. In wild type myocytes, (xeno)estrogens increased NPo(Po × the number of channels, N), shifted the voltage of half-activation (V12) to more negative potentials, and decreased unitary conductance. These effects were non-genomic and direct, because they were rapid, reversible, and observed in cell-free patches. None of the (xeno)estrogens increased the NPo of BK channels from β1−/− mice, but all three agents decreased single channel conductance. Thus, (xeno)estrogens increase BK NPothrough a mechanism involving the β1 subunit. The decrease in conductance did not require the β1 subunit and probably reflects an interaction with the pore-forming α subunit. We demonstrate regulation of smooth muscle BK channels by physiological (steroid hormones) and pharmacological (chemotherapeutic) agents and reveal the critical role of the β1 subunit in these responses in native myocytes.

Whereas the pore-forming α subunit has a wide tissue distribution, BK channel function varies greatly among cell types because of the addition of specific regulatory β subunits (for example, see Ref. 5Fettiplace R.

Schmalhofer W.A. Munujos P. Knaus H.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and dehydrosaponin I (9McManus O.B. Helms L.M. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R. Leonard R.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Additionally, the β1 subunit may bind estrogens and xenoestrogens (i.e. agents that are not steroids but possess estrogenic activity). Valverde et al. (16Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D.

Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) have shown that smooth muscle BK channels are activated by 17β-estradiol and proposed that this action is because of binding on the β1 subunit. We have recently shown that tamoxifen (Tx)1also activates BK channels (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We demonstrated in a heterologous expression system (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) that the presence of the β1 subunit is required for the effects of tamoxifen and 17β-estradiol on recombinant BK channels (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The importance of the β1 subunit in the response of native smooth muscle cells to (xeno)estrogens is unknown. Recently, genetically engineered mice in which the β1 subunit has been deleted (β1−/−) have been produced (14Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and these animals provide the opportunity to assess the role of the β1 subunit in the actions of (xeno)estrogens in native myocytes. β1−/− mice are hypertensive and demonstrate altered vascular reactivity (13Pluger S.

Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), illustrating the physiological importance of the β1 subunit. Pharmacological manipulation of the regulatory β1 subunit may become a novel approach to treating conditions such as hypertension, because the expression of the β1 subunit is thought to be limited to smooth muscle (18Jiang Z. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Genomics. 1999; 55: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Tseng-Crank J. Godinot N. Johansen T.E. Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Mertz R. Foster C.D. Olesen S.P. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9200-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we have sought to determine whether tamoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and 17β-estradiol activate BK channels in native smooth muscle cells. 4-OH tamoxifen is a very potent anti-estrogen and may be the biologically active product in some tissues (20Borgna J.L. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, aside from binding the nuclear estrogen receptor, very little is known about its mechanism(s) of action, particularly non-genomic mechanisms. In this study, we have used β1−/− mice to test the hypothesis that the regulatory β1 subunit is essential for the response of BK channels to (xeno)estrogens, including tamoxifen and its P450 metabolite, 4-OH tamoxifen. Murine colonic myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dispersion as described previously (21Koh S.D. Dick G.M. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C2010-C2021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genotype and phenotype of the β1−/− mice have been characterized previously (14Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and corroborated in a similar model by others (13Pluger S. Faulhaber J. Furstenau M. Lohn M. Waldschutz R. Gollasch M. Haller H. Luft F.C. Ehmke H. Pongs O. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E53-E60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controls for this study were wild type C57BL (“Black 6”) mice. This is the same strain from which the β1−/− mice were derived (14Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with chloroform and killed by cervical dislocation. The proximal colon was placed in Krebs solution and rinsed free of contents. Krebs contained (in mm) 125 NaCl, 5.9 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 15.5 NaHCO3, 1.2 Na2HPO4, 11.5 glucose, pH 7.4, with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Salts for Krebs and other solutions were purchased from Sigma and Fisher Scientific. In Ca2+-free Hanks' solution, the smooth muscle layer was dissected free of mucosa and submucosa. Ca2+-free Hanks' solution contained (in mm) 125 NaCl, 5.36 KCl, 15.5 NaHCO3, 0.336 Na2HPO4, 0.44 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, 2.9 sucrose, 11 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH. The muscle layers were treated with collagenase (345 units/ml, Worthington) in Ca2+-free Hanks' solution at 37 °C to produce suspensions of single cells. Dispersed myocytes were placed in a recording chamber on an inverted microscope for electrophysiological studies. After adhering to the glass-bottomed recording chamber, myocytes were suffused with a solution containing (in mm) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 5 Tris, pH 7.1. Ca2+ was added to the bath solution buffered with 1 mm EGTA orN-(2-hydroxyethyl)EDTA to achieve the desired free Ca2+ concentration (MaxChelator, Pacific Grove, CA) (22Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myocytes were approached with heat-polished pipettes having tip resistances of 2–10 megohm when filled with bath solution. BK channel currents were recorded from inside-out patches in symmetrical 140 mm K+ or with an asymmetrical gradient (5 mm K+ in the pipette with a Na+balance). An Axopatch 1D amplifier with a CV-4 headstage was used for data acquisition (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were acquired in pCLAMP 5.5.1 (Clampex and Fetchex, Axon) by an IBM-compatible computer interfaced via a TL-1 analog-digital converter. The digitization rate was 4 times greater than the low pass cut-off frequency for filtration (1 kHz). Data were analyzed using pCLAMP 6 (Clampfit; Axon) and the Analysis of Single Channel Data program (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). NPo and conductance were calculated from all-points amplitude histograms. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of n cells. Statistical analyses were made with the Mann-Whitney rank sum test on medians or Student's t test on means as appropriate. The threshold for statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. Currents were recorded from inside-out patches of membrane from murine colonic myocytes in symmetrical (140 mm) K+. NPo increased when the patch potential was made more positive or when Ca2+ concentration of the bath was increased (Fig. 1 A). In myocytes from wild type mice, the slope conductance of BK channels in symmetrical K+ was 258 ± 5 pS (Fig.1 B, n = 6). The I-V relationship in asymmetrical K+ (5 mm pipette and 140 mm pipette) was outwardly rectifying, and conductance increased to 265 ± 6 pS at +80 mV (n = 3). The slope conductance of BK channels from β1−/− mice was 259 ± 6 pS in symmetrical K+ (Fig. 1 B, n= 9). For β1−/− mice, BK channel conductance in asymmetrical K+ increased to 267 ± 13 pS at +80 mV (n = 3). These characteristics of BK channels in colonic myocytes from β1−/− mice were not significantly different from those of wild type mice. Furthermore, the characteristics of BK channels from β1−/− mice are similar to those attributed to the cloned mSlo α subunit (4Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and of cerebral arterial myocytes from same animals (14Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Presence of the regulatory β1 subunit in smooth muscle BK channels confers greater Ca2+/voltage-sensitivity and slows gating kinetics, therefore, we tested the Ca2+ dependence of steady-state activation of BK channels from wild type and β1−/− mice as an index of the presence of the β1 subunit (23Tanaka Y. Meera P. Song M. Knaus H.G. Toro L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 545-557Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Currents were measured from inside-out patches in symmetrical K+with 100 nm free Ca2+ in the bath. Patches were held at 0 mV and depolarized in 10 mV increments until conductance was maximal (Fig. 1 C). Currents activated with a different time course in myocytes from control and β1 knockout mice. The time constant of activation at +150 mV was 10 ± 2 ms in control myocytes (n = 6) and 4 ± 1 ms in myocytes from β1−/− mice (n = 10, p < 0.05). Conductance was normalized and plotted versus voltage (Fig.1 D). The V12 was 117 ± 3 mV in patches from control myocytes. In contrast, V12 was significantly greater in patches from β1−/− myocytes (151 ± 5 mV, p< 0.05). Thus, BK channels from the β1−/− mice demonstrated more rapid activation kinetics and reduced Ca2+/voltage-sensitivity. Expression of canine Slo α and β1 subunits in human embryonic kidney 293 cells has revealed that tamoxifen activates cloned BK channels only in the presence of the β1 subunit (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We tested whether tamoxifen activated BK channels in colonic myocytes from wild type and β1−/− mice. Single channel records from inside-out patches demonstrated that 1 μm tamoxifen increased NPo and decreased the conductance of BK channels from wild type myocytes (Fig. 2 A). NPo and conductance were averaged for at least 3 min (and up to 15 min) of recording before and after the addition of tamoxifen. Longer recordings assure that steady-state NPo is assessed accurately and eliminate contamination of the data from periodic fluctuations in NPo (24Silberberg S.D. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Magleby K.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2640-2651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similar to previous results (16Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar,17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar), 1 μm tamoxifen activated BK channels in the patches from wild type mouse myocytes. The increase in NPo over control was 248 ± 41% (n = 9). The reduction in conductance averaged 12 ± 3%. In contrast to wild type BK channels, 1 μm tamoxifen did not activate BK channels in colonic myocytes from β1−/− mice (Fig. 2 B,n = 21). NPo in the presence of tamoxifen was within 2 ± 1% of the control level. The NPo of BK channels of β1−/− mice was unaffected by higher concentrations of tamoxifen (e.g. Fig. 2 B demonstrates the lack of effect of 10 μm tamoxifen but was not averaged in the results with 1 μm tamoxifen as shown in Fig. 2,C and D). Whereas 1 μm tamoxifen did not change NPo significantly, it decreased the conductance of BK channels from β1−/− mice by 13 ± 1% (not different from the reduction in wild type BK channel). Group data illustrating these effects of 1 μm tamoxifen on NPo and conductance are shown in Fig. 2, C andD. The effects of tamoxifen were reversible, and control NPo was restored upon washout of the drug. Tamoxifen shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state activation of BK channels to more negative potentials only in wild type mice (Fig.3). Inside-out patches were studied in symmetrical 140 mm K+ and two Ca2+concentrations (either 100 nm or 10 μm). The patch potential was held at 0 mV and stepped to different potentials to determine steady-state activation before and after the addition of 1 μm tamoxifen. Potential was made more positive until conductance was maximal, and then activation curves (i.e.normalized conductance versus voltage) were generated. In patches from control myocytes with 100 nm free Ca2+, the V12 was 118 ± 3 mV and shifted to 94 ± 2 mV by tamoxifen (n = 9). With 10 μm free Ca2+, the V12 was −52 ± 3 mV and shifted to −66 ± 3 mV by tamoxifen in control myocytes (n = 4). Increasing the free Ca2+concentration, two orders of magnitude made V12 more negative, however, tamoxifen still caused a hyperpolarizing shift in V12. Tamoxifen decreased conductance by 29 ± 10 and 30 ± 12% in 100 nm and 10 μm free Ca2+, respectively (p < 0.05). In patches from β1−/− mice, tamoxifen did not change the voltage dependence of steady-state activation. With 100 nm free Ca2+, V12 was 152 ± 3 mV under control conditions and 153 ± 4 mV in the presence of tamoxifen (n = 12). With 10 μm free Ca2+ in patches from β1−/− mice, V12 was 34 ± 5 mV under control conditions and 31 ± 4 mV in the presence of tamoxifen (n = 8). However, tamoxifen did significantly decrease the conductance of channels from β1−/− mouse myocytes by 27 ± 4 and 28 ± 6% in 100 nm and 10 μm free Ca2+, respectively (p < 0.05, not different from patches from wild type mice). The effects of tamoxifen were rapid and reversible, suggesting a non-genomic mechanism. Furthermore, the mechanism seems direct, as tamoxifen increased NPo in excised patches, free from cellular signaling mechanisms. The time course of activation by tamoxifen was studied in inside-out patches. The potential of patches from wild type and β1−/− mouse myocytes was held constant, and the bath-contained 100 nm free Ca2+. NPo and conductance were measured over 8-s intervals and plotted versus time (Fig. 4). In patches from wild type mice, tamoxifen increased NPo and decreased conductance in a reversible manner (Fig. 4 A). NPo reached its maximum (3.5 ± 0.6-fold increase) in 83 ± 9 s (n = 3), and conductance simultaneously reached a minimum (12 ± 3% reduction). In contrast, in patches from β1−/− mice, tamoxifen decreased conductance (13 ± 3% reduction, n = 3) without affecting NPo (Fig. 4 B). The effect on conductance was reversible. Washout commenced within 1 min of tamoxifen removal or approximately the time required to exchange the bath solution. In wild type mice after 5 min of washout, NPo and conductance returned to 94 ± 8% and 100 ± 1% of control, respectively (n = 3, p > 0.05). In vivo metabolism of tamoxifen produces 4-OH tamoxifen, a very potent anti-estrogen, that may be the biologically active product in some tissues (20Borgna J.L. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, aside from binding the nuclear estrogen receptor, very little is known about its mechanism(s) of action. To determine whether this hydroxylated P450 metabolite of tamoxifen interacts with the β1 subunit to increase BK channel NPo, currents were recorded before and after the addition of 1 μm 4-OH tamoxifen. In myocytes from wild type mice, 4-OH tamoxifen (1 μm) increased BK channel NPo(Fig. 5 A) and decreased the single channel conductance 12 ± 3% (n = 9). In contrast, 4-OH tamoxifen had no significant effect on the NPo of BK channels from β1−/− mice (Fig.5 A). It did, however, decrease unitary conductance 13 ± 4% (n = 4). In vivo, most 4-OH tamoxifen is bound to proteins such as albumin, therefore, the amount of free 4-OH tamoxifen is reduced. To mimic this situation and determine whether binding to proteins might negate the effect of 4-OH tamoxifen, we added 20 mg/ml albumin to a solution containing 1 μm4-OH tamoxifen and tested the effect on BK channel NPo. Albumin decreased the effectiveness of 4-OH tamoxifen, but NPo was still increased significantly (2.2 ± 0.6-fold increase, n = 4). 4-OH tamoxifen also shifted the activation curve of wild type BK channels to more negative potentials (Fig. 5 B). In patches from wild type mice with 100 nm free Ca2+, the V12 was 109 ± 3 mV and shifted to 93 ± 5 mV by 1 μm 4-OH tamoxifen (n = 9). 4-OH tamoxifen decreased conductance by 30 ± 5% (p < 0.05). As a comparison to our previous results with tamoxifen (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a parallel set of experiments was performed on myocytes from the canine colon. We constructed a complete concentration-response curve (5 concentrations between 100 nm and 10 μm) for 4-OH tamoxifen on BK channels in canine colonic myocytes. 4-OH tamoxifen increased BK channel NPo with an EC50 of 0.87 μm (n = 10), a value very similar to that observed previously with tamoxifen (0.65 μm, see Ref.17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of human and canine Slo α and β1 subunits in heterologous expression systems has indicated that 17β-estradiol activates BK channels only in the presence of the β1 subunit (16Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar,17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The regulatory β1 subunit may confer sensitivity to 17β-estradiol upon recombinant smooth muscle BK channels, however, this has not been determined in native myocytes. Thus, it is unknown what molecular components of the BK channel are necessary for activation by 17β-estradiol in native smooth muscle cells. We tested the effects of 17β-estradiol on native smooth muscle cells from wild type and β1−/− mice. 17β-estradiol (10 μm) activated BK channels from wild type mouse colonic myocytes (Fig.6 A). BK conductance was slightly but significantly decreased by 10 μm17β-estradiol (4.02 ± 0.69%, p < 0.05,n = 7, Fig. 5 B). In contrast to the effects observed in wild type myocytes, 17β-estradiol did not activate BK channels in colonic myocytes from β1−/− mice (Fig. 5 A). Fig. 6 B shows that although NPo was not changed by 17β-estradiol, BK conductance was decreased 3.34 ± 0.20% by 17β-estradiol (p < 0.05, n = 9). The activation of BK channels by 17β-estradiol, but not the reduction in conductance, depends on the presence of the regulatory β1 subunit. We have shown that (xeno)estrogens activate smooth muscle BK channels, important regulators of smooth muscle tone (11Brayden J.E. Nelson M.T. Science. 1992; 256: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 12Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J.

Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). These results in myocytes from genetically engineered mice confirm our previous observations in a gene expression system (i.e. cloned Slo α and β subunits in human embryonic kidney 293 cells) (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, wild type and β1−/− mice are much more valuable models, because they allow the opportunity to test the effects of (xeno)estrogens on blood pressure, vasomotion, gastrointestinal motility, and other smooth muscle activity in the presence or absence of the BK regulatory β1 subunit. BK channels of colonic smooth muscle cells from β1−/− mice were similar to those of wild type with the exception for markedly reduced Ca2+/voltage-sensitivity and faster activation kinetics. Tamoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and 17β-estradiol activated BK channels and shifted the V12 of activation to more negative potentials only in myocytes from wild type mice. (Xeno)estrogens decreased the conductance of BK channels in myocytes from both wild type and β1−/− mice. Therefore, whereas the activation of BK channels by (xeno)estrogens depends on the presence of the regulatory β1 subunit, the reduction in conductance caused by these compounds does not. These data demonstrate that the regulatory β1 subunit is necessary for the stimulatory effects of (xeno)estrogens on native smooth muscle BK channels and extend our understanding of the regulation of BK channels. Tamoxifen has effects on smooth muscle tissues consistent with the activation of BK channels. In myometrium, tamoxifen inhibits spontaneous and agonist-induced contractions (25Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 381-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen also has vascular effects, as it relaxes myometrial arteries (26Marshall K. Senior J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), increases uterine blood flow (26Marshall K. Senior J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and hyperpolarizes and relaxes cerebral arteries (27Nelson M.T. Conway M.A. Knot H.J. Brayden J.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 259-264Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). High extracellular K+, which limits the degree to which openings of BK channels can hyperpolarize smooth muscle, inhibits the relaxing effect of tamoxifen on myometrial smooth muscle (25Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 381-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In clinical use, tamoxifen chemotherapy commonly causes facial flushing, reflecting a loss of vasomotor tone (28Love R.R. Cameron L. Connell B.L. Leventhal H. Arch. Intern. Med. 1991; 151: 1842-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All of these smooth muscle effects of tamoxifen can be explained in part by the activation of BK channels. However, tamoxifen also affects other ion channels. Tamoxifen inhibits volume-sensitive Cl− and delayed rectifier K+ currents in canine colonic smooth muscle (29Dick G.M. Kong I.D. Sanders K.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen also inhibits voltage-gated Na+(30Hardy S.P. deFelipe C. Valverde M.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), l-type Ca2+ (29Dick G.M. Kong I.D. Sanders K.M. Br. J.

Tamoxifen effects on ion channels may be responsible for some therapeutic side effects (e.g. for example Q–T interval prolongation and neurological symptoms (34Trump D.L. Smith D.C. Ellis P.G.

Most probably, the effects of tamoxifen in vitro and in vivo are multifaceted and difficult to identify specifically. The mechanism of action of tamoxifen and 17β-estradiol, determined on recombinant BK channels in heterologous expression systems, involves the regulatory β1 subunit (16Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, such a mechanism had not been demonstrated in native smooth muscle cells. A wide variety of smooth muscle cells express the β1 subunit (18Jiang Z. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Genomics. 1999; 55: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Tseng-Crank J. Godinot N. Johansen T.E. Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Mertz R. Foster C.D. Olesen S.P. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9200-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), thus it has been difficult to test the importance of the β1 subunit in responses of native myocytes to (xeno)estrogens. Genetically engineered mice have provided the opportunity to test a β1 subunit-null smooth muscle cell type (13Pluger S. Faulhaber J. Furstenau M. Lohn M. Waldschutz R. Gollasch M. Haller H. Luft F.C. Ehmke H. Pongs O. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E53-E60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that the regulatory β1 subunit was essential for the activation of native smooth muscle BK channels by tamoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and 17β-estradiol. The data support the hypothesis and strengthen the idea that the regulatory β1 subunit functions as a membrane receptor for (xeno)estrogens that transduces the signal to effects on BK channels. The effects of (xeno)estrogens to increase BK channel NPo are non-genomic, as they were rapid, reversible, and occurred in cell-free patches that were removed from nuclear influences. These are well established characteristics of non-genomic mechanism of steroid hormone action (36Wehling M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Whereas the β1 subunit of the BK channel is essential for conferring sensitivity to 17β-estradiol, tamoxifen, and 4-OH tamoxifen, the exact mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated, but several possibilities can be excluded from our studies and include changes in Ca2+, nitric-oxide production, and changes in kinase activity. Cellular signaling mechanisms are known to influence BK channel activity. Nitric-oxide activates BK channels directly (37Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) and indirectly via protein kinase G (38Robertson B.E. Schubert R. Hescheler J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C299-C303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase A has also been shown to regulate the NPo of BK channels (39Perez G. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1459-C1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40White R.E. Kryman J.P. El Mowafy A.M. Han G. Carrier G.O. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this study, excised patch recordings were performed in solutions with clamped Ca2+ and in the nominal absence of substrates for cellular regulatory mechanisms that affect BK channel NPo(e.g. nitric-oxide production and phosphorylation via cGMP- and cAMP-dependent kinases). Therefore, (xeno)estrogens appear to directly activate BK channels. Our studies, however, do not rule out the possibility that these other mechanisms may contribute to the effects of (xeno)estrogens in intact myocytes. If some of these other cellular signaling mechanisms contribute to the increase in NPo in intact myocytes, then our experiments have underestimated the full effect of (xeno)estrogens to increase BK NPo, as the total cellular response would be a summation of direct and indirect effects. Another critical reason why phosphorylation by protein kinase G is an improbable mechanism underlying BK activation by tamoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and 17β-estradiol in the excised patches in our study is that a stimulatory protein kinase G phosphorylation site exists on the pore-forming α subunit (41Fukao M. Mason H.S. Britton F.C. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10927-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), but our study shows that (xeno)estrogens have no effects on NPo in β1−/− mice. Additionally, the effects of tamoxifen are also not attributed to periodic fluctuations of NPo or “wanderlust” kinetics (24Silberberg S.D. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Magleby K.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2640-2651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), because the responses to tamoxifen are concentration-dependent (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and, as we have shown here, completely reversible. Regardless of any other potential influence or signaling mechanism, the β1 subunit is crucial for the effects of tamoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and 17β-estradiol on BK NPo. Tamoxifen, its 4-hydroxy metabolite, and 17β-estradiol produce effects on BK channels directly at the cell membrane, probably by binding the regulatory β1 subunit itself, however, this is yet to be confirmed. A previous study (16Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) has indicated that a membrane-impermeant conjugate of 17β-estradiol acts only from the extracellular surface, giving a sidedness to the putative binding site. We have obtained preliminary results indicating that a membrane-impermeant form of tamoxifen, i.e. ethylbromide tamoxifen, activates BK channels only from the extracellular surface. 2G. M. Dick and K. M. Sanders, unpublished data. It is unknown whether the 17β-estradiol and xenoestrogen binding sites are the same, however, pilot data from our lab indicates that they are the same as 17α-estradiol, an isomer without estrogenic properties, antagonizes the effects of both tamoxifen and 17β-estradiol.2 Furthermore, it is unknown whether the binding site is actually on the β1 subunit or on another unidentified effector molecule that acts through the β1 subunit. Neither this study, our previous work (17Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 34594-34599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar), nor the investigation of Valverde et al. (16Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) has determined the location of the binding site for (xeno)estrogens. Regardless, the effects of 17β-estradiol, tamoxifen, and 4-OH tamoxifen to increase BK NPo represent a non-genomic mechanism of ion channel activation involving a regulatory subunit. Furthermore, our data suggest that wild type and β1−/− mice could be used to test the effects of (xeno)estrogens on smooth muscle function in vivoand in vitro in the presence or absence of the BK channel regulatory β1 subunit. Thus, the contribution of BK channels to the effects of tamoxifen on smooth muscle reported previously (25Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) helps protect against atherosclerosis, in part, because apoE particles secreted by macrophages have local beneficial effects at lesion sites. Here, we hypothesize that such protection includes anti-inflammatory actions and investigate whether cell-derived apoE can inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Two models were used to mimic endothelial exposure to macrophage-derived apoE. In the first, HUVECs were transiently transfected to secrete apoE; VCAM-1 induction inversely correlated with secretion of apoE into the media (r = −0.76,p < 0.001). In the second, incubation of HUVECs with media from recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing apoE (CHOapoE) also reduced VCAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner (r = −0.70,p < 0.001). Characterization of CHOapoEcell-derived apoE revealed several similarities to apoE particles secreted by human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. The suppression of endothelial activation by apoE most likely occurs via stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase; apoE increased levels of intracellular nitric oxide and its surrogate marker, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, while the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, ethyl-isothiourea, blocked its effect. We propose that apoE secreted locally at lesion sites by macrophages may be anti-inflammatory by stimulating endothelium to release NO and suppress VCAM-1 expression.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar). Initially, monocytes adhere to activated endothelium on which up-regulated cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)1are displayed, a dynamic process sensitive to inflammatory cytokines, shear stress, and oxidative insults (2Chia M.C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 573-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs, is increasingly described as the key factor in monocyte infiltration (3Nakashima Y.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34-kDa polypeptide synthesized mainly by liver and helps protect against atherosclerosis, in part by mediating hepatic clearance of remnant plasma lipoproteins (5Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When apoE is absent or dysfunctional, severe hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis ensue, while infusion of apoE or hepatic gene overexpression protect (6Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ApoE is also abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, secreted by resident cholesterol-loaded macrophages (6Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This locally produced apoE is atheroprotective by contributing to reverse cholesterol transport (8Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Maeda N. Assmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1834-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation (9Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N.A. Hui D.Y. J. Biol.

Breslow J.L. Ross R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), which enhances monocyte recruitment and adhesion (12Ramos C.L. Huo Y. Jung U. Ghosh S. Manka D.R. Sarembock I.J. Ley K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), while apoE expression in the artery wall reduces early foam cell lesion formation (13Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Brandt S.J. Babaev V.R. Gleaves L.A. Fazio S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings imply that apoE may influence early inflammatory responses by suppressing endothelial activation and CAM expression. However, we found that plasma-purified apoE did not suppress VCAM-1 induction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, if apoE affects CAM expression and atherogenic eventsin vivo, then most likely it will be released at lesion sites by recruited macrophages. Here, we devise two models to mimic endothelial exposure to locally synthesized, cell-derived apoE and show, in both cases, that apoE limits cytokine-mediated VCAM-1 up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner. HUVECs were isolated, characterized and cultured as before (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in M199 media with Hank's salts containing 3.6 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 25 μg/ml endothelial growth supplement (Sigma). For experiments, 5% (v/v) FBS was used. Plastic culture ware was precoated with 1% (w/v) gelatin, and cells were used between passages 1–4. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells secreting human apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 isoforms (CHOapoE2, CHOapoE3, and CHOapoE4) were produced by stably transfecting CHO cells lacking the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene with apoE expression plasmids (p7055.apoE2/3/4) encoding the selectableDHFR gene (15Tagalakis A.D.

Recombinant CHOapoE cells were maintained in selection media, Iscove's medium plus 2 mmglutaMAX and 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS, while medium for control CHOdhfr− cells was supplemented with 0.1 mmhypoxanthine and 16 μm thymidine. Human monocytes with the apoE2/2 genotype were isolated by leukapheresis and elutriation and then differentiated into macrophages by 12 days of cultivation in RPMI media supplemented with 20% (v/v) pooled human serum. Macrophages were then converted into foam cells by 48 h of incubation with 100 μg of protein/ml of acetylated low-density lipoprotein as described previously (16Cullen P. Cignarella A. Brennhausen B. Mohr S. Assmann G. von Eckardstein A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These acetylated low-density lipoprotein-loaded monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were incubated with serum-free RPMI for characterization of secreted apoE. Analysis of VCAM-1 in quadruplicate wells by ELISA used previously described protocols and reagents (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs in 96-well plates were either exposed to cell-derived apoE by transient transfection, co-culturing with CHOapoE cells or by incubation with CHOapoE cell-conditioned media. For the last 6 h in each experiment tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, human recombinant; Sigma) was added directly into the media to a final concentration of 10 units/ml (0.5 ng/ml) except for basal VCAM-1 controls. Any binding of monoclonal VCAM-1 antibody at 5 μg/ml (clone BBIG-V1; R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was detected by StreptABComplex/HRP Duet kit and O-phenylenediamine chromogenic substrate (both from DAKO Ltd., High Wycombe, UK). Absorbances were measured at 492 nm (A 492) by microtitre plate spectrophotometer. Finally, cellular protein per well was determined by solubilizing the monolayers with 0.1 m NaOH, adding Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK), and measuring the absorbance at 620 nm (A 620). VCAM-1 expression was calculated for each well as a ratio of A 492VCAM-1 assay:A 620 protein assay values for TNF-α stimulated cells. Non-cytokine-stimulated wells were subtracted to give “VCAM-1 induction above basal”, and then data was normalized to a percentage of VCAM-1 induction in TNF-α controls. Analysis of VCAM-1 by flow cytometry was carried out on confluent HUVECs in 12-well plates as described previously (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ApoE-enriched high-density lipoproteins (HDL-E), from a normal subject homozygous for the ε3 allele, were prepared by our standard procedure (17Desai K. Bruckdorfer K.R. Hutton R.A. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and added to cells (1.5 mg of protein/ml) for 24 h; TNF-α was added directly into the media to a final concentration of 10 units/ml (0.5 ng/ml) for the last 6 h, except for basal VCAM-1 controls. Primary antibody (monoclonal VCAM-1 antibody at 5 μg/ml) binding was detected using goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (DAKO Ltd), and 5 × 103 cells were analyzed per well by flow cytometry (Coulter Epics Elite; Coulter, Hialeah, FL). ApoE expression plasmids pCMV.apoE2, pCMV.apoE3, and pCMV.apoE4 were prepared by ligating the corresponding cDNA into pCMV.0, a mammalian expression vector originally purchased as pCMV.β (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK). Subconfluent HUVECs (2 × 104cells/well; 96-well plate) were transfected for 1 h with 0.4 μg of DNA/well of pCMV.apoE2, pCMV.apoE3, pCMV.apoE4, or pCMV.0, using 3 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Cells were then incubated for 48 h in M199 (5% FBS), adding 10 units/ml TNF-α for the last 6 h, except for basal VCAM-1 controls. ApoE from cell culture supernatants was measured by ELISA (Apo-Tek ApoE kit; PerImmune Inc, Rockville, MD), while HUVEC monolayers were analyzed for VCAM-1 by cell-bound ELISA. Mixtures of HUVECs and CHOapoE2 or CHOdhfr− cells were co-cultured in 96-well plates at a ratio of 4:1 in M199 (5% FBS) for 48 h with TNF-α 10 units/ml added for the last 6 h (except for basal VCAM-1 controls). ApoE and VCAM-1 were then measured by ELISA. CHOapoE2, CHOapoE3, CHOapoE4, and CHOdhfr− cells (each ∼80% confluent) were conditioned for 24 h in M199 (5% FBS). The media was collected, filtered (0.2 μm), and after apoE measurement was incubated for 24 h with confluent HUVECs (3 × 104 cells/well; 96-well plate). To inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, HUVECs were pre-incubated for 2 h with 100 μm ethyl-isothiourea (18Southan G.J. Szabo C. Thiemermann C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (ethyl-ITU; Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) prior to adding conditioned media plus 100 μm ethyl-ITU; TNF-α was added 6 h before VCAM-1 analyses. In some experiments, induction of E-selectin by TNF-α and constitutive von Willebrand factor (vWF) expression were analyzed by cell-bound ELISA using anti-E-selectin (clone BBIG-E4; R&D Systems) and anti-vWF (DAKO Ltd) at 5 and 1.2 μg/ml, respectively. In other experiments intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) content of confluent HUVECs in 12-well plates was analyzed by radioimmunoassay (11Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Intracellular NO production was measured directly in triplicate wells using the cell-permeable fluorescent indicator 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA; Sigma) (19Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVECs in 48 well-plates were incubated with 10 μm DAF-2 DA (0.2% Me2SO) for 1 h at 37 °C. To inhibit NOS activity, wells were preincubated for 2 h with 100 μm ethyl-ITU prior to addition of DAF-2 DA plus ethyl-ITU. Monolayers were washed with warm PBS and then incubated with CHO cell-conditioned media (from either CHOapoE2 or CHOdhfr− cells) with some wells supplemented with 100 μm ethyl-ITU. Fluorescent emissions at 530 nm (bandwidth of 25 nm) were read using a Cytofluor Series 400 plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) upon excitation at 485 nm (bandwidth of 20 nm). Results are expressed as change in relative DAF-2 DA fluorescence (arbitrary units) over a 2-h time course as a percentage of the fluorescence signal from the control wells treated with CHOdhfr− cell-conditioned media. To characterize apoE particles secreted from CHOapoE cells and to compare them with those secreted by MDM, cells were incubated for 24 h with serum-free media. Media was then concentrated 10-fold in Vivaspin concentrators (10,000 molecular weight cut off; Vivascience Ltd, Lincoln, UK), and apoE particles were analyzed for electrophoretic mobility in agarose hydragels (Sebia, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France) by apoE immunoblotting (8Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Maeda N. Assmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1834-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) or for morphology by negative staining electron microscopy (8Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Maeda N. Assmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Fractions (0.5 ml) were blotted onto nitrocellulose and analyzed for apoE by immunoblotting and densitometry. Polyadenylated RNA was extracted from HUVECs, and the full-length open reading frame of apoER2 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect splice variants as described previously (20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect protein, HUVECs were labeled for 4 h with l-[35S]methionine, and solubilized membranes were immunoprecipitated with our anti-peptide antisera, “anti-apoER2Ins” (20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were reduced, separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by fluorography. Similar analyses were carried out using CHO cells expressing apoER2 (CHOapoER2) as positive controls. This was performed for independent experiments using GraphPad InStat version 3.01 for Windows 95, choosing a Student's two-tailed t test, analysis of variance test, or Pearson correlation, as appropriate. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Plasma-purified apoE does not inhibit endothelial CAM expression (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, as the purification process may attenuate apoE biological activity (21LaDu M.J. Pederson T.M. Frail D.E. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Falduto M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9039-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we studied effects of HDL-E, the minor apoE-containing subclass of bulk plasma HDL, on VCAM-1 up-regulation. The fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence profiles showed basal VCAM-1 expression was negligible, with most cell fluorescence values under 10 units (Fig.1 A), similar to isotype-treated controls or of cells incubated with HDL-E alone (not shown). After TNF-α treatment, the fluorescence peak shifted right, indicating up-regulation of cell-surface VCAM-1 (Fig. 1 B). However, pretreatment with HDL-E did not suppress this induction of VCAM-1 expression; the fluorescence profile or mean fluorescence intensity was not altered (Fig. 1 C). To mimic endothelial exposure to locally secreted apoE, HUVECs were transfected with apoE expression plasmids. Although apoE was undetectable in pCMV.0 media, it was readily detected in pCMV.apoE2/3 transfectants with the accumulated levels of apoE2 and apoE3 being similar (0.10 ± 0.02 versus 0.12 ± 0.02 μg/ml, respectively, n = 4). Levels of apoE4 were much lower, close to the detection limit of 10–20 ng/ml, possibly due to enhanced re-uptake by the cells or of increased association with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (16Cullen P. Cignarella A. Brennhausen B. Mohr S. Assmann G. von Eckardstein A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Variable apoE handling and retention by HSPG, with isoform-dependence, has been reported for various cultured cells including neurons, fibroblasts, CHO, and HepG2 cells (22Ji Z-S. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, while HSPG-mediated accumulation of apoE4 occurs less readily than apoE3 in these cell types, in macrophages apoE4 has increased surface binding to HSPG (16Cullen P. Cignarella A. Brennhausen B. Mohr S. Assmann G. von Eckardstein A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whether there is differential apoE isoform retention by endothelial cells is unknown but merits further investigation. HUVEC monolayers transfected with pCMV.0 responded to TNF-α by a 10-fold induction of VCAM-1 as measured by cell-bound ELISA (data not shown). Strikingly, cells secreting apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 had significantly reduced (all p < 0.01, Student'st test) VCAM-1 compared with pCMV.0 transfection (67.8 ± 8.3%, 61.0 ± 12.0%, and 41.4 ± 7.4% inhibition, respectively; Fig. 2 A), although the differences between the isoforms was not significant (p > 0.05, analysis of variance test). Further experiments revealed that VCAM-1 induction was inversely correlated with concentration of secreted apoE2 (r = −0.76, Pearson correlation, p < 0.001; n = 20, Fig. 2 B) or apoE3 (r = −0.81, Pearson correlation, p < 0.001; n = 8, data not shown). One explanation for VCAM-1 suppression would be an intracellular action of apoE trafficking in successfully transfected cells, as this influences several processes (23Pitas R.E. Ji Z.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, this possibility is unlikely to account for down-regulation of up to 70% of VCAM-1; primary endothelial cells are notoriously difficult to transfect and we estimated our transfection efficiency to be typically ∼1% by treating parallel wells with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (pCMV.GPF; data not shown). Further support against an intracellular action of apoE was obtained by transferring media from transfected HUVECs containing 0.12 ± 0.03 μg of apoE2/ml to untransfected cells; induction of VCAM-1 was inhibited by 12.9 ± 2.2% (p < 0.05, Student's t test, data not shown). Additionally, when HUVECs were co-cultured with CHOapoE2 cells expressing apoE2, VCAM-1 induction was down-regulated by 16.1 ± 2.4% (p < 0.05, Student's t test) when the concentration in the media was 0.14 ± 0.01 μg/ml, as compared with incubations with control CHOdhfr− cells (data not shown). To verify that apoE secreted by CHOapoE cells inhibits VCAM-1 expression, CHOapoE2/3/4 cell-conditioned media was added directly to HUVECs. Although VCAM-1 suppression was less than by pCMV.apoE2/3/4 transfections, induction of VCAM-1 inversely correlated with apoE2 (r = −0.70,p < 0.001; n = 10, Fig.3 A) or apoE3 and apoE4 concentration (r = −0.64, p < 0.001,n = 4 and r = −0.53, p< 0.001, n = 4, respectively; data not shown) in the conditioned media. By contrast, CHOapoE cell-derived apoE did not affect expression of other endothelial markers; at 5.5 ± 0.2 μg of apoE2/ml of expression of both constitutive vWF and TNF-α-induced E-selectin were unchanged, even though VCAM-1 was suppressed by 23.4 ± 2.2% (p < 0.001;n = 3, Fig. 3 B) in the same experiments. Thus, unlike plasma-purified apoE, which was inactive (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), CHOapoE cell-derived apoE was a selective inhibitor of VCAM-1 expression, without affecting the constitutive levels of vWF or the degree of E-selectin up-regulation in response to TNF-α. Characterization of CHOapoE cell-derived apoE revealed several similarities to particles secreted by MDM. Both had a similar heterogeneity by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 A). Particles were spherical and of a similar diameter by negative staining electron microscopy (mean diameter 14 nm; range 8–20 nm) (Fig.4 B). Additional analyses showed that, for both cells, most apoE particles had a mean molecular mass of 400 kDa (range 150–1200 kDa; Fig. 4 C) with pre-α mobility. A minor 90-kDa (50–150 kDa) particle with preβ-mobility was also found. Additionally, MDM media contained a very large particle (>1200 kDa) not seen in CHOapoE cell media. ApoE inhibits platelet aggregation by stimulating NOS III (endothelial NOS) (11Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the NO released elevating anti-aggregatory cGMP. The initial step was considered to be binding of apoE by apoER2, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) family localized to caveolae signaling microdomains within the plasma membrane (24Riddell D.R. Sun X-M. Stannard A.K. Soutar A.K. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 998-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding, a signal transduction cascade to activate NOS was postulated (20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Riddell D.R. Owen J.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As NO is an inhibitor of VCAM-1 expression (26Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 27Spiecker M. Darius H. Kaboth K. Hbner F. Liao J.K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), we examined whether this apoE-NOS pathway might down-regulate VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. Suppression of VCAM-1 induction in HUVECs by CHOapoE2 cell-conditioned media was completely blocked by the NOS inhibitor, ethyl-ITU (Fig.5 A), while intracellular cGMP levels were increased by 46.5 ± 15% (p < 0.05, Student's t test, n = 3), indicating NO release (Fig. 5 B). However, it is unlikely that cGMP itself mediates the action of apoE because the inhibition of VCAM-1 by NO is not a result of increases in cyclic nucleotides (27Spiecker M. Darius H. Kaboth K. Hbner F. Liao J.K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). When intracellular NO production was measured directly, using the cell-permeable fluorescent indicator DAF-2 DA (18Southan G.J. Szabo C. Thiemermann C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), NO levels increased 62% from basal levels of 100.0 ± 5.6% (in HUVECs exposed to control-conditioned media) to 161.9 ± 24.2% (p< 0.001, Student's t test, n = 5) during a 2-h incubation with CHOapoE2 cell-conditioned media (Fig.5 C). Moreover, this apoE-induced rise in NO production was due to activation of NOS since the effect was essentially blocked using the NOS inhibitor (p < 0.001, Student's ttest, n = 5). We then confirmed, that apoER2 mRNA was present in HUVECs (29Korschineck I. Ziegler S. Breuss J. Lang I. Lorenz M. Kaun C. Ambros P.F. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13192-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by long-range polymerase chain reaction (Fig.6 A). As in platelets and the megakaryocytic cell line, HEL (20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the predominant transcript (∼70% by densitometry) lacked binding repeats 4–6 (apoER2Δ4–6) but contained the 177-base pair cytoplasmic insert, although minor transcripts of full-length apoER2±cytoplasmic insert (Ins) were also detected. To verify protein expression we immunoprecipitated solubilized HUVEC membranes with anti-apoER2Ins (20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the variant lacking the cytoplasmic insert is not recognized by this anti-peptide antibody, only two immunoreactive bands were detected, a major one at 130 kDa and a minor one at 180 kDa corresponding, respectively, to apoER2Δ4–6 and full-length apoER2 (Fig. 6 B). This study provides the first evidence that cell-secreted apoE may be anti-inflammatory by suppressing VCAM-1 induction, most probably because endothelial cells are stimulated to release NO. By contrast, an apoE-enriched lipoprotein, HDL-E, did not inhibit VCAM-1 expression, endorsing the view that plasma apoE does not modulate endothelial CAMs (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This was important; previously we used plasma-purified apoE3 complexed to phospholipid (apoE3:DMPC), and, although active in other systems (11Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this did not inhibit VCAM-1 expression (14Stannard A.K. Riddell D.R. Bradley N.J. Hassall D.G. Graham A. Owen J.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) presumably because the purification process (21LaDu M.J. Pederson T.M. Frail D.E. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Falduto M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9039-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or lipid environment (5Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) diminished biological potency. Indeed, in a direct comparison of anti-platelet activity we found that cell-derived apoE3 was 4-fold more active than apoE3:DMPC (data not shown). As activated endothelium is exposed to locally secreted apoE from cholesterol-loaded macrophages within atherosclerotic plaques (6Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) our findings suggest a new atheroprotective role for apoE: the restriction of endothelial activation by down-regulating VCAM-1 induction. This is consistent with macrophage apoE acting early in lesion development (13Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Brandt S.J. Babaev V.R. Gleaves L.A. Fazio S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mimicking endothelial exposure to macrophage apoE in vitrois complex; a simple co-culture would expose endothelial cells not only to apoE but also to diverse macrophage secretory factors, including inflammatory cytokines (31Libby P. Clinton S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we first transiently transfected HUVECs to expose them to locally synthesized native apoE, albeit self-secreted; all three common apoE isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, strongly inhibited VCAM-1 induction even though media levels of apoE were <200 ng/ml. Moreover, VCAM-1 down-regulation was not solely due to intracellular actions or autocrine functions of apoE synthesized in successfully transfected cells; cross-incubation studies, adding media from transfected HUVECs to fresh non-transfected cells and the low efficiency of transfection (∼1%) excluded these possibilities. Rather, and in contrast to HDL-E or plasma-purified apoE, the potency of apoE reflected its inherent cell-derived nature. Thus, in other experiments, CHOapoEcell-conditioned media also down-regulated VCAM-1 induction, correlating with apoE content. Significantly, this cell-derived apoE was secreted as particles that closely resembled macrophage apoE. Intriguingly, suppression of VCAM-1 was most marked in transfected HUVECs when the media content of apoE was 50–75 times lower than in CHOapoE cell-conditioned media. One explanation is that in transfected wells entrapment of secreted apoE by endothelial HSPG (32Saxena U. Goldberg I.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) may result in high local concentrations at the cell surface and enhanced biological activity. Indeed, HSPG is abundant on the cell-surface of cultured endothelial cells, and its production is rapidly stimulated by apoE (33Paka L. Kado Y. Obunike J.C. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4816-4823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although our transfection studies are not directly relevant to the situation in vivo, as endothelium does not synthesize apoE, they do have implications for gene therapy; transfecting endothelial cells to express apoE may limit endothelial activation. Indeed, this approach prevents lesion development in apoE-deficient mice (34Cioffi L. Sturtz F.G. Wittmer S. Barut B. SmithGbur J. Moore V. Zupancic T. Gilligan B. Auerbach R. Gomez F. Chauvin F. Antczak M. Platika D. Snodgrass H.R. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ApoE activates NOS III in platelets (11Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and NOS II in macrophages (35Vitek M.P. Snell J. Dawson H. Colton C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 240: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because NO is a potent intracellular messenger and inhibitor of atherogenesis, in part by suppressing cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression and reducing monocyte adherence to endothelium (26Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 27Spiecker M. Darius H. Kaboth K. Hbner F.

Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), we investigated whether apoE might stimulate endothelial NO production. Supporting this mechanism, the NOS inhibitor, ethyl-ITU, blocked the inhibitory effect of apoE on VCAM-1 expression, while CHOapoE cell-conditioned media not only increased cGMP, a surrogate marker for NO release (36Lincoln J. Hoyle C.H.V. Burnstock G. Nitric Oxide in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1997Google Scholar), but also increased intracellular NO levels in a fluorescent assay for direct NO detection. Importantly, E-selectin, a cytokine-induced endothelial CAM not regulated by NO in HUVECs (26Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), was unaffected by apoE; rather apoE selectively inhibits VCAM-1. Indirect evidence also implicates apoE-mediated release of NO in down-regulating VCAM-1. In platelets, binding of apoE by its receptor, apoER2, appears to initiate a signal transduction cascade to up-regulate NOS (20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Riddell D.R. Owen J.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As we found apoER2 mRNA and protein in HUVECs, a similar apoE-apoER2-NOS pathway may function in endothelium to limit VCAM-1 induction. Indeed, this constitutes the first report of apoER2 protein being identified in vascular endothelial cells in non-neuronal tissues. A role for apoER2 is also suggested by the similar efficacy of apoE2 and apoE3; apoE2 binds poorly to the LDL-R and LDL-R-related protein, thereby discounting them in inhibiting VCAM-1, whereas apoER2 and its closest mammalian homolog, the very-low-density receptor (VLDL-R), bind both isoforms efficiently (5Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also relevant is the proposal that both apoER2 and VLDL-R initiate tyrosine kinase signaling to modulate neuronal positioning in brain development (38Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), a process dependent on neuronal cell adhesion molecules (39Curran T. D'Arcangelo G. Brain Res. Brain.

Since VLDL-R is also present in HUVECs (41Nilsson L. Gåfvels M. Musakka L. Ensler K. Strickland D.K. Angelin B. Hamsten A. Eriksson P. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 913-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we cannot exclude coordinate apoE signaling by the two receptors in HUVECs to activate NOS and limit VCAM-1 induction. In summary, we have shown that cell-derived apoE inhibits cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells and propose that this occurs through activation of NOS to release NO. However, further work will be needed to confirm an apoE-NO link in endothelium and to delineate the steps involved, not least because VCAM-1 can also be suppressed by NO-independent mechanisms (42Wolle J.

But insects can also be severe pests in agriculture, destroying 30% of our potential annual harvest, and can be vectors for major diseases such as malaria, sleeping disease, and yellow fever. Despite the importance of insects, however, their molecular endocrinology is not well understood. This will certainly change after the recent publication of theDrosophila genome (1Adams M.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar, 2Rubin G.M. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2204-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), which represents a breakthrough for our understanding of virtually all aspects of insects. For the insect molecular endocrinology field, e.g. one can anticipate that the major future advances will occur by “mining” of the “Drosophila Genome Project” data base and cloning of important key proteins involved in insect endocrinology (3Hauser F. Søndergaard L. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Lenz C. Søndergaard L. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys.

Although most initial findings will be made inDrosophila, one can expect that these discoveries also will have their impacts on our understanding of the molecular endocrinology of other insects. Although Drosophila offers many important advantages for studying the molecular biology and genetics of an insect (a sequenced genome; the presence of numerous mutants, including knock-out mutants (7Eriksen K.K. Hauser F. Schiøtt M. Pedersen K.-M. Søndergaard L. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 924-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and the possibility of creating transgenic animals), it is relatively small, which makes it difficult for physiological experimentation. We have, therefore, decided to use a second insect species in our laboratory in parallel toDrosophila. This species is another widely used model insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori, the larvae of which can be up to 8 cm in size, and which, therefore, is more amenable to endocrinological experiments at the organ level. Furthermore, B. mori (order: Lepidoptera, or moths and butterflies) belongs to a different insect order than Drosophila (order: Diptera, or flies). We hope that our findings in B. mori will supplement our findings in Drosophila melanogaster and vice versa, so that we will obtain a more complete and, because two insect orders are involved, a more general picture of insect endocrinology. The cockroach-type or A-type allatostatins are an important group of insect neurohormones of which many have the C-terminal sequence Tyr-X-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH2 or Phe-X-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH2 (6Lenz C. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Bendena W.G. Garside C.S., Yu, C.G. Tobe S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In some insects (e.g. in cockroaches), these allatostatins inhibit the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone (a terpenoid important for development and reproduction) in the corpora allata (paired or unpaired endocrine organs near the insect brain) and, in addition, muscle contraction of the gut, whereas in other insects they only block gut muscle contraction (10Bendena W.G. Garside C.S., Yu, C.G. Tobe S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 814: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By mining of the DrosophilaGenome Project data base, and using conventional PCR,1 Birgül and co-workers (13Birgül N. Weise C. Kreienkamp H.-J. Richter D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5892-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and our group have recently cloned two novel neurohormone receptors from Drosophila that turned out to be the first insect allatostatin receptors (named Drosophilaallatostatin receptor-1 and -2 or DAR-1 and -2) (4Lenz C.

In the present paper we will report on the cloning of a functional allatostatin receptor from the silkworm B. mori. We will also describe the cloning of aBombyx allatostatin preprohormone that gives rise to eight different allatostatins and show that these are the cognate ligands for the Bombyx allatostatin receptor. Furthermore, we will show that the allatostatin receptor is mainly expressed in the gut. The B. mori strain used was a hybrid of Lyon 200BA and Lyon 300AB and was kindly provided to us by Dr. Søren Wilken Rasmussen from Carlsberg Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark. The animals were reared on an artificial diet (Silkmate E., Nihon Nosan Kogyo KK, Yokohama, Japan). Diapause eggs were stored for up to 6 months at 4 °C, and hatching was induced in 16% HCl at 46 °C for 4–6 min (14Tazima Y. The Silkworm: An Important Laboratory Tool. Kodansha Ltd., Tokyo1978Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from whole fifth instar larvae using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A+) was obtained using the μMACS mRNA Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and single-stranded cDNA prepared using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was carried out, using the Advantage2 PCR enzyme system (CLONTECH), and the degenerate sense primer 5′-GAYMGITWYYTIGCIGTIGTICA-3′(corresponding to nucleotide positions 415–437 of Fig. 1) and the degenerate antisense primer 5′-CRTAIARDATIGGRTTDATRCA-3′ (corresponding to nucleotide positions 922–943 of Fig. 1) (B = G/C/T; D = A/G/T; I = inosine; K = G/T; M=A/C; R = A/G; S = C/G; W = A/T; Y = C/T). The PCR program was 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 42 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. 5′-RACE was carried out as a nested PCR with an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 594–619 and an antisense nested primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 439–462 of Fig. 1. For 3′-RACE, a sense primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 528–549 and a nested sense primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 900–921 of Fig. 1 was used. For 5′- and 3′-RACE we used the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification method (CLONTECH). All PCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), using the TOPO TA Cloning method (Invitrogen). Sequencing was carried out using the Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons and data base searches were performed using the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR Inc.). Genomic DNA was isolated from third instar larvae, using the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Midi kit (Qiagen). Southern blot analyses were carried out as described in Ref. 7Eriksen K.K. Hauser F. Schiøtt M. Pedersen K.-M. Søndergaard L. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 924-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. The cDNA probe corresponded to nucleotide positions −300 to 619 of Fig. 1. PCR was applied to determine the genomic organization of the Bombyx allatostatin receptor gene, using 100 ng of genomic DNA as a template and 7 primer pairs, covering the whole range of the receptor cDNA (Fig. 1). All products were cloned and sequenced as above. Northern blots were prepared, using the NorthernMax-Formaldehyde kit (Ambion) and BrightStar-Plus membranes (Ambion). A cDNA probe (nucleotide position 1–1089 of Fig. 1) was labeled using the Strip-EZ DNA kit (Ambion). The Bombyx RP49 probe was generated by PCR (corresponding to nucleotide positions 1–220 of the sequence given in GenBankTM accession number AB048205). Evolutionary tree analyses were carried out using several software programs, among them PAUP, version 4.0b5 (Sinauer Associates) (Fig. 3). The protein sequences were obtained from GenBankTM. The sense 5′-GGTACCAAGATGGAGTCAACCGAAGACG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCGAGTCACACGATGTCGTGACAGG-3′ primers (corresponding to nucleotide positions 1–19 and 1067–1086 of Fig. 1) were used in a PCR reaction with cDNA from fifth instar larvae to amplify the coding region of the Bombyx allatostatin receptor (BAR) gene. The product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The KpnI andXhoI restriction sites that had been incorporated into the above primers facilitated the subcloning into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The insert was fully sequenced, and two nucleotide substitutions were corrected using the Quickchange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This generated pcDNA3/BAR. The cDNA coding for mitochondrially targeted apoaequorin (vector pcDNA-I/mtAEQ) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the human G-protein subunit Gα16 (CHO/G16) were a kind gift from Drs. Stephen Rees and Jenny Stables (Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, UK). This cell line was created as described in Ref. 15Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar. CHO/G16 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12 with glutamax-I (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The transfection of CHO/G-16 with pcDNA3/BAR was done, using the Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to generate CHO/G16/BAR. Antibiotic selection was carried out with 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) added to the above medium. Subsequently 17 clones were isolated, and one clone, expressing high levels of BAR mRNA, was selected for further analysis. All CHO cells were assayed in white 96-well microtiter plates. CHO cells were assayed 48 h after transient transfection with pcDNA-I/mtAEQ (15Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These cells were confluent on the day of testing and were washed in cell medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum at the beginning of the testing day. To reconstitute the coelenterazine-apoaequorin complex, coelenterazine (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 5 μm 3 h prior to the assay (15Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Peptides, which were >95% pure and synthesized by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA), were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, warmed up to 37 °C, and 100 μl was added to the wells, giving a final volume of 200 μl. Luminescence was measured at 37 °C on a Victor2 (Wallac). Construction of the internal recombinant RNA standard (IS) was accomplished by designing two BAR-specific primers to amplify a fragment, corresponding to nucleotide positions 681–890 of Fig. 1. The sense primer had a 26-bp overhang attached to it, corresponding to positions 594–619 of Fig. 1 and located 61 bp upstream from the primer sequence. A 235-bp product containing a 61-bp deletion was created by PCR and cloned into pCR4-TOPO and sequenced. This construct was linearized withSpeI, and 1 μg was transcribed into RNA with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche). The product was treated with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove the DNA template and subsequently precipitated with ethanol. The IS was diluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA from fifth instar larvae was isolated as described above and treated with DNase I to remove any residual genomic DNA. A dilution series of IS was spiked into aliquots of 5 μg of total RNA from the different tissues and reverse transcribed with the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 100 ng of random hexamer primers per reaction. PCR was done using the sense primer, corresponding to position 594–619, and the antisense primer, corresponding to position 866–890 of Fig. 1 with the following cycle parameters: 94 °C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 68 °C for 3 min. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were digitized under UV light by means of a digital camera and software (Intas, Göttingen, Germany). The density of BAR cDNA and IS PCR products was measured using the Gelscan pro 4.0 software (Bioscitec), and a correction for the difference in length was made. The density ratio of IS to BAR cDNA versus the initial amount of IS added was depicted in a double logarithmic plot, and linear regression was used to calculate the amount of IS that resulted in a 1:1 molar ratio between BAR cDNA and IS. The screening for allatostatin preprohormone gene transcripts from B. mori was done, using PCR and cDNA from fifth instar larvae as a template. The first PCR reaction was carried out using the degenerate sense primer 5′-YTICCIGTITAYAAYTTYGG-3′ and the degenerate antisense primer 5′-CCIARICCRAAISWRAAICKRTG-3′. The second (nested) PCR reaction was carried out with the degenerate nested sense primer 5′-TAYWSITTYGGIYTIGGIAARMG-3′ and the degenerate nested antisense primer 5′-CKYTTICCIARICCMAAIBWRA-3′. The PCR program used for both reactions was 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. This yielded one product (nucleotide positions 228–575 in Fig. 5) that was cloned and sequenced. 5′-RACE was carried out as a nested PCR with an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 504–528 of Fig. 5 and a nested antisense primer corresponding to nuclotide positions 458–482 of Fig. 5. 3′-RACE was carried out as nested PCR as well, using a sense primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 253–276 of Fig. 5 and a nested sense primer corresponding to nucleotide positions 381–406 of Fig. 5. We aligned the two Drosophila allatostatin receptors, DAR-1 and DAR-2 (5Lenz C. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and designed degenerated primers against their con-served regions. Using PCR with these primers and Bombyx cDNA as a template, we were able to amplify a cDNA sequence, coding for a part of the transmembrane domain of a Bombyx receptor. Using 3′- and 5′-RACE, we could subsequently clone the complete receptor cDNA. The receptor cDNA is 1994 nucleotides long. It has a coding region of 1083 nucleotides, a 5′-untranslated region of 300 nucleotides, and a relatively long 3′-untranslated region of 611 nucleotides that includes a polyadenylylation signal and a poly(A+) tail (Fig. 1). Northern blots showed that our cloned cDNA represented most, or perhaps all, of the receptor cDNA (cf. Fig. 8, A and D). The cDNA codes for a protein of 361 amino acid residues. The first ATG in the open reading frame is proposed to be the start codon, because it is preceded by several stop codons (Fig. 1). Analysis of the protein using the SignalP, version 2.0 software program (www.cbs.dtu.dk) (16Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) did not reveal a conventional signal sequence for RER membrane translocation. However, the N terminus contains twoN-glycosylation sites, matching the Asn-X-Thr/Ser consensus sequence, suggesting that this part must be extracellular. Several software programs for hydropathicity analyses (www.cbs.dtu.dk; TMHMM, version 2.0 program) showed the clear presence of seven transmembrane domains (TM I–VII in Fig. 1), characteristic for G-protein-coupled receptors. The second extracellular loop has a third glycosylation site, obeying the Asn-X-Thr/Ser consensus sequence. The intracellular C terminus contains several Ser and Thr residues that are potential targets for receptor phosphorylation. To investigate the presence of introns in the receptor gene, we used PCR with primer pairs covering the whole receptor cDNA sequence and Bombyxgenomic DNA as a template. Sequencing of all the PCR products and comparison of the amplified genomic DNA fragments with the cDNA of Fig. 1 revealed the presence of two introns and three exons in the receptor gene (Fig. 1; Table I).Table IIntron/Exon Boundaries of the Bombyx Receptor GeneIntron5′-DonorIntron size (bp)3′-AcceptorIntron phase1CAG gttagatac. . . . .∼1600. . . . . .ccgtttcagATA3GlnIle2AAG gttaattca. . . . .∼5500. . . . . .aattttcagGTA3LysValThe sequence of each of the intron/exon boundaries is shown, as well as the amino acid residues involved.

Amino acid sequence alignments showed that the novel Bombyxreceptor is strongly related to the Drosophila allatostatin receptors, DAR-1 (68% amino acid sequence identity in the transmembrane region, 60% overall identity) and DAR-2 (53% in the transmembrane region, 48% overall identity) and a very recently cloned allatostatin receptor from the cockroach Periplaneta americana (PAR) (Fig. 2) (4Lenz C. Søndergaard L. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Lenz C. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

BAR is also related to the mammalian galanin receptors (36% overall identity with the rat galanin receptor type-1), somatostatin receptors (34% with the rat somatostatin receptor type-5), and opioid receptor (32% with the rat μ opioid receptors) (18Parker E.M.

Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the first potential glycosylation site (filled triangle in Fig. 2) of BAR occurs at the same positions as in DAR-1, DAR-2, PAR, and the galanin receptors; the second potential glycosylation site occurs at the same or nearly the same positions as in DAR-1, DAR-2, and the rat galanin receptor types-1 and -2; and the third potential BAR glycosylation site occurs at about the same position as in DAR-2 and the two rat galanin receptors. These findings confirm the structural similarities between the five receptors. The above findings can also be illustrated by a phylogenetic tree, showing that the five receptors are structurally related without, however, giving a significantly closer relationship of BAR to any of the other insect allatostatin receptors (Fig. 3). When the genes of BAR and DAR-1 and -2 were compared, we found that the two BAR introns occur at exactly the same positions and have the same intron phasing as two introns in DAR-1 and DAR-2 genes (Figs. 1 and 2; Table I), showing that the three receptors are not only structurally, but also clearly evolutionarily, related. Southern blot analyses, using a cDNA probe covering a large part of the BAR cDNA, and restriction enzymes that did not cleave within the sequenced gene regions, showed one strongly hybridizing and one or more additional, weakly hybridizing bands (Fig. 4). This suggests the presence of additional Bombyx genes related to the BAR gene. To establish that BAR is indeed an allatostatin receptor, one has to (i) find the authentic Bombyx allatostatins and (ii) perform the functional expression of BAR. To clone the Bombyxallatostatin preprohormone (BAP), we aligned a variety of known allatostatin preprohormones and designed primers against some of their common regions. These primers were then used in PCR, withBombyx fifth instar larval cDNA as a template. This procedure yielded a PCR product that was part of an allatostatin preprohormone. After 5′- and 3′-RACE, we finally cloned the whole precursor protein. The BAP cDNA is 2066 bp long and contains an unusually long 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 5). Northern blots showed that we cloned most of the BAP cDNA (c.f. Fig. 8 B). BAP is a protein of 204 amino acid residues long (Fig. 5) and has a clear N-terminal signal sequence for RER translocation that is probably cleaved off after Ala-17 (16Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). BAP contains the unprocessed sequences of eight allatostatins (Fig. 5). These eightBombyx allatostatins (bostatins 1–8) are all related and have the C-terminal A-type allatostatin consensus sequence Tyr/Phe-X-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH2 in common (Table II). Most of these peptide sequences (except for bostatin-2 and -4) are novel neuropeptide sequences and have not been isolated earlier from insects or other invertebrates (Table II).Table IIAllatostatin sequences found in the Bombyx allatostatin preprohormoneThese sequences are the proposed mature bioactive sequences after processing from the precursor (Fig. 5). Amino acid residues common to bostatin-4 are boxed. Bostatin-2 probably consists of two forms; one shorter variant and one longer variant N-terminally elongated with 10 amino acid residues. The shorter variant, bostatin-2[11–18] is identical to the Drosophila peptide drostatin-2 (6Lenz C. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the moth peptides helicostatin-2[11–18] and cydiastatin-2[11–18] (21Duve H. Johnsen A.H. Maestro J.-L. Scott A.G. Winstanley D. Davey M. East P.D. Thorpe A. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The elongated form, bostatin-2, is identical to the moth peptides helicostatin-2, and cydiastatin-2 (21Duve H. Johnsen A.H. Maestro J.-L. Scott A.G. Winstanley D. Davey M. East P.D. Thorpe A.

https://openalex.org/W2164163003,"Pex18p and Pex21p are structurally related yeast peroxins (proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis) that are partially redundant in function. One or the other is essential for the import into peroxisomes of proteins with type 2 peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS2). These sequences bind to the soluble PTS2 receptor, Pex7p, which in turn binds to Pex18p (or Pex21p or possibly both). Here we show that Pex18p is constitutively degraded with a half-time of less than 10 min in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This degradation probably occurs in proteasomes, because it requires the related ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc4p and Ubc5p and occurs normally in a mutant lacking the Pep4p vacuolar protease. The turnover of Pex18p stops, and Pex18p accumulates to a much higher than normal abundance in pex mutants in which the import of all peroxisomal matrix proteins is blocked. This includes mutants that lack peroxins involved in receptor docking at the membrane (Δpex13 or Δpex14), a mutant that lacks the peroxisomal member of the E2 family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Δpex4), and others (Δpex1). This stabilization in a variety of pex mutants indicates that Pex18p turnover is associated with its normal function. A Pex18p-Pex7p complex is detected by immunoprecipitation in wild type cells, and its abundance increases considerably in the Δpex14 peroxisome biogenesis mutant. Cells that lack Pex7p fail to stabilize and accumulate Pex18p, indicating an important role for complex formation in the stabilization. Mono- and diubiquitinated forms of Pex18p are detected in wild-type cells, and there is no Pex18p turnover in a yeastdoa4 mutant in which ubiquitin homeostasis is defective. These data represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of an organelle biogenesis factor that is degraded constitutively and rapidly. Pex18p and Pex21p are structurally related yeast peroxins (proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis) that are partially redundant in function. One or the other is essential for the import into peroxisomes of proteins with type 2 peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS2). These sequences bind to the soluble PTS2 receptor, Pex7p, which in turn binds to Pex18p (or Pex21p or possibly both). Here we show that Pex18p is constitutively degraded with a half-time of less than 10 min in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This degradation probably occurs in proteasomes, because it requires the related ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc4p and Ubc5p and occurs normally in a mutant lacking the Pep4p vacuolar protease. The turnover of Pex18p stops, and Pex18p accumulates to a much higher than normal abundance in pex mutants in which the import of all peroxisomal matrix proteins is blocked. This includes mutants that lack peroxins involved in receptor docking at the membrane (Δpex13 or Δpex14), a mutant that lacks the peroxisomal member of the E2 family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Δpex4), and others (Δpex1). This stabilization in a variety of pex mutants indicates that Pex18p turnover is associated with its normal function. A Pex18p-Pex7p complex is detected by immunoprecipitation in wild type cells, and its abundance increases considerably in the Δpex14 peroxisome biogenesis mutant. Cells that lack Pex7p fail to stabilize and accumulate Pex18p, indicating an important role for complex formation in the stabilization. Mono- and diubiquitinated forms of Pex18p are detected in wild-type cells, and there is no Pex18p turnover in a yeastdoa4 mutant in which ubiquitin homeostasis is defective. These data represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of an organelle biogenesis factor that is degraded constitutively and rapidly. peroxisomal targeting sequence polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hemagglutinin ubiquitin ubiquitin carrier protein Peroxisome biogenesis proceeds via a complex, branched pathway, in which a cellular machinery consisting of more than 20 proteins (peroxins) effects the recognition, targeting, and import of proteins containing peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTSs)1 (reviewed in Refs.1Sacksteder K.A.

The importance of this pathway is highlighted by the observation that it is evolutionarily conserved between yeast and humans and by the fact that loss of the PTS2 branch of peroxisomal biogenesis through PEX7 mutation causes the lethal disorder rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata in humans (12Braverman N.

We recently identified a novel pair of yeast peroxins, Pex18p and Pex21p, which interact with Pex7p and are essential for PTS2 targeting (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pex18p and Pex21p are weakly homologous to each other and appear to demonstrate partial functional redundancy, in that full loss of PTS2 targeting requires the absence of them both. Thus, although thiolase is the only known Saccharomyces cerevisiae PTS2 protein, at least three peroxins are involved in its delivery to peroxisomes. Several reports concerning different species place Pex7p within peroxisomes and/or within the cytosol, raising the intriguing possibility that Pex7p acts as a mobile receptor, shuttling between the cytosol and peroxisomal surface and/or lumen (10Marzioch M. Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4908-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Zhang J.W. Lazarow P.B. J.

The initial characterization of Pex18p/Pex21p identified these proteins as potentially key players in this proposed “mobile receptor” mechanism. In addition to the PTS2-specific peroxins (Pex7p, Pex18p, and Pex21p), many other peroxins are required for import of peroxisomal proteins, including, but not limited to, those with a PTS2. These peroxins are believed to include components of a common translocation machinery acting downstream of the point at which the various branches of peroxisomal protein import converge. Examples include the peroxisomal membrane peroxins Pex13p and Pex14p, which have been reported to interact with both Pex7p and the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p, consistent with roles in a common docking site for the PTS1 and PTS2 branches (18Albertini M.

Still other peroxins, including Pex1p, Pex4p, and Pex6p, are required for both PTS1 and PTS2 packaging but not for peroxisomal membrane assembly; their molecular roles have yet to be established. Pex1p and Pex6p are AAA ATPases localized in various yeasts and mammals to either cytosol, peroxisomes, or vesicles, depending upon the species under investigation, but not yet firmly localized in S. cerevisiae(25Erdmann R.

Pex4p is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for which substrates have not been identified, localized to the peroxisome membrane (34Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.-H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that the functioning of Pex18p and Pex21p is accompanied by their rapid proteolytic turnover and that this pathway of peroxin degradation is obligatorily connected to ongoing peroxisome assembly. This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of an organelle biogenesis factor that is constitutively degraded during its normal function. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against S. cerevisiae Pex7p and Pex18p were raised at Covance Research Products, Inc. (Denver, PA) using standard procedures. Antigens (prepared as slices excised from SDS-PAGE gels) corresponding to the NH2-terminal 156 residues of Pex7p and the COOH-terminal 200 residues of Pex18p were purified as His6-tagged proteins from overexpressing bacterial clones as described previously (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Pex7p antigen was prepared in the presence of 6 m urea to overcome its low solubility. The anti-Pex18p serum was affinity-purified on amino-link columns (Pierce) coupled with His6-tagged antigen, eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 2.5, and adjusted to pH 8.0 with Tris base. 10 ml of sera yielded 0.8 ml of purified antibody. All of thepex mutants described in this paper were generated by targeted disruption from wild-type haploid W303 of the correspondingPEX genes. W303Δpex5, W303Δpex7, and W303Δpex18 and have been described previously (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). W303Δpex1, in which the entire PEX1 coding region is replaced with the LEU2 marker gene, was a kind gift of Dr. Marek Skoneczny. W303Δpex4 was generated by transformation of W303 with the HindIII-NotI insert of plasmid pPEX4::TRP1 (see below) and selection of tryptophan auxotrophs. All double knockout strains were generated by successive transformations with the appropriate disruption constructs. W303Δpep4 was generated by transformation of W303 with theEcoRI-XbaI insert of plasmid pBJ3287 (a kind gift of Dr. Beth Jones, Carnegie Mellon University) and selection of histidine auxotrophs. All new disruption strains were checked by polymerase chain reaction and/or Western blotting. MHY623, in whichDOA4 has been disrupted, and the congenic wild-type strain MHY501 (36Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Dr. Marc Hochstrasser (University of Chicago). Y0238, in which UBC4 and UBC5 have been disrupted, and the congenic wild-type strain Y0002 were kind gifts of Dr. Stefan Jentsch (University of Heidelberg). For induction of peroxisomes, cells were precultured to a density of 5 × 107/ml in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and then inoculated at a density of 5 × 106/ml into YPEO (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% ethanol, 0.1% oleic acid, 0.25% Tween 40) and grown for a further 18 h. Where appropriate, cycloheximide was then added to a concentration of 10 μg/ml (0.2 μl/ml of a 50 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol), and growth was continued for up to 30 min, prior to protein extraction. For expression of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) from plasmid pKR81, galactose was added to the YPEO at a concentration of 0.01%. For strains harboring plasmids, preculturing was in SCD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose supplemented with all amino acids, adenine, and uracil, except those omitted to maintain plasmid selection). For some experiments, YPEO was replaced with YPE (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% ethanol). For assessment of Pex18p levels in YPD (see Fig. 1 B), aliquots of YPD precultures (2 × 107 cells/ml) were removed and processed for protein extraction (see below). For the pulse labeling shown in Fig. 2 B, peroxisome induction was in SCEO lacking methionine (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% ethanol, 0.1% oleic acid, 0.25% Tween 40 supplemented with adenine, uracil, and all amino acids except methionine) for 18 h, after which cells were diluted into fresh SCEO lacking methionine, supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, to a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml, and incubated for a further 5 min prior to protein extraction.Figure 2Strains with vastly different levels of Pex18p protein show little variation in PEX18 mRNA abundance or synthetic rate of Pex18p. A, total RNA was prepared from yeast grown in YPEO or YPE, and 20-μg aliquots were analyzed by Northern blotting with probes against PEX18 and actin (as a loading control). B, yeast cells grown in SCEO without methionine were pulse-labeled with radiolabeled methionine. Pex18p was immunoprecipitated from total cellular protein extracts (prepared by glass bead homogenization); its radioactivity was visualized by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For FLAG tagging, the complete coding sequence of the PEX18 gene was excised as a BamHI fragment from clone pYcp-PEX18 (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and cloned into the BglII site of pESC-LEU (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This produced a sequence encoding an in-frame fusion between the FLAG tag and the amino terminus ofPEX18, which was then excised as an SpeI fragment and cloned into the XbaI site of Yep351-POT1, which contains the POT1 (thiolase) promoter in the episomal vector Yep351. This produced a clone encoding FLAG-Pex18p under the regulation of the oleate-responsive POT1 promoter. To produce a similar clone lacking the FLAG tag, the PEX18 gene was excised as anSpeI fragment from clone pYcp-PEX18 (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and cloned directly into the into the XbaI site of Yep351-POT1. Plasmid pKR81, encoding HA-Ub (37Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) under the regulation of the GAL1 promoter, was a kind gift of Dr. K. Robzyk (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York). For construction of plasmid pPEX4::TRP1, which was used for targeted disruption of PEX4 from W303 wild-type yeast, PEX4 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from W303 genomic DNA using primers 5′-CCTGTTGCTTTACACCATTGA-3′ (maps to 593 bases upstream of PEX4 coding region) and 5′-GATACTGCAGTCAATGGTTGTTGATCCGCT-3′ (maps to the 3′ end ofPEX4 coding sequence). This polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCR-TOPO2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), linearized with StuI, and ligated to aSmaI-StuI fragment containing the TRP1 gene. A fragment containing the TRP1 gene flanked byPEX4 sequences was excised from the resultant construct and used for transformation of W303. PEX4 knockouts were verified by polymerase chain reaction. Preparation of total cellular RNA by the hot acidic phenol method and Northern blotting were as described (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY1987Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by random priming from the coding regions of yeast PEX18 and actin genes, the latter of which were a kind gift of Drs. Igor Karpichev and Gillian Small (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). Radioactive bands on the washed blots were visualized by autoradiography or with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Preparation by glass bead homogenization of total cellular protein extracts for immunoblotting was as described previously (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Preparation by glass bead homogenization of total cellular protein extracts for immunoprecipitation with anti-Pex18p (Figs. 2 Band 4 B) was by this same method but using IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, supplemented as usual with protease inhibitor mixture (39Thieringer R. Shio H. Han Y. Cohen G. Lazarow P.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) in place of our normal protein extraction buffer. Immunoprecipitations, with affinity-purified anti-Pex18p, were as described previously (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For preparation of total protein extracts prior to immunoprecipitation of Pex18p-ubiquitin conjugates with anti-FLAG, a modified extraction procedure was employed in order to minimize the risk of proteolytic degradation of these conjugates. Cells were grown in 25 ml of YPEO and washed and collected as usual. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 40% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were briefly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then thawed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Glass beads were added, and the samples were then vortexed vigorously for 2 min, after which the extracts were decanted from the beads and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 50 μl of unbuffered 2 m Tris base was added (to adjust the pH). Samples were boiled for 3 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. 200-μl aliquots of the blue supernatant were then recovered and added to 770 μl of fresh IP buffer (supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, after which the anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel was recovered by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 1 min and washed twice with 1 ml of IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in IP buffer. The final eluate was processed as usual for SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were as described previously (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), except that prior to blotting with anti-ubiquitin, the nitrocellulose membrane was autoclaved for 20 min. This greatly enhances the signal from both free ubiquitin and ubiquitin conjugates (data not shown). Antibody dilutions used were as follows: 1:100 affinity-purified anti-Pex18p, 1:500 anti-Pex7p serum, and 1:100 anti-ubiquitin (Sigma). For the pulse-labeling experiment shown in Fig. 2 B, the SDS-PAGE gel was incubated in 1 m sodium salicylate for 1 h prior to drying and fluorography. A polyclonal antiserum raised against bacterially expressed Pex18p (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to monitor Pex18p expression levels in wild-type and variouspex mutant yeast strains. Pex18p could be detected in extracts from oleate-induced wild-type yeast as a doublet with an estimated size of about 36 kDa (see Fig. 1), compared with the predicted size, based on the sequence of the PEX18 gene, of ∼32 kDa (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The reason for this apparent size difference is unclear, but it was also observed for bacterially expressed Pex18p (which likewise runs as a doublet), indicating that its mobility in SDS-PAGE may be an intrinsic feature of the protein rather than due to covalent modifications. Treatment of extracts with iodoacetamide, phosphatases, or hydroxylamine did not alter the Pex18p gel migration pattern (data not shown). Both bands of the doublet were absent in extracts from W303Δpex18 yeast, confirming that they correspond to Pex18p (Fig. 1 A). Remarkably, the abundance of Pex18p was greatly increased in strains with generalized defects in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins (W303Δpex1, W303Δpex4, W303Δpex13, and W303Δpex14) (Figs. 1 and3 B). On the other hand, Pex18p abundance was close to normal in W303Δpex7 and W303Δpex5, which display partial defects in this process. In common with many peroxisomal proteins and peroxins, Pex18p expression was oleate-inducible, as shown by the apparent absence or near absence of immunoreactive protein in strains grown in YPD or YPE (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the mechanism of the variation in Pex18p levels, RNA was extracted from oleate-induced strains and analyzed by Northern blotting. PEX18 mRNA levels were similar to the wild-type level in several pex mutants, including W303Δpex5, W303Δpex7, W303Δpex13, and W303Δpex14 (shown for W303Δpex14 in Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the variation in Pex18p levels is not primarily due to differences in abundance of PEX18 message. In agreement with the immunoblot data shown in Fig. 1 B, PEX18 mRNA levels were much lower in the absence of oleate. The rate of Pex18p synthesis was tested directly by pulse-labeling oleate-grown cells with [35S]methionine and then analyzing incorporation into Pex18p by immunoprecipitation with anti-Pex18p, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 2 B). Little difference was observed between wild type and W303Δpex14, suggesting that Pex18p is made at similar rates in these strains. Since neither the levels of PEX18 mRNA nor the rates of Pex18p synthesis vary substantially between strains with grossly different levels of Pex18p, we next addressed the question of Pex18p turnover. Cells were grown and induced as usual, and then growth was continued in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Pex18p rapidly disappeared from wild-type cells treated with cycloheximide, being barely detectable within 20 min. In contrast, the high level of Pex18p in W303Δpex14 cells was maintained after 20 min in cycloheximide (Fig. 3 A) and showed no discernible decline even 5 h after administration of cycloheximide (not shown). The turnover of Pex18p in W303Δpex7 cells, which maintain Pex18p at a level similar to that seen in wild-type cells, is similar to the turnover rate in wild-type cells (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of additional pex mutants revealed a consistent pattern. Mutants that have a generalized defect in peroxisome biogenesis accumulated high levels of Pex18p, which turned over slowly, if at all, whereas W303Δpex7 and W303Δpex5, which are defective only for PTS2 and PTS1 targeting, respectively, behaved similarly to wild type (Fig. 3 B). Thus, in mutants W303Δpex13 and W303Δpex14, where Pex18p is unable to fulfill its role of PTS2 protein delivery to peroxisomes, Pex18p is stabilized. Notably in W303Δpex4, which lacks the peroxisomal member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, Pex18p is likewise stabilized. Stabilization also occurs in W303Δpex1. In W303Δpex5, where PTS2 packaging is functional, Pex18p is turned over as in wild-type cells. Pex18p is known to interact with Pex7p (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The instability of Pex18p in W303Δpex7 suggests that Pex18p may be stabilized by its interaction with Pex7p. Pex21p, whose function can partially compensate for an absence of Pex18p (16Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), also turns over rapidly in wild-type yeast (data not shown). In cells defective in peroxisome biogenesis (W303Δpex13 or W303Δpex14), Pex21p is stabilized little, if at all, unless Pex18p is missing, in which case there is a striking stabilization and accumulation of Pex21p. As for Pex18p, this stabilization requires Pex7p to be present. In order to investigate further the possible involvement of Pex7p in Pex18p stabilization, we disrupted thePEX7 gene from several pex mutants and assessed the consequences for Pex18p accumulation and turnover. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the absence of Pex7p completely abolishes Pex18p stabilization in the W303Δpex13 background. W303Δpex13Δpex7appeared identical to W303Δpex7 with respect to the abundance of Pex18p and its turnover. Similar Pex18p instability was observed in W303Δpex14Δpex7 (Fig. 4 A) and W303Δpex4Δpex7 (not shown). These data support the idea that Pex18p becomes stabilized in pex mutants through persistence of its interaction with Pex7p. To test directly whether the elevated Pex18p is associated with Pex7p, anti-Pex18p immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Pex7p antisera (Fig. 4 B). Pex7p was co-immunoprecipitated with Pex18p from wild-type cells; the amount of immunoprecipitated Pex7p was considerably greater with W303Δpex14 cells. In neither case was immunoprecipitation of Pex7p complete, suggesting that the cellular Pex7p is not saturated with Pex18p, even when the latter is accumulated to the levels seen in W303Δpex14. To investigate the mechanism of the rapid turnover of Pex18p in wild-type cells, we first analyzed Pex18p turnover in strains defective in various aspects of degradation of cellular proteins. W303Δpep4, which lacks the vacuolar proteinase A, had wild-type levels of Pex18p abundance and turnover (Fig. 5). On the other hand, Y0238, which lacks two functionally related ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ubc4p and Ubc5p, showed accumulation of high levels of Pex18p and impaired Pex18p turnover. A congenic wild type strain (Y0002; Fig. 5) and various otherubc mutants, including a strain lacking Ubc6p and Ubc7p (Y0241; not shown), demonstrated normal Pex18p"

G protein-coupled receptor multivesicular bodies transferrin receptor muscarinic acetylcholine receptor early endosome autoantigen 1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium carbachol phosphate-buffered saline epidermal growth factor receptor Intracellular trafficking has recently emerged as a crucial component of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 regulation. GPCR trafficking includes targeting of newly synthesized receptors to the cell surface, endocytosis of activated receptors, recycling back to the plasma membrane, and targeting to lysosomes for degradation (1Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A central requirement for understanding the role of trafficking in GPCR regulation is to delineate the intracellular organelles through which the receptors traffic. Recent cell biological studies have identified multiple distinct endocytic compartments involved in cell surface receptor trafficking. These organelles include: 1) early sorting endosomes that contain both recycling proteins and proteins destined for degradation; 2) recycling endosomes; and 3) late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that target proteins for lysosomal degradation (2Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 4Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The endosomal compartments involved in protein trafficking are morphologically and functionally distinct and can be identified by association with small GTPases called Rabs. The roles individual Rabs play in endocytic trafficking have been elucidated primarily based on studies of trafficking of the constitutively endocytosed and recycled transferrin receptor (TfnR) (5Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the first steps in the endocytic pathway, trafficking of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane to early sorting endosomes, is mediated by Rab5. Mutants that alter Rab5 activity affect the targeting of the TfnR from the cell surface to early sorting endosomes and the intracellular distribution of the TfnR within early endosomes (6Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Consequently, if GPCR traffic through early sorting endosomes in common with the TfnR, the localization of internalized GPCR within this compartment should depend upon Rab5 activity. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) provide an excellent model for studying GPCR trafficking because of the existence membrane impermeant ligands that identify cell surface receptors and specific antibodies that can identify individual mAChR subtypes. The family of mAChR includes 5 subtypes: Gq-linked m1, m3, and m5, and Gi-linked m2 and m4. The m4 mAChR is one of the principal mAChR subtypes in the brain, yet little is known about its functions due to lack of selective pharmacological agents. However, recent studies indicate that activation of m4 mediates locomotor activity (7Gomeza J. Zhang L. Kostenis E. Felder C. Bymaster F. Brodkin J. Shannon H. Xia B. Deng C. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10483-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), m4 expression is up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease (8Flynn D.D. Ferrari-DiLeo G. Mash D.C. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and m4 is a novel target for antipsychotics (9Felder C.C. Porter A.C. Skillman T.L. Zhang L. Bymaster F.P. Nathanson N.M. Hamilton S.E. Gomeza J. Wess J. McKinzie D.L. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On a cellular level, m4 regulates adenylyl cyclase (10Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), release of intracellular calcium (11Krudewig R. Langer B. Vogler O. Markschies N. Erl M. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and calcium channels (12Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding m4 regulation is important for understanding mechanisms that underlie many physiological processes. The primary goal of this study is to define the early endosomal trafficking of m4 and determine the role of Rab5 in m4 internalization and endocytic trafficking. We used subtype-specific antibodies and immunocytochemistry to selectively quantitate the intracellular trafficking of m4. We chose to examine m4 endogenously expressed in a native system because endogenously expressed GPCRs show different trafficking patterns than receptors transfected and overexpressed in foreign cell lines (13Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, because the majority of m4 is expressed in neurons, we studied m4 trafficking in the neuroendocrine PC12 cell line (14Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We show that CCh treatment causes m4 to internalize from the cell surface to Tfn- and early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA1)-positive early sorting endosomes. Mutants that alter Rab5 activity produce dramatic effects on m4 cell surface and endosomal localization. The dominant negative Rab5 inhibits m4 internalization and reduces the size of endocytic vesicles containing m4. The constitutively active Rab5 enhances m4 intracellular localization and produces enlarged vacuoles to which m4 is targeted. Ultrastructural analysis of these vacuoles reveals the presence of numerous internal vesicles, suggesting that these structures are MVBs. Interestingly, m4 shows a distinct distribution within the MVB compared with Tfn. These studies thus define the early endosomal trafficking of m4 and identify MVBs as a site of divergence between the m4 mAChR and constitutively recycled cell surface receptors. PC12 cells were a gift from Dr. Richard Burry (15Burry B.W. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), 5% fetal clone serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For binding assays, cells were passaged into 6-well culture dishes at 20,000 cells/cm2 3 days before use. For immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were passaged 2 days before use onto Matrigel extracellular matrix (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) coated coverslips in 6-well culture dishes at 20,000 cells/cm2. Wild typerab5, rab5S34N, and rab5Q79L cDNAs were a gift from Dr. Marino Zerial. To construct the Rab5-GFP fusion proteins, the rab5 cDNAs were amplified with polymerase chain reaction with a 5′ oligonucleotide primer that introduced aHindIII restriction enzyme site (5′-TATTAAAGCTTCATGGCTAATCGAGGA-3′) and a 3′ primer that introduced aBamHI restriction enzyme site (5′-TTATATGGATCCGTTACTACAACACTG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with HindIII andBamHI and ligated into the pEGFP-C2 vector using a DNA ligation kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Vectors were transformed into ultracompetent epicurian coli bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a plasmid preparation was performed using a Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequencing confirmed the DNA sequence of therab5 constructs. For transfections, cells were plated onto 6-well trays at 100,000 cells/cm2 and transfected 2 days later. The following constructs (1 μg) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA): pEGFP vector (control), wild type rab5, rab5S34N, and rab5Q79L. The next day, cells were rinsed and passaged onto coverslips. For all experiments, cells were pretreated with media containing cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) for 30 min to eliminate newly synthesized mAChR (16Szekeres P.G. Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1694-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide was included in all subsequent treatments. To induce mAChR internalization, cells were continuously treated with media containing carbachol (CCh) (100 μm) at 37 °C for various time points as indicated in the figure legends. To inhibit mAChR activation, cells were treated with the mAChR antagonist, atropine (10 μm) for 2.5 h. Following drug treatments, cells were rinsed with cold DMEM and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 nm [3H]NMS and 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were rinsed with DMEM, suspended in 1 ml PBS, and 0.9 ml used for radioactive measurements by liquid scintillation spectroscopy and 0.1 ml used for a protein assay. Nonspecific binding was determined using atropine. Cells were serum starved for 2 h before transferring the coverslips to cold DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin and transferrin-Alexa 633 (50 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells were then placed on ice, rinsed 2 times with DMEM and 1% BSA, and warmed to 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of CCh. Following drug treatments, cells were fixed for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. Cells were rinsed 5 times with PBS containing 0.5% normal horse serum (PBS+), blocked for 60 min in PBS containing 5% normal horse serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer), and 0.05% Triton X-100 for permeabilization and rinsed 3 times with PBS+. Primary antibody incubations were in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The following antibodies were used: m4 monoclonal (1:250; Chemicon, Temecula, CA (17Bernard V. Levey A.I. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10237-10249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or polyclonal (1 μg/ml (18Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)); Na+/K+-ATPase α-1 subunit monoclonal (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); EEA-1 monoclonal (1:250; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). For double labeling, both primaries were incubated together. The cells were rinsed 4 times with PBS+ and incubated with rhodamine- or Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies in blocking buffer (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). For double labeling, secondary antibodies were incubated together. Control incubations included omission of primary antibodies to test nonspecific secondary antibody binding and incubation with one primary but both secondary antibodies to demonstrate the absence of bleedthrough and cross-labeling (data not shown). Coverslips were mounted onto slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Cells were scanned using a Zeiss (Heidelberg, Germany) LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope coupled to a Zeiss 100M axiovert and a 63× Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens. Adobe Photoshop was used for final image preparation. Quantitation of co-localization was performed on unprocessed images using Metamorph Imaging System Software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The average grayscale pixel intensity +1 standard deviation of a small region of the nucleus was measured in the m4 and Na+/K+-ATPase (or EEA1) channels and defined as background. Each field contained a few cells and single cells were selected by manually tracing cell outlines. To subtract background, the threshold of each channel was set at the value obtained for background. The average pixel intensity +1 standard deviation was measured for the thresholded images and the threshold was then set at this new value. The percentage of the area of overlap between m4 pixels over Na+/K+-ATPase (or EEA1) pixels was calculated. The data is presented as the mean (± S.E.) and was analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher's LSD post-hoc test. Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer. Cells were rinsed with 0.1m phosphate buffer, fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 15 min, dehydrated, and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella, Inc. Redding, CA). After resin polymerization, cells were sectioned en face. Ultrathin sections were stained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Hitachi 7500 transmission electron microscope (Mountain Hill, CA). The neuronotypic PC12 cell line endogenously expresses mAChRs (14Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and thus provides an excellent model for studying trafficking in a native system. Because mAChR trafficking may depend on the cell line in which they are expressed (13Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar), we first sought to characterize the extent of CCh induced loss of cell surface mAChRs in PC12 cells with previously established binding assays using membrane impermeant [3H]NMS. Treatment of PC12 cells with CCh produces a progressive decrease in cell surface binding of mAChR over time (Fig. 1 A). This loss in cell surface mAChR is substantial, as ∼80% of mAChR internalize by 60 min continuous CCh treatment. [3H]NMS binds nonselectively to all mAChRs, and PC12 cells express multiple mAChR subtypes (14Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As distinct GPCR subtypes show differences in patterns of intracellular trafficking (19Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Vogler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12155-12160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), binding assays are thus inadequate because they do not allow study of individual mAChRs. Therefore, immunocytochemistry using a subtype-selective antibody, confocal microscopy, and image analysis were used to visualize and quantitate the internalization of the m4 subtype of mAChR specifically. In untreated cells, m4 and Na+/K+-ATPase localize to the cell surface and co-localize extensively (Fig. 1 B). Following 10 min continuous CCh treatment, m4 redistributes from the plasma membrane into large discrete puncta distributed peripherally throughout the cell. After 60 min CCh, m4 concentrates near the nucleus. Following both 10 and 60 min CCh treatment, m4 shows minimal co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase. To quantitate loss of cell surface m4 in single cells, the percentage of m4 pixels that overlap with Na+/K+-ATPase pixels in the confocal images was measured. Ten and 60 min CCh treatment cause a progressive decrease in m4 co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 1 D shows that the magnitude of mAChR internalization measured by binding assays and the magnitude of m4 internalization measured by image analysis are very similar. These data are consistent with m4 comprising 95% of total mAChR expressed in PC12 cells (14Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, quantitation of confocal images provides a valid method for measuring the extent of internalization following agonist treatment. Furthermore, unlike binding assays, confocal images allow single cell analysis of internalization of the m4 subtype of mAChR specifically and visualization of m4 trafficking to intracellular compartments. We next determined if CCh-induced internalization targets m4 to intracellular compartments in common with the TfnR. To visualize internalization of m4 and the TfnR simultaneously at early time points, cells were prelabeled with the Tfn ligand conjugated to Alexa-633, rinsed, and incubated in CCh. Fig. 2 Ashows that both internalized m4 and Tfn localize to large puncta distributed throughout the cell. Merged images demonstrate m4 and Tfn co-localization. The TfnR initially traffics to early sorting endosomes following internalization, but also travels through distinct recycling compartments (2Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Therefore localization of the TfnR does not distinguish among segregate endosomal compartments. EEA1 localizes selectively to early sorting endosomes (21Rubino M. Miaczynska M. Lippe R. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3745-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether m4 initially traffics to early sorting endosomes following internalization we measured the extent of m4 co-localization with EEA1. In PC12 cells, EEA1 distributes to large puncta peripherally localized throughout cell. m4 and EEA1 show minimal co-localization in untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). Following 10 min CCh, m4 has almost completely redistributed from the cell surface and localizes to large intracellular puncta that co-localize extensively with EEA1. Accordingly, co-localization between m4 and EEA1 increases from ∼7.5% in untreated cells to greater than 50% following 10 min CCh (Fig. 2 C). These data demonstrate agonist-induced m4 trafficking through EEA1-positive early sorting endosomes. EEA1 is a Rab5 effector and both molecules direct trafficking of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane to early endosomes (21Rubino M. Miaczynska M. Lippe R. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3745-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies demonstrate that dominant negative Rab5S34N inhibits and constitutively active Rab5Q79L enhances cell surface receptor internalization (6Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 23Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether m4 internalization from the cell surface depends on Rab5 activity, the following rab5 constructs were transiently transfected in PC12 cells: wild type rab5, dominant negative rab5S34N which cannot exchange GDP for GTP, and constitutively active rab5Q79L which lacks GTPase activity. Cells transfected with the pEGFP vector alone were included as controls. Transfection efficiency in PC12 cells is low. Thus, the use of established methods, such as [3H]NMS binding, to determine the effects of Rab5 on mAChR trafficking, is not possible. We therefore used confocal microscopy and image analysis to quantify m4 co-localization with a cell surface marker to determine the effects of Rab5 on m4 internalization in single cells. Expression of wild type Rab5 produces no effect on cell surface m4 as co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase is equivalent between control cells and wild type Rab5 expressing cells at baseline and throughout the time course of CCh treatment (data not shown). In cells expressing dominant negative Rab5S34N, m4 shows equivalent co-localization with cell surface Na+/K+-ATPase at baseline compared with vector transfected control cells (Fig. 3 A). However, cell surface m4 is not reduced following initial (2.5 min) treatment with CCh such that m4 overlap with Na+/K+-ATPase is significantly higher than controls. By 5 min continuous CCh stimulation and throughout the remainder of the time course, m4 co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase is similar between Rab5S34N expressing cells and control cells. In cells expressing constitutively active Rab5Q79L, m4 co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase is strikingly reduced at baseline. This reduction in cell surface m4 is maintained in Rab5Q79L expressing cells following 2.5 to 10 min CCh stimulation. By 60 min, m4 shows extensive internalization in all cells and m4 co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase in Rab5Q79L expressing cells is equivalent to controls. When the data presented in Fig. 3 A is replotted to examine CCh-induced loss of cell surface m4 relative to untreated cells (Fig. 3 B), the dominant negative Rab5S34N inhibits m4 internalization. However, this effect is significant only during the initial period following CCh stimulation. In addition, while Rab5Q79L expression increases the proportion of intracellular m4 at baseline, the extent of CCh-induced m4 internalization in rab5Q79L-transfected cells is not further increased relative to control cells. Collectively, these results indicate that m4 distribution at baseline and internalization following agonist stimulation are both regulated by Rab5. Because Rab5 plays a role in m4 cell surface distribution and m4 traffics to early endosomes following internalization, m4 localization within early endosomes may also depend on Rab5 activity. Therefore, the effects of mutant Rab5 expression on intracellular localization of m4 following CCh treatment were examined. In the GDP bound form, Rab5 localizes to the cytosol while Rab5-GTP attaches to the membrane (25Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Accordingly, wild type Rab5 expressed in PC12 cells shows both diffuse staining consistent with cytosolic Rab5-GDP and punctate staining consistent with membrane bound Rab5-GTP (Fig. 4). Localization of dominant negative Rab5S34N-GFP, which does not bind to the membrane is mostly diffuse and cytosolic. Constitutively active Rab5Q79L-GFP produces enlarged puncta and strikingly large vacuoles (Fig. 4) with diameters ranging from ∼3.5 to 6.5 μm in ∼50% of Rab5Q79L-GFP positive cells. In untreated cells, expression of wild type Rab5 or Rab5S34N does not affect the cell surface distribution of m4 compared with controls (Fig. 4). However, m4 shows markedly enhanced intracellular localization in cells expressing constitutively active Rab5Q79L. In particular, m4 is targeted to the large vacuole. The effects of Rab5Q79L are selective for m4 as this Rab5 mutant does not affect cell surface localization of Na+/K+-ATPase (see Fig. 7). Thus, even in unstimulated cells, production of enlarged vacuoles by Rab5Q79L results in dramatic enhancement of intracellular pools of m4. To determine whether intracellular distribution of m4 following agonist stimulation depends on Rab5 activity, cells were treated continuously with CCh for 10 min and m4 co-localization with EEA1 and Rab5-GFP was analyzed. In cells expressing wild type Rab5, internalized m4, EEA1, and Rab5-GFP co-localize in large puncta (Fig. 5). In cells expressing dominant negative Rab5S34N, m4 shows a predominately intracellular distribution following 10 min CCh. These data confirm that although dominant negative Rab5S34N inhibits m4 internalization following 2.5 min CCh, m4 internalization is not impaired following 10 min CCh (see Fig. 3). The most dramatic effect of Rab5S34N expression is decreased size of vesicles containing internalized m4 compared with control cells (see Fig. 1) and wild type Rab5 expressing cells. EEA1-positive puncta are also reduced in size but m4 does not co-localize with either EEA1 or Rab5S34N-GFP. Rab5Q79L increases the size of EEA1 and m4-positive endosomes and m4 co-localizes extensively with EEA1 and Rab5Q79L-GFP in these large puncta (Fig. 5, third panel from top). Furthermore, m4 also co-localizes with EEA1 and Rab5Q79L-GFP at the perimeter of the large vacuole (bottom panel). However, unlike EEA1 and Rab5Q79L-GFP, m4 localizes to the interior of the large vacuoles. The amount of m4 at the vacuole perimeter following 10 min CCh treatment was quantitated by determining the percentage of m4 that co-localizes with EEA1 at the vacuolar limiting membrane. EEA1 localizes selectively to the vacuole perimeter and an average of ∼35% of m4 co-localizes with EEA1. Therefore, the majority (65%) of m4 localizes to the interior of the vacuole where it does not co-localize with EEA1. Overall, these data demonstrate that expression of Rab5 mutants produces dramatic effects on endosomal morphology and m4 distribution within early endosomes. Interestingly, m4 shows segregate distribution from Rab5 and EEA1 within either the small vesicles produced by dominant negative Rab5 or the enlarged vacuoles produced by expression of constitutively active Rab5Q79L. Because m4 is a 7-transmembrane spanning receptor it most likely localizes to membranes within the vacuole produced by constitutively active Rab5Q79L. Fig. 6shows the ultrastructural characteristics of an enlarged vacuole formed by expression of Rab5Q79L. The vacuoles are frequently very large (6 μm diameter, Fig. 6 A) and the structures are surrounded by a limiting membrane which encloses lumenal material that is more electron dense than the surrounding cytoplasm. The vacuoles often contain several large, irregular membrane profiles (Fig. 6 B) and are filled with multiple small, round vesicles (Fig. 6 C). The presence of internal vesicles within the lumen of these vacuoles identify these structures as MVBs. Comparison of the ultrastructural appearance of the multivesicular structures with confocal images (see Fig. 5) suggests that m4 localizes both to the limiting membrane and internal vesicles. Therefore, in addition to increasing endosomal size, Rab5Q79L produces enlarged MVBs. m4 localizes within the large MVBs produced by Rab5Q79L after CCh treatment and in unstimulated cells. At baseline, cell surface m4 could be activated by ACh released by PC12 cells (26Greene L.A. Rein G. Nature. 1977; 268: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,27Schubert D. Klier F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5184-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and hence internalized. Substantial levels of choline acetyltransferase activity have been measured and therefore the PC12 cells used in this study synthesize ACh. 2C. Heilman and A. Levey, unpublished observations. Thus, sequestration of m4 within large vacuoles formed by Rab5Q79L may depend on m4 stimulation and endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Alternatively, Rab5Q79L expression may target m4 directly from biosynthetic compartments to endosomal compartments, thus preventing m4 from ever reaching the cell surface and causing its intracellular accumulation. To distinguish between these possibilities, the mAChR antagonist, atropine was used to inhibit mAChR activation and consequent internalization. In vector-transfected control cells, prolonged atropine treatment (2.5 h) does not significantly enhance m4 co-localization with Na+/K+-ATPase compared with untreated cells (Fig. 7 B). In Rab5Q79L expressing cells, although the enlarged MVBs are still formed, atropine prevents the intracellular accumulation of m4 (Fig. 7 A). m4 overlap with Na+/K+-ATPase is significantly increased following atropine treatment compared with untreated cells such that co-localization is equivalent to vector transfected control cells (Fig. 7 B). Therefore, Rab5Q79L does not prevent the targeting of m4 to the plasma membrane. By preventing activation and consequent internalization, atropine prevents Rab5Q79L from sequestering m4 intracellularly. Because atropine inhibits m4 endocytosis, and cycloheximide blocks m4 synthesis, only the recycling and degradative pathways remain. Thus, m4 shows increased cell surface localization following 2.5 h atropine treatment compared with untreated cells because m4 either returns to the cell surface or is degraded. In either case, these data demonstrate that m4 must traffic through the endocytic pathway to be delivered to the enlarged MVBs. We show that in control cells, m4 traffics through Tfn and EEA1 positive early endosomes (Fig. 2). However, unlike Tfn which completely recycles to the cell surface (6Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), internalized mAChRs can be targeted for degradation (1Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In constitutively active Rab5Q79L expressing cells, EEA1 localizes selectively to the perimeter of the large vacuoles while m4 localizes both to the perimeter and within the vacuoles, suggesting that m4 also traffics to a membrane compartment distinct from early sorting endosomes. Therefore, m4 and Tfn trafficking were compared to determine whether m4 localizes to membrane compartments within the multivesicular structure distinct from a constitutively endocytosed and recycled protein. In Rab5Q79L expressing cells, internalized m4 and Tfn co-localize in some puncta. However, m4 and Tfn show remarkably distinct distributions within the large vacuoles (Fig. 8). Whereas Tfn localization is restricted to the perimeter of the vacuole, m4 is also found in the lumen of vacuole. These data demonstrate that these large vacuoles formed by Rab5Q79L are capable of segregating m4 from constitutively endocytosed and recycled Tfn. We show that following agonist stimulated internalization, m4 trafficked to Tfn- and EEA1-positive early sorting endosomes. m4 trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes depends on Rab5 activity as Rab5 mutants produced dramatic effects on m4 localization at cell surface and within early endosomes. The dominant negative Rab5S34N inhibited CCh-induced m4 internalization and the constitutively active Rab5Q79L enhanced m4 intracellular localization even in unstimulated cells. In particular, expression of constitutively active Rab5Q79L resulted in formation of markedly enlarged vacuoles containing vesicles and resembling MVBs, suggesting a surprising new role for Rab5 in MVB biogenesis. While Rab5, EEA1, and Tfn localized selectively to the perimeter of these MVBs, m4 distributed both to the perimeter and the interior of the MVB. Therefore our data suggest a novel model by which MVBs segregate GPCRs away from pathways traveled by constitutively endocytosed and recycled proteins. To analyze m4 mAChR intracellular trafficking, we developed a method to quantitate changes in the cell surface distribution of m4 in single cells. This method provides several advantages by allowing: 1) analysis of the m4 subtype of mAChR specifically; 2) investigation of the trafficking of an endogenously expressed receptor; and 3) visualization of m4 trafficking at the cell surface and intracellularly. Furthermore, despite low transfection efficiency of PC12 cells, this method allowed determination of the effects of mutant Rab5 expression in single cells. The percentage of m4 internalization measured by confocal microscopy and [3H]NMS binding were remarkably similar. Thus, quantitation of confocal images provides a valuable method for measuring cell surface localization of specific mAChR subtypes and studying their intracellular trafficking. Following CCh stimulation, m4 showed a progressive redistribution from the cell surface to Tfn-positive and EEA1-positive early endosomes. EEA1 is a Rab5 effector (22Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) which directs trafficking to early endosomes. Localization of m4 to the cell surface and distribution within early endosomes was found to depend on Rab5 activity. The most apparent effect of expression of the dominant negative, inactive form of Rab5 is decreased size of m4 containing vesicles. These vesicles do not co-localize with EEA1 or Rab5, indicating that active Rab5 is required for targeting m4 to early sorting endosomes. Expression of Rab5S34N also impaired m4 internalization at an early time point following CCh treatment in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that Rab5S34N inhibits cell surface receptor internalization (6Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 23Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altered endosomal morphology may be related to the initial impairment of m4 internalization following CCh treatment. Reduced endosomal size may decrease the number of receptors that can enter the endocytic pathway initially (2.5 min) following internalization. However, m4 internalization was not blocked following prolonged (≥5 min) agonist stimulation. Therefore, it is possible that over time, as m4 is shunted to other pathways such as recycling endosomes, more receptors can enter early endosomes from the cell surface. Expression of Rab5Q79L produced the opposite effects to Rab5S34N, as this constitutively active mutant produced dramatically enlarged vacuoles. Electron microscopy showed that the vacuoles are surrounded by a limiting membrane, contain irregular shaped membrane profiles and multiple small, round vesicles. Therefore, our ultrastructural analysis are consistent with these vacuoles being MVBs. Initially upon formation, MVBs are sorting endosomes containing proteins destined to recycle such as the TfnR and proteins destined for degradation such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). MVBs then lose recycling proteins as they mature into a prelysosomal compartment (28Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rab5Q79L mediated increase in MVB size is consistent with the role of Rab5 in regulating membrane traffic among sorting endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a role for Rab5 in MVB biogenesis. Although the mechanisms by which MVB internal vesicles accumulate are unknown, because the structure produced by RabQ79L is filled with small vesicles, Rab5 may be involved in formation of MVB internal vesicles. Constitutively active Rab5Q79L enhanced m4 intracellular distribution even in unstimulated cells and in particular targeted m4 to the enlarged MVBs. m4 targeting to MVBs is consistent with a previous electron microscopy study of m4 trafficking in vivo, showing that, following agonist treatment, m4 localizes to MVBs in medium spiny neurons (17Bernard V. Levey A.I. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10237-10249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our data highlight that in addition to early endosomes, MVBs are important organelles involved in m4 trafficking. We show that targeting to this vacuole requires m4 activation (i.e. is atropine sensitive) and thus trafficking through an endocytic pathway. Treatment with atropine most likely prevents intracellular accumulation of m4 at baseline in Rab5Q79L expressing cells by inhibiting m4 activation by ACh released by PC12 cells. However, although ACh is synthesized by the clone of PC12 cells used in this study, it is possible that ACh is not released at sufficient levels to stimulate mAChRs. Thus, another mechanism by which atropine prevents intracellular accumulation of m4 is by preventing a conformational change in m4 that allows the receptor to internalize. In Rab5Q79L expressing cells, m4 localization by confocal microscopy suggests that m4 is present on the MVB limiting membrane and internal vesicles within the MVB (see Fig. 5). Tfn, however, localizes selectively to the perimeter of the MVB. Because Tfn is a typical marker of the recycling pathway, m4 on the limiting membrane may be able to recycle, while m4 that localizes to the internal vesicles may be targeted for degradation. Although our study did not address the fate of the m4 receptors localized to the MVB, previous cell biological studies provide intriguing clues that MVB may segregate recycling receptors from those targeted for degradation in lysosomes. For example, the TfnR localizes to the limiting membrane of MVBs while lysosomally targeted EGFR are found within internal vesicles (29Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Miller K. Nature. 1990; 346: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike wild type EGFR, a kinase-deficient EGFR internalizes, is not degraded, and recycles to the plasma membrane. This EGFR mutant localizes selectively to the perimeter of the MVB (30Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As discussed in a recent review (31Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), controversy exists in the literature regarding the organelles responsible for sorting GPCRs from recycling pathways to lysosomal/degradative pathways. We propose that following agonist activation, GPCRs initially internalize into early sorting endosomes in common with Tfn. GPCRs and Tfn also travel to the limiting membrane of MVBs and can recycle from both early endosomes and the limiting membrane. However, GPCR and Tfn trafficking diverge, as GPCRs localize to internal vesicles of the MVBs. Similar to the EGFR, we suggest that GPCRs in internal vesicles are targeted to lysosomes for degradation. In conclusion, we show that following activation and internalization, endogenously expressed m4 traffics through an endocytic pathway in common with Tfn. The cell surface and early endosomal localization of m4 depends on Rab5 activity as mutants affecting Rab5 activity produce striking changes in m4 intracellular localization. Moreover, our results also reveal MVBs as important organelles involved in GPCR trafficking and suggest that MVBs segregate recycling GPCRs from those targeted to a nonrecycling, possibly degradative pathway. By determining the organelles through which GPCR traffic, we can begin to elucidate the mechanisms that sort them to recycling or to degradative pathways, and thus better understand how the cell controls the cellular responsiveness to ligand.

To identify whether the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) can play such a role, we performed affinity chromatography of brain extract with the nNOS PDZ domain. We identified the carboxyl-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), a phosphoprotein first identified as a binding partner to adenovirus E1A, as a nNOS binding partner. CtBP interacts with the PDZ domain of nNOS, and this interaction can be competed with peptide that binds to the PDZ peptide-binding site. In addition, binding of CtBP to nNOS is dependent on its carboxyl-terminal sequence -DX L, residues conserved between species that fit the canonical sequence for nNOS PDZ binding. Immunoprecipitation studies show that CtBP and nNOS associate in the brain. When CtBP is expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, its distribution is primarily nuclear; however, when CtBP is co-expressed with nNOS, its localization becomes more cytosolic. This change in CtBP localization does not occur when its carboxyl-terminal nNOS PDZ binding motif is mutated or when CtBP is co-expressed with postsynaptic density 95, another PDZ domain-containing protein. Taken together, our data suggest a new function for nNOS as a regulator of CtBP nuclear localization.

It is produced by the enzyme neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS), which can be stimulated when glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor family are activated, and calcium enters the neuron (2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Calcium binds to calmodulin, and the complex then activates nNOS. Furthermore, the NO produced can increase the production of 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, which can activate other enzymes including protein kinases (3Schmidt H.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 4Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recent evidence supports a role for NO in synaptic plasticity (5Son H. Hawkins R.D. Martin K. Kiebler M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Kandel E.R.

Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In neurons, nNOS is targeted to synaptic sites via its interaction with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and PSD-93 (9Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). In fact, PSD-95 also interacts withN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors via one of its PDZ domains. Through its concurrent interaction with nNOS, PSD-95 serves as a physical tether to allow nNOS signaling byN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). By abolishing expression of PSD-95 protein either by knockout technology in mice or by antisense technology in tissue culture, it has been shown that the presence of PSD-95 is essential for NO production by glutamate stimulation (12Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 13Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M.

Thus, the PDZ domain of nNOS plays an important role in helping to localize nNOS to appropriate sites in the neuron.Subcellular fractionation shows that roughly half of nNOS is soluble, and half is particulate (14Hecker M. Mulsch A. Busse R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As such, binding partners of the PDZ domain of nNOS can serve to regulate nNOS localization in the cell. In fact, it has been shown that the soluble CAPON (ca rboxy-terminal P DZ ligand of n NOS) competes with PSD-95 and PSD-93 for binding of nNOS and thus may participate in localization of nNOS to the cytoplasm (15Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphofructokinase binds to the PDZ domain of nNOS and co-localizes with nNOS in the cytosol of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus (16Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The binding of phosphofructokinase to nNOS does not alter the enzymatic activity of either phosphofructokinase or nNOS (16Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); thus, the possibility exists that the binding of these two enzymes is important for subcellular localization.Based on the fact that the PDZ domain of nNOS is important for protein localization, we tested whether other protein complexes may bind to this domain. To address this question, we performed affinity chromatography using a GST fusion protein column containing the PDZ domain of nNOS. Purification of brain lysates on the column yielded a protein of 48 kDa, which was identified as the carboxyl-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), a protein originally identified as a phosphoprotein that interacts with the adenovirus E1A protein (17Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and acts as a transcriptional co-repressor (18Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Endogenous CtBP associates with nNOS in the brain and binds to the peptide-binding site of the nNOS PDZ domain via a consensus sequence at its carboxyl terminus. At the cellular level, CtBP protein is expressed in the nucleus, whereas when CtBP is co-expressed with nNOS, it relocalizes to the cytosol. Furthermore, this translocation is dependent on nNOS binding. Taken together, these results suggest a novel function for a PDZ domain-containing protein, namely nNOS, in regulation of the localization of a transcriptional co-repressor to the cytosol.DISCUSSIONThe primary finding of this study is that nNOS associates with the transcription factor CtBP. CtBP specifically binds to the peptide-binding site in the PDZ domain of nNOS because its binding can be competed with the peptide VSPDFGDAV. The carboxyl terminus of CtBP contains a consensus sequence shown to bind to the peptide-binding site, and mutation of crucial amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of CtBP abolishes its binding to nNOS. Furthermore, CtBP and nNOS associate in vivo as evidenced by the co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS by incubation of brain extract with an antibody raised against CtBP. Most exciting is the fact that the binding of CtBP to nNOS results in the change in localization of CtBP from the nucleus to the cytosol.CtBP was originally isolated as a cellular phosphoprotein that interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the adenovirus protein E1A that negatively regulates oncogenic transformation (17Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Most work has focused on the role of CtBP as a short range repressor, although little is known about the mechanism by which CtBP acts (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CtBP can interact with a subset of transcription factors including theDrosophila Knirps (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Hairy (25Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the vertebrate CtIP (17Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 26Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor MEF2. It is thought that CtBP functions as a co-repressor protein that can recruit histone deacetylase 1 (27Sundqvist A. Sollerbrant K. Svensson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or DNA-binding proteins, which can inhibit transcription. The localization of CtBP to the cytosol by nNOS may make CtBP unavailable to interact with these nuclear proteins (i.e. histone deacetylase and transcription factors), thereby hindering the function of CtBP as a co-repressor. Perhaps, by binding CtBP, nNOS helps to maintain homeostasis of transcriptional repression and activation.In addition, CtBP has been shown to have a role in Golgi maintenance (28Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). CtBP is ribosylated by brefeldin A, and this ribosylation leads to Golgi disassembly. It is believed that this function of CtBP is independent of its function as a transcriptional co-repressor. By localizing CtBP to the cytosol, nNOS may make CtBP available to perform a cellular function independent of co-repression.Until now, reports have suggested that the PDZ domain of nNOS serves to regulate the localization of nNOS protein. Interactions with other proteins containing PDZ domains function to target nNOS to noncytosolic sites. For example, in brain, nNOS binding to PSD-95 localizes nNOS to the postsynaptic density (9Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Similarly, in skeletal muscle, association of nNOS with α1-syntrophin localizes nNOS to the sarcolemma (9Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H.

Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In contrast, proteins that contain carboxyl-terminal motifs that bind to the PDZ domain of nNOS often target nNOS to the cytosol or inhibit nNOS activity. For example, when CAPON binds to nNOS, nNOS is not targeted to postsynaptic sites in the brain; instead, it is localized to the cytosol (15Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). PIN (p rotein i nhibitor of n NOS) associates with nNOS in the cytosol and inhibits nNOS activity (30Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Dressel U. Bailey P.J. Wang S.C. Downes M. Evans R.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17007-17013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found no effect on nNOS activity when we added purified GST-CtBP to brain extract. 2B. L. Firestein, unpublished observations. Thus, we believe that the binding of CtBP to nNOS plays a role in protein localization rather than regulation of enzymatic activity, suggesting a novel role for nNOS as a targeting molecule.Recently, there have been a number of reports describing the role of PDZ domain-containing proteins in localization to the nucleus. For example, the PDZ-containing protein zona occludens-1 shuttles between tight junctions and the nucleus in epithelial cells and is thought to regulate gene expression (32Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Islas S. Contreras R.G. Garcia-Villegas M.R. Betanzos A. Vega J. Diaz-Quinonez A. Martin-Orozco N. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Cereijido M. Valdes J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When it is localized to the nucleus, the SH3 domain of zona occludens-1 binds to a nucleic acid-binding protein known as ZONAB, and together zona occludens-1 and ZONAB bind to the Erb-2 promoter and regulate Erb-2 transcription (33Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Similarly, CASK/LIN-2, a multi-PDZ-containing protein, can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus and bind to Tbr-1, a T-box transcription factor involved in brain development (34Hsueh Y.P. Wang T.F. Yang F.C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The binding of the guanylate kinase domain of CASK to Tbr-1 induces gene transcription. Thus, evidence is beginning to emerge to support a role for PDZ-containing proteins in transcription factor activity. Our data support the idea that nNOS protein is present in the nucleus; however, unlike the other PDZ proteins mentioned above, nNOS may traffic nuclear proteins to the cytosol, thereby making them inaccessible to regulate transcription. Furthermore, targeting of proteins by nNOS occurs via its PDZ domain, unlike the proteins described above, which contain PDZ domains but regulate nuclear events via other domains.There are two possible mechanisms by which nNOS may target proteins from the nucleus. Because a majority of nNOS protein is found in the cytosol, nNOS may act to “trap” nuclear proteins in the cytosol once they diffuse or are transported from the nucleus. Alternatively, nNOS may bind nuclear proteins and actively transport them from the nucleus to the cytosol. In line with this mechanism, we find some nNOS protein, although only a small amount, in the nucleus (Fig.6 A). In addition, this localized nNOS associates with CtBP in brain nuclei (Fig. 6 B). nNOS contains putative nuclear export sequences; however, treatment of cells with leptomycin B, a drug that inhibits crm-1-mediated nuclear transport, has no effect on nNOS protein localization. 3G. M. Riefler and B. L. Firestein, unpublished observations. This suggests that nNOS does not shuttle from the nucleus to cytosol by binding crm-1. Future studies will serve to identify which mechanism plays a role in the targeting of nuclear proteins by nNOS.Thus, we believe that we have found a novel function for nNOS as a regulator of nuclear protein localization. Although other forms of nitric-oxide synthase, such as endothelial and inducible nitric-oxide synthase, also produce NO, nNOS is the only isoform that contains a PDZ domain. Furthermore, nNOS is expressed at the highest levels in brain and skeletal muscle, with very little expression in other tissues (35Park C.S. Krishna G. Ahn M.S. Kang J.H. Chung W.G. Kim D.J. Hwang H.K. Lee J.N. Paik S.G. Cha Y.N. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As such, the PDZ of nNOS may play a novel role in nNOS function in these two tissues. Nitric oxide (NO)1 is a gaseous molecule that plays an important role in the central nervous system (1Christopherson K.S. Bredt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2424-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). It is produced by the enzyme neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS), which can be stimulated when glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor family are activated, and calcium enters the neuron (2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Calcium binds to calmodulin, and the complex then activates nNOS. Furthermore, the NO produced can increase the production of 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, which can activate other enzymes including protein kinases (3Schmidt H.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 4Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recent evidence supports a role for NO in synaptic plasticity (5Son H. Hawkins R.D. Martin K. Kiebler M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), long-term potentiation (6Hawkins R.D. Neuron. 1996; 16: 465-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and aspects of learning and memory (7Kendrick K.M. Guevara-Guzman R. Zorrilla J. Hinton M.R. Broad K.D. Mimmack M. Ohkura S. Nature. 1997; 388: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). nNOS contains a PDZ (P SD-95, d iscs-large and z ona occludens-1) domain, a consensus sequence of approximately 90 amino acids that has been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions (8Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In neurons, nNOS is targeted to synaptic sites via its interaction with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and PSD-93 (9Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). In fact, PSD-95 also interacts withN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors via one of its PDZ domains. Through its concurrent interaction with nNOS, PSD-95 serves as a physical tether to allow nNOS signaling byN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). By abolishing expression of PSD-95 protein either by knockout technology in mice or by antisense technology in tissue culture, it has been shown that the presence of PSD-95 is essential for NO production by glutamate stimulation (12Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 13Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Thus, the PDZ domain of nNOS plays an important role in helping to localize nNOS to appropriate sites in the neuron. Subcellular fractionation shows that roughly half of nNOS is soluble, and half is particulate (14Hecker M. Mulsch A. Busse R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As such, binding partners of the PDZ domain of nNOS can serve to regulate nNOS localization in the cell. In fact, it has been shown that the soluble CAPON (ca rboxy-terminal P DZ ligand of n NOS) competes with PSD-95 and PSD-93 for binding of nNOS and thus may participate in localization of nNOS to the cytoplasm (15Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphofructokinase binds to the PDZ domain of nNOS and co-localizes with nNOS in the cytosol of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus (16Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The binding of phosphofructokinase to nNOS does not alter the enzymatic activity of either phosphofructokinase or nNOS (16Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); thus, the possibility exists that the binding of these two enzymes is important for subcellular localization. Based on the fact that the PDZ domain of nNOS is important for protein localization, we tested whether other protein complexes may bind to this domain. To address this question, we performed affinity chromatography using a GST fusion protein column containing the PDZ domain of nNOS. Purification of brain lysates on the column yielded a protein of 48 kDa, which was identified as the carboxyl-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), a protein originally identified as a phosphoprotein that interacts with the adenovirus E1A protein (17Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and acts as a transcriptional co-repressor (18Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Endogenous CtBP associates with nNOS in the brain and binds to the peptide-binding site of the nNOS PDZ domain via a consensus sequence at its carboxyl terminus. At the cellular level, CtBP protein is expressed in the nucleus, whereas when CtBP is co-expressed with nNOS, it relocalizes to the cytosol. Furthermore, this translocation is dependent on nNOS binding. Taken together, these results suggest a novel function for a PDZ domain-containing protein, namely nNOS, in regulation of the localization of a transcriptional co-repressor to the cytosol. DISCUSSIONThe primary finding of this study is that nNOS associates with the transcription factor CtBP. CtBP specifically binds to the peptide-binding site in the PDZ domain of nNOS because its binding can be competed with the peptide VSPDFGDAV. The carboxyl terminus of CtBP contains a consensus sequence shown to bind to the peptide-binding site, and mutation of crucial amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of CtBP abolishes its binding to nNOS. Furthermore, CtBP and nNOS associate in vivo as evidenced by the co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS by incubation of brain extract with an antibody raised against CtBP. Most exciting is the fact that the binding of CtBP to nNOS results in the change in localization of CtBP from the nucleus to the cytosol.CtBP was originally isolated as a cellular phosphoprotein that interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the adenovirus protein E1A that negatively regulates oncogenic transformation (17Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Most work has focused on the role of CtBP as a short range repressor, although little is known about the mechanism by which CtBP acts (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CtBP can interact with a subset of transcription factors including theDrosophila Knirps (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Hairy (25Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the vertebrate CtIP (17Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 26Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor MEF2. It is thought that CtBP functions as a co-repressor protein that can recruit histone deacetylase 1 (27Sundqvist A. Sollerbrant K. Svensson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or DNA-binding proteins, which can inhibit transcription. The localization of CtBP to the cytosol by nNOS may make CtBP unavailable to interact with these nuclear proteins (i.e. histone deacetylase and transcription factors), thereby hindering the function of CtBP as a co-repressor. Perhaps, by binding CtBP, nNOS helps to maintain homeostasis of transcriptional repression and activation.In addition, CtBP has been shown to have a role in Golgi maintenance (28Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). CtBP is ribosylated by brefeldin A, and this ribosylation leads to Golgi disassembly. It is believed that this function of CtBP is independent of its function as a transcriptional co-repressor. By localizing CtBP to the cytosol, nNOS may make CtBP available to perform a cellular function independent of co-repression.Until now, reports have suggested that the PDZ domain of nNOS serves to regulate the localization of nNOS protein.

Interestingly, we found no effect on nNOS activity when we added purified GST-CtBP to brain extract. 2B. L. Firestein, unpublished observations. Thus, we believe that the binding of CtBP to nNOS plays a role in protein localization rather than regulation of enzymatic activity, suggesting a novel role for nNOS as a targeting molecule. Recently, there have been a number of reports describing the role of PDZ domain-containing proteins in localization to the nucleus. For example, the PDZ-containing protein zona occludens-1 shuttles between tight junctions and the nucleus in epithelial cells and is thought to regulate gene expression (32Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Islas S. Contreras R.G. Garcia-Villegas M.R. Betanzos A. Vega J. Diaz-Quinonez A. Martin-Orozco N. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Cereijido M. Valdes J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When it is localized to the nucleus, the SH3 domain of zona occludens-1 binds to a nucleic acid-binding protein known as ZONAB, and together zona occludens-1 and ZONAB bind to the Erb-2 promoter and regulate Erb-2 transcription (33Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Similarly, CASK/LIN-2, a multi-PDZ-containing protein, can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus and bind to Tbr-1, a T-box transcription factor involved in brain development (34Hsueh Y.P. Wang T.F. Yang F.C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The binding of the guanylate kinase domain of CASK to Tbr-1 induces gene transcription. Thus, evidence is beginning to emerge to support a role for PDZ-containing proteins in transcription factor activity. Our data support the idea that nNOS protein is present in the nucleus; however, unlike the other PDZ proteins mentioned above, nNOS may traffic nuclear proteins to the cytosol, thereby making them inaccessible to regulate transcription. Furthermore, targeting of proteins by nNOS occurs via its PDZ domain, unlike the proteins described above, which contain PDZ domains but regulate nuclear events via other domains. There are two possible mechanisms by which nNOS may target proteins from the nucleus. Because a majority of nNOS protein is found in the cytosol, nNOS may act to “trap” nuclear proteins in the cytosol once they diffuse or are transported from the nucleus. Alternatively, nNOS may bind nuclear proteins and actively transport them from the nucleus to the cytosol. In line with this mechanism, we find some nNOS protein, although only a small amount, in the nucleus (Fig.6 A). In addition, this localized nNOS associates with CtBP in brain nuclei (Fig. 6 B). nNOS contains putative nuclear export sequences; however, treatment of cells with leptomycin B, a drug that inhibits crm-1-mediated nuclear transport, has no effect on nNOS protein localization. 3G. M. Riefler and B. L. Firestein, unpublished observations. This suggests that nNOS does not shuttle from the nucleus to cytosol by binding crm-1. Future studies will serve to identify which mechanism plays a role in the targeting of nuclear proteins by nNOS. Thus, we believe that we have found a novel function for nNOS as a regulator of nuclear protein localization. Although other forms of nitric-oxide synthase, such as endothelial and inducible nitric-oxide synthase, also produce NO, nNOS is the only isoform that contains a PDZ domain. Furthermore, nNOS is expressed at the highest levels in brain and skeletal muscle, with very little expression in other tissues (35Park C.S. Krishna G. Ahn M.S. Kang J.H. Chung W.G. Kim D.J. Hwang H.K. Lee J.N. Paik S.G. Cha Y.N. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As such, the PDZ of nNOS may play a novel role in nNOS function in these two tissues.

Aminoglycosides were among the first antibiotics discovered and are clinically used in the treatment of severe Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. Their mechanism of action is the inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the small ribosomal subunit, and additionally, they are also capable of directly disrupting the integrity of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by displacing divalent cations bridging adjacent lipopolysaccharide molecules (1Davis B.D.

The emergence of growing numbers of resistant strains has somewhat reduced the utility of aminoglycosides in empiric therapies (5Murray B.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 163: 1185-1194Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Resistance to aminoglycosides can arise by three distinct mechanisms: (i) alteration of ribosomal RNA and small ribosomal subunit protein binding sites, (ii) decreased uptake and/or accumulation of the drug in bacteria due to changes in the permeability of the outer membrane or active efflux, and most commonly (iii) enzymatic detoxification of the drug (6Moore R.A.

Expression of genes encoding these enzymes is either by acquisition of foreign DNA (plasmid-borne) or by overexpression of a housekeeping gene with modifying activity (13Courvalin P. Carlier C. Collatz E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 541-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rather P.N. Orosz E. Shaw K.J. Hare R. Miller G. J.

Aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases (AACs)1 use acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as the acetyl group donor and are grouped into four classes: AAC(1), AAC(2′), AAC(3), and AAC(6′) based on the site of their regioselective acetylation of the aminoglycoside. Members of the AAC(6′) class are the most common in nature, and there have been several kinetic and mechanistic studies reported on them (16Radhika K. Northop D.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5118-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Radhika K. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 258: 12543-12546Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18Wright G.D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The only other enzyme subjected to a rigorous kinetic analysis has been gentamicin acetyltransferase, AAC(3)-I (20Williams J.W. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 17: 5908-5914Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Williams J.W. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 17: 5902-5907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). AAC(2′) is another class of aminoglycosideN-acetyltransferases with more restricted occurrence in bacteria. All aac(2′) genes reported so far are chromosomally encoded and have been shown to be universally present in all mycobacteria (22Ainsa J.A. Perez E. Pelicic V. Berthet F. Gicquel B. Martin C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The AAC(2′)-Ia from Providencia stuartii has been implicated in O-acetylation of peptidoglycan (23Payie K.G. Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the physiological role of the mycobacterial enzymes is not clearly understood. The aac(2′)-Ib fromMycobacterium fortuitum has been cloned inMycobacterium smegmatis but was neither expressed, purified, nor subjected to kinetic analysis. The P. stuartiiAAC(2′)-Ia has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and a preliminary kinetic characterization has very recently been reported (24Franklin K. Clarke A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). None of the aac(2′) genes appear to be responsible for clinical resistance of aminoglycoside antibiotics, and interactions between the 2′-substituent of clinically effective aminoglycosides (-OH or -NH2) and the ribosomal site of action are not known and may differ among aminoglycoside structural classes. In the present paper we report the cloning, overexpression, purification, substrate specificity, kinetic mechanism, and solvent kinetic isotope effects of AAC(2′)-Ic from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All chemicals, coenzyme A derivatives, and aminoglycoside antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Enzymes used in molecular biology studies were supplied by New England Biolabs or Promega. DNA purification kits and plasmid pET-23a(+) were from Novagen. E. coli strains XL10-Gold and BL21(DE3) were obtained from Stratagene. The open reading frame of the aac(2′)-Ic gene (GenBankTMaccession no. U72714) was amplified from M. tuberculosisH37Rv genomic DNA by standard PCR techniques using the oligonucleotides AS1 (5′-ATTCCATATGCACA CCCAGGTACACACGG-3′) and AA1 (5′-GCGGAATTCTTACCAGACGTCGCCCGC-3′) containing the underlined NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites shown, respectively. The PCR fragment was cloned into pET-23a(+) and expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). For shake flask growth, 1 liter of Luria broth medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) was inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C. The culture was grown to midlog phase (A 600 ∼ 1.0), cooled to 20 °C for 15 min, induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl thio-β-d- galactosidase, and further incubated for 8–10 h at 20 °C. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and resuspended in buffer A (25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), lysozyme (0.2 μg/ml), and DNase I (1 μg/ml) and stirred for 20 min. The cells were then lysed by passage through a French press (1200 p.s.i.), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 40 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.85 m. The mixture was stirred for 1 h and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant was further treated with solid ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 1.6m. After stirring for 2 h, the pellet, separated by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm, was resuspended in buffer B (25 mm triethanolamine containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5m (NH4)2SO4). After extensive dialysis, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 10 min. The clear supernatant was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0.5–0m ammonium sulfate gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, solid ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the solution was rechromatographed on phenyl-Sepharose as above. The enzyme after this step was found to be >90% pure as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme preparation was stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C for long term storage and retained full activity for 8–10 months. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Commercial kanamycin A containing small amounts of kanamycin B (5%) was purified as follows. Kanamycin A (500 mg) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was loaded onto a CM-Sephadex column (5 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer followed by a linear 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient. Bound antibiotic eluted as two peaks at ∼0.4 and 0.55 m NaCl (Authentic Kanamycin B sulfate eluted as a single peak at 0.6m NaCl under these conditions.). Kanamycin A-containing fractions, eluting at 0.4 m NaCl, were detected and quantitated using a phenol-sulfuric acid method, concentrated by lyophilization, desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.5 × 50 cm) using Milli-Q water, and used in kinetic studies. Reaction rates were measured spectrophotometrically by following the increase in absorbance at 324 nm due to the reaction between the free sulfhydryl group of CoASH, generated by the enzyme-catalyzed aminoglycoside acylating activity, and 4,4′-dithiopyridine. The reaction was monitored continuously on a UVIKON 943 spectrophotometer, and enzyme activities were calculated using a molar absorption coefficient of 19,800m−1 cm−1. Assay mixtures contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm 4,4′-dithiopyridine, in addition to substrates or inhibitors in a volume of 1 ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and followed at 30 °C for 1–2 min. Initial velocity kinetic data were fitted using the programs of Cleland (25Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Equation 1 was used to fit simple substrate saturation kinetics, where the concentration of one substrate was varied at a fixed, saturating (>20 × K m) concentration of the other substrate. Equation 2 was used to fit initial velocity patterns, where the concentrations of both substrates were varied. Equations 3 and 4were used to fit competitive and noncompetitive inhibition data, respectively. v=V/(Ka+A)Equation 1 v=VAB/(KaB+KbA+KiaKb+AB)Equation 2 v=VA/[Ka(1+I/Kis)+A]Equation 3 v=VA/[Ka(1+I/Kis)+A(1+I/Kii)]Equation 4 In Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, v is the measured reaction velocity, V is the maximal velocity, A andB are the concentrations of substrates (aminoglycoside and acyl-CoA), K a and K b are the corresponding Michaelis-Menten constants, Kia is the inhibition constant for substrate A, I is the concentration of the inhibitor, and Kis andKii are the slope and intercept inhibition constant for the inhibitor, respectively. Equation 5 was used to fit kinetic plots in which “substrate activation” was apparent from Lineweaver-Burk plots, where A is the concentration of the variable substrate. The constants B, C, andD are collections of rate constants that depend on the kinetic mechanism and the resulting rate equation (for model and rate equation, see Ref. 19Magnet S. Lambert T.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).v=V(A2+DA)/(A2+BA+C)Equation 5 The solvent kinetic isotope effects on V andV/K were determined by measuring the initial velocities using saturating concentrations of acyl-CoA and varying concentrations of aminoglycoside in H2O or ∼98% D2O as solvent. Solvent deuterium isotope effects were calculated from the equation:v=VA/[Ka(1+IEV/K)+A(1+IEV)Equation 6 where, I represents the fraction of isotope, andEVK and EV are isotope effects on V/K and V − 1, respectively. PCR amplification of the aac(2′)-Ic gene using primers AS1 and AA1 and theM. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA template yielded a single fragment of the expected length. Cloning and overexpression of the PCR product resulted in an expressed protein product with an apparent molecular weight, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in agreement with the weight of 20,038 deduced from the nucleotide sequence. DNA sequencing of the cloned fragment confirmed the absence of any mutations introduced during PCR amplification. The two-step purification procedure yielded greater than 90% pure protein. Recombinant AAC(2′)-Ic was stable in the presence of 0.45 m ammonium sulfate and catalyzed aminoglycoside acyltransferase activity in vitro. Any attempt to remove ammonium sulfate resulted in the precipitation of the protein, and expression of the enzyme with either N- or C-terminal His6affinity tags yielded insoluble protein products. Initial velocities were determined spectrophotometrically, at pH 7.0, at 8–12 different concentrations of each substrate. The data were plotted as double-reciprocal plots and fitted using the programs of Cleland (25Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) as well as by nonlinear, least square curve fitting using Sigmaplot (version 3.0). Kinetic constants for acetyl-CoA and other CoA derivatives, determined at a saturating concentration of sisomicin, are presented in Table I. The steady-state kinetic parameters for various aminoglycosides (Scheme FS1) at saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA are also summarized in Table I. The structures of the aminoglycosides used are shown in Fig.1. Aminoglycoside substrates can be divided into two groups on the basis of their kinetic behavior. Seven of 13 antibiotics, using acetyl-CoA (8 of 10 using propionyl-CoA) as the second substrate, exhibited linear reciprocal plots at low substrate concentrations but rapidly increasing velocities at higher antibiotic concentrations (Fig. 2). This phenomenon, termed substrate activation, has previously been observed with other aminoglycoside acetyltransferases (19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Williams J.W. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 17: 5902-5907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For substrates exhibiting substrate activation, two pairs of fitted parameters are included in Table I. V 2 was 1.5–6 times higher than V 1, K 2 was 6–1500 times higher than K 1, andV/K 1 was 3–300 times higher thanV/K 2 at saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA, while these same parameters were 2–8, 20–140, and 25–70 times higher, respectively, at saturating concentrations of propionyl-CoA. The enzyme did not exhibit any activity with lividomycin A, kanamycin A, and amikacin when propionyl-CoA was the acyl donor. Amikacin and kanamycin A, both of which contained 2′-hydroxyl substituents, were extremely poor, but bona fide, acetyltransferase substrates for the AAC(2′)-Ic enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters for coenzyme A derivatives and aminoglycosidesSubstrateK mk catV/KK m 1-aValues at high substrate concentrations.k cat1-aValues at high substrate concentrations.1-bSum of velocities at low and high concentrations.V/Kμmmin −110 5μmmin −110 5A Acetyl-CoA1-cMeasured at 5-cm path length.0.8 ± 0.1220 ± 102750 n-Propionyl-CoA3.0 ± 0.318 ± 0.460 Malonyl-CoA120 ± 18155 ± 813 Me-malonyl-CoA74 ± 1113 ± 0.61.8 n-Hexanoyl-CoA75 ± 63.9 ± 0.080.52 n-Butyryl-CoA188 ± 263.3 ± 0.020.18 Isovaleryl-CoA275 ± 243.8 ± 0.020.13 Gluteryl-CoANA Acetoacetyl-CoANAB Sisomicin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.3.4 ± 0.3258 ± 6.37601450 ± 1380330 ± 242.3 Netilmicin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.9.8 ± 0.6454 ± 9.54631780 ± 995625 ± 333.5 Tobramycin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.2.5 ± 0.591 ± 43643730 ± 790140 ± 140.4 Ribostamycin2.5 ± 0.369 ± 1.1276 Kanamycin B1.4 ± 0.0532 ± 0.3229 Gentamicin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.22 ± 0.7364 ± 4.61653230 ± 1530505 ± 311.6 Dibekacin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.22 ± 3.9354 ± 31161940 ± 420650 ± 467.0 Neomycin B19 ± 2120 ± 363 Paromomycin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.86 ± 18144 ± 19173050 ± 1150380 ± 471.2 Butirosin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.29 ± 1141 ± 7.2141530 ± 300250 ± 101.6 Lividomycin A1600 ± 96186 ± 51.2 Kanamycin A320 ± 2915.2 ± 0.40.48 Amikacin968 ± 1487.8 ± 1.20.08C Ribostamycin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.8.3 ± 1.89.5 ± 0.811.4390 ± 4035 ± 1.40.90 Kanamycin B1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.16 ± 2.79 ± 0.65.62310 ± 81017 ± 2.20.07 Neomycin B1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.16 ± 3.37.0 ± 1.64.4310 ± 11018 ± 2.40.57 Sisomicin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.39 ± 9.016 ± 1.94.12270 ± 83057 ± 4.60.25 Tobramycin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.20 ± 4.77.8 ± 1.23.91360 ± 31042 ± 2.90.31 Netilmicin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.46 ± 8.717 ± 1.73.71870 ± 38064 ± 3.90.34 Dibekacin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.43 ± 1211 ± 1.52.61980 ± 60042 ± 2.50.21 Gentamicin1-dSubstrate exhibiting substrate activation.21 ± 124.2 ± 0.82.0610 ± 19034 ± 2.10.56 Butirosin429 ± 5411 ± 0.50.25 Paromomycin498 ± 4312 ± 0.30.24 Lividomycin ANA Kanamycin ANA AmikacinNAValues in A were determined at a fixed, saturating concentration of sisomicin.

The initial velocity pattern was determined using sisomicin and acetyl-CoA at five different concentrations of acetyl-CoA and four different concentrations of sisomicin. The resultant double-reciprocal plot was intersecting (data not shown), indicating a sequential kinetic mechanism. Alternative aminoglycoside kinetics were determined using propionyl-CoA as the variable substrate at fixed, saturating concentrations of eight different aminoglycosides (Table II). The values of V/Kfor propionyl-CoA varied modestly (over a 7-fold range) with this change being the result of changes in both V andK m values for propionyl-CoA. Alternate acyl coenzyme A kinetics were determined using sisomicin as the variable substrate at a fixed, saturating concentrations of five different coenzyme A derivatives (Table II). The values of V/K for sisomicin varied over a 2500-fold range with this change being the result of changes in both V and K values for sisomicin (Table II). Dead-end inhibition experiments were carried out using desulfocoenzyme A versus either acetyl-CoA or sisomicin. Desulfocoenzyme A exhibited linear, competitive inhibitionversus acetyl-CoA and linear, noncompetitive inhibitionversus sisomicin (data not shown).Table IIAlternate substrate kinetic parametersK mk catV/K propionyl-CoAμmmin −110 5A Tobramycin1.34 ± 0.1130.4 ± 0.523 Kanamycin B0.71 ± 0.038.91 ± 0.113 Ribostamycin2.73 ± 0.1123.4 ± 0.28.6 Dibekacin8.02 ± 0.8454.2 ± 1.66.8 Netilmicin4.40 ± 0.4128.9 ± 0.76.6 Neomycin B2.33 ± 0.1114.5 ± 0.26.2 Sisomicin3.01 ± 0.3517.6 ± 0.45.9 Gentamicin5.68 ± 0.9219.0 ± 0.73.3K mk catV/K sisomicinμmmin −110 5B Acetyl-CoA3.4 ± 0.3258 ± 6.3760 Malonyl-CoA8.7 ± 1.087 ± 2.5100 Propionyl-CoA39 ± 9.016 ± 1.94.1 Me-malonyl-CoA51 ± 1114 ± 1.02.8 n-Hexanoyl-CoA175 ± 125.9 ± 0.10.3Kinetic parameters for propionyl-CoA at fixed, saturating concentrations of the indicated aminoglycosides (A) and sisomicin at fixed, saturating concentration of the indicated coenzyme A derivatives (B). Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters for propionyl-CoA at fixed, saturating concentrations of the indicated aminoglycosides (A) and sisomicin at fixed, saturating concentration of the indicated coenzyme A derivatives (B). Solvent kinetic isotope effects on acyl transfer were determined by measuring initial velocities at pH 7.0 in both H2O and 98% D2O. Reactions were performed at fixed, saturating concentrations of either acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA and at varying aminoglycoside concentrations. Two different aminoglycosides, ribostamycin and paromomycin, exhibiting relatively low and high K m values, respectively, using both acyl coenzymes A were used. The solvent kinetic isotope effects on V were 1.7 ± 0.02 and 2.1 ± 0.08 for ribostamycin and paromomycin, respectively, when acetyl-CoA was the acyl donor (Fig.3). A value forD2O V of 1.49 ± 0.05 was obtained using paromomycin and propionyl-CoA, and a value forD2O V of 1.66 ± 0.09 was obtained using only the high concentration ribostamycin data and propionyl-CoA (Fig. 2). The solvent kinetic isotope effects on V/K were identical for paromomycin using either acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA (0.98 ± 0.1 and 1.03 ± 0.1, respectively) and for ribostamycin using acetyl-CoA (1.15 ± 0.07). Using just the data obtained using propionyl-CoA at low ribostamycin concentrations (5–100 μm), the V and V/K solvent kinetic isotope effects were 1.5 ± 0.1 and 1.5 ± 0.2, respectively (Fig. 3). The latter is significantly greater than one, the value for the V/K solvent kinetic isotope effect observed in all other cases. From the determined steady-state kinetic parameters (Table I), particularly the relative V/K values, acetyl-CoA was the strongly preferred acyl donor. The M. tuberculosisAAC(2′)-Ic exhibited a comparable k cat value but a 10-fold lower K m value for acetyl-CoA compared with the AAC(2′)-Ia from P. stuartii (24Franklin K. Clarke A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Propionyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA exhibited significant acyl transferase activity, while other coenzyme A derivatives were either extremely poor substrates or did not demonstrate any activity. The drastic decrease in theV/K value observed by the addition of a methylene group to acetyl-CoA (propionyl-CoA) is primarily a k cateffect, whereas the decrease observed by the addition of a carboxyl group to acetyl-CoA (malonyl-CoA) is primarily a K m effect. Methylmalonyl-CoA, having both an additional methylene and carboxyl group, exhibited an intermediate K m value but a low k cat value, and acetoacetyl-CoA did not have any measurable acyl transfer activity. This acyl donor selectivity and differential affinity for CoA derivatives suggest a rigid, sterically restricted acyl coenzyme binding site that influences both binding and catalysis. Such severe acyl donor selectivity has also been reported for the AAC(6′) from Salmonella enterica (19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in contrast to the AAC(6′) enzymes from E. coli andEnterococcus faecium (16Radhika K. Northop D.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5118-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Wright G.D. Ladak P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 956-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AAC(2′)-Ic exhibits a very broad specificity with respect to aminoglycosides. All aminoglycosides having a 2′-amino substituent were substrates. Kanamycin A and amikacin (a semisynthetic derivative of kanamycin A) contain hydroxyl groups at the 2′ position but exhibited measurable activity, consistent with the unique ability of the enzyme to perform both O- and N-acyl transfer to the 2′ position. The substrate specificity, as evaluated by the V/Kvalues of substrates, varied over a 1000-fold range, much higher than reported for AAC(2′)-Ia. Among the 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides, ribostamycin was the most efficient substrate, whereas itsN 1-derivative, butirosin, exhibited 20- and 45-fold lower V/K values using acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, respectively, as the acyl donors. Paromomycin having a 6′-hydroxyl substituent compared with neomycin B exhibited a 4-fold lowerV/K value for acetylation (18-fold lower for propionylation) than neomycin B, indicating the importance of the 6′-amino group in substrate recognition. Lividomycin A, the largest aminoglycoside with a 6′-hydroxyl substituent, exhibited 50-fold lower specificity for acetylation than Neomycin B and was the poorest 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside substrate examined. 4,6-Disubstituted aminoglycosides were generally better substrates for AAC(2′)-Ic. Sisomicin was a better substrate than itsN 1-ethyl derivative, netilmicin, at low substrate concentrations, whereas netilmicin exhibited stronger substrate activation. In contrast to ribostamycin and butirosin, sisomicin and netilmicin exhibited identical specificity for propionylation and only slightly lowered (1.6-fold) V/Kvalues. These data suggest that either the amino group at the N1 position may not be crucial for substrate recognition or that the relatively smaller ethyl substituent at the N1 position of netilmicin does not cause as much steric hindrance compared with the bulkyN 1-hydroxybutyramide moiety of butirosin. Tobramycin and kanamycin B (identical except that the former lacks a 3′-hydroxyl group) had comparable K m values, but the additional removal of the 4′-hydroxyl group, as in dibekacin, resulted in a 10-fold increase in the K m value, implying a role for the 4′-hydroxyl in substrate recognition. Dibekacin and gentamicin (a mixture of C1, C1a, and C2 used in this study), which have similar substitution patterns on the 6-deoxy-6-aminopyranose (primed) and central aminocyclitol (deoxystreptamine) rings but differ with respect to substitution around the 6“-ring, displayed identical kinetic parameters for acetylation. In contrast to the reported aminoglycoside specificity of the P. stuartii AAC(2′)-Ia, the M. tuberculosis AAC(2′)-Ic exhibits a much larger difference in the kinetic parameters for aminoglycoside substrates. While we observe differences in V/K values of almost 1000-fold using acetyl-CoA as the acyl donor, differences of only 10-fold were observed for the 2′-N-acetyltransferase from Providencia. Some of this difference can be attributed to the larger number of aminoglycosides tested in the current study, including the poor 2′-hydroxyl-substituted substrates, kanamycin A and amikacin. However, the direct comparison between the specificity exhibited between the two enzymes for the same substrate reveals some interesting differences. For example, gentamicin is a 4-fold better substrate for the AAC(2′)-Ia enzyme than netilmicin, while netilmicin is a 3-fold better substrate than gentamicin for the AAC(2′)-Ic enzyme. Butirosin exhibits the sameV/K value as kanamycin B for the AAC(2′)-Ia enzyme but a 16-fold lower V/K value than kanamycin B for the AAC(2′)-Ic enzyme. Despite the complex substrate specificity of both the AAC(2′)-Ic and AAC(2′)-Ia enzymes, the data suggest that the most important determinants of substrate recognition are present on the primed 6-deoxy-6-aminopyranosyl ring, where acetylation occurs, as previously suggested for AAC(2′)-Ia (24Franklin K. Clarke A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Many of the aminoglycosides exhibited nonlinear double-reciprocal plots, referred to as substrate activation, which have also been observed for AAC(6′)-Iy from S. enterica (19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and gentamicin acetyltransferase (21Williams J.W. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 17: 5902-5907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Kanamycin B, neomycin B, and ribostamycin did not show any substrate activation for acetylation but did for propionylation, whereas paromomycin and butirosin did not exhibit substrate activation upon propionylation but did for acetylation. None of the acyl-CoAs displayed substrate activation. There was no single structural feature or substitution that distinguishes between linear and nonlinear behavior of aminoglycoside substrates. Such aminoglycoside-dependent shifts from linear to nonlinear kinetics have been proposed to be the result of changes in kinetic mechanism (21Williams J.W. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 17: 5902-5907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) or to substrate-dependent subunit interactions in a dimeric enzyme (19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The intersecting initial velocity plots obtained for sisomicin and acetyl-CoA suggests a sequential kinetic mechanism where both substrates must be bound to the enzyme for catalysis to occur. The sequential kinetic mechanism appears to be universally used by aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases of all classes studied to date (3, 2′, and 6′), although there is no reason, a priori, why a ping-pong kinetic mechanism could not be used. Dead-end inhibition studies were performed to distinguish between the ordered and random addition of substrates. Desulfo-CoA exhibited linear, competitive inhibition versus acetyl-CoA and linear, noncompetitive inhibition versus sisomicin. These data are compatible with the ordered addition of acetyl-CoA followed by sisomicin. Alternate aminoglycoside kinetics is another useful approach to discriminate between various kinetic mechanisms and has been used earlier to determine the kinetic mechanisms of kanamycin 6′-N-acetyltransferase and AAC(6′)-Iy (17Radhika K. Northop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 258: 12543-12546Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We determined the V/K value of propionyl-CoA at saturating concentrations of eight different aminoglycoside substrates. The determined values of V/K depend on the identity of aminoglycoside used with the range of values varying some 7-fold. TheV/K value for sisomicin was highly dependent on the identity of the acyl-CoA substrate used with the range varying over 2000-fold. For an ordered sequential mechanism, the V/K value of the first substrate to bind should not be influenced by the identity of the second substrate, but the V/K value of the second substrate to bind will be substantially influenced by the identity of the first substrate. In the present case, there is only a modest effect on theV/K value of propionyl-CoA on the identity of the aminoglycoside substrate and a much larger effect on the V/Kvalue for sisomicin on the identity of the acyl-CoA substrate. This suggests that the acyl-CoA preferentially binds to the free enzyme in agreement with the dead-end inhibition data. However, the modest change in the V/K value of propionyl-CoA with aminoglycoside identity requires that there be a degree of randomness in substrate binding with aminoglycoside substrates being able to bind to both enzyme-acyl-CoA and free enzyme. The independent evaluation of aminoglycoside binding to the free enzyme is being pursued. Studies of solvent kinetic isotope effects can be a useful tool in the determination of rate-limiting chemical steps and the kinetic mechanism, especially to distinguish between steady-state random and rapid equilibrium random mechanisms. In a rapid equilibrium random kinetic mechanism, the rates of substrate binding and product dissociation are very fast relative to the catalytic step, and equivalent isotope effects must be observed on V andV/K. This is not a requirement for the steady-state random mechanism. Solvent kinetic isotope effects were determined at pH 7.0, a region where small changes in pH(pD) did not have any effect on kinetic parameters (data not shown). Solvent kinetic effects were measured for ribostamycin and paromomycin (Fig. 3) at fixed, saturating concentrations of either acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA. The unitary values of the solvent kinetic isotope effects on V/K suggest that both ribostamycin and paromomycin are kinetically “sticky” and that no slow, solvent isotopically sensitive step occurs between aminoglycoside binding and the first irreversible step, generally assumed to be the release of first product. The only conditions in which the V/K solvent kinetic isotope effect was statistically greater than 1.0 were using ribostamycin at low concentrations and propionyl-CoA. We are presently examining other substrate pairs to see whether this is unique to this substrate pair or a general phenomenon that might have diagnostic utility. The larger values of the solvent kinetic isotope effects on V must reflect the effects of solvent isotopic substitution on the release of the second product or the conformational changes that allow this to occur. The solvent kinetic isotope effects observed for the AAC(2′)-Ic (1.5–2.1) may be compared with the much smaller effects of 1.3 reported for the S. enterica AAC(6′)-Iy (19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The AAC(2′) family of aminoglycoside acetyltransferases uniquely exhibit the catalytic ability to perform either N-acetyl orO-acetyl transfer to various substrates. In the present study, we have established that the homogeneous M. tuberculosis AAC(2′)-Ic can use both kanamycin A and amikacin as substrates, thus demonstrating the first example of O-acetyl transfer to aminoglycosides by an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. In contrast, in the case of the well studied 6′-N-acetyltransferases, all aminoglycosides bearing 6′-hydroxyl substituents are inhibitors and exhibit no detectable activity (18Wright G.D. Ladak P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 956-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Magnet S. Lambert T. Courvalin P. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3700-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the case of the related P. stuartiiAAC(2′)-Ia enzyme, the enzyme has been shown to perform theO-acetylation of peptidoglycan intermediates (23Payie K.G. Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and very recently, the overexpressed and homogeneous enzyme has been shown to be capable of acetylation of aminoglycosides; however, aminoglycosides bearing a 2′-hydroxyl substituent, e.g. kanamycin A and amikacin, were not tested in this study (24Franklin K. Clarke A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a physiological role in peptidoglycan acetylation for theProvidencia enzyme and by extension to the M. tuberculosis enzyme. In support of this idea, clinical resistance to aminoglycosides in M. tuberculosis has been shown to be due to single base substitutions in the 16 S rRNA gene or the gene encoding the S12 ribosomal protein, resulting in single amino acid substitutions (26Blanchard J.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Finally, aac(2′) genes are universally present in mycobacterial species, and the deduced amino acid sequences are highly homologous (63–79%), yet their presence does not correlate with resistance to aminoglycosides (22Ainsa J.A. Perez E. Pelicic V. Berthet F. Gicquel B. Martin C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the theory that AAC(2′) gene products have a yet unidentified physiological role, and aminoglycoside acetylation is only a fortuitous secondary activity. Studies to determine the true substrate or substrates for the M. tuberculosis enzyme are being pursued."

MLK3 has also been implicated as an IκB kinase kinase in the activation of NF-κB. Amino-terminal to its catalytic domain, MLK3 contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. SH3 domains harbor three highly conserved aromatic amino acids that are important for ligand binding. In this study, we mutated one of these corresponding residues within MLK3 to deliberately disrupt the function of its SH3 domain.

We report herein that the SH3 domain of MLK3 interacts with full-length MLK3, and we have mapped the site of interaction to a region between the zipper and the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif. Interestingly, the SH3-binding region contains not a proline-rich sequence but, rather, a single proline residue. Mutation of this sole proline abrogates SH3 binding and increases MLK3 catalytic activity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MLK3 is autoinhibited through its SH3 domain.

Therefore protein kinases and phosphatases should be highly regulated enzymes. Physical interactions with other signaling molecules can modulate protein kinase activity by changing subcellular location, autophosphorylation state, or conformation of a protein kinase. In the absence of intermolecular associations, many kinases are kept in an inhibited state that is maintained by intramolecular interactions.

Recent evidence suggests that IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IKKβ are also substrates of MLK3, and that MLK3 acts as an IKK kinase to activate the NF-κB pathway in response to T cell receptor costimulation (4Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O. Wing-Lan Leung I. Lassam N. Scheidereit C. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2556-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). MLK3 contains several domains that are predicted to mediate protein-protein interactions including an SH3 domain, a leucine zipper, and a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif (Fig.1). The small GTPase Cdc42, in its activated state, binds to MLK3 through the centrally located CRIB motif, and increases MLK3 catalytic activity (5Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol.

This activation is accompanied by a change in the phosphopeptide map pattern of in vivo labeled MLK3, suggesting that Cdc42 binding induces activating phosphorylation event(s) on MLK3 (7Bock B.C.

A leucine zipper that resides NH2-terminal to the CRIB motif is necessary for MLK3 homo-oligomerization (8Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Work in our laboratory has shown that zipper-mediated oligomerization is not required for MLK3 activation by Cdc42, but instead is critical for proper interaction and phosphorylation of a downstream target, MKK4, and subsequent JNK activation (9Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of MLK3 contains an SH3 domain. SH3 domains are independently folding modules of about 60 amino acids. Although different SH3 domains have distinct ligand preferences (10Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the consensus binding site is composed of a short proline-rich sequence, often Pro-Xxx-Xxx-Pro preceded or followed by basic amino acids (11Ren R.

The SH3 domain of MLK3 has been shown to interact with a proline-rich region in hematopoietic progenitor protein kinase-1 (15Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but an effect on MLK3 activity has not been demonstrated. Since MLK3 contains a large proline-rich COOH-terminal region (Fig. 1), we were interested in the possibility that the SH3 domain of MLK3 might bind to this region in an autoregulatory fashion. In the work presented here, we show that the SH3 domain of MLK3 does indeed play a critical role in autoregulation. However, unexpectedly, the SH3 domain binds to a region between the zipper and CRIB motifs that lacks a classical SH3-binding site. Point mutations, either in the SH3 domain or in the newly identified SH3-binding site of MLK3, which disrupt this interaction, result in increased MLK3 activity. The data presented here indicate that the catalytic activity of MLK3 is negatively regulated by its SH3 domain. This is the first demonstration of SH3-mediated autoinhibition of a serine/threonine kinase. Construction of the cytomegalovirus-based expression vectors carrying the cDNAs for wild type MLK3 (pRK5-NFlag.mlk3), MLK3 L410P, and MLK3 Δ430–486 has been described elsewhere (7Bock B.C.

A series of truncation variants of MLK3 were generated by 15 cycles of amplification of pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 using the polymerase chain reaction withPfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The same 5′ oligonucleotide was used for the construction of a series of variants with successive COOH-terminal deletions: 5′-GCATTAGCT- AGCACCATGGACTACAAG-3′. The following oligonucleotides were used as 3′ primers: pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 1–635, 5′-CGTTAAGGATCCTCAAGAGCTGCTACCGCG-3′; pRK5-NFlag.mlk31–598, 5′-CGTTAAGGATCCTCAGGATGAGTCATCTGA-3′; pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 1–529, 5′-CGTTAAGGATCCTCACCGGGGAAAGGTGGG-3′; pRK5-NFlag.mlk31–485: 5′-CGTTAAGGATCCTCACGCCCGGAGCTTGCT-3′; pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 1–386, 5′-CGTTAAGGATCCTCATTCCCGTAGGACCTG-3′.

For the construction of the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MLK3 variants, the following oligonucleotides were used in the polymerase chain reaction reactions with pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 as the template; pCGN-HA.mlk3 1–114, 5′-CGTTAGTCTAGAATGGAGCCCTTGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGATCCTCAGAAGCTGGCCACCTCGC-3′; pCGN-HA.mlk3115–399, 5′-CGTTAGTCTAGACAGGAGCTGCGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGATCCTCACCAGCCTTCCTGCATGG-3′; pCGN-HA.mlk3400–591, 5′-CGTTAGTCTAGAAAGCGCGAGATCCAGGG-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGATCCTCAGTACCATGTGGCTTCG-3′; pCGN-HA.mlk3592–847, 5′-CGAATGTCTAGACTGGATTCAGATGACTC-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGATCCTCAAGGCCCCGCTTCCGGC-3′. The amplified mlk3fragments were subcloned in-frame with the HA coding sequence into the pCGN mammalian expression vector (16Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using XbaI andBamHI. Variants of MLK3 containing point mutations were constructed using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) with pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 as the template DNA using Pfxpolymerase (Invitrogen) and 15 cycles of amplification. The following oligonucleotides, and their reverse complements, were used as mutagenesis primers: pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 Y52A, 5′-GGACAGCCCTGTTCGACGCCGAGCCCAGTGG-3′; pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 P469A, 5′-GTGGACCGCGAGCGAGCGCACGTGC-3′. The presence of the appropriate mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MSU DNA Sequencing Facility). A glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector (pGEM-2T-SH3) carrying the cDNA encoding the SH3 domain of MLK3 (amino acids 43–104) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification of the corresponding coding sequence from pRK5-mlk3 followed by subcloning into the pGEM-2T vector. The Y52A mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of pGEM-2T-SH3 using the same oligonucleotides that were used to construct pRK5-NFlag.mlk3 Y52A. GST and GST fusion proteins (GST-SH3 and GST-SH3 Y52A) were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Phamacia Biotech). Eluted fractions containing the GST fusion protein, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and concentrated to about 1 mg/ml using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). Human fetal kidney 293 cells were cultured on 100-mm dishes and transfected using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (7Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 16 h after transfection, and lysed by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm Na4PPi, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 units/ml aprotinin) as described previously (7Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the proteins of interest were prebound to protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at room temperature: MLK3 antiserum (0.25 μg/μl slurry) and M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) directed against the Flag epitope (0.45 μg/μl slurry). For the GST pull-down experiment, the GST fusion proteins were preincubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin for 30 min. Clarified lysate (400 μl) was incubated with 20 μl of antibody-bound Protein A-agarose or with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin prebound with 5 μg of GST fusion protein for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates and GST pull-downs were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates used for kinase assays were washed three times with HNTG buffer containing 1 m LiCl, three times with HNTG buffer, and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). Proteins from lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted using MLK3 antiserum (1 μg/ml), M2 Flag monoclonal antibody (9 μg/ml), or HA antibody (BAbCO) (5 μg/ml), followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Western blots were developed by the chemiluminescence method. Multiple exposures of the Western blots were developed, and densitometry (NIH Image) of unsaturated films was used to determine relative expression levels. Kinase assays were performed in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Science), 10 μg of mixed histones (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the reactions were carried out for either 15 or 30 min at room temperature as previously described (7Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following the kinase assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and the incorporation of radioactivity into the kinase or substrates was determined by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Sequence and structural analyses of SH3 domains reveal three highly conserved aromatic amino acids that participate in ligand binding (18Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Replacement of any one of these conserved residues with alanine in the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Sem-5/Grb2 abolishes binding to its proline-rich targets (18Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The corresponding conserved residues in the SH3 domain of MLK3 are Tyr52, Trp83, and Tyr99. To deliberately disrupt the function of the SH3 domain of MLK3, site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute the tyrosine residue at position 52 with an alanine residue. The catalytic activity of this SH3 mutant, MLK3 Y52A, was compared with that of wild type MLK3. Cells transiently expressing MLK3 or MLK3 Y52A were lysed, the MLK3 variants were immunoprecipitated, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using histones as an exogenous substrate. Data from a representative experiment are shown in Fig.2. Based on three independent experiments, MLK3 Y52A exhibits a 2-fold increase in autophosphorylation activity and a 2.5-fold increase in histone phosphorylation activity when compared with wild type MLK3. These data suggest that the catalytic activity of MLK3 is negatively regulated by its functional SH3 domain. The finding that a disruptive mutation in its SH3 domain increases MLK3 activity, coupled with the fact that MLK3 contains nine potential SH3 binding sequences (Pro-Xxx-Xxx-Pro) in its COOH-terminal 220 amino acids, led us to investigate whether the SH3 domain may bind to MLK3 itself. The SH3 domain of MLK3 (amino acids 43–104) was expressed as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli and purified. The ability of MLK3 to interact with its SH3 domain in an intermolecular fashion was assessed in GST pull down experiments. As shown in Fig.3, both wild type MLK3 and MLK3 Y52A associate with GST-SH3 but not with GST. The observation that wild type MLK3 associates with GST-SH3 to a lesser extent than does MLK3 Y52A suggests that an SH3-mediated intramolecular interaction within wild type MLK3 competes with the intermolecular binding of GST-SH3. Variants with progressive deletions from the COOH terminus of MLK3 were constructed with an NH2-terminal Flag tag, expressed, and tested for their ability to associate with GST-SH3. MLK3-(1–635) and MLK3-(1–598) lack the Pro/Ser/Thr-rich region; MLK3-(1–529) ends 23 amino acids after the CRIB motif; MLK3-(1–485) terminates just after the zipper motif; and MLK3-(1–386) contains the NH2terminus through the kinase domain. All variants expressed at similar levels in 293 cells (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel). To create a more appropriate negative control for the GST pull down experiment, the Tyr residue in GST-SH3 that corresponds to Tyr52 in MLK3 was replaced with Ala, thus giving rise to GST-SH3 Y52A. Both fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli, purified, and used in GST pull down assays to test their binding to the Flag-tagged MLK3 variants. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 4 A, deletion of the Pro/Ser/Thr-rich COOH-terminal region does not prevent association with GST-SH3. In fact, of all the truncation variants tested, only MLK3-(1–386) fails to detectably bind to GST-SH3. This suggests that the SH3-binding site is within amino acids 387–485 of MLK3. However, it is also conceivable that the SH3-binding site may be present but masked in MLK3-(1–386). In any case, one can conservatively conclude that a binding site for MLK3's SH3 domain is present in amino acids 1–485 of MLK3. All MLK3 variants fail to associate with GST-SH3 Y52A, indicating that introduction of this point mutation successfully blocks the binding ability of the SH3 domain. To further define the SH3-binding site within MLK3, individual or tandem domains of MLK3 were constructed as NH2-terminal HA-tagged variants, expressed, and analyzed for their capacity to interact with the SH3 domain of MLK3. MLK3-(1–114) contains the NH2-terminal glycine-rich region and the SH3 domain; MLK3-(115–399) contains the kinase domain; MLK3-(400–591) includes the zipper region, the CRIB motif, and an adjacent stretch of basic amino acids; and MLK3-(592–847) contains the COOH-terminal Pro/Ser/Thr-rich region. All variants expressed at similar levels although MLK3-(592–847) apparently undergoes some proteolytic degradation (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel). Data from GST pull down assays show that, of these variants, only MLK3-(400–591) retains the ability to interact with GST-SH3 (Fig. 4 B). As expected, none of the variants associates with GST-SH3 Y52A. Taking together all of the results from the GST pull down experiments, we conclude that the binding site for MLK3's SH3 domain is within amino acids 400–485 of MLK3. To confirm that the SH3-binding region lies within MLK3-(400–485), we took advantage of a previously constructed deletion mutant, MLK3-(Δ430–486), which lacks the COOH-terminal half of the zipper and the flanking stretch of basic amino acids (7Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, MLK3-(Δ430–486) fails to associate with GST-SH3. These data suggest that the critical SH3 binding determinants lie within amino acids 430–485 of MLK3. However, an alternative explanation is that disruption of zipper-mediated oligomerization prevents access to the SH3-binding site. We recently reported that a leucine zipper point mutant, MLK3 L410P, behaves as a monomer (9Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results show that GST-SH3 associates with both MLK3 L410P and wild type MLK3 to approximately the same extent (Fig. 5). An SH3-binding region has been mapped to amino acids 400–485 of MLK3. The predicted leucine zipper which comprises amino acids 400–463 of MLK3 is devoid of proline residues, and GST-SH3 binding does not require zipper-mediated homo-oligomerization of MLK3 (Fig. 5), suggesting that the zipper domain should not contain the SH3-binding region. Amino acids 463–485 of MLK3 are therefore predicted to be crucial for the binding of the SH3 domain. As shown in Fig.6 A, no typical SH3 binding motif of Pro-Xxx-Xxx-Pro is found in this region of MLK3, although a single proline residue is found at position 469 and four contiguous arginine residues (472) are present. Substitution of all four arginine residues with neutral glutamine residues reduces, but does not abolish, binding of MLK3 to GST-SH3 (data not shown). The sole proline residue in this region was substituted with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis and the ability of this mutant, MLK3 P469A, to associate with MLK3's SH3 domain was tested in a GST pull down assay. As shown in Fig. 6 B, MLK3 P469A does not detectably associate with GST-SH3, indicating that Pro469 is critical for SH3 binding. A point mutation in the SH3 domain increases MLK3 activity (Fig. 2), presumably because the mutation disrupts an autoinhibitory interaction. It has now been determined that Pro469 is critical for binding to MLK3's SH3 domain. A reasonable prediction, therefore, is that mutation of Pro469 should likewise disrupt an autoinhibitory interaction and increase MLK3 activity. Indeed, as measured in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.7), MLK3 P469A has about 4-fold higher autophosphorylation and histone phosphorylation activity than does wild type MLK3. These data argue that MLK3 is autoinhibited by a physical interaction between its SH3 domain and a SH3-binding site that is located between its zipper and CRIB motif. Protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous regulatory event in biology. Many pathological processes are associated with dysregulation of protein kinase activity. It is not surprising, therefore, that nature has evolved and coordinated multiple mechanisms to exquisitely control the activity of protein kinases. Many protein kinases are maintained in low activity or inactive states through intermolecular or intramolecular association with inhibitory molecules or domains. These inhibitory interactions may be disrupted in response to appropriate stimuli, allowing the protein kinase to adopt an active conformation. SH3 domains were first identified as targeting domains that through binding to proline-rich sequences mediate intermolecular associations among signaling molecules (13Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Extensive structural information has revealed three aromatic residues conserved in SH3 domains that participate in binding to proline-rich ligands which usually adopt left-handed polyproline type II helices (18Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MLK3 contains an NH2-terminal SH3 domain. Notably, proline residues comprise 24% of the COOH-terminal 220 amino acids. Our finding that the mutation of one of the conserved aromatic residues in MLK3, Tyr52, to Ala renders MLK3 more active (Fig. 2), suggested to us that MLK3's SH3 domain might bind to MLK3 itself to negatively regulate its activity. Pull down experiments showed that full-length MLK3 associates with the SH3 domain of MLK3 fused to GST (Fig. 3). However, the extent of association of MLK3 Y52A with the GST-SH3 fusion protein is much greater than that of wild type MLK3 (Fig. 3), suggesting that the functional SH3 domain of wild type MLK3 competes with exogenous GST-SH3. These results argue that an intramolecular association involving the SH3 domain of wild type MLK3 negatively regulates MLK3 activity. Despite the fact that the COOH-terminal Pro/Ser/Thr-rich region of MLK3 contains nine Pro-Xxx-Xxx-Pro sequences, deletion of this region has no effect on association of MLK3 with GST-SH3 (Fig. 4 A). Instead, a series of mapping experiments has identified a sequence located between the zipper and CRIB motifs that is important for the interaction of MLK3 with its SH3 domain (Fig. 4 B). Unexpectedly, this sequence is not proline-rich but, rather, contains a single proline residue at position 469. Mutation of this sole proline residue to alanine in MLK3 abolishes binding to GST-SH3. In accord with the supposition that MLK3 is autoinhibited by an SH3-mediated intramolecular interaction, replacement of Pro469 with Ala increases the catalytic activity of MLK3. While MLK3 represents the first demonstrated example of SH3-mediated autoinhibition of a serine/threonine kinase, the well studied tyrosine kinases of the Src family offer some interesting parallels. Crystal structure and biochemical studies have revealed an autoinhibitory intramolecular association that involves both the SH2 domain and the SH3 domain of Src (20Williams J.C. Weijland A. Gonfloni S. Thompson A. Courtneidge S.A. Superti-Furga G. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 22Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). A COOH-terminal phosphorylated Tyr provides a ligand for the SH2 domain, and the SH3 domain of Src binds to its so-called “SH2-kinase linker” region, a sequence located between the SH2 and kinase domains. These intramolecular interactions constrain the movement of the two lobes of the kinase domain and therefore, block the binding of ATP, keeping Src in an inactive form (reviewed in Refs.23Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 24Williams J.C. Wierenga R.K. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Hubbard S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SH3 binding sequence in Src, and also in its relative Fyn, harbors only a single proline residue, analogous to what we have discovered in MLK3, even though the preferred ligand of Src's SH3 domain was found by phage display methods to be the proline-rich sequence Leu-Xxx-Xxx-Arg-Pro-Leu-Pro-Xxx-Pro (10Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). One might imagine that the SH3 binding sequence in the “zipper-CRIB linker” region of MLK3 would provide a suboptimal ligand for MLK3's SH3 domain. The high effective concentration afforded in intramolecular associations in all likelihood allows this otherwise weak interaction to occur. Indeed, evolutionary selection may have given rise to a relatively low affinity intramolecular ligand for MLK3's SH3 domain so that it might be outcompeted by the presentation, in response to an appropriate physiological signal, of a high affinity proline-rich ligand on another signaling molecule. For instance, binding of a proline-rich sequence in the Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 to the SH3 domain of Hck, a Src family member expressed primarily in myeloid cells, overcomes autoinhibition, dramatically increasing the activity of Hck (26Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 27Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Signaling molecules that overcome SH3-mediated autoinhibition of MLK3 have yet to be identified. One potential candidate is the MKKK kinase hematopoietic progenitor protein kinase-1 that contains proline-rich sequences through which it interacts with the SH3 domain of MLK3 (15Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and that, like MLK3, can activate both the JNK pathway and the NF-κB pathway (28Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 29Hu M.C. Wang Y. Qiu W.R. Mikhail A. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5514-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hematopoietic progenitor protein kinase-1 phosphorylates kinase-inactive MLK3 in an in vitrokinase assay (15Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, no effect of hematopoietic progenitor protein kinase-1 on MLK3 activity has been observed in our hands or reported in the literature. The JNK pathway scaffold proteins, JNK interacting protein 1 (JIP1), JIP2 and JIP3, have been shown to bind to mixed lineage kinases including MLK3 (30Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 31Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Co-transfection of JIP1, JIP2, or JIP3 with MLK3 in COS-7 cells enhances the activation of JNK by MLK3 (31Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 32Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This may suggest that binding of JIP increases MLK3 activity. It is conceivable that JIP binding might relieve SH3-mediated autoinhibition of MLK3. However, the mixed lineage kinase family member, dual leucine zipper kinase, which lacks an SH3 domain, also binds to JIP1 and JIP2 (33Nihalani D. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and recent data from Holzman's laboratory suggests that JIP-associated dual leucine zipper kinase is catalytically inactive (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to clarify these issues. We previously reported that activated Cdc42 binds to MLK3 in a CRIB-dependent manner and results in a change in thein vivo phosphorylation pattern of MLK3 as judged by phosphopeptide mapping (7Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the newly identified SH3 binding sequence of MLK3 to its CRIB motif may suggest interplay between Cdc42-mediated activation and SH3-mediated autoinhibition of MLK3. The precise mechanistic relationship is likely to be complex and is currently under investigation in our laboratory. The mixed lineage family of serine/threonine kinases are so-named for the sequence similarity in their catalytic domains to both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. The major function ascribed to this group of protein kinases is activation of the JNK pathway, specifically by acting as MKKKs to phosphorylate and activate MKK4 or MKK7. MLK1 (35Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), MLK2 (36Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar), and MLK3 share the same general domain arrangement, which includes an NH2-terminal SH3 domain and centrally located zipper and CRIB motifs. However, the sequences in their COOH termini diverge. The more distantly related mixed lineage kinases include leucine zipper-bearing kinase (38Sakuma H. Ikeda A. Oka S. Kozutsumi Y. Zanetta J.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4276-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These kinases lack both SH3 domains and CRIB motifs. In this report we have identified a single proline residue in MLK3 that is required for binding and autoinhibition through MLK3's SH3 domain. Interestingly, this proline residue is conserved in the closely related family members MLK1 and MLK2 (Fig. 6 A), but not in the more distantly related mixed lineage kinases. Thus this newly discovered mechanism of SH3-mediated autoinhibition of MLK3 is predicted to apply to the regulation of MLK1 and MLK2 as well.

https://openalex.org/W1982484092,"We have investigated the ability of intracellular vitamin C to protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells from exposure to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and a range of derived chloramines. Ascorbate provided minimal protection against the cytotoxicity induced by these oxidants, as measured by propidium iodide uptake. In contrast, there was a marked effect on apoptosis, monitored by caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine exposure. Extended incubation of the cells with glycine chloramine or histamine chloramine completely blocked apoptosis initiated in the cells by serum withdrawal. This effect was significantly abrogated by ascorbate. Inhibition of apoptosis required the oxidant to be present for an extended period after serum withdrawal and occurred prior to caspase-3 activation. General protection of thiols by ascorbate was not responsible for the protection of apoptosis, because intracellular oxidation by HOCl or chloramines was not prevented in supplemented cells. The results suggest a new role for vitamin C in the regulation of apoptosis. We propose that, by protection of an oxidant-sensitive step in the initiation phase, ascorbate allows apoptosis to proceed in endothelial cells under sustained oxidative stress.

Its functions are many, and relate mostly to its ability to act as a strong reducing agent (3Halliwell B. Whiteman M. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 59-73Google Scholar, 4Frei B. England L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Human plasma levels are typically 50–70 μm, whereas tissue concentrations range from around 1 mm for skeletal and smooth muscle to >10 mm in leukocytes, brain, adrenal glands, and lungs (1Tsao C.S. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 25-58Google Scholar). Ascorbate is an essential cofactor for the enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine and is, therefore, necessary for the synthesis of collagen (5Barnes M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1975; 258: 264-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is also required for the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters in the adrenals and the brain, and its high levels in leukocytes suggest a vital role in the immune response (1Tsao C.S. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 25-58Google Scholar, 6Goldschmidt M.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1214S-1220SCrossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ascorbate is highly water-soluble, and its ability to act as a one- or two-electron reductant for a wide variety of biological oxidizing species has led to a great deal of interest in its role as a major anti-oxidant. This role has been supported by many in vitrostudies demonstrating the ability of ascorbate to scavenge oxidants and radical species, including the vitamin E radical, peroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, thiyl radicals, superoxide and peroxynitrite (3Halliwell B.

Bull. 2000; 23: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, there is still debate about the importance of the anti-oxidant role in vivo (14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 200-208Google Scholar). There is little direct evidence for anti-oxidant protection by ascorbate in vivo, and the symptoms of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) appear to be more related to its hydroxylation reactions than to an anti-oxidant function (1Tsao C.S. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 25-58Google Scholar). A significant oxidant for which ascorbate could provide effective protection is hypochlorous acid (HOCl).1 This is produced by stimulated phagocytic cells, via the action of myeloperoxidase, which uses H2O2 to catalyze the oxidation of halides, particularly Cl− (15Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Kettle A.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). HOCl is a powerful two-electron oxidant that reacts readily with a range of biological targets, and its production at sites of inflammation is associated with tissue and cell injury (16Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Pullar J.M. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for this comes from studies that have detected myeloperoxidase and HOCl-modified proteins in atherosclerotic plaques, in the endothelial cells lining arterial vessel walls, and in inflammatory bowel disease (18Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 19Malle E. Waeg G. Schreiber R. Grone E.F. Sattler W. Grone H.J. Eur.

Invest. 1996; 98: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). HOCl reacts most readily with thiols, with a rate constant of >107m−1 s−1 at neutral pH (21Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 22Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem.

We, and others have shown that glutathione and protein thiols are oxidized in cells exposed to low concentrations of HOCl (24Tatsumi T. Fliss H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1597-H1607PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pullar J.M. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22120-22125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Amino groups are also readily oxidized, with the generation of chloramine derivatives (-NHCl) that retain the Cl+-oxidizing equivalent of HOCl and extend its toxicity (27Samuels M.P. Warner J.O. Arch. Dis. Child. 1987; 62: 1099-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Chloramines also react readily with thiols and are variably cytotoxic, depending on their ability to cross cell membranes (27Samuels M.P. Warner J.O. Arch. Dis. Child. 1987; 62: 1099-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 29Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar,30Thomas E.L. Jefferson M.M. Learn D.B. King C.C. Dabbous M.K. Redox Rep. 2000; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Scavenging of HOCl and chloramines by cell thiols and methionine, together with enzymatic regeneration of these groups, is a likely defense against their toxicity (31Levine R.L. Moskovitz J. Stadtman E.R. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, both HOCl and chloramines react with ascorbate, the former with a reaction rate constant of approx 5 × 106m−1s−1 (22Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 29Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 32Carr A.C. Hawkins C.L. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Frei B. Free Radic. Biol Med. 2001; 30: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ascorbate has also been shown to protect protein targets and low density lipoprotein from reaction with these chlorinated oxidants and may be particularly effective against chloramine-mediated injury (14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 200-208Google Scholar, 32Carr A.C. Hawkins C.L. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Frei B. Free Radic.

We have assessed the effect of intracellular ascorbate on the toxicity of HOCl and a range of chloramines, using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model system. We have shown that HOCl can oxidize susceptible thiol-containing enzymes and glutathione and initiate apoptosis in these cells (25Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vissers M.C.M. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sub-lethal concentrations of HOCl also initiate signaling responses and growth arrest in HUVEC and fibroblasts (34Vissers M.C.M. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using this model, it is therefore possible to investigate the effect of ascorbate on a range of oxidant-mediated responses. Under routine culture conditions HUVEC, and any other human cell line, are completely deficient in ascorbate (12Alexandra E.K. Strom K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,37Leist M. Raab B. Maurer S. Rosick U. Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 21: 297-306Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Intracellular levels can be boosted by uptake as the reduced vitamin from supplemented medium (12Alexandra E.K. Strom K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the course of this study we found that, although cellular ascorbate offered only marginal protection of endothelial cells against the toxicity of HOCl and chloramines, there was a marked effect on apoptosis. Chlorinated oxidants were able to inhibit apoptosis, and this inhibition was completely abrogated by ascorbate. The ability of ascorbate to allow cells under oxidative stress to undergo apoptosis is an unexpected finding that may represent a new and specific function of vitamin C. All cell culture media and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc., supplied by Invitrogen (Auckland, New Zealand). PS exposure was measured by the binding of Annexin V-FITC using the Apotest FITC kit from Nexins Research B.V. (Hoeven, The Netherlands). The substrate for caspase-3-like enzymes, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) was from Bachem, (Bubendorf, Switzerland). HOCl was from Reckitt and Coleman Ltd. (Auckland, New Zealand). Solutions were diluted into Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose) and standardized by the absorbance at 292 nm at pH > 9 (ε = 350m−1 cm−1) (38Gazda M. Margerum D.W. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 118-123Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Chloramine derivatives of NH3 and glycine were generated by mixing equal volumes of 10 mm amine solutions at pH 7.4 with 2 mm HOCl at 0–4 °C. With histamine, 4 mmsolutions were mixed with 2 mm HOCl to minimize the final concentration of histamine. The concentrations of chloramine were determined by reaction with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored (ε = 14,140m−1 cm−1) (39Vissers M.C.M. Fantone J.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. and were reagent grade or better. HUVEC were isolated from human umbilical cords by collagenase extraction and cultured in Medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and endothelial cell growth supplement until the second or third passage as previously described (34Vissers M.C.M. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were finally cultured in 24-well plates and used when confluent (approximately 120,000 cells per well). HUVEC were loaded with vitamin C by supplementing the medium with 1 mm sodium ascorbate for 18 h (12Alexandra E.K. Strom K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After incubation with glycine-NHCl, 2 mm methionine was added to scavenge any remaining oxidant, and HUVEC were washed three times with HBSS and harvested by trypsin digestion. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until assay, when 150 μl of 0.27 m perchloric acid was added. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, and the ascorbate was measured in the supernatant by HPLC using an Aqua C18 5 micron column and electrochemical detection (40Lee W. Hamernyik P. Hutchinson M. Raisys V.A. Labbe R.F. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ascorbate concentration was calculated from a standard curve of between 0 and 10 ng/ml run with each experiment. Prior to treatment with HOCl or chloramines, the HUVEC were washed three times to remove any potential oxidant scavengers and the medium was replaced with HBSS. Diluted solutions of oxidant were added to each well to give a final volume of 1 ml. When the cells were exposed to HOCl, the HBSS was replaced with fresh complete medium after 10 min. When the longer-lived chloramines were added, the cells were maintained in HBSS for the duration of oxidant exposure. Throughout the experiment the plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The effect of oxidant exposure on HUVEC was determined by dual staining with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Annexin V binding to PS on the cell surface provides an indicator for apoptotic cells, whereas necrotic cells take up propidium iodide and bind Annexin V due to a loss in membrane permeability (34Vissers M.C.M. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar). After exposure to oxidants the cells were harvested from the wells by trypsin digestion. Attached cells were pooled with any detached cells from the supernatant and pelleted by centrifugation. Annexin V and propidium iodide were added according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sample fluorescence of 10,000 cells was analyzed in a bivariate flow cytometer. The HUVEC from three wells (approx 360,000 cells) were harvested by trypsin digestion and pooled. The cells were spun and pellets frozen at −80 °C. Immediately before assay the samples were thawed by the addition of 100 μl of buffer (100 mm Hepes with 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10−4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 μm DEVD-AMC), and the rate of change in fluorescence was monitored at 370(ex) and 445(em) (42Stridh H. Kimland M. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Hampton M.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The amount of AMC liberated was calculated from a standard curve. Reduced glutathione was measured by reaction with the cell-permeable reagent monobromobimane and detection by HPLC (43Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HUVEC were exposed to oxidants in 1 ml of HBSS. After a given time 20 μl of methionine (2 mm) was added to scavenge any remaining oxidant. The well volume was adjusted to 0.4 ml by carefully removing 0.6 ml, and 20 μl of monobromobimane (10 mm in acetonitrile) and 6 μl NaOH (1 mm) were added. After 10 min in the dark, trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 2.5% (v/v), and the wells were scraped with a rubber policeman. The cell debris was pelleted, and the GSH were analyzed by HPLC using a Brownlee Spheri5 ODS column and fluorescence detection at 394(ex) and 408(em). The concentration of GSH was determined from a standard curve of 0–4 μm run with each experiment. Similar to previous reports (12Alexandra E.K. Strom K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), overnight incubation of HUVEC with ascorbate resulted in its uptake in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). We routinely used 1 mmascorbate in the preincubation medium, resulting in uptake of approximately 0.9 nmol per 120,000 cells. This amount corresponds to around 50% of the GSH in these cells (2.05 ± 0.19 nmol per 120,000 cells). Given that the intracellular concentration of GSH is on the order of 2–5 mm (14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 200-208Google Scholar), the ascorbate concentration approximates in vivo levels of 1–2 mm (1Tsao C.S. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 25-58Google Scholar). HOCl and the chloramine derivatives of NH3, glycine, and histamine were variably cytotoxic to HUVEC, as measured by propidium iodide uptake (Fig. 2). HOCl and NH2Cl caused almost complete necrosis at 100 and 50 μm, respectively, whereas glycine-NHCl and histamine-NHCl were less toxic. This toxicity relates directly to the ability of the oxidants to react with the cells. HOCl and NH2Cl are freely permeable (43Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Birdwell C.R. Gospodarowicz D. Nicholson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and were rapidly consumed, whereas glycine-NHCl and histamine-NHCl remained present in the medium for a considerable time (Fig. 3). When HUVEC were supplemented with ascorbate, there was no difference in the level of necrosis caused by exposure to HOCl or any of the chloramines (Fig. 2).Figure 3Consumption of HOCl and chloramines by HUVEC. Solutions (1 ml) of 25 μm HOCl (●), 25 μm NH2Cl (▪), 100 μmglycine-NHCl (▴), or 50 μm histamine-NHCl (▾) were added to cells in HBSS, in 24-well plates. The supernatants were sampled at given times, and the remaining oxidant was assayed by reaction with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid. In control wells without cells all oxidants were stable for the duration of the experiment (not shown). Results are the means ± S.D. of at least three estimates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that apoptosis occurs with doses of HOCl between 25 and 50 nmol/120,000 cells (34Vissers M.C.M. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether ascorbate affected apoptosis, we measured activation of caspase-3-like enzymes and monitored PS exposure with Annexin V-FITC. When the cells were treated with 40 nmol of HOCl/well, supplementation with ascorbate increased caspase activity from 15.3 ± 2.7 pmol of AMC/min/360,000 cells in control cells to 18.2 ± 3.1 pmol of AMC/min/360,000 cells in supplemented cells (p < 0.05, n = 6). PS exposure appeared to be similarly increased, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (not shown). These studies with HUVEC maintained in serum suggested that ascorbate could enhance apoptosis in cells exposed to chlorinated oxidants. When the effect of ascorbate on apoptosis induced by chloramines was investigated, the cells were maintained in HBSS to prevent scavenging of the oxidant by the culture medium. We found that HBSS alone initiated apoptosis in a significant population of the cells as indicated by an increase in caspase activity and PS exposure (Fig. 4). Identical results were obtained when HUVEC were incubated in Medium 199 without fetal calf serum (not shown), suggesting that serum deprival was responsible for initiating the apoptotic process. The effect of chloramines on HUVEC apoptosis was investigated against this background activity. When HUVEC were exposed to NH2Cl we found that caspase activity was slightly increased, with or without ascorbate (Fig. 5). However, activation was progressively blocked when the cells were incubated with glycine-NHCl, with maximal inhibition at 40 or 50 μm. This inhibition was markedly decreased when the cells were supplemented with ascorbate (Fig. 5). The greatest difference was seen with 50 μm glycine-NHCl. At higher doses of oxidant caspase protection was less evident, although the enzyme activity was always higher in cells supplemented with ascorbate. Caspase activation was similarly inhibited by histamine-NHCl at doses between 10 and 40 μm, and ascorbate was maximally protective at around 25 μm (Fig. 5). This effect on the activation of caspase-3-like enzymes was also seen when PS exposure was monitored (Fig. 6and Table I). PS exposure in HUVEC exposed to 5 or 10 μm NH2Cl was similar to the HBSS control and was unaffected by ascorbate (Table I). In contrast, PS exposure was completely inhibited by 50 μmglycine-NHCl, and this inhibition was almost completely abrogated in cells supplemented with ascorbate (Fig. 6 and Table I). Glycine-NHCl prevented PS exposure with a concentration dependence identical to that required to block caspase activation and protection by ascorbate was similarly effective at oxidant doses between 30 and 75 μm. With 25 μm NH2Cl or 100 μm glycine-NHCl, where some necrosis was evident (Fig. 2) inhibition of PS exposure was not readily blocked by ascorbate.Table IEffect of chloramines and intracellular ascorbate on PS exposure in HUVEC initiated by serum withdrawalIncubation conditionsAmount of apoptotic cells (PS-positive, propidium iodide-negative)(n)No ascorbate+ Ascorbate%Medium 199 control5.0 ± 0.84.1 ± 0.9(4)HBSS27.5 ± 2.623.3 ± 3.8(6)NH2Cl 5 μm23.0 ± 2.026.0 ± 7.0(2) 10 μm21.5 ± 1.523.5 ± 1.5(2) 25 μm6.0 ± 1.03.2 ± 1.8(2)Glycine-NHCl 25 μm16.8 ± 1.918.8 ± 3.8(4) 50 μm6.7 ± 1.61-ap < 0.005 as determined by paired Student's t test for samples without and with ascorbate.

In contrast with HOCl and NH2Cl, which are rapidly consumed by the cells and are undetectable after 20–60 min, glycine-NHCl and histamine-NHCl persist in the medium for the duration of the experiment. We therefore considered the possibility that inhibition of apoptosis by glycine-NHCl or histamine-NHCl was dependent on their being present at a particular time in the initiation or execution phases of apoptosis. To investigate this further, we varied the time of addition of glycine-NHCl. When 50 μm glycine-NHCl was present for the first 60 min of the incubation, then removed and replaced with fresh HBSS, there was an increase in caspase activity rather than a decrease (Fig. 7), indicating that under these conditions glycine-NHCl causes additional apoptosis. However, when the oxidant was added at 2 h after serum withdrawal there was marked and consistent inhibition of caspase activation that was completely prevented by ascorbate (Fig. 7) and that resembled the effect seen when glycine-NHCl was present throughout the 4-h incubation. When glycine-NHCl was added 30 min prior to harvesting, there was a decrease in caspase activity that was only partly prevented or reversed by ascorbate (Fig. 7). Low concentrations of HOCl added 2 h after serum withdrawal also prevented caspase activation, and this was significantly less in the presence of ascorbate (Fig. 7). Because HOCl is very short-lived in the medium, these results suggest that chlorinated oxidants can prevent apoptosis in serum-deprived cells prior to activation of caspase-3 and PS exposure and that this inhibition can be prevented or repaired by ascorbate. Given that thiols are favored targets for HOCl and chloramines (21Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 23Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem.

Supplementation of HUVEC with ascorbate did not alter the extent of GSH loss with increasing doses of HOCl, histamine-NHCl, or glycine-NHCl (Table II).Table IIEffect of HOCl and chloramines on HUVEC GSH content in the presence and absence of ascorbateOxidantConcentrationGSH levelsNo ascorbateWith ascorbate% controlHOCl 30 μm84 ± 890 ± 25 50 μm66 ± 1073 ± 14 100 μm27 ± 634 ± 7Glycine-NHCl 50 μm58 ± 563 ± 6Histamine-NHCl 50 μm61 ± 768 ± 11 100 μm38 ± 140 ± 2Control HUVEC contained 2.05 ± 0.19 nmol of GSH/120,000 cells and 2.27 ± 0.47 nmol/120,000 cells in ascorbate supplemented cells.

After a 2-h incubation the ascorbate levels in control cells had decreased slightly (Table III). This is likely to be due to export from the cells. When the cells were incubated with 25–100 μm glycine-NHCl, there was a substantially greater loss of ascorbate (Table III). This does not reflect leakage from the cells, because there was minimal cell lysis in this time (refer to Fig. 2).Table IIIAscorbate content of HUVEC after incubation with glycine-NHClnmol of ascorbate/120,000 cellsControl cells, t = 01.12 ± 0.14Control cells,t = 2 h in HBSS0.75 ± 0.26Glycine-NHCl 2 h, 50 μm0.32 ± 0.22 2 h, 75 μm0.19 ± 0.21 2 h, 100 μm0.24 ± 0.03Cellular ascorbate was measured before and after 2-h incubation in HBSS without and with glycine-NHCl.

In this study we have found that chlorinated oxidants are able to block apoptosis in serum-deprived HUVEC and that vitamin C is able to protect against this oxidative stress and allow progression of the apoptotic process. Both PS exposure and activation of caspase-3-like enzymes were similarly affected, suggesting that this inhibition occurred at a point central to the apoptotic program. The ability of chlorinated oxidants to inhibit apoptosis depended on their being present 2 h after serum withdrawal. Glycine-NHCl and histamine-NHCl reacted slowly with the cells and persisted in the medium for several hours, explaining their inhibitory effect. In contrast, HOCl and NH2Cl were rapidly consumed by the cells and inhibited apoptosis only when added at a later time. Although HOCl reacts rapidly with cells, it is likely to generate some chloramines that could affect apoptosis signaling. In fact, generation of these long-lived species and their scavenging by ascorbate could explain the slightly increased apoptosis in HOCl-treated supplemented cells. Our finding that ascorbate can protect the apoptotic machinery from this oxidant attack may represent a new and potentially important role for vitamin C. Although there are many situations when apoptosis may be an undesirable outcome of oxidant exposure or cell damage, it is also central to the clearance of damaged and depleted cells in a way that does not disturb the surrounding tissue. In contrast, necrosis promotes inflammation and is to be avoided. In many in vivosituations an oxidant stress could persist over an extended time and may result in oxidative inhibition of apoptosis. Our results suggest that ascorbate provides specific protection under these conditions, allowing apoptosis to proceed. Neutrophils and phagocytic cells accumulate very high concentrations of ascorbate (1Tsao C.S. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 25-58Google Scholar). These cells are required to undergo apoptosis at sites of inflammation (45Fadeel B. Åhlin A. Henter J. Orrenius S. Hampton M.B. Blood. 1998; 92: 4808-4818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 83: 865-875Crossref Scopus (1333) Google Scholar), where they themselves generate considerable amounts of chlorinated oxidants (16Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Pullar J.M. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C.

Although their intracellular ascorbate has been proposed to provide a general protection against these oxidants (6Goldschmidt M.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1214S-1220SCrossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.

Acta. 1983; 763: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that a more vital function could be the protection of apoptosis that will allow successful resolution of inflammation. The consequences of oxidative inhibition of apoptosis would be either the survival of damaged cells or necrosis, and either outcome is undesirable. Our endothelial cell model may also have relevance for the pathology of atherosclerosis. Chlorinated oxidants are produced in the course of this disease, because myeloperoxidase and hypochlorite-modified proteins have been detected both in the plaque and the adjacent endothelial cells (18Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 19Malle E. Waeg G. Schreiber R. Grone E.F. Sattler W. Grone H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4495-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Whether apoptosis of these cells is involved in plaque development is not known, but the protection of this process in an oxidative environment could prevent necrosis or induce the persistence of dysfunctional endothelial cells. Apoptosis can be induced in cells under a variety of conditions, and several signaling pathways have been described (49Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 50Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The majority of agents cause mitochondrial disruption, and the release of cytochromec that binds to Apaf-1 in the cytoplasm. These events culminate in activation of the effector caspases, including caspase-3 that cleaves a number of structural and regulatory proteins (49Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 50Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Oxidant stress can initiate apoptosis, and this can be partly prevented by cellular anti-oxidants, including ascorbate (10Tu B. Wallin A. Moldeus P. Cotgreave I. Toxicology. 1995; 98: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Witenberg B. Kletter Y. Kalir H.H. Raviv Z. Fenig E. Nagler A. Halperin D. Fabian I. Radiat. Res. 1999; 152: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In our current experiments, exposure of HUVEC to NH2Cl or glycine-NHCl for 60 min resulted in an increase in apoptosis that was not greatly affected by ascorbate. These conditions are more similar to mostin vitro studies, in which the oxidant is delivered in a short initial exposure, and the cellular consequences, including apoptosis, are monitored for the ensuing period. Sustained oxidative stress can attenuate apoptosis by oxidative modulation of the caspase catalytic site, which has a critical thiol residue (49Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 51Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 52Hampton M.B. Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). H2O2 and the thiol reagent thiuram disulfide have been shown to affect caspase activity and processing by a thiol-dependent mechanism (51Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar,53Nobel C.S.I. Burgess D.H. Zhivotovsky B. Burkitt M.J. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). H2O2 treatment of Jurkat cells undergoing Fas-mediated apoptosis effectively delayed the activation of caspase-3, suggesting that repair of the oxidized thiol occurred once the H2O2 was consumed (51Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In another study (53Nobel C.S.I. Burgess D.H. Zhivotovsky B. Burkitt M.J. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), delayed exposure of HL60 and Jurkat cells to oxidized dithiocarbamates prevented apoptosis initiated by Fas ligand or etoposide. The oxidant-sensitive step in the initiation of apoptosis was proposed to be at a point immediately prior to the processing of caspase-3. These results are similar to our findings with chlorinated oxidants and would explain the timing of addition of the oxidant stress. Given the relative specificity of chlorinated oxidants for thiol groups, it is possible that inactivation of a caspase could explain the prevention of apoptosis, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. The more novel finding in our study, however, is that this effect of oxidants can be markedly prevented by ascorbate and suggests an intimate involvement of ascorbate in apoptosis signaling. We propose that ascorbate can protect or repair some component of the apoptotic cascade that allows activation of the effector caspases that commit the cell to apoptosis (Fig. 8). The ascorbate-mediated protection of apoptosis was marked at some doses of chlorinated oxidant, but was ineffective at higher levels of exposure. This could indicate that the anti-oxidant or repair capacity of ascorbate can be overwhelmed by higher oxidant concentrations, or that, at these levels that cause necrotic cell death, apoptosis cannot occur for other reasons, such as depletion of ATP (54Lelli J.L.J. Becks L.L. Dabrowska M.I. Hinshaw D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 55Richter C. Schweizer M. Cossarizza A. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). That ascorbate provides specific protection of a component of the apoptotic process is suggested by its comparative ineffectiveness in preventing GSH oxidation or in protecting the cells against the toxicity of HOCl or chloramines. Neither process was significantly affected by ascorbate, suggesting that inhibition of general thiol oxidation does not itself account for the effect on apoptosis. Given the relative reaction rate constants of HOCl and chloramines with ascorbate and thiols (23Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), it is predicted that the intracellular ascorbate concentration should exceed the thiol concentration by 10-fold for it to act as an effective scavenger. This is not the case, with the ascorbate concentration being half that of GSH and much less than the protein thiols in HUVEC (25Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). However, intracellular GSH also did not prevent chloramine-mediated ascorbate oxidation and did not appear to reduce oxidized ascorbate. Hence, the cellular environment is clearly more complex and reactions cannot be predicted from purely chemical considerations. In summary, our results show that intracellular ascorbate can specifically protect apoptosis in HUVEC in the presence of chlorinated oxidants. The anti-oxidant protection of a putative thiol-dependent step, critical for the progression of apoptosis, has not previously been described and may represent a vital function for this essential vitamin. Further experiments are required to determine the target of the oxidative and protective events, and we are currently investigating this phenomenon with other oxidants and cell types.

Although its precise role in peroxisome function is poorly understood, it seems to be involved in pore forming activity and may contribute to the unspecific permeability of the organelle membrane. PMP22 is synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and then directed to the peroxisome membrane by specific targeting information. Previous studies in rats revealed that PMP22 contains one distinct peroxisomal membrane targeting signal in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail. We cloned and characterized the targeting signal of human PMP22 and compared it with the already described characteristics of the corresponding rat protein. Amino acid sequence alignment of rat and human protein revealed 77% identity including a high conservation of several protein motifs. We expressed various deletion constructs of PMP22 in fusion with the green fluorescent protein in COS-7 cells and determined their intracellular localization. In contrast to previous studies on rat PMP22 and most other peroxisomal membrane proteins, we showed that human as well as rat PMP22 contains two distinct and nonoverlapping peroxisomal membrane targeting signals, one in the amino-terminal and the other in the carboxyl-terminal protein region. They consist of two transmembrane domains and adjacent protein loops with almost identical basic clusters. Both of these peroxisomal targeting regions interact with PEX19, a factor required for peroxisome membrane synthesis.

Over the past years, a clear picture has emerged of how matrix proteins are targeted to peroxisomes. The majority of these proteins have a carboxyl-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1)1 with the consensus sequence -S-K-L-COOH or a conservative variant (6Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J.

They all describe a single targeting signal that is either contained in internal protein regions or at the amino terminus of these membrane proteins. Two recent studies report the existence of multiple distinct targeting signals for yeast PMP47, human PMP34, and human PEX13 (23Wang X. Unruh M.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The insertion mechanisms of peroxisomal membrane proteins are also poorly understood. Cytosolic factors including organelle-specific chaperones may promote post-translational import by presenting the membrane protein in a conformation suitable for insertion into the peroxisome membrane. Studies of PEX19 indicate that this protein may act as such a chaperone for newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins (20Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PEX19 is involved in peroxisome membrane synthesis, and mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus led to the accumulation of newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins in the nucleoplasm. In addition, PEX19 binds to the targeting regions of various peroxisomal membrane proteins. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of peroxisome membrane synthesis and especially import of human peroxisomal membrane proteins, we cloned the human PMP22 and analyzed the molecular and biochemical properties of different PMP22 regions. We describe that either discrete amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal targeting elements are necessary and sufficient to direct the protein to the peroxisome membrane. We also report on the interaction of the peroxisomal targeting regions with PEX19 and the influence of the green fluorescent protein on targeting characteristics.

A. 1997; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Different human or rat cDNA fragments were amplified using a full-length human or rat PMP22 cDNA clone as template. PCR-generated fragments with either EcoRI andBamHI or EcoRI and SalI restriction sites were subcloned in frame either into the pEGFP-C1 or into the pEGFP-N1 expression vector. The identity of all subclones was confirmed by semiautomated sequencing on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer following the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

The OAT cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA1Neo vector. N-terminally Myc-tagged PEX2 cDNA with BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites and truncated PMP70-(1–180) with BamHI/XhoI restriction sites were generated by PCR using PEX2 and PMP70 plasmid DNA as template, respectively. The oligonucleotide primers used are listed in Table I. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 24 h before transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded on sterile cover slides. All transfections were performed using Superfect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 25 min in 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for indirect immunofluorescence. The fixed cells were permeabilized in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, washed twice, and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used in this study include rabbit anti-human calreticulin (1:300 dilution), mouse anti-human mitochondria (1:50 dilution), and rabbit anti-human catalase (1:250 dilution). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with either TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50 dilution) or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50 dilution). We also used the LysoTracker Red and the MitoTracker Red according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation was essentially performed as described previously (18Soukupova M. Sprenger C. Gorgas K. Kunau W.-H. Dodt G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, N-Myc-tagged PMP22, PMP22 fragments, PMP70 fragments, PEX2, and PEX19 as well as untagged PMP22, OAT, and PEX19 were transcribed and translated in vitro for 90 min at 30 °C. The proteins were used either labeled with [35S]methionine or unlabeled. The proteins of interest were incubated with an equal amount of N-Myc-tagged or untagged PEX19 translation reaction. The Myc-tagged proteins were precipitated by anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads saturated with mouse anti-Myc antibodies and further isolated by use of a magnetic device. The collected precipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, denaturated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. The rat PMP22 cDNA was used to clone the corresponding human PMP22 cDNA. The resulting human PMP22 cDNA meld extends from bp 1 to the apparent poly(A) addition site at bp 884 (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number AY044439). Over the 585-bp open reading frame, the nucleotide sequence of the human PMP22 cDNA is 81% identical with that of rat and is 3 bp longer. The amino acid sequence of the human PMP22, as shown in Fig.1, is 77% identical with the rat protein, 76% with the mouse protein, and 22% with theArabidopsis protein. The protein has four putative transmembrane domains; the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus are facing the cytosol. We first performed a data base search for conserved protein regions of human PMP22 and other peroxisomal membrane proteins using the BLAST algorithm (28Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Gish W. Wootton J.C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The alignment detected blocks of conserved amino acid sequences in the first peroxisomal matrix loop of PMP22 (Fig.2). Interestingly, these conserved amino acids, including the basic cluster KIKKR, had previously been identified as the peroxisomal targeting motif of the 47-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein of Candida boidinii (16Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Since similar basic motifs are also present in PMP22 and in other peroxisomal membrane proteins, we assumed that the targeting information of human PMP22 is located within the first peroxisomal matrix loop. Amino acids 56–74 of human PMP22 were fused to the green fluorescent protein. However, the resulting GFP-HsPMP22-(56–74) fusion protein did not reveal any peroxisomal localization (Fig.3, A and B). Because peroxisomal membrane proteins have to be inserted into the peroxisomal membrane, a more complex targeting signal including membrane anchoring domains may be required. Therefore, we added transmembrane regions adjacent to the first peroxisomal loop to allow membrane integration of the fusion proteins. Nevertheless, all of these fusion proteins, namely GFP-HsPMP22-(56–74), GFP-HsPMP22-(38–94), GFP-HsPMP22-(38–61), GFP-HsPMP22-(62–94), and GFP-HsPMP22-(1–94), were found in the cytoplasm and did not target to peroxisomes (Fig. 3,A and B). Furthermore, GFP-HsPMP22-(75–195), which lacks the first peroxisomal matrix loop region, did target to peroxisomes at an efficiency almost comparable with the full-length protein and yielded a perfect co-localization pattern with the peroxisomal marker enzyme catalase (Fig. 3B). Our data suggest that the first peroxisomal matrix loop does not contain important peroxisomal membrane targeting information for human PMP22.Figure 3The first peroxisomal loop of PMP22 is not essential for peroxisomal targeting.A, constructs of human PMP22 deletion mutants. The ellipse shows the position of the GFP. The three blocks (Block I,II, and III) in the first peroxisomal matrix loop are highlighted by different patterns.

While the amino-terminal half, GFP-HsPMP22-(1–94), did not localize to peroxisomes, the carboxyl-terminal 101 amino acids, GFP-HsPMP22-(95–195), were capable of targeting to peroxisomes (Fig.4, A and B). To identify the minimal regions within the carboxyl-terminal half of PMP22 that are sufficient for its proper peroxisomal localization, we made a series of deletion constructs. The truncated fusion proteins GFP-HsPMP22-(75–174) and GFP-HsPMP22-(95–195) retained targeting to peroxisomes, whereas all shorter fusion protein constructs failed to target (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the cytosolic and peroxisomal loop in the carboxyl-terminal half of PMP22 plus two transmembrane segments function as the peroxisomal targeting signal. These results were inconsistent with those by Pause et al.(19Pause B. Saffrich R. Hunziker A. Ansorge W. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Their work on rat PMP22 had shown that the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail is important for peroxisomal targeting. The presence of two entirely different and nonoverlapping targeting regions in the rat and human protein was unexpected and could reflect interspecies differences or the existence of multiple targeting signals in PMP22. To distinguish between these possibilities, we divided the rat polypeptide into two nonoverlapping halves and subsequently fused the two fragments to the carboxyl terminus of the green fluorescent protein. In accordance with our finding of a carboxyl-terminal targeting signal for human PMP22, we showed that the amino-terminal half of the rat protein, GFP-RnPMP22-(1–93), was also mislocalized in the cytosol and that the carboxyl-terminal fragments, GFP-RnPMP22-(74–194) and GFP-RnPMP22-(94–194), targeted to peroxisomes (Fig. 5A). Next, we used the experimental conditions previously described by Pauseet al. (19Pause B. Saffrich R. Hunziker A. Ansorge W. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and fused the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of human and rat PMP22 to the amino terminus of the green fluorescent protein. These experiments revealed the second and distinct peroxisomal targeting signal for human PMP22 at the amino terminus (Fig. 5, A and B). HsPMP22-(1–94)-GFP and RnPMP22-(1–93)-GFP were sorted to peroxisomes. In contrast, HsPMP22-(75–195)-GFP, RnPMP22-(74–194)-GFP, HsPMP22-(95–195)-GFP, and RnPMP22-(94–194)-GFP were not localized in peroxisomes. Comparison of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal protein targeting regions did reveal that both regions consist of two transmembrane domains and an adjacent basic cluster of five amino acids. The amino acid composition of these clusters is almost identical, RRALA or KRALA for the amino-terminal signal and RRLLL or KRLLL for the carboxyl-terminal one (Table II).Table IIAmino acid sequence of the basic clusters in different PMPs with two peroxisomal targeting signals (mPTS) of human (Hs), R. norvegicus (Rn), and C. boidinii (Cb)The two basic amino acids of each cluster are indicated in boldface letters. Amino acid sequences are from GenBank™/EMBL databases under accession numbers AY044439 for human PMP22, X70223 for rat PMP22,U53145 for C. boidinii PMP47, and Y12860 for human PMP34. Open table in a new tab The two basic amino acids of each cluster are indicated in boldface letters. Amino acid sequences are from GenBank™/EMBL databases under accession numbers AY044439 for human PMP22, X70223 for rat PMP22,U53145 for C. boidinii PMP47, and Y12860 for human PMP34. Taken together, these results indicate that there are two distinct peroxisomal targeting signals in human as well as in rat PMP22. Furthermore, the targeting characteristics of the PMP22 fusion proteins are influenced by the position of the green fluorescent protein. Fusing the green fluorescent protein to the carboxyl terminus of PMP22 masks its carboxyl-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal, while adding this protein to the amino terminus of PMP22 masks its amino-terminal targeting signal. While Dyer et al. (16Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) found that a hydrophilic 20-amino acid loop in PMP47 is both necessary and sufficient for peroxisomal targeting, further investigations on various peroxisomal membrane proteins revealed that targeting also depends on the number and position of the transmembrane domains (17Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber N.K. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Soukupova M. Sprenger C. Gorgas K. Kunau W.-H. Dodt G. Eur. J.

To elucidate the effect of the four transmembrane domains in PMP22 on peroxisomal targeting, we made different amino-terminal deletion constructs and determined their efficiency for peroxisomal localization. We found that at least two transmembrane domains were necessary and sufficient for peroxisomal targeting. GFP-HsPMP22-(75–174), including TMD2 and TMD3, was targeted with an efficiency of 85% of all transfected cells, and GFP-HsPMP22-(95–195), including TMD3 and TMD4, was targeted with an efficiency of 74%. Adding an additional transmembrane domain could further increase the targeting efficiency. GFP-HsPMP22-(75–195), including TMD2, TMD3, and TMD4, was directed to peroxisomes at an efficiency indistinguishable from the full-length protein. By scanning PMP22 for regions that were sufficient for peroxisomal targeting, we also found PMP22 truncations that specifically targeted to other cellular organelles (Fig.6, A and B). The fusion proteins GFP-HsPMP22-(95–132) and GFP-HsPMP22-(95–175) targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, respectively, while GFP-HsPMP22-(115–195) targeted to both of these organelles. In addition, none of our PMP22 truncations targeted to lysosomes. Thus, mitochondrial targeting of PMP22 seems to require the following elements: the second peroxisomal matrix loop and the third transmembrane domain. These regions may contain a conservative variant of a mitochondrial sorting signal. Previous studies established a role of PEX19 as a chaperone-like protein or a receptor protein for the import of peroxisomal membrane proteins and the synthesis of peroxisomal membranes (20Sacksteder K.A.

https://openalex.org/W1976382237,"Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and the second of the two large cytosolic domains of type V adenylyl cyclase (ACV) as bait, we identified a small region (amino acids 1028–1231) in the protein associated with Myc (PAM) as an interaction site for ACV. This small region of PAM as well as purified full-length PAM inhibited the activity of ACV. Additionally, full-length PAM was a very potent inhibitor of ACI and AC activities in S49 cyc− cells and HeLa cells with IC50 values in the pm and low nm range. Moreover, the regulator of chromatin condensation 1-like domain of PAM (amino acids 446–1062) was sufficient and as potent as full-length PAM at inhibiting the activity of ACV. Interestingly, full-length PAM did not inhibit ACII activity that was stimulated by either forskolin of Gαs. When endogenous levels of PAM in HeLa cells were decreased using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, the basal cAMP content was elevated, and the dose-response curve for vasoactive intestinal peptide-elicited cAMP accumulation in HeLa cells was shifted to the left. Therefore, we conclude that PAM is a very potent, novel inhibitor of specific isoforms of AC. Furthermore, the regulator of chromatin condensation 1-like domain of PAM is sufficient to exert the effects of the full-length protein on AC and decreases in endogenous PAM levels in HeLa cells can modulate both basal and agonist stimulated cAMP accumulation.

Antoni F.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in their regulation, all membrane-bound isoforms of AC are stimulated by the stimulatory GTP-binding protein of AC, Gαs (1Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol.

Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Similarly, all isoforms with the exception of ACIX (24Premont R.T. Matsuoka I. Mattei M.G. Pouille Y. Defer N. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13900-13907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Yan S.Z. Huang Z.H. Andrews R.K. Tang W.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) are stimulated by the diterpene, forskolin. In addition to the modulators described above, activity of the membrane-bound AC isoforms has also been shown to be regulated by other proteins. For instance, peptides corresponding to regions in caveolin 1 and 2 have been shown to inhibit the activity of ACV (26Toya Y. Schwencke C. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2025-2031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a bacterial protein, cis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase, has been demonstrated to inhibit the activity of ACVII and certain other isoforms (27Yan S.-Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More recently, ACIII, ACV, and ACVI have been shown to be inhibited by RGS2 (28Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanov V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In a search for novel mammalian proteins that may interact with ACs and regulate their activity, we performed a two-hybrid yeast screen with the second cytosolic domain of ACV, C2 (29Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), as a bait. Our screen isolated a clone that corresponds to a region within the protein associated withMyc (PAM (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). The homologs of PAM in Caenorhabditis elegans (RPM-1) and in Drosophila (HIW) have been shown to be important for synaptogenesis, synaptic growth, and presynaptic organization (31Schaefer A.M. Hadwiger G.D. Nonet M.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Zhen M. Huang X. Bamber B. Jin Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of action of PAM at the cellular level remain to be elucidated. Here we show that purified PAM as well as a protein corresponding to its regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) homology domain potently inhibit the activity of ACI, ACV, ACVI and ACVII, and AC in HeLa cells without altering the activity of ACII. PAM and its RCC1 domain are more potent inhibitors of AC activity than either Gαi or Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using the HF7c yeast strain provided in the MatchmakerTM kit. Growth conditions, media, and transformation protocols followed the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast cells transformed with plasmid construct C2ACV-pGBT9, which encodes for the C2 domain of ACV (see Ref. 34Scholich K. Wittpoth C. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), were cotransformed with an adult rat brain cDNA library in plasmid pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Approximately 15 million transformed yeast cells were grown on plates containing either medium deficient inl-histidine, l-leucine, andl-tryptophan (Leu−/Trp−/His−) or medium lacking only Leu and Trp. Yeasts growing in the latter medium demonstrate successful transformation with both plasmids, and those growing in His− medium suggest interaction between proteins. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 7 days. Several of the colonies that grew on plates containing Leu−/Trp−/His− medium were then individually streaked out onto new plates containing the same medium for another 3 days. These clones were grown overnight in liquid medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His at 30 °C followed by 3 h in complete medium. The cells were then pelleted, and β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates was detected by the chemiluminescence assay of Jain and Magrath (35Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as described in our previous publications (34Scholich K. Wittpoth C. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Sun H. Chen Z. Poppleton H. Scholich K. Mullenix J. Weipz G.J. Fulgham D.L. Bertics P.J. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5413-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cDNAs from clones that showed β-galactosidase activity were isolated and sequenced. To control for false positive interactions, the isolated cDNA was used to cotransform yeast with C2ACV-pGBT9 or GBT9 alone. Analysis of the transformants was performed as described above. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Confluent cells from 25 150-mm dishes were harvested by trypsinization and pelleted for 5 min at 400 × g. The cells were resuspended in TED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 135 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, lysed by 2 × 5 s of sonication, and subsequently homogenized using 15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded on a Superdex 200pg gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with TED containing 135 mm NaCl, and the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Positive fractions were pooled, loaded on a Q-Sepharose column, and eluted with a gradient of 150–350 mm NaCl in TED. Fractions containing PAM were pooled and the buffer exchanged against the aforementioned TED buffer containing 100 mmNaCl using Centricon 50 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was then loaded on a Mono S 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with the loading buffer (100 mm NaCl in TED). The flow-through was collected and applied to a Mono Q 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was eluted with a gradient from 150 to 400 mm NaCl in TED. Positive fractions were pooled and the buffer exchanged against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol using Centricon 50 (Amicon). Then the protein was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) and eluted with a gradient of 100–400 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. Positive fractions were pooled and the buffer exchanged against TED. The purified PAM was stored at −80 °C and used within 3 weeks. The RCC1-like domain (nucleotides 1484–3333; amino acids 446–1062) was subcloned from clone 97HT5 (gift from Dr. Guo, NIH, Bethesda, MD (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) into pTrcHisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in two steps. First, a DNA fragment was excised using SspI andEcoRI restriction endonucleases. The SspI site was blunted using Klenow polymerase and cloned inBamHI/EcoRI in pTrcHisA. The BamHI site in pTrcHisA was blunted using Klenow polymerase. In the second step, a cDNA fragment was excised from an overlapping clone T25a (also a gift from Dr. Guo) using EcoRI and DraI and cloned in the EcoRI/HindIII-cut plasmid from the first step. The HindIII and DraI sites were blunted using Klenow polymerase. The recombinant RCC1-like domain of PAM was expressed in the Top10 strain of E. coli. Cells transformed with plasmid constructs encoding the RCC1-like domain were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until they reached anA 600 of 0.4. Expression of the protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were incubated for 15 h at 23 °C before they were pelleted at 6,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min before adding 5 mmMgCl2 and 0.2 mg/ml DNase. After 5 min, the cells were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was batch-bound for 1 h at 4 °C to metal-chelating resin (Talon, CLONTECH). The resin was then poured into a column and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, followed by a second wash with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted with 3 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 125 mm imidazole and applied directly to a Mono Q 5/5 FPLC column. The protein was then eluted with a 100–350 mm NaCl gradient in TED. Fractions containing the proteins were pooled and concentrated in buffer containing TED using Centricon 50 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The protein was stored at −80 °C and used within a week. The hexahistidyl-tagged, constitutively active Q213L mutant of Gαs (Gαs*) was expressed and purified as described in our previous publication (32Zhen M. Huang X. Bamber B. Jin Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To ensure maximal activation of the Gαs*, the G protein was incubated with 1 μm GTPγS in the presence of 25 mm MgCl2 for 30 min prior to use in AC activity assays. Sf9 cells that were grown to 70–90% confluence in Sf900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus and 60 h later, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 mmbenzamidine. The cells were lysed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 10% sucrose, and cell membranes were prepared as described by Kassis and Fishman (37Kassis S. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. In experiments with full-length PAM or the recombinant RCC1-like domain of PAM, membranes (15 μg of protein) were incubated for 20 min on ice in the presence or absence of the proteins of interest. This incubation (20 μl final volume) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and a protease inhibitor mix (5 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). The preincubated membranes were then transferred into the AC activity reactions. AC activity assays were performed in a volume of 100 μl for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2as described previously (38Nair B.G. Parikh B. Milligan G. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21317-21322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 nm Gαs* or 100 μm forskolin was used to stimulate enzyme activity. Concentrations of PAM and its RCC1-like domain were calculated based upon the theoretical molecular mass (based on amino acid content) of these proteins (510 kDa for PAM and 70 kDa for its RCC1-like domain). The sequences of the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were as follows: sense, 5′-CTGTTCATGCCGGTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AACCGGCATGAACAG-3′; and antisense ODN harboring three mutations (3M-as; mutations are underlined), 5′-AATCCGTATGAACAC-3′. HeLa cells were plated on 35-mm dishes (300,000 cells/dish) and grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin for 24 h. The ODNs (3 μm each) were introduced into the cells by transfections using FUGENE 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in serum-free medium according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 90 min later the medium was changed with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 3 μm ODNs. The cells were then incubated for 20 h followed by an incubation for 4 h in serum-free DMEM before being treated with 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine for 5 min. Wherever indicated, cells were incubated for an additional 10 min in the presence of different concentrations of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or serum. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were treated with 1 n HCl as described previously (39Chen Z. Nield H.S. Sun H. Barbier A. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27525-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cAMP accumulation in the cells was determined by the radioimmunoassay procedure described by Brooker et al. (40Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). To check the levels of PAM, cells were harvested in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblots using anti-PAM antibody (gift from Dr. Guo). To monitor the distribution of PAM during the M and G1 phases of the cell cycle, HeLa cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml nocodazole for 24 h. They were then released from the nocodazole block by replacing medium devoid of the drug. Samples were taken 2 h (M phase) and 8 h (G1 phase) after release, and cell cycle phases were verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. In identical and parallel experiments, HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for another 5 min. The coverslips were blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with anti-PAM antibody (1:50 dilution). This was followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then washed with PBS and mounted. Staining of nuclei was performed using 1 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS for 5 min. To identify novel proteins that may interact and modulate AC activity, initially, we performed a two-hybrid screen with an adult rat brain cDNA library using the C2 domain of ACV as the bait. A positive clone corresponding to amino acids 1028–1231 of PAM (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in the correct reading frame was isolated (Fig. 1 A). This clone (clone 22) was expressed in bacteria as a hexahistidyl-tagged protein and purified. The purified protein was tested for its ability to modulate AC activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the protein corresponding to clone 22 (amino acids 1028–1231 of PAM) inhibited the activity of the full-length ACV when the enzyme was stimulated by Gαs* (Fig. 1 B). However, the full-length ACV activity that had been stimulated by forskolin was not altered in the presence of the protein corresponding to clone 22 (Fig. 1 B). Next, we investigated whether or not the full-length PAM also modulates AC activity. For this purpose, PAM was purified from HeLa cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2 A shows the purification of PAM at different steps in the procedure. The final purified protein was a single band on the gel and was estimated to be more than 95% pure (Fig. 2 A, last lane). Western analyses of the purified protein in lane 6 of Fig. 2 with anti-PAM antibody showed a single band (Fig. 2 B). Using this purified protein, we tested its ability to inhibit AC activity in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, PAM inhibited the Gαs*-stimulated AC activity in HeLa cell lysates in a concentration-dependent manner such that maximal inhibition was achieved at ∼10 nm protein. However, like the findings with the protein corresponding to clone 22 (Fig. 1 B), the forskolin-stimulated AC activity in HeLa cell lysates was not altered by full-length PAM. Thus the full-length PAM mimics the actions of the short protein, which corresponds to its amino acids 1028–1231. In additional experiments, we investigated the ability of PAM to modulate the activity of different AC isoforms. As observed with the protein corresponding to clone 22 (Fig. 1 B), PAM inhibited the Gαs*-stimulated activity of full-length ACV expressed in Sf9 cells. Again, ACV activity that had been stimulated with forskolin was not altered by PAM (Fig. 3 A). PAM also inhibited Gαs*-stimulated ACI activity but not the forskolin-stimulated activity of this isozyme (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, PAM did not alter either the Gαs*- or forskolin-stimulated activity of ACII expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 3 C). These data demonstrate that PAM differentially modulates the activity of different isoforms. Moreover, the finding that PAM does not inhibit Gαs*-stimulated ACII activity indicates that PAM does not alter AC activity by merely sequestering Gαs* or blocking the actions of the G protein in some nonspecific manner. Further evidence of differential regulation of the AC isozymes is shown by the finding that in membranes of S49 cyc− cells, PAM inhibited both the forskolin- and Gαs*-stimulated AC activity. The predominant AC isoforms in S49 cells have been shown to be ACVI and ACVII (41Premont R.T. Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, unlike ACV, ACI (Fig. 3, A and B), and AC activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 C), PAM can inhibit the activity of ACVI+VII (S49 cell membranes; Fig. 3 D) when the enzyme is stimulated by forskolin. Whether or not PAM inhibits forskolin-stimulated AC activity in other cell types or tissues remains the subject of further investigations. Another interesting aspect of the regulation of AC activity by PAM is the sensitivity of the different isoforms. Hence, for the Gαs*-stimulated activities of ACI and ACV the IC50 concentrations of PAM are 0.3 and 3 nm, respectively. In the case of S49 cells (ACVI+VII), PAM inhibits forskolin- and Gαs*-stimulated activities with IC50 values of ∼0.03 nm. For comparison, Gαs*-stimulated ACV and Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated ACI activities are inhibited by Gαi with IC50 values of ∼100 and 30–100 nm, respectively (42Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Yigzaw Y. Stringfield T.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Likewise, Gβγ subunits of G protein also inhibit ACI with IC50 values that are much higher (approximately 50 nm (42Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Yigzaw Y. Stringfield T.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) than those we report here for PAM. Recently, bacterial cis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase (27Yan S.-Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and RGS2 (28Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanov V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have been shown to inhibit certain isoforms of AC. However, these proteins also inhibit AC activity at very high concentrations (27Yan S.-Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanov V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Overall, therefore, PAM is a more potent inhibitor of AC activity than Gαi or any other protein that has been shown to inhibit AC activity. Interestingly, PAM contains a region (amino acids 498–1066) that is homologous to the RCC1 protein (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RCC1 protein has been solved recently (44Renault L. Nassar N. Vetter I. Becker J. Klebe C. Roth M. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1998; 392: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and resembles the seven-bladed propeller structure of the G protein β subunit (45Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Because clone 22 includes the C-terminal end of the RCC1-like domain of PAM and because G protein βγ subunits have been shown to modulate AC activity (for review, see Refs. 1Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F400-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 23Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the RCC1-like domain of PAM may be the part of the protein which is responsible for the inhibition of AC activity. Therefore, we expressed and purified a protein corresponding to amino acids 446–1062 of PAM which encompasses the RCC1-like domain and compared its activity with full-length PAM. As shown in Fig. 4, PAM and its RCC1-like domain inhibited Gαs*-stimulated ACV activity with equivalent potency. Moreover, as shown for PAM (Fig. 3 A), the RCC1-like domain of PAM did not alter the forskolin-stimulated ACV activity (not shown). These results demonstrate that the RCC1-like domain of PAM is sufficient to observe inhibition of AC activity. The RCC1 protein is a seven-bladed propellor and resembles the structural features of the G protein β subunit (44Renault L. Nassar N. Vetter I. Becker J. Klebe C. Roth M. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1998; 392: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 45Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Because G protein Gβγ subunits inhibit ACI activity (46Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at first sight it is tempting to speculate that this structural similarity is the basis for the inhibition of ACV activity by the RCC1-like domain. However, this similarity cannot completely explain the actions of PAM on ACV and ACII. Thus, ACV activity is not inhibited in in vitroexperiments by G protein βγ subunits (42Wittpoth C. Scholich K.

Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Nevo I. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that in cells overexpressing ACV the enzyme was inhibited by Gβ1γ2, whether or not the effects of Gβγ which they observed were direct or indirect remains to be determined. Moreover, ACII activity has been demonstrated to be conditionally stimulated in the presence of Gβγ subunits (46Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any stimulation of ACII activity in the presence of PAM and Gαs* (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, whether or not the structural similarity between the RCC1-like domain and G protein β subunits forms the basis for the inhibitory activity of PAM remains to be determined. To determine whether PAM modulates AC activity in intact cells, we used the approach of decreasing the amount of endogenous PAM in HeLa cells with antisense ODNs. As shown in Fig. 5 A, in HeLa cells treated with antisense ODN the amount of PAM, as determined by Western analysis, was decreased compared with cells treated with sense or mutant antisense ODNs. Reprobing the same blot with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody showed that the loading of proteins was the same (Fig. 5 A). The mutant antisense ODN was not totally inactive and decreased the amount of PAM to some extent (Fig. 5 A). Partial suppression of activity with mutant antisense ODNs has been observed previously by others (48Summerton J. Weller D. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the forskolin-stimulated AC activity in lysates of cells treated with PAM was unchanged, indicating that the total amount of AC was not altered by the ODNs (Fig. 5 B). However, the treatment of HeLa cells with antisense ODN increased basal cAMP levels (Fig. 5 C). Consistent with the partial decrease in the amount of PAM, the levels of cAMP in cells treated with mutant antisense ODN were intermediate between those in cells treated with the sense and antisense ODNs (Fig. 5 C). Moreover, when the amount of PAM was decreased by treatment of HeLa cells with antisense ODNs, the dose-response curve of cAMP accumulation in response to VIP was shifted to the left (Fig. 5 D). Hence, in the presence of antisense ODN, when the endogenous amount of PAM was low, VIP stimulated cAMP accumulation to the same level at ∼10-fold lower concentrations. These data suggest that endogenous PAM exerts an inhibitory influence on AC activity and that the decrease in endogenous PAM enhances basal AC activity and facilitates its activation by G protein-coupled receptors. Guo et al. (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have previously shown PAM to be a nuclear protein during interphase and to be distributed throughout the cell during mitosis. Because AC is a membrane-bound protein, we investigated the cellular localization of PAM in HeLa cells using the antibody that Guo et al. (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) had developed. Our data (Fig. 6) demonstrate that during the M phase, PAM is located exclusively in the cytosol. On the other hand, during the G1 phase, PAM is distributed both within the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The precise reason(s) for the slight differences in distribution of PAM in HeLa cells (Fig. 6) versus in endothelial cells (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) despite using the same antibody is presently not clear. It could be related to the different cell types. Nevertheless, the finding that PAM is located in cytosol during the M and G1 phases (Fig. 6) coupled with the data that show that a decrease in PAM expression increases basal and agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 5) indicate that PAM can modulate AC activity in intact cells. PAM is a large protein that is associated with Myc (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The region of Myc which associates with PAM is necessary for transcriptional activation by Myc, and mutations in this region have been observed in Burkitt's and AIDS-associated lymphomas (30Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Whether or not this interaction of PAM with Myc has functional significance in these diseases remains unknown. More recently, homologs of PAM in C. elegans (RPM-1) and in Drosophila (HIW) have been shown to be important for synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junctions (31Schaefer A.M. Hadwiger G.D. Nonet M.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Zhen M. Huang X. Bamber B. Jin Y.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Thus, the mammalian PAM may play a similar role. However, because PAM is a large protein with a number of potentially important domains for biological action, it is likely that this protein has a number of biological functions. This notion is underscored by the fact that PAM is also expressed in a large variety of non-neuronal tissues and cells (27Yan S.-Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this respect, our studies have assigned mammalian PAM with a functional role as the most potent inhibitor of some isoforms of ACs. Clearly, the decrease in its intracellular concentration increases basal cAMP levels and also responsiveness of AC to agonists of seven-transmembrane receptors such as VIP, suggesting that endogenous PAM in mammalian cells tonically inhibits the AC signaling system. Although PAM clearly modulates the ability of Gαs to stimulate AC activity, whether or not PAM also affects regulation of AC isoforms by Gβγ or other modulators such as Ca2+/calmodulin remains to be determined by future studies.

McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular polyamine levels are highly regulated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC),1 which catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis. Therefore, specific inhibitors of ODC such as α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) have been used to define the role of polyamines in cellular processes. The role of polyamines in the growth and repair of gastrointestinal mucosa has been examined extensively in the cultured intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6, a nontransformed line derived from adult rat crypt cells. Previous studies have established that inhibition of ODC activity in IEC-6 cells leads to alterations in gene expression (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although polyamines are critical for optimal cell growth, excessive accumulation may interfere directly with normal cell function. Polyamines have been implicated recently in the control of the apoptotic response. For example, polyamine depletion by DFMO treatment in IEC-6 cells delays the onset of apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α and the DNA topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (3Ray R. Viar M.J. Yuan Q. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C480-C489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells overexpressing ODC excessive accumulation of polyamines triggers apoptosis (4Pouline R. Pelletier G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Tobias K.E. Kahana C. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 10: 1279-1285Google Scholar). Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is an inducible and ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. NF-κB is a central regulator of the transcription of genes involved in cell survival, as well as genes involved in cell adhesion, immune and inflammatory responses, differentiation, and growth (6Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 7Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 10Baeuerle, P. A. (1998) Cell 729–731Google Scholar). Active NF-κB complexes are dimers of various combinations of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides, which includes p50, p52, c-Rel, v-Rel, RelA (p65), and RelB (reviewed in Refs. 11Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar and 12Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to inhibitory IκB proteins, which block the nuclear localization sequences of NF-κB. NF-κB is activated by a variety of stimuli, including phorbol esters, cytokines (IL-1, interferon-α/β, and tumor necrosis factor), lipopolysaccharide, double-stranded RNA, bacteria, and viral transactivators. NF-κB-inducing stimuli promote dissociation of the inactive NF-κB/IκB complexes via the serine phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. These events lead to the unmasking of the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB, thereby allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus and bind κB-regulatory elements. In this study we tested the hypothesis that NF-κB is activated following inhibition of ODC in intestinal cells. We found that inhibition of ODC by DFMO treatment results in depletion of cellular putrescine levels by 1 h. The depletion of putrescine levels was accompanied by rapid induction of NF-κB activation as determined by its presence in κB-dependent DNA-protein complexes. Several distinct complexes were detected that differ in Rel protein composition. In response to polyamine depletion, NF-κB translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The DFMO-induced NF-κB complexes selectively inhibited κB-dependent reporter constructs. Thus, ODC inhibition by DFMO depletes cellular polyamine levels and activates the NF-κB transcription factor, which may repress the expression of important cellular genes in intestinal cells. The regulation of gene expression mediated by NF-κB activation may manifest itself in alterations in cell physiology, such as the intrinsic resistance of polyamine-depleted cells to apoptosis. The normal rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cell line (13Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 80: 248-265Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1592). IEC-6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 10 μg of insulin/ml and 0.05 mg of gentamicin/ml (sDMEM). Stock cultures were subcultured once a week at 1:20, and sDMEM was replenished three times weekly. For experiments, the cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/cm2 in sDMEM containing 5 mm d,l-α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). This dose of DFMO markedly inhibits ODC activity (95%) and entirely depletes putrescine and spermidine from IEC-6 cells by 6 and 48 h, respectively (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this dose partially (60%) depletes spermine by 4 days. Control cultures received no DFMO. In some experiments 10 μm putrescine was added simultaneously with DFMO to demonstrate that exogenous polyamines can prevent the effects of DFMO. The inhibition of growth and migration resulting from polyamine depletion in IEC-6 cells can be prevented by adding 5 μm spermidine or 10 μm putrescine to DFMO-containing medium (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of DFMO treatment are caused by the absence of polyamines and not by DFMO itself. For preparation of nuclear extracts, the cultures were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with a rubber policeman. Nuclei were extracted with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.85, 250 mm sucrose, 0.4 m KCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and 1.75 μg/ml benzamidine), and extracts were frozen and stored at −80 °C (14Yang C.H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatt L. Croze E. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8057-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For EMSA, the nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′) derived from an NF-κB binding sequence in the immunoglobulin gene promoter (15Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To define the presence of specific Rel proteins, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 1:25 dilution of anti-Rel antibodies at 25 °C for 20 min and then subjected to EMSA. The gels were quantitated by PhosphorImager autoradiography (Molecular Dynamics). In brief, IEC-6 cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, 0.5 m perchloric acid was added, and the cells were frozen at −80 °C. The extracts were subjected to dansylation, and the intracellular level of putrescine in the range from 0.3 to 10 nmol/mg protein was determined by HPLC as described previously (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentrations in extracts were determined by the Bradford method. IEC-6 cells were rinsed with PBS without Ca+2 or Mg+2 (PBS−), fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS−, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS−. The cells were successively stained at room temperature for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal antibody to RelA (p65) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The cells were washed extensively after each incubation with PBS− and mounted with VectaShield. The Images captured on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 LaserSharp confocal laser scanning microscope were processed using Adobe Photoshop. At various times after DFMO treatment, 1 × 108 cells were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer, and equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotted with specific affinity-purified rabbit anti-IκBα antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IEC-6 cells were transfected by electroporation with either the pUXCAT promoter-less chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct; the pUXCAT 3XHLAκB construct, which contains three tandemly repeated copies of the NF-κB site from the HLA-B7 gene; or pUXCAT 3XIL8κB, which contains three tandemly repeated copies of the NF-κB site from the IL-8 gene (16Oliviera I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushiam K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 24–48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with DFMO for the indicated time or with both putrescine and DFMO and assayed for CAT activity. Acetylated and unacetylated [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the radioactivity was measured by PhosphorImager autoradiography. All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. from representative experiments. All experiments were repeated three times, in triplicate. Analysis of variance and appropriate post hoc testing determined the significance of the differences between means. Values of p < 0.05 were regarded as significant. NF-κB proteins are present in the cytoplasm as latent transcription factors. To determine whether polyamine depletion induced NF-κB activation, IEC-6 cells were treated with DFMO in the presence or absence of putresine. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the treated cells and incubated with a labeled κB oligonucleotide probe, and the resultant DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by EMSA. Nuclear extracts from untreated IEC-6 cells show little detectable constitutive binding to a consensus κB oligonucleotide probe. However, DFMO induced κB binding within 1 h (noted by the arrows in Fig. 1 A). NF-κB binding persisted for 24 h after DFMO treatment (Fig. 1 A). The DFMO-induced NF-κB complexes at all times examined specifically reflected the effects of ODC inhibition and blockage of polyamine synthesis because their induction was prevented by the addition of putrescine. To determine whether the binding to the κB probe was specific, nuclear extracts prepared from DFMO-treated cells were incubated in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled κB or an unrelated oligonucleotide probe. No DNA binding to the κB probe was detected in the presence of excess unlabeled κB oligonucleotide, and binding was not competed for by an excess of unrelated sis-inducible element oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a STAT-dependent DNA element (Fig. 1 B). Taken together these results indicate that the binding to the κB probe was specific. As shown in Fig. 1, two distinct complexes were found to bind the κB probe. These DFMO-induced complexes were detectable within 1 h of DFMO treatment and persisted for at least 24 h. Because active NF-κB complexes are dimers of various combinations of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides, we defined the composition of the DFMO-induced NF-κB complexes. To determine their composition we performed supershift assays with antisera directed against specific Rel proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the slowest migrating DFMO-induced complexes (denoted by the dotted arrow) contained p65 (RelA), because antisera to p65 supershifted the complex. In contrast, the faster migrating DFMO-induced complex (denoted by the solid arrow) was supershifted by antisera to p50. Thus, the DFMO-induced complexes of NF-κB are composed of the p50 and p65 members of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides The effect of DFMO could be reversed by the addition of exogenous putrescine, suggesting that the primary effect of ODC inhibition was depletion of intracellular polyamine levels as shown previously. To demonstrate directly that ODC inhibition by DFMO resulted in depletion of intracellular polyamine levels, the effect of DFMO treatment on the intracellular levels of putrescine was determined in IEC-6 cells. Perchloric acid extracts of IEC-6 cells were prepared at varying times after DFMO addition and subjected to dansylation, and the intracellular levels of putrescine were determined by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2, the intracellular level of putrescine in control IEC-6 cells was relatively stable throughout the 6-h time course of the experiment (0.21 ± 0.03 nmol/mg protein). In contrast, DFMO treatment for 1 h resulted in ∼50% decrease in intracellular putrescine levels. The intracellular putrescine levels continued to decline, reaching undetectable levels 6 h after addition of DFMO. These results confirm the previous finding that putrescine is rapidly depleted in IEC-6 cells upon ODC inhibition by DFMO (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is localized in the cytoplasm because of the binding of inhibitory IκB proteins, which block the nuclear localization sequences present in NF-κB proteins. Upon stimulation, the inactive NF-κB/IκB complexes dissociate, the nuclear localization sequences of NF-κB proteins are unmasked, and NF-κB complexes enter the nucleus. As illustrated in Fig.3, p65 (RelA) is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm of control IEC-6 cells with no nuclear staining. After 1 h of treatment with DFMO, there was a dramatic redistribution of p65 into the nucleus, so that p65 was nearly exclusively in the nucleus with little cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3). The translocation of p65 into the nucleus induced by DFMO treatment persisted for at least 5 h and specifically reflected the effects of ODC inhibition and blockage of polyamine synthesis because nuclear translocation was prevented by the addition of putrescine. Thus, p65 was present nearly exclusively in the cytoplasm of IEC-6 cells incubated for 5 h with DFMO in the presence of putrescine and resembled the distribution in control, untreated IEC-6 cells. The immunofluorescent studies on p65 confirmed the findings obtained by gel shift analysis, i.e.p65 translocates into the nucleus of IEC-6 cells upon DFMO addition. The activity of NF-κB is tightly controlled by inhibitory IκB proteins that bind to NF-κB complexes and sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm (11Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar, 12Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Viruses, cytokines, lipopolysaccharides, and other stimulating agents promote NF-κB activation by the serine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB. To determine whether NF-κB activation observed after DFMO treatment reflects IκBα degradation, IκBα levels were determined at various times after DFMO addition by immunoblotting with anti-IκBα antisera. As shown in Fig. 4, DFMO induced a progressive decrease in cellular levels of IκBα, indicating that DFMO induced NF-κB activation by promoting IκBα degradation. IκB degradation was observable within 1 h of DFMO addition, and a dramatic decrease in IκBα levels was observed at 5 h after treatment. Quantitation of IκBα levels by PhosphorImager analysis of the data demonstrated a 15% decrease in IκBα levels at 1 h and a 70% decrease at 5 h. The kinetics of IκBα degradation are consistent with that of NF-κB activation, i.e. a detectable decrease in IκBα at 1 h, at which time NF-κB activation is observed. DFMO-induced degradation of IκB specifically reflected the effects of blockage of polyamine synthesis because it was prevented by the addition of putrescine (Fig. 4). To determine the functional consequences of NF-κB activation induced by inhibition of ODC, we examined the effect of DFMO treatment on the transcriptional activity of CAT reporter constructs driven by NF-κB-dependent promoters. IEC-6 cells were transfected with either the pUXCAT promoter-less CAT construct; the pUXCAT 3XHLAκB construct, which contains three tandemly repeated copies of the NF-κB site from the HLA-B7 gene; or pUXCAT 3XIL8κB, which contains three tandemly repeated copies of the NF-κB site from the IL-8 gene (16Oliviera I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushiam K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were treated for either 1 or 24 h with DFMO and then assayed for CAT activity. As shown in Fig. 5 A, there was significant basal activity of the promotorless CAT construct as determined by the formation of acetylated chloramphenicol. The basal activity of the promoter-less construct was not affected by DFMO treatment. In contrast, DFMO treatment for either 1 or 24 h resulted in a marked decrease (∼90% inhibition) in the transcriptional activity of the 3XHLAκB construct, which contains three tandemly repeated copies of the NF-κB site from the HLA-B7 gene. In addition, DFMO treatment had no effect on a reporter construct driven by the NF-κB site from the IL-8 gene (3XIL8κB CAT). A time course of the effect of DFMO on the CAT reporter activity driven by the HLA κB site demonstrated that the inhibitory effect was first detected at 1 h of DFMO addition (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effect of DFMO was not observed in a CAT reporter activity driven by the IL-8 κB site. The inhibitory effect of DFMO on the HLA κB-dependent promoter persisted for at least 3 days after DFMO addition (data not shown). The decreased transcriptional activity of the HLA κB-dependent reporter construct was specific for polyamine depletion, because putrescine addition blocked the DFMO-induced decrease in CAT reporter activity (Fig.5 B). The polyamines, spermidine and spermine, and their precursor putrescine are found in virtually all cells of higher eukaryotes and are intimately involved in and are required for cell growth and proliferation (1Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important mechanism of action of the polyamines concerns their control of growth-regulated genes. Increased ODC activity occurs concomitantly with increases in the mRNA of several proto-oncogenes in growth-stimulated cells (17Celano P. Baylin S.B. Casero R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ODC is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis. Inhibition of ODC activity by DFMO decreases mRNA levels for the c-fos, c-myc, and c-jun proto-oncogenes in IEC-6 cells (18Wang J.-Y. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Wang H. Tzen C.-Y. Scott R.E.

In the present report we investigated the potential role of the NF-κB transcription factor family in the regulation of gene expression by polyamines. We report that inhibition of ODC induces the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor as measured by its presence in DNA-binding complexes and its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. DFMO-induced activation of NF-κB specifically reflected the effects of ODC inhibition and blockage of polyamine synthesis because it was prevented by the addition of putrescine, which is the end product of the reaction catalyzed by ODC. Distinct DFMO-induced NF-κB complexes were detected that differ in Rel protein composition as well as in their time course of activation. Two DFMO-induced complexes were detectable within 1 h of DFMO treatment and persisted for at least 24 h. The results of supershift analysis with specific Rel antisera indicate that these complexes are comprised of p50 and p65. The dimeric forms of NF-κB differ in their preference for certain κB sites on DNA, transactivation potentials, kinetics of nuclear translocation, and levels of tissue expression (11Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). The p50 homodimer is generally thought to act as an inhibitor of κB-dependent transcription (19Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the rapidity of NF-κB activation in response to DFMO. In Fig. 2 we show that in IEC-6 cells putrescine levels decreased by 50% within 1 h of exposure to DFMO and are at undetectable levels by 6 h. These data are nearly identical to those previously reported for IEC-6 cells (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the levels of the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, did not decline at this time. In fact, spermidine does not decline to undetectable levels until 48 h of DFMO addition, and significant spermine remains after 6 days (2McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these results demonstrate that NF-κB activation is clearly not caused by a general “polyamine depletion.” Instead, we believe that there is only a small pool of free polyamines within the cell. This pool, consisting largely of putrescine, is rapidly depleted by conversion to spermidine upon inhibition of new putrescine synthesis. Because almost all intracellular polyamines must be bound and unavailable for biological processes, a slight decrease in putrescine levels is sensed by the cell and activates a NF-κB-dependent response pathway. This view of maintaining cellular polyamine equilibrium is supported by the often reported finding that ODC activity peaks within 3–4 h of cellular exposure to serum or other growth stimuli (1Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is obvious that cellular polyamines are not free to take part in the proliferative response and that new polyamines must be synthesized. We next investigated the effect of ODC inhibition on transcriptional activity using κB-dependent reporter gene assays. DFMO selectively inhibited a gene reporter construct dependent on the κB site present in the HLA-B7 gene but had no effect on a construct dependent on the κB site present in the IL-8 gene. The inhibitory effect of DFMO on the κB site present in the HLA-B7 gene was detectable within 1 h and persisted for at least 24 h after DFMO treatment. These results correlate with the time course of DFMO induction of NF-κB activation, activation within 1 h that persists up to 24 h after DFMO addition. This is of particular importance, as noted above, because the p50 homodimer apparently inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcription. Moreover, the results on the inhibitory effect of DFMO on the κB site in the HLA-B7 gene versus the IL-8 gene highlight the selective effects of decreases in polyamine levels on the activated NF-κB complexes that bind to κB regulatory elements. A similar selectivity for κB sites has been described for the interferon-induced expression of a CAT reporter construct driven by the κB site in HLA-B7 gene, but interferon had no effect on a construct driven by the κB site in the IL-8 gene (20Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13756-13761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The polyamine spermine activates NF-κB in human breast cancer cells (21Shah N. Thomas T. Shirahata A. Sigal L.H. Thomas T.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14763-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Shah N. Thomas T.J. Lewis J.S. Klinge C.M. Shirahata A. Gelinas C. Thomas T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings appear to be in conflict with the results reported herein. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the differential responses of normal cells (IEC-6 cells) versuscancer cells to polyamine effects. Alternatively, both inhibition of ODC activity by DFMO (Fig. 2) and exogenous spermine addition (21Shah N. Thomas T. Shirahata A. Sigal L.H. Thomas T.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14763-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) result in depletion in putrescine levels. Because a slight decrease in putrescine levels may be sensed by the cell to activate a NF-κB-dependent response pathway, these apparently contradictory reports may be entirely consistent with one another. An emerging area of research in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation is the role of NF-κB in regulating intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) gene expression (23Schmid R.M. Adler G. Gastroenerology. 2000; 118: 1208-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IECs form a single layer of cells that isolate the host from the hostile gut luminal environment. Aside from their classical absorptive and physical barrier roles, an emerging concept views IECs as immunological sentinels of the intestinal mucosa. IECs are capable of responding to a wide array of biologically active agents commonly found in the lumen, including bacterial products, adherent and invasive bacteria, cytokines, and short chain fatty acids. NF-κB regulates the transcription of a number of proinflammatory molecules, including IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, involved in acute responses to injury and in chronic intestinal inflammation (23Schmid R.M. Adler G. Gastroenerology. 2000; 118: 1208-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB activation has been documented in the intestine of patients with various forms of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and self-limited colitis (25Neurath M. Pettersson S. Meyer Zum Buschen-felde K.-H. Strober W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 26Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Scholrerich J. Gross V. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 27Schreiber S. Nikolaus S. Hampe J. Gut. 1998; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry performed on tissue sections isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease demonstrates the presence of activated NF-κB in IECs located at the crypts but not at the surface region (26Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Scholrerich J. Gross V. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clearly important that we have found that polyamine depletion of IEC-6 cells results in NF-κB activation. In many cell types NF-κB plays a protective role against apoptosis, mediated by death signals such as tumor necrosis factor-α and radiation (6Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 7Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 8Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Therefore, NF-κB activation may have an impact on intestinal hyperplasia through cell removal by apoptosis in a manner similar to experimental rheumatoid arthritis (28Miagkov A.V. Kovalenko D.V. Brown C.E. Didsbury J.R. Cogswell J.P. Stimpson S.A. Baldwin A.S. Makarov S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13859-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We report that ODC inhibition by DFMO treatment rapidly induces NF-κB activation. It has been recently shown that apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents and tumor necrosis factor-α is delayed in polyamine-depleted cells (3Ray R. Viar M.J. Yuan Q. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C480-C489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results implicate NF-κB in the protective action of DFMO against apoptotic agents in IEC-6 cells. In summary, we have shown that polyamine depletion activates the NF-κB transcription factor. NF-κB activation resulted in the inhibition of selective NF-κB-dependent reporter constructs. Therefore, our results show that polyamine depletion in intestinal epithelial cells activates the NF-κB signal transduction pathway, which is a pathway with important physiological consequences.

Decreased cyclin expression, induction of p18INK4c and increased association of the CDK inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 with cyclin E-Cdk2 have been implicated in these responses. To determine the role of decreased cyclin expression, T-47D human breast cancer cells constitutively expressing cyclin D1 or cyclin E were treated with the progestin ORG 2058. Overexpression of cyclin E had only a modest effect on growth inhibition. Although cyclin E expression was maintained during progestin treatment, cyclin E-Cdk2 activity decreased by ∼60%. This was accompanied by p27Kip1 association with cyclin E-Cdk2, indicating that both cyclin E down-regulation and p27Kip1 recruitment contribute to the decrease in activity. In contrast, overexpression of cyclin D1 induced progestin resistance and cell proliferation continued despite decreased cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. Progestin treatment of cyclin D1-overexpressing cells was associated with increased p27Kip1 association with cyclin E-Cdk2. Thus the ability of cyclin D1 to confer progestin resistance does not depend on sequestration of p27Kip1 away from cyclin E-Cdk2, providing evidence for a critical function of cyclin D1 other than as a high-capacity “sink” for p27Kip1. These data indicate that regulation of cyclin D1 is a critical element of progestin inhibition in breast cancer cells and suggest that breast cancers overexpressing cyclin D1 may respond poorly to progestin therapy.

Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). For example, in the uterus progesterone acts synergistically with estrogen to stimulate stromal proliferation but inhibits estrogen-induced epithelial proliferation. The latter effect has led to the addition of progestin to hormone replacement therapies to counteract the increased risk of endometrial cancer arising from treatment with estrogen alone (2Rose P.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Synthetic progestins have an established role in the therapy of breast and endometrial cancers (2Rose P.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 3Veronesi U. Goldhirsch A. Yarnold J. Peckham M. Pinedo H.M. Veronesi U. Oxford Textbook of Oncology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1243-1289Google Scholar), demonstrating a growth-inhibitory effect on breast and endometrial cancer cells, although whether progesterone is stimulatory or inhibitory for normal breast epithelium remains controversial. Progestins have a biphasic effect on the proliferation of breast cancer cells in culture (4Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), initially stimulating G1 cells to enter S phase, but the predominant effect is long term growth inhibition. Several recent studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms for this growth inhibition (5Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6Musgrove E.A. Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Cornish A.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Progestin-mediated growth inhibition is preceded by decreased expression of the major G1 cyclins in breast cancer cells, cyclin D1 and cyclin E (5Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6Musgrove E.A. Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Cornish A.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and preferential formation of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes that contain the CDK1 inhibitor p27Kip1 and are therefore inactive (6Musgrove E.A. Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Cornish A.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The related CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 appears to play a minor role since immunodepletion experiments indicate that few of the cyclin D1- or cyclin E-containing complexes contain p21Cip1 following progestin treatment (7Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The increased association of p27Kip1 with cyclin E-Cdk2 occurs prior to any increase in p27Kip1 abundance. Since in breast cancer cells cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes bind a significant fraction of the total cellular p27Kip1, a decrease in their abundance will make p27Kip1 increasingly available to associate with other molecules and this likely contributes to increased p27Kip1-cyclin E-Cdk2 association. The increased formation of p27Kip1-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes also reflects increased expression of another CDK inhibitor, p18INK4c (7Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast with p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, which associate with both cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2, p18INK4c specifically inhibits the activity of cyclin D-associated kinases, restricting cyclin D binding to Cdk4/6 and thereby making p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 available to bind other proteins (8Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5158) Google Scholar). Thus, it is apparent that progestins target multiple elements of the cell cycle control machinery which may contribute to inhibition of CDK activity and consequent inhibition of proliferation. However, the relative importance of regulating cyclin abundance remains unclear, and it was the objective of this study to address this issue by using constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 or cyclin E as a means of maintaining cyclin expression during progestin treatment. Additional impetus for these experiments comes from the frequent overexpression of cyclin D1 or cyclin E in breast cancer. Cyclin D1 is overexpressed in ∼50% of breast cancers (9Gillett C. Fantl V. Smith R. Fisher C. Bartek J. Dickson C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1812-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bartkova J. Lukas J. Müller H. Lützhøft D. Strauss M. Bartek J. Int. J.

More recent data indicate that cyclin D1 overexpression is an indicator of poor prognosis specifically in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers (17Kenny F.S. Hui R. Musgrove E.A. Gee J.M.

Cyclin E is present as low molecular weight isoforms in breast cancer but not in normal breast epithelium and is overexpressed in ∼30% of breast cancer specimens (18Porter P.L. Malone K.E.

One possible explanation for poor outcome associated with cyclin overexpression is impaired response to therapies that modulate cyclin D1 expression, but there are to date few studies addressing the question of whether cyclin overexpression might alter response. This manuscript demonstrates that overexpression of cyclin D1 induces resistance to progestin-mediated growth inhibition, but overexpression of cyclin E has little effect. Maintenance of cyclin D1 expression after progestin treatment did not prevent increased p27Kip1association with cyclin E-Cdk2. This observation is inconsistent with the suggestion, supported by recent genetic evidence (22Tong W. Pollard J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Geng Y., Yu, Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Bronson R.T. Sicinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), that sequestration of p27Kip1 is the physiologically relevant function of cyclin D1. Rather, it indicates that in the context of progestin inhibition, other functions of cyclin D1 are critical. Overall, the data presented here indicate that regulation of cyclin D1 is a central element of progestin inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and suggest that breast cancers overexpressing cyclin D1 may respond poorly to progestin therapy. The generation of T-47D human breast cancer cells constitutively expressing either cyclin D1 or cyclin E is described fully elsewhere. 2R. Hui, G. L. Finney, C. S. L. Lee, E. A. Musgrove, R. L Sutherland, manuscript in preparation. In brief, a T-47D clone stably transfected with the tet-responsive transcriptional activator tTA (T-47D tTA-17) was transfected with a pTRE vector containing full-length cyclin D1 or full-length cyclin E cDNA. Stable clones were selected by hygromycin treatment (200 μg/ml) following co-transfection with pTK-Hyg to produce cell lines overexpressing cyclin D1 (D1 17-1) or cyclin E (E 17-2, E 17-3). Western blot analysis of cell lysates demonstrated overexpression of the cyclin proteins in the absence of tetracycline. T-47D tTA-17 and clonal derivatives stably transfected with the empty pTRE vector were used as control cell lines. T-47D tTA-17 derivatives were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, insulin (10 μg/ml), and tetracycline (2 μg/ml). T-47D-EcoR-p cells for retroviral infection were generated by stable transfection of a vector encoding the murine (ecotropic) retroviral receptor (pBabePuro-EcoR; provided by Dr. Gordon Peters, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK) into T-47D breast cancer cells. A clone was selected based on high retroviral infectability and normal steroid responsiveness and expanded for subsequent experiments. RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, insulin (10 μg/ml), and gentamicin (20 μg/ml) was used to culture the cell lines for progestin treatment experiments. The synthetic progestin ORG 2058 (16α-ethoxy-21-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-en-3,20-dione; Amersham Biosciences) was dissolved in ethanol at 1,000-fold final concentration and added to cells in exponential growth. Control cultures received ethanol vehicle to the same final concentration. The sensitivity of the cell lines to ORG 2058 treatment was assessed in colony-forming assays. Cells (8000 cells/plate) were plated into duplicate 6-cm diameter dishes in RPMI 1640,5% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the cells were treated with a range of ORG 2058 concentrations (0.01–100 nm) or ethanol vehicle (control) and incubated for up to 35 days (typically 18–21 days) until the control dishes for each cell line reached similar colony size. The medium was changed, and ethanol or ORG 2058 treatment repeated every 7 days during this time period. The cells were fixed and stained using the Diff-Quik Stain Set (64851, Lab Aids Pty. Ltd., Narrabeen, Australia). The number of colonies in each dish was quantitated using Bio-Rad Quantity One 4.2.1 GelDoc software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Retroviral vectors were constructed as follows: pLib-D1 was made by digesting pLib (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) withEcoRI/NotI and pHsCYCD1-H124 (David Beach, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) withEcoRI/ HindIII, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis purification. The fragments were end-blunted with DNA polymerase and ligated. The pLib-cycE vector was constructed similarly, using a cyclin E long-form insert isolated from pBSSK-cycE (Steven Reed, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) byEcoRI/HindIII digestion. Ecotropic retroviruses expressing cyclins D1 and E were packaged in Phoenix-Eco cells (a gift of Philip Achacoso and Garry Nolan, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA) by transient transfection. Phoenix-Eco cells were seeded into 10-cm diameter dishes and 24 h later were transfected with 20 μg of vector DNA using 60 μl of FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics Australia, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia) per dish. The medium was changed 24 h later, and the cells incubated at 32 °C for a further 24 h. Viral supernatant was harvested by filtration (Millex-HV Durapore, Millipore Bedford, MA), and polybrene (Sigma) added to a final concentration of 16 μg/ml. Viral supernatant was added immediately to target cells by 1:4 dilution in culture medium or stored at −80 °C for later use. As a means of estimating infection efficiency a GFP-expressing virus (pLib-EGFP, CLONTECH) was packaged in parallel with the cyclin constructs. T-47D-EcoR-p cells (5 × 105 cells/plate) were plated into 10-cm diameter dishes in RPMI 1640,5% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the cells were infected with either the GFP, cyclin D1, or cyclin E viral supernatant and incubated with occasional swirling. The medium was removed 24 h later, and the cells were reinfected with fresh viral supernatant to maximize infection efficiency. Following a further 24 h of incubation, the retroviral-infected cells were plated (8000 cells/plate) into replicate 6-cm diameter dishes in RPMI 1640,5% fetal calf serum, subsequently treated with ORG 2058 or ethanol vehicle, stained after 18 days incubation, and quantitated as described above for the colony-forming assay. Parallel dishes were harvested for analysis of cyclin expression levels by Western blotting. GFP-expressing cells were also harvested for flow cytometric analysis 48 h after infection to estimate the proportion of infected cells, which was typically 30–50%. Cells were lysed as follows: cell monolayers were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 20 μmMG132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO; Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany)). At selected timepoints an aliquot of this suspension was diluted in RPMI 1640,5% fetal calf serum and stained for later flow cytometric DNA analysis by addition of ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) and Triton X-100 (0.2%). The remainder was incubated for 5 min on ice, and the cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). For Cdk4 assays kinase lysis buffer was used: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 20 μm MG132. The cells were lysed, and the lysates cleared as previously described (24Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The cleared lysates were stored at −80 °C. Cell lysates (600 μg) were immunoprecipitated by incubation (40 min, 4 °C) with p27Kip1 (C-19-G) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) followed by incubation (1 h, 4 °C) with protein G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Alternatively, lysates were additionally incubated with p21Cip1 (C-19) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology that had been previously chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) by incubation in dimethyl pimelimidate (5 mg/ml),sodium tetraborate (0.2m, pH 9.0), for 30 min at room temperature, essentially as described previously (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A control with no antibody (mock immunoprecipitation) was included for each sample. Following three rounds of immunoprecipitation, the combined immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with lysis buffer and eluted by the addition of glycine (0.1 m, pH 2.7) for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were cleared by centrifugation and the eluted proteins neutralized with the addition of Tris-HCl (1 m, pH 9.0) before addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Following the addition of ferritin carrier protein, the immunodepleted supernatant was acetone-precipitated overnight at −80 °C and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples of immunoprecipitated or total protein (50–80 μg) in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were heated to 95 °C for 3 min, then separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated (2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C) with the following primary antibodies: cyclin E (HE12) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; cyclin D1 (DCS6) antibody from Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom; p27Kip1(K25020) antibodies from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY.; pRb (14001A) antibody from PharMingen, San Diego, CA; and phospho-Rb (Ser-780) antibody from New England Biolabs Inc., Beverley, MA. Following incubation (1 h at room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), specific proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Where the proteins of interest were of sufficiently different mobilities, membranes were incubated either sequentially or simultaneously with several primary antibodies. The histone H1 kinase activity of cyclin E immunoprecipitates from 100 to 250 μg of cellular protein was measured as previously described (24Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), using 10 μg of histone H1 as substrate. The degree of background histone H1 phosphorylation, estimated from parallel control samples immunoprecipitated using beads without antibody, was typically near the limit of detection. Kinase activity of Cdk4 immunoprecipitates from 500 μg of cellular protein was measured using 10 μg of GST-pRb773–928 fusion protein substrate as previously described (24Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The degree of background phosphorylation in pRb phosphorylation assays was estimated from parallel control samples immunoprecipitated following blocking of specific antibody binding with the appropriate antigenic peptide. Following termination of kinase reactions, samples were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-12% PAGE. Images captured by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics 445 SI; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or, for chemiluminescence, by densitometer scanning (Molecular Dynamics PDSI) of x-ray film, were quantitated using IP Lab Gel H analysis software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Quantitation of protein levels by this method was linear over the range of intensities measured. All figures were compiled using Deneba Canvas 5.0 software. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) using CELLQuest 2.0 (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) software. The proportion of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were calculated from the resulting DNA histograms using ModFit LT analysis software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME). To determine the effect of cyclin overexpression on sensitivity to growth inhibition by progestins we used clonal derivatives of T-47D breast cancer cells that had been transfected with either cyclin D1 or cyclin E. The levels of cyclin expression achieved were ∼5-fold greater than in parental or vector-transfected control cells for the cyclin D1-overexpressing line and >3-fold for the cyclin E overexpressing lines (Fig. 1 A). This level of cyclin overexpression had no effect on the expression of other G1cyclins, nor on the levels of the CDK inhibitors p21Cip1and p27Kip1 (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Colony formation over 3 weeks of monolayer culture was used to test the sensitivity of the cyclin-overexpressing clonal cell lines to long term inhibition of proliferation following progestin treatment. Vector-transfected cells were profoundly inhibited by the presence of the progestin ORG 2058. Very few colonies were apparent after treatment with ≥1 nm ORG 2058, representing >99% inhibition of colony formation (Fig. 1, B and C). The concentration-dependence of the inhibition of proliferation was similar to that previously observed in the parental T-47D cells using different methodology (26Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Pang G.Y.N. Musgrove E.A. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5084-5091PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, the cyclin D1-overexpressing cell line (cyclin D1 17–1) was poorly inhibited by ORG 2058 treatment even at the highest concentration used, 100 nm (Fig. 1,B and C). In two cyclin E-overexpressing cell lines (cyclin E 17–2 and 17–3) ORG 2058 clearly inhibited colony formation, to ∼25% of control at 1–100 nm, although significant numbers of colonies were still apparent (Fig. 1, B and C). These data suggested that cyclin D1 overexpression attenuated the antiproliferative effects of progestins, but cyclin E overexpression had a more modest effect, still allowing substantial inhibition of proliferation. Measurement of estrogen and progesterone receptor levels by Western blot confirmed similar receptor expression in all the cell lines and demonstrated progestin-mediated down-regulation of both receptors in all cell lines (not shown), indicating that other progestin responses remained intact and thus that the apparent resistance was not simply due to defects in progesterone receptor expression or signaling. To further confirm that the alteration in progestin sensitivity documented in Fig. 1 was due to cyclin overexpression rather than clonal variation, we infected T-47D cells with retroviruses expressing either GFP (control), cyclin D1, or cyclin E. Up to 50% of the original population was infected with virus. The resulting level of cyclin expression was similar to that in the cyclin-overexpressing clonal T-47D cell lines (Fig. 2) and was maintained over the 3 weeks of the experiment (not shown). Colony formation of cells infected with GFP-expressing virus was inhibited by ORG 2058 in a manner similar to other control T-47D derivatives, but retroviral expression of cyclin D1 resulted in marked resistance to ORG 2058-mediated growth inhibition (Fig. 2). Retroviral expression of cyclin E still allowed significant inhibition with the number of colonies reduced by ∼60%, but again more colonies were apparent than in progestin-treated control cells. These experiments confirmed the conclusion obtained with the clonal cell lines overexpressing the cyclins i.e. that cyclin D1 overexpression markedly reduced sensitivity to progestin-mediated inhibition of proliferation, but cyclin E overexpression was much less effective. As a basis for a more detailed examination of the mechanisms responsible for the progestin resistance documented in Figs. 1 and 2, responses in the first 4 days of treatment were characterized. Measurement of cell number over this timeframe revealed a modest decrease in relative cell number after 2 days of treatment of vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 A). The initial continuation of cell division in the presence of ORG 2058 is consistent with the early G1 site of progestin action and consequent ability of cells past this point in the cell cycle to complete a round of DNA replication and mitosis (26Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Pang G.Y.N. Musgrove E.A. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5084-5091PubMed Google Scholar). Between days 2 and 4, no further increase in cell number was seen following treatment with either 0.2 or 10 nm ORG 2058 (Fig. 3 A). Growth curves of cyclin E-overexpressing cells were similar to control cell lines, with an increase in cell number over the first 2 days of treatment but no subsequent increase in the presence of 0.2 or 10 nm ORG 2058 (not shown). In contrast, while the response of cyclin D1-overexpressing cells after 2 days was very similar to that of vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B), thereafter these cells continued to proliferate rather than becoming growth-arrested (Fig. 3 B). The relative numbers of vector-transfected cyclin D1 17–1 and cyclin E 17–3 cells after 96 h of treatment with 0.1–10 nmORG 2058 indicated decreased proliferation following treatment with 0.2 or 10 nm ORG 2058 (Fig. 3 C). The cyclin D1-overexpressing cell line was relatively insensitive, and the cyclin E-overexpressing cell line was of intermediate sensitivity, consistent with the longer term data presented in Fig. 1. Similarly, measurement of S phase fraction after 48 h of ORG 2058 treatment yielded data (Fig. 3 D) that paralleled those from the colony-forming assay: the S phase fraction of vector-transfected cells decreased to <20% of control, while the response was substantially attenuated in cyclin D1-overexpressing cells. The two cyclin E-overexpressing cell lines again were inhibited, although to a lesser degree than control cell lines. After treatment with maximally effective concentrations of ORG 2058 (0.2 or 10 nm) the S phase fraction of vector-transfected control cells decreased from 15–18% to <5% after treatment for ≥30 h (Fig. 4 A"
https://openalex.org/W2007068418,"An adenine-rich cis element at the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of Pabp1 mRNA is able to inhibit translation of its own mRNA. Similar inhibition of translation of a reporter β-galactosidase mRNA is observed when the adenine-rich auto regulatory sequence (ARS) is placed within the 5′-UTR of this mRNA. For this translational control the distance of the ARS from the 5′ cap is not important. However, it determines the number of 40 S ribosomal subunits bound to the translationally arrested mRNA. Inhibition of mRNA translation by this regulatory sequence occurs at the step of joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the pre-initiation complex. Translational arrest of the ARS containing mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system in the presence of exogenous Pabp1 protects the 5′-flanking region of the ARS from nuclease digestion. This protection depends on the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. The size and the sequence of the nucleotide-protected fragment depends on the location of the ARS within the 5′-UTR. When the ARS is located at a distance of about 78 nucleotides from the 5′ cap, a 40-nucleotide long region adjacent to the ARS is protected. On the other hand, when the ARS is moved further away from the 5′ cap to a distance of ∼267 nucleotides, a 100-nucleotide-long region adjacent to the ARS is protected from nuclease digestion. Nuclease protection is attributed to the presence of one or more stalled 40 S ribosomal subunits near the Pabp1-bound ARS.

It performs multiple functions related to mRNA translation and stability in eukaryotic cells. Pabp1 contains two distinct structural domains. Four tandemly repeated RNA-binding domains (RBD) at its N-terminal end are joined by a variable length linker region to the protein binding domain at the C-terminal end (3Grange T. Martins de Sa C.

The first two RBDs show high affinity toward poly(A), whereas the third and fourth RBDs have high affinity for polypyrimidines (8Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell.

However, its known functions can be attributed to its ability to bind poly(A) and several polypeptides (14Ernstein P. Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell.

The RBDs of Pabp1 are probably involved in binding to the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F complex, and the 5′ cap to circularize the translating mRNA (10Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A.

Pabp1 also functions as a determinant of mRNA stability/degradation by interacting with the poly(C) binding protein αCP1 and a poly(A) nuclease (27Sachs A.B. Deardorff J.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Boeck R. Tarun Jr., S. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A. Muller-Auer S. Sachs A.B. J. Biol.

Considering these important functions, it is not surprising that the Pabp1 gene is essential for viability of yeast cells (15Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In the absence of Pabp1 expression, joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 48 S pre-initiation complex is inhibited (15Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Besides circularizing translating mRNA, Pabp1 may participate in additional steps of mRNA translation (30Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1996; 9: 2421-2432Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 31Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Considering the important cellular functions of Pabp1, it is not unexpected that its expression is regulated in eukaryotes. In fact, the Pabp1 gene behaves like a primary response gene. Stimulation of proliferation of mammalian cells in culture or in vivoresults in increased Pabp1 synthesis (32Ulrich S.J. Appela E. Mercer W.E. Exp. Cell.

It is thought that an increase in the cellular Pabp1 level could alter translation and stability of some mRNAs. In addition to translational control, the stability of Pabp1 mRNA is altered when proliferating myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate into myotubes (38Adamou J. Bag J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Changes in the Pabp1 level is not the only way Pabp1 controls mRNA translation and stability. The interaction between Pabp1 and eIF4G could also be a target for regulation. In serum-stimulated Xenopus kidney cells, the association of Pabp1 with eIF4G is enhanced. This occurs by a distinct mechanism, independent of eIF4E phosphorylation-mediated increased interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E (39Fraser C.S. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 196-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the stability of Pabp1 is also regulated. Shut-off of host protein synthesis following poliovirus or coxsackievirus infection is achieved at least in part through the cleavage of Pabp1 and eIF4G by viral 2A proteases (40Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar, 41Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton J.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 17: 709-717Crossref Google Scholar). Pabp1 expression also responds to stress. In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans the Pabp1 mRNA level increased 3- to 6-fold in response to stress (43Cherkasova V. Ayyadevara S. Eglimez N. Reis R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, several pathways exist to control the function of this important cellular protein. To examine how Pabp1 mRNA translation is regulated in eukaryotic cells, several laboratories have focused their attention to its unusually long (∼500 nucleotides) 5′-UTR. Within its long 5′-UTR, it has at least two translational control elements. An oligopyrimidine tract is located at the 5′ terminus (37Hornstein E. Git A. Braunstein I. Avni D. Meyuhas O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This makes Pabp1 mRNA a member of the TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine) family of mRNAs. Several members of this family code for various components of the translation apparatus like the ribosomal proteins and elongation factor Tu. The oligopyrimidine tract within the first 32 nucleotides of Pabp1 mRNA is necessary for translational control in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts but not in HeLa cells (37Hornstein E. Git A. Braunstein I. Avni D. Meyuhas O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The C residue at the 5′ cap is essential for translational control. The second regulator of translation, a highly conserved oligo(A)-rich region, is present near the TOP sequence. In vitro protein binding studies show that Pabp1 binds to this region of its own mRNA (44Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45Berger L.C. Bag J. Sells B.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 46DeMeloNeto O.P. Standart N. Disa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This oligo(A)-rich region acts as an autoregulatory sequence (ARS) for Pabp1 mRNA translation. Deletion of the ARS region enhances Pabp1 mRNA translation in both in vitro (44Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 46DeMeloNeto O.P. Standart N. Disa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in vivo systems (47Wu J. Bag J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34535-34542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ARS region is sufficient to confer translational arrest of the heterologous reporter β-galactosidase mRNA (47Wu J. Bag J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34535-34542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). TOP and ARS may function in a cell-specific manner (37Hornstein E. Git A. Braunstein I. Avni D. Meyuhas O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is likely that the two cis elements of translational control can work independently from one another. There is no detectable synergistic effect on the translational repression of the reporter β-galactosidase mRNA in HeLa cells when both TOP and ARS are present at its 5′-UTR (47Wu J. Bag J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34535-34542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated how binding of Pabp1 to the ARS prevents translation. Results presented here suggest that the ARS·Pabp1 complex prevents the movement of the 40 S ribosomal subunit past the ARS. Consequently, the 40 S subunit stalls near the Pabp1-bound ARS and fails to reach the initiation codon to form the 80 S initiation complex. Several reporter plasmids suitable for expression in mammalian cells were constructed by fusing different regions of the 5′-UTR of Pabp1 mRNA with the β-galactosidase coding region. The vector-derived 5′-UTR of the β-galactosidase mRNA was deleted from the CMV-SPORT-β-Gal plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) by digesting it withNcoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. PCR was used to amplify the regions from nucleotides 132 to 350 and 58 to 350 of Pabp1 mRNA, and the amplified products were ligated to theNcoI/EcoRI-digested vector fragment to generate the p350-Gal and ARS p350-Gal plasmids, respectively (47Wu J. Bag J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34535-34542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The forward (sense) and the reverse (antisense) primers used in PCR for constructing the p350-Gal plasmid were catgaccatggTCCGCGTCTCCCCCG and acgatgaattcCGCAGAACGGGGTCG, respectively. Similarly, the forward primer for constructing the ARS p350-Gal plasmid was catgaccatggCACATTTATTATTAAA, and the reverse primer was the same as described before for making the p350-Gal plasmid. The lowercase letters indicate the NcoI (ccatgg) and EcoRI (gaattc) recognition sequences and 5 additional nucleotides at the 5′-end of each primer. To generate the third reporter plasmid, where the ARS was moved closer to the initiation codon, the region between nucleotides 132 and 360 of Pabp1 mRNA was amplified with the same forward primer as the one used for generating the p350-Gal clone, and the sequence of the reverse primer was ACTCAACGGCCGCAGAAC. The 228-bp PCR product was digested withXmaIII (3Grange T. Martins de Sa C. Odos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In a separate reaction the ARS region between nucleotides 58 and 146 was amplified by PCR. The forward primer with the XmaIII recognition sequence and additional 5 nucleotides at the 5′-end (shown by lowercase letters) and the reverse primer with the EcoRI recognition sequence and additional 5 nucleotides at the 5′-end were used for PCR. The sequences of these oligomers are catgacggccgCACATTTATTATTAAA and acgatgaattcCGGGGGAGACGCGGA, respectively. The PCR-generated ARS region was ligated to theXmaIII-digested 228-bp PCR product. The 316-bp-ligated product was purified from the agarose gel and ligated to the NcoI/EcoRI-digested CMV-SPORT-β-Gal vector for cloning. The PCR reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 200 μmdNTPs, 200 ng of each primer, 2 units of Taq polymerase, 20 ng of pHU73 plasmid as the template for 35 cycles. Each cycle was at 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and the final cycle was at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The digested product of the correct size was gel-purified using a kit (Qiagen) and used for constructing the reporter plasmids. In addition to the β-galactosidase reporter constructs, several plasmids were made forin vitro RNA synthesis. The p350-Gal and p350 ARS-Gal plasmids were digested with the NcoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and the Pabp1 mRNA 5′-UTR containing insert was isolated. The gel-purified insert was ligated to theNcoI/EcoRI-digested PGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) vector to generate PGEM-p350 and PGEM p350-ARS clones. For measuring the β-galactosidase and Pabp1 mRNA levels by using RNase protection assay, a selected region of these mRNAs was cloned into the PGEM-T Easy vector. The region between nucleotides 734 and 1049 of the CMV-SPORT-β-Gal vector was amplified by PCR. The sequence of the forward sense primer and the reverse antisense primers, including the NcoI and EcoRI adaptors (lowercase) were catgaccatggAGAGTCCAGGCCGAG and acgatgaattcCGCCGGTCGCTACCA, respectively. The PCR product was gel-purified and ligated to theNcoI/EcoRI-digested PGEM-T Easy vector to generate the PGEM-β-Gal plasmid. Transcription of this plasmid with SP6 polymerase in vitro produced an RNA complementary to the 3′-UTR of β-galactosidase mRNA. Similarly the PGEM-Pabp1 plasmid was made by subcloning the 539-bp-long NcoI/EcoRI fragment of the pHu73 plasmid into the PGEM-T Easy vector. Transcription of the NcoI-digested PGEM-Pabp1 by SP6 polymerase produced an RNA complementary to the Pabp1-mRNA. All clones were maintained in Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and the plasmid DNA was isolated using a endotoxin-free plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR-derived region of all plasmids was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The schematic maps of the plasmids are shown in Fig. 1 (see below). Approximately 1 × 106 HeLa WS cells were grown on a 12-well dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada), and used for transfection. Subconfluent cultures were transfected in a serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with plasmid DNA. Approximately 1–2 μg of DNA was incubated with 10 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 400 μl of Opti-MEM medium at 20 °C for 30 min before being added to the cells. Cells were incubated with the DNA/liposome mixture for 6 h at 37 °C, and then the DNA-containing medium was removed, and transfected cells were allowed to grow for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were also co-transfected with 0.75 μg of pCAT3 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to monitor the transfection efficiencies between experiments by measuring SV40 promoter driven expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. The transfected cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate-buffered saline, 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and lysed directly with 200 μl of a buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (33Mercer W.E. Jaskulski D. Shields M.T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 181: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The separated polypeptides were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and levels of β-galactosidase and CAT polypeptides were determined by using mouse anti β-galactosidase and rabbit anti-CAT antibodies (Sigma Chemical Co., Oakville, Ontario, Canada), respectively. The antigen·antibody complex was visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies using Lumi-Light+ Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml heparin, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide). After removing the nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the polysomes were pelleted from the 12,000 × g supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a 75 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. The polysomal pellet was suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (44Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The supernatant fraction was used as the source for post-polysomal material. The RNA from both fractions was isolated in the presence of 4 m guanidine thiocyanate (48Chomoczynski P. Sacche N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Polysomal and post-polysomal RNA samples corresponding to equal numbers of cells were used for analysis. In some experiments, the 12,000 × g supernatant faction was centrifuged in a 12-ml 10–50% sucrose gradient, containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgOAc, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 41Ti rotor for 3 h (35Berger L.C. Bag J. Sells B.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions of 1 ml each were collected using an Auto Densi-Flow IIC apparatus (Buchler Instruments). Total RNA from each fraction was isolated as described before and precipitated with ethanol using 5 μg of yeast tRNA as the carrier. Total cellular RNA was isolated by using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The integrity of the RNA samples was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as previously described (35Berger L.C. Bag J. Sells B.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Samples containing equal amounts of 28 S rRNA were used for measuring the level of β-galactosidase, Pabp1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs by RNase protection assay (47Wu J. Bag J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34535-34542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using the Hybspeed RPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA probes were produced by SP6 polymerase transcription of the PGEM-Gal and PGEM-Pabp1 plasmids. Due to the presence of sequence derived from the vector, hybridization of the 381-nucleotide-long β-galactosidase probe and 605-nucleotide-long Pabp1 probe, respectively, produced 315- and 539-nucleotide-long RNase protected fragments. The RNA probe for measuring the GAPDH mRNA level was generated by T7 polymerase transcription of a commercially available clone (Ambion). Again, due to the presence of a short sequence that does not hybridize to the GAPDH mRNA, the 374-nucleotide-long RNA probe produced a shorter 316-nucleotide-long RNase protected fragment. The shorter RNase-protected fragment of the probe permitted us to assess the presence of any undigested probe in the RNase protected sample. To investigate the presence of stalled 40 S ribosomal subunits at a site downstream from the ARS in the translationally arrested RNA, this region's resistance to nuclease digestion was examined. The methods used in these studies were similar to those previously described to examine the ribosome binding sites of translating mRNA (50Wolin S. Walter P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3559-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 51Cao J. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 52Kolupaeva G.V. Pestova T.

For the nuclease protection analysis of translating RNA-truncated Pabp1 mRNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–350 (H350) and 132–350 (p350) and the ARS region (nucleotides 58–146) joined to the p350 (p350 ARS) were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (44Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The pHu73 plasmid (3Grange T. Martins de Sa C. Odos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was linearized with XmaIII, and the PGEM-p350 and PGEM-p350 ARS plasmids were linearized withEcoRI to use as a template in the in vitroreactions to produce, respectively, the H350, p350, and p350 ARS RNAs.In vitro transcription was performed using a Transprobe T kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Quebec, Canada) containing m7GpppG capping solution according to the manufacturer's protocol. A small amount of [α-32P]UTP (1 μCi) was added in a 25-μl reaction to examine the synthesis of RNA. The synthesized RNA was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified by using a Qiagen column. Approximately 50 ng of RNA was used in 50 μl of mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) cell-free translation system (44Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Promega, Madison, WI). Due to the absence of downstream initiation codon in the capped RNA samples, only the 40 S ribosomal subunits could join to for"

The present study identified novel trophinin gene transcripts, which encode proteins structurally distinct from trophinin protein in the mouse. We designated these proteins “magphinins,” because they share consensus amino acid sequences with MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen) superfamily proteins. Among many MAGE proteins, magphinins are closely related to NRAGE, which mediates p75 neurotrophin receptor-dependent apoptosis, and necdin, which is a strong suppressor of cell proliferation in post-mitotic neurons. There are three major forms of magphinins, i.e. magphinin-α, -β, and -γ, in the mouse, which are formed due to alternative usage of different exons. Northern blot analysis revealed that magphinins are expressed in brain, ovary, testis, and epididymis. In addition, Western blot analysis and in vitro translation experiments showed that magphinins expressed in the mouse ovary and testis are translation products utilizing the second initiation AUG codon and contain an active nuclear localization signal. Ectopic expression of magphinins in mammalian cells resulted in nuclear localization of magphinin and suppressed cell proliferation. Immunohistochemistry of the mouse ovary and testis showed that magphinin proteins are distributed in the cytoplasm of the male and female germ cells, whereas these proteins are translocated to the nucleus at a specific stage of gametogenesis. These results strongly suggest that magphinins regulate cell proliferation during gametogenesis in the mouse.

The process of implantation varies markedly between species (1Carson D.D. Bagchi I. Dey S.K. Enders A.C. Fazleabas A.T. Lessey B.A. Yoshinaga K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and genes involved in this process display remarkably high spontaneous mutational rates (2Roberts R.M. Ealy A.D. Alexenko A.P. Han C.S. Ezashi T. Placenta. 1999; 20: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting a strong adaptive selection pressure. The study of human embryo implantation at the molecular level is hampered by the fact thatin vivo studies with an implanting embryo in place are difficult to perform and are generally considered ethically unacceptable. To overcome this problem, we established an in vitro cell culture system using two human cell lines, trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H and endometrial adenocarcinoma SNG-M. These two cell types adhered with each other at their respective apical cell membranes and exhibited morphologies resembling the cells at the initial adhesion steps of embryo implantation (3Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki N. Zara J. Sato T. Ong E. Bakhiet N. Oshima R.G. Watson K.L. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5027-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using this model system, we identified a unique protein, trophinin, by means of expression cloning. Thus a mammalian expression cDNA library constructed from HT-H cells was transfected into COS cells, and COS cells that became adhesive to SNG-M cells were selected. When COS cells acquired trophinin and trophinin-associated cytoplasmic proteins, tastin and bystin, COS cells adhered to SNG-M (3Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S.

Human trophinin is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein, and more than 90% of the trophinin polypeptide consists of tandem decapeptide repeats, which may be a key structural element mediating homophilic interactions between trophinin-expressing cells. The N terminus of human trophinin is predicted to be cytoplasmic and interacts with cytoplasmic proteins, bystin and tastin (3Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki N. Zara J. Sato T. Ong E. Bakhiet N. Oshima R.G. Watson K.L. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5027-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Trophinin is strongly expressed on the plasma membrane of trophectoderm cells of Rhesus monkey blastocysts, particularly in those cells located at the embryonic pole where the initial adhesion to the endometrium takes place (3Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In human placenta, high levels of trophinin transcripts and proteins have been detected in the trophoblasts and the endometrial glandular epithelial cells at the utero-placental interface during early pregnancy (6Suzuki N. Nakayama J. Shih I.-M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Fukuda M.N. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Minimal trophinin expression has been observed in other tissues. Based on these findings, it has been proposed that trophinin may mediate the initial adhesion of the blastocyst to the endometrium during implantation of human embryos (3Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). During the course of our study of the mouse trophinin gene, we found that the upstream region of the trophinin gene is transcribed in several alternatively spliced forms. Surprisingly, these alternatively spliced transcripts were translated into proteins structurally distinct from trophinin. Domains of these proteins exhibited significant homology to MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen)1superfamily proteins (7van der Bruggen P. Traversari C. Chomez P. Lurquin C. De Plaen E.

We designated the novel MAGE proteins encoded by the trophinin gene “magphinins” (GenBankTM accession numberAB017108). 2Saburi et al., unpublished data., 3The sequences of mRNAs are available from GenBankTM under accession numbers AF331848 (mouse trophinin genomic DNA), AF241244 (mouse trophinin mRNA), AF241245 (mouse magphinin-α mRNA), AF288605 (mouse magphinin-β mRNA), andAF288606 (mouse magphinin-γ mRNA). Necdin is a neuron-specific growth suppressor and binds to a cellular transcription factor, E2F-1 (E2 promoter bindingfactor-1), which regulates the expression of the cell-cycle-specific genes (11Taniura H.

The necdin gene knock-out mouse showed early post-natal lethality and phenotypes associated with Prader-Willi syndrome, a neurobehavioral disorder, under a limited genetic background (16Gerard M.

NRAGE, which was identified from a neural crest-derived cDNA library, binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor, arrests cell proliferation, and induces the p75 neurotrophin receptor-dependent apoptosis in sympathetic neuronal precursor cells (9Salehi A.H.

Dlxin-1, a mouse orthologue of MAGE-D1, has been identified as a Dlx5-binding protein, and regulates transcription mediated by Dlx/Msx homeodomain proteins (14Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, common features of other MAGE superfamily proteins are that they are expressed specifically in tumor cells derived from various tissues and in the testis (12De Plaen E. De Backer O. Amaud D. Bonjean B. Chomez P. Martelange V. Avner P. Baldacci P. Babinet C. Hwang S.Y. Knowles B. Boon T. Genomics. 1999; 55: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In particular, the MAGE proteins are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of male germ cells (8Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chomez P. Williams R. De Backer O. Boon T. Vennstrem B. Immunogenetics. 1995; 43: 97-100Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In mice, the Mage-a and -b genes are expressed in the testis as well as in blastocyst stage embryos (12De Plaen E. De Backer O. Amaud D. Bonjean B. Chomez P. Martelange V. Avner P. Baldacci P.

All of the transcripts encode the MAGE homology domain. Newly identified magphinin transcripts lack most of trophinin's coding region. In contrast, trophinin protein lacks the MAGE domain by translating from a downstream AUG codon. Thus the trophinin gene appears to produce two distinct sets of proteins, trophinin and magphinins. Ectopic expression of magphinins in mammalian cells results in nuclear localization of magphinins and remarkably arrests cell proliferation. In this study, we show that magphinin proteins were found in the male and female germ cells and that they enter the nucleus at a specific stage of gametogenesis, suggesting that magphinins regulate cell proliferation during gametogenesis. Thus the present report describes an intriguing nature of the trophinin gene, i.e. its production of trophinin and magphinin, and each appears to play a unique respective role in mammalian reproduction. The mouse trophinin genomic clone was isolated from a phage library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) constructed from the mouse 129/SvJ strain using the human trophinin cDNA as a probe. Phage DNA from a positive clone was digested with BamHI, HindIII, or XhoI, subcloned into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene), and sequenced. A BAC genomic clone encoding the 5′-region of the mouse trophinin/magphinin gene was obtained using PCR screening. The sequences of the primers used for this screening are: forward, 5′-AGACCAGACAAAGATCCCAA-3′ (F267), and reverse, 5′-ATGAGGAGACCCAGCTTAGG-3′ (R503). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA extracted from various organs of adult mouse (ICR strain, 12 weeks old), using oligo(dT) latex beads (Nihon Roche, Tokyo). RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). RNA blots were fixed onto the membrane by UV irradiation and hybridized with 32P-labeled trophinin and magphinin probes (see Fig. 1A) in 50% formamide hybridization buffer at 42 °C for 20 h. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, 0.5× SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 60 °C for 20 min, 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C, and were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 12 h. Poly(A)+RNA was purified from total RNA isolated from a whole adult mouse brain. RACE reactions were carried out on the isolated poly(A)+ RNA using the 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using the specific primer: 5′-TAATACCAGCACCATCA-3′ (GSP1) The dC-tailed cDNAs were subjected to serial PCR using the following specific primers: GSP2 (first PCR), 5′-CTGGTAGTAGCTCT-TGGTTG-3′, and GSP3 (nested PCR), 5′-CTGCATTTTCTTGGGCTCGG-3′. PCR products, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, were subcloned into pBluescript KS− vector (Stratagene), and sequenced. The mouse brain Cap site cDNA dT (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) was subjected to serial PCR using the following specific reverse primers; TGP1 (first PCR), 5′-CCTGACTGATCTGGGTGAAC-3′, and TGP2 (nested PCR), 5′- GTCCTTTTCTGTGGTCTCCG-3′. The PCR products were subcloned and sequenced as described above. The antibody against the MAGE domain of magphinin, MGPM, was raised by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide, WGRRLPPPRDVAILQERANKLC (amino acid residues from 569 to 589 of magphinin-α, except for the cysteine residue added for conjugation) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Polyscience, Warrenton, PA). The antibody against theN-terminal region of magphinin, MGPN, was raised by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide, CVQSETTEKDPPIASRSKKN (amino acid residues from 32 to 50 of magphinin-α, except for the cysteine residue added for conjugation). Polyclonal anti-mouse trophinin antibody was described previously (20Suzuki N. Nadano D. Paria B.C. Kupriyanov S. Sugihara K. Fukuda M.N. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). IgG was purified from anti-sera using a protein A-Sepharose column (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The mouse brain and spleen tissues were extracted in 3 volumes of 1× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Sigma). Cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from murine adult brain, ovary, testis, and epididymis by using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Each sample of these tissues was combined with a 2× SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose filter as described previously (20Suzuki N. Nadano D. Paria B.C. Kupriyanov S. Sugihara K. Fukuda M.N. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The filters were treated with a blocking solution (1% skimmed milk in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% Tween 20), and were reacted with anti-mouse trophinin antibody or anti-magphinin antibodies (either MGPM or MGPN, see above) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the chemiluminescent ECLplus reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and then exposures of the filter were made to BioMax x-ray film (Kodak). Magphinin cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In vitro translation of cDNA was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems; Promega, Madison, WI) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [35S]methionine. The lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and reaction products were visualized by fluorography. Ten microliters of in vitrotranslation reaction mixture, as described above, was diluted with 620 μl of PBS and then added with 30 μl of polyclonal (rabbit) anti-magphinin antibodies MGPM or MGPN. After incubation at 4 °C for 6 h, 45 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated further at 4 °C for 20 h on a rotating device. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer and further with PBS. The beads were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The 35S-labeled and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by fluorography. DNA sequence for Myc-epitope was amplified by PCR using a forward primer, TTTGGATCCGAACAGAAACTGATCTCT (BamHI site underlined), and a reverse primer, GATTTAGTCTAGACTATAG (XbaI site underlined), and, after the restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR product was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) at the BamHI site andXbaI site (pcDNA3.1-Myc vector). The DNA sequence for the HA-epitope was amplified by PCR using a forward primer, TGAGTAAGCTTGCCATGTACCCTTATGATGTG (HindIII site underlined; initiation AUG codonitalic), and a reverse primer, CGGCCGAATTCGGGAGAGGCATAATCTGG (EcoRI site underlined), and, after the restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR product was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) at the HindIII site and EcoRI site (pcDNA3.1-HA vector). The DNA sequences for full-length magphinin-α cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a forward primer, AGCCTGAATTCAAGATGGATAGAAGAAATGACC (EcoRI site underlined), and a reverse primer, TCTGGATCCGCCGTAAGGGAAGCCACAG (BamHI site underlined). After the restriction enzyme digestion, the DNA fragment encoding the full-length magphinin-α cDNA was inserted in-frame into the pcDNA3.1-Myc vector at the 5′-end of the coding sequence of Myc-epitope (magphinin-α-Myc). TheEcoRI-XbaI fragment, including theC-terminal Myc-tagged magphinin-α cDNA, was digested out from the magphinin-α-Myc construct vector and then inserted in-frame into the pcDNA3.1-HA vector at the 3′-end of the coding sequence of HA-epitope (HA-magphinin-α-Myc). An expression vector for ΔN-magphinin-α, an N-terminal region-truncated magphinin-α, was constructed as follows. DNA sequences for ΔN-magphinin-α cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a forward primer, CCAAGAAAGCTTCTACGGC (HindIII site underlined), and a reverse primer, TCTGGATCCGCCGTAAGGGAAGCCACAG (BamHI site underlined). After the restriction enzyme digestion, the DNA fragment was inserted in-frame into the pcDNA3.1-Myc vector at the 5′-end of the coding sequence of the Myc-epitope (ΔN-magphinin-α-Myc). The cell cycle was synchronized by incubating cells for 20 h in medium containing 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma). The cells were then cultured in a medium without thymidine for 10 h. Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was added into the medium at a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and the cells were cultured for an additional 16 h (21Cao G. Liu L.M. Cleary S.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in a medium containing 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). The cells incorporated with BrdUrd were detected by immunocytochemistry using monoclonal (mouse IgG) anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody under a fluorescence microscope. Saos-2 cells were separately transfected with the following plasmid vectors constructed in pcDNA3.1. Thus, each pcDNA3.1 vector contained the cDNA insert for magphinin-α, magphinin-β, magphinin-γ, ΔN-magphinin-α, ΔN-magphinin-β, ΔN-magphinin-βΔ22, and ΔN-magphinin-γ. The vectors having necdin cDNA was used as a positive control, and that without an insert was used as a negative control. For each transfection 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used per each 35-mm dish using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were transferred to a 10-cm dish. Because pcDNA3.1 contains a neomycin-resistant gene, G418 was added into the culture medium at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml 48 h after transfection, and the cells were cultured for 14 days. To visualize each colony, cells were fixed with 10% acetic acid/10% methanol at room temperature for 15 min and stained with 0.4% crystal violet dissolved in 20% ethanol. The GC1spg cell line established from murine type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, using the SV40 large T antigen (22Hofmann M.C. Narisawa S. Hess R.A. Millan J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Millan of the Burnham Institute. GC1spg cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 containing either HA-magphinin-α-Myc or ΔN-magphinin-α-Myc cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and treated with polyclonal (rabbit) anti-HA antibodies (BAbCO, Richmond, CA) or monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10; mouse IgG, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) were used as secondary antibodies. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections of murine ovary and testis were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Immunostaining was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-trophinin (TRO) or anti-magphinin (MGPM) antibodies using an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin or methyl green. A 706-bp EcoRI fragment (1605–2311 of trophinin/magphinin cDNA) was subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pGEM-3Z plasmid vector (Promega). The plasmid DNA was linearized by digesting with HindIII for an antisense probe or with NotI for a sense probe. A digoxigenin-labeled sense or antisense cRNA probe was prepared using digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (6Suzuki N. Nakayama J. Shih I.-M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Fukuda M.N. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sequencing of genomic clones of the murinetrophinin gene established that the entire gene spans about 13.6 kb (Fig. 1A). The 5′ terminus ends at an undefined expressed sequence tag cluster and the 3′-end terminates at the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pseudogene. Sequences encoding a protein homologous to human trophinin were found near the 3′-region of mouse trophinin gene as an open reading frame contained on a large exon followed by a short intron and the 3′-untranslated region, including a poly(A) signal. In parallel to this genomic sequencing analysis, RT-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mouse ovulated oocytes identified a cDNA containing sequences upstream of the previously known trophinin sequences. 4Saburi et al.; GenBankTMaccession number AB017108. (This cDNA was designated as magphinin-α (Fig.1A).) When we searched the data base using magphinin-α sequences, we detected additional sequences overlapping with magphinin-α. Sequencing of several expressed sequence tag clones, RT-PCR using primers A and B (Fig. 1A), 5′-RACE of the RT-PCR products, and screening of a brain cap site cDNA dT library (see “Materials and Methods”) established five transcripts for full-length trophinin and magphinins α, β, βΔ22 and γ, as summarized in Fig. 1A. These results indicate that the trophinin gene belongs to the MAGE gene family (7van der Bruggen P. Traversari C. Chomez P. Lurquin C. De Plaen E. Van den Eynde B. Knuth A. Boon T. Science. 1991; 254: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar, 8Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we identified trophinin by expression cloning based on cell adhesion activity (3Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the light of present results, previously reported trophinin cDNA is a partial mRNA sequence, representing exons 12 and 13 (Fig. 1A). However, as described below, trophinin protein expressed in vivo appears to be initiated from AUG in exon 12, which may explain why the originally identified trophinin cDNA was derived from the 3′-region, exons 12 and 13, of this gene. The existence of novel magphinin/trophinin transcripts prompted us to re-examine the expression of the trophinin gene in the mouse. Northern blot analysis with probe-1 specific to trophinin (Fig. 1A) detected a 6.5-kb species in the cerebrum, cerebellum, ovary, uterus, testis, and epididymis (Fig.1B, left). Re-probing the same blot with probe-2 specific to both magphinin and trophinin (Fig. 1A), yielded three signals of 6.5, 3.2, and 2.7 kb, roughly corresponding in size to trophinin, magphinin-α, and magphinin-β/γ mRNAs, respectively (Fig. 1B, right). These results indicate that both mRNAs encoding magphinin and trophinin are expressed in the brain and that magphinin transcripts are expressed particularly in the male and female reproductive organs in the mouse. The above results indicate that the trophinin gene could produce at least five translation products depending on how mRNA splicing occurs. As shown in Fig.1A, full-length, 6.5-kb trophinin mRNA contains an open reading frame encoding a 196-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). However, a previous study showed that trophinin protein expressed in the mouse uterus is 110 kDa (20Suzuki N. Nadano D. Paria B.C. Kupriyanov S. Sugihara K. Fukuda M.N. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of mouse brain extract showed an intense 110-kDa band for trophinin but not a 196-kDa band (Fig. 2B). No fragments reactive with anti-magphinin antibodies were detected in the brain extract (Fig. 2C). These results exclude the possibility that the 110-kDa protein is derived from proteolytic fragmentation of 196-kDa protein and suggest that the 110-kDa trophinin protein was produced by initiation from a downstream AUG codon (TableI). These results thus indicate that trophinin protein can be produced by the 3′ half of the trophinin gene.Figure 2Predicted trophinin and magphinin protein structures and synthesis of magphinin proteins in vitroand in vivo.A, predicted polypeptide structures of mouse trophinin and magphinin are shown. Although trophinin mRNA has an open reading frame encoding a 196.3-kDa protein, the trophinin protein expressed in mouse adult brain is 107 kDa (see Fig. 2B), suggesting the usage of t"

(1996) Virology 216, 60-70), have been studied at neutral and fusion (low) pH values by using its derived peptides. Cell-to-cell fusion, translocation of phosphatidylserine, and inhibition of fusion of pG-transfected cells defined the p9 + p2 (fragment 11, sequence 56-110) as a fragment with higher specific activity for anionic phospholipid aggregation than the previously reported p2. While fragment 11, p2, and p3 showed interactions with anionic phospholipids, p9 and p4 showed no interactions with any phospholipids. When added to a cell monolayer model at low pH, fragment 11 induced pH-dependent cell-to-cell fusion and translocated phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane. At low pH and in the presence of anionic phospholipids, fragment 11 showed more than 80% beta-sheet conformation (IR and CD spectroscopies). Finally, anti-fragment 11 antibodies inhibited low pH-dependent pG-transfected cell-to-cell fusion. All of the data support the conclusion that fragment 11 is a primary determinant of some of the viral cell fusion events in VHSV."

By immunoprecipitation experiments and mass spectrometry analyses, we identified a human protein previously known as HSPC021 that is associated with Int-6. Exposure of Jurkat cells to the phosphatase inhibitor H2O2 triggers a marked phosphorylation on tyrosine of HSPC021. Several experiments were performed to evaluate whether this protein is associated with eIF3. It was observed that HSPC021 coelutes with Int-6 and eIF3 in gel filtration, coimmunoprecipitates with eIF3, and is incorporated into eIF3 both in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and in COS7 cells. A direct protein-protein interaction occurs between HSPC021 and Int-6, but the analysis of different mutants of HSPC021 indicated that a larger region of the protein is necessary for incorporation into eIF3 as compared with binding to Int-6. Taken together, our results establish that HSPC021 is tightly associated with the mammalian translation initiation factor eIF3. Analysis of the primary sequence of HSPC021 from different species revealed the presence of a tetratricopeptide repeat, a proteasome-COP9 (constitutivephotomorphogenesis 9) signalosome-initiation factor 3 domain along with a Pumilio FBF repeat.

Buttitta F. Miyazaki S. Gallahan D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This integration within the gene causes production of truncated transcripts. Hence, either loss of expression of the modified allele or production of shortened forms of the protein alters control of cell growth. The human cDNA coding for Int-6 was isolated in a two-hybrid screen using the Tax transforming protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 as bait (2Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P.

Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.B.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). This complex establishes multiple protein-protein interactions with other translation initiation factors. For example, it has been shown that eIF3 contacts eIF5 and eIF1 (8Bandyopadhyay A. Maitra U.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) have shown the existence of a complex including the yeast initiation factors eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF5 and initiator Met-tRNA. The presence of Int-6 in eIF3 purified from various organisms is now well established (3Asano K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10056-10062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but several observations show that Int-6 is also present in other cellular protein complexes. Int-6 includes both a nuclear export signal at its N terminus and a nuclear localization signal, suggesting that the protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm (18Guo J. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, endogenous Int-6 of primary lymphocytes has been observed in the nuclear compartment, partly associated with the nuclear bodies containing the promyelocytic leukemia protein (19Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This localization is related to the ability of Int-6 to interact with the Ret finger protein (19Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that binds to promyelocytic leukemia protein (20Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A nuclear localization of Int-6 has also been observed in the plantArabidopsis thaliana. In this organism, it has been shown that Int-6 together with eIF3-p110 interacts with the COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome, which plays an important role in the control of photomorphogenesis (16Yahalom A. Kim T.H. Winter E. Karniol B. von Arnim A.G. Chamovitz D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 334-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In cells of the root, Int-6 is seen predominantly within the nucleus. In mammalian cells also, the localization of Int-6 might differ from one cell type to another. Recently, data on the disruption of the gene encoding the Int-6 ortholog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe have been reported by several groups (17Akiyoshi Y. Clayton J. Phan L. Yamamoto M. Hinnebusch A.G. Watanabe Y. Asano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10056-10062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I.

Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Yeast strains lacking Int-6 were found to grow slowly in minimal medium and to exhibit an increased sensitivity to various drugs including caffeine, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide (21Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3993-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conversely, the overexpression of Int-6 in this organism leads to resistance to these drugs. This effect was related to an increase in the amounts of RNA produced by several genes regulated by Pap-1, the S. pombe homolog of AP-1 (21Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3993-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether this effect is the consequence of altered translation of a regulatory factor or of a direct transcriptional action of Int-6. The loss of Int-6 in S. pombe also causes a weak deleterious effect on chromosome segregation by a modification of the microtubule assembly/disassembly (23Yen H.C. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This effect is highly reinforced by mutations in the ras1 gene. A similar effect was observed with the S. pombe homolog of eIF3-p66, Moe1, which interacts with Int-6. Interestingly, when Moe1 is absent, the level of Int-6 decreases and its subcellular localization is modified, the protein being then present within the nucleus. The inverse situation occurs when the int-6 gene is disrupted. This suggests that the interaction between Moe1 and Int-6 is important for the presence of both proteins in the cytoplasm. The effect on chromosome segregation might be an explanation of the transforming activity of the putative truncated Int-6 forms resulting from mouse mammary tumor virus integration (23Yen H.C. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All of these data show that Int-6 exerts complex regulatory roles in the cell and that much remains to be understood about the function of this protein. With the exception of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conservation of Int-6 among various species of eukaryotes (S. pombe (17Akiyoshi Y. Clayton J. Phan L. Yamamoto M. Hinnebusch A.G. Watanabe Y.

By comparing these sequences, we noticed a good conservation of a consensus phosphorylation site on tyrosine at position 144 in the human sequence. Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine whether Int-6 can be phosphorylated on tyrosine. Under the conditions tested, we did not observe such a phosphorylation, but it appeared that Int-6 coprecipitated a protein showing an apparent molecular mass of 69 kDa, which was very clearly revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. This protein has been identified by mass spectrometry, and we show in this report that it associates with the eIF3 translation initiation factor. Jurkat and MT4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. BHK21 and COS7 cells were cultured under the same conditions except that the medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium instead of RPMI. COS7 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method in 100-mm diameter Petri dishes. Treatment of cells with 10 mmH2O2 was performed by the addition of 114 μl of a 3% H2O2 solution in 10 ml of culture medium. After incubation for 15 min, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet of cells was stored at −80 °C after freezing in a liquid nitrogen bath. Cells corresponding to 10 ml of culture at 1 × 106 cells/ml were resuspended in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40-desoxycholate lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate) supplemented extemporaneously with 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 40 mm sodium orthovanadate. After 20 min at 4 °C, the tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min. 250 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 1 μl of antibody and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The mix was then added to 25 μl of protein A beads previously equilibrated in the Nonidet P-40-desoxycholate lysis buffer and further incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 2000 rpm and washed three times with 250 μl of Nonidet P-40-desoxycholate lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer by incubation at 80 °C for 10 min. In some experiments, the Nonidet P-40-desoxycholate lysis buffer was replaced by the Nonidet P-40 or radioimmune precipitation buffers (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 447-470Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation was done similarly with 250 ml of cells lysed in 10 ml of Nonidet P-40-desoxycholate lysis buffer. After the final wash, proteins were eluted from the protein A beads (1 ml) in 2 ml of 20 mm Hepes pH 7.0, 1% SDS by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. Proteins of the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of four volumes of acetone (overnight at −20 °C). After centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 × g, the protein pellet was dried and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and analyzed by immunoblot using standard procedures. When the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were used, the membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin instead of 5% dry milk in the other cases. Revelation of the secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase was performed using ECL or ECLplus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When probed with a secondary antibody coupled to cyanine 5, the membrane was scanned with a STORM860 apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 19 amino acids of HSPC021 and to the N-terminal 19 amino acids of eIF3-p66 were chemically synthesized and coupled to ovalbumin. Rabbits were immunized with these conjugates. The antiserum was used diluted 1:1000 for immunoblotting and 1:250 for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with a zinc stain kit (Bio-Rad), and the band at 69 kDa was excised. After a wash with 50% acetonitrile, gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reswollen in 20 μl of 25 mmNH4HCO3 containing 0.5 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, a 0.5-μl aliquot was removed for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis. Monoisotopic peptide masses were assigned and used for data base searching. The gel pieces were then extracted with 5% formic acid solution and then with acetonitrile. The extracts were combined with the original digest, and the sample was evaporated to dryness. The sample was dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and desalted using a Zip Tip (Millipore Corp.). Elution of the peptides was performed with 5–10 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid solution. The peptide solution was introduced into a glass capillary (Protana) for nanoelectrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a Q-TOF hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass) in order to obtain sequence information. 100 × 106 Jurkat cells were lysed by freeze-thaw in 400 μl of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation and subjected to nuclease digestion for 90 min (benzonase; Sigma). The whole cell extract was loaded at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min on a Superose 6 HR10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions of 0.6 ml each were collected and concentrated with 25 μl of StrataClean resin (Stratagene). Gels for immunoblots were done with one-fifth of each fraction. The HSPC021 cDNA was obtained from the United Kingdom Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center (Image clone 2518785) (25Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The HSPC021 coding sequence was amplified by PCR with the following sense and antisense primers: 5′-CGCAAGATCTACATATGTCTTATCCCGCTGATG-3′ and 5′-TGTGTAGATCTCATCAAGGTCTCTGTCCCATC-3′, respectively. After digestion by BglII, the fragment was cloned into the BglII site of the pSG5 (26Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) derivative pTL1, giving pTL1-HSPC021. The pSGF-HSPC021 plasmid contains the HSPC021 cDNA fused at its 5′-end to the FLAG epitope into pSG5. It was generated by amplifying the HSPC021 coding sequence from the pTL1-HSPC021 plasmid with the following sense primer: 5′-CAGCCAGATCTTATCCCGCTGATGATTATG-3′, along with the antisense primer indicated above. After digestion byBglII, the fragment was inserted into the BamHI restriction site of pSGFLAG (2Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The N-terminal HSPC021 deletion mutants, pSGF-306/564 and pSGF-358/564, as well as the C-terminal deletion mutants, pSGF-1/466 and pSGF-1/536, were constructed by inserting into the BamHI site of pSGFLAG the corresponding cDNA fragments obtained by PCR amplification using pSGF-HSPC021 as matrix along with appropriate primers, which created BglII sites at both ends. The pTL1-Int-6 plasmid has been described previously (19Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vector used to express Int-6 in bacteria was generated by amplifying the Int-6 cDNA from pTL1-Int6 withPfu polymerase and primers sharing a stretch of 20 nucleotides homologous to pET-15b at both ends. The sequence of the sense and antisense primers was as follows: 5′-GGCCTGGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCGCGGAGTACGACTTGACTAC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGCTTCCTTTCGGGCTTCTTCAGTAGAAGCCAGAATC-3′. The PCR product was cloned by homologous recombination (27Bubeck P. Winkler M. Bautsch W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3601-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in pET-15b vector (Novagen) digested with NdeI and BamHI. For the HSPC021 bacterial expression vector, the cDNA was amplified by PCR as for pSGF-HSPC021 and inserted into the BglII site of the bacterial expression vector pFLAG-2 (Sigma). Wild-type HSPC021 and a FLAG-tagged form were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation using the TranscendTM tRNA and the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate systems (Promega). 1 μg of plasmids pTL1-HSPC021 and pSGF-HSPC021 were added to reaction mixtures of 50 μl, and assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. To verify the incorporation of biotinylated lysine residues into newly synthesized proteins, 2-μl aliquots were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF, and analyzed with streptavidin coupled to peroxidase. The remaining 48 μl of reaction mixtures were diluted in Nonidet P-40 buffer and used for immunoprecipitation experiments. FLAG-tagged HSPC021 was also produced in bacteria. E. coliBL21 transformed with the pFLAG-2-HSPC021 plasmid were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to midexponential phase. Induction was carried out at 37 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were centrifuged at 4000 × g; resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1000 units of benzonase, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, Complete EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche); and sonicated three times for 1 min at 30 watts. Suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and applied on a FLAG-M2-agarose affinity column (Sigma) equilibrated in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Recombinant protein was eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS. To produce Int-6 in bacteria, the E. coli BL21 strain was transformed with the pET-15b-Int-6 plasmid. Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to midexponential phase and were induced at 28 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h. Cells were centrifuged at 4000 × g; resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2% LDAO, 10 mm imidazole, 1000 units of benzonase, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, Complete EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); and sonicated three times for 1 min at 30 watts. Suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min and applied onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% LDAO and connected to a Beckman high pressure liquid chromatography system. Elution was performed with a linear gradient to 0.5 m imidazole in 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% LDAO. The His-tagged Int-6 fractions, eluted between 150 and 200 mm imidazole, were pooled and concentrated on Centricon 30 (Millipore Corp.). Full-length Int-6 and a C-terminal truncated form were separated on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% LDAO, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Amino acid analysis of the truncated form showed that it corresponds to the N-terminal 211 amino acids of Int-6. For Far Western blots, 250 and 500 ng of FLAG-tagged HSPC021 expressed in E. coli and purified as described above were loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to PVDF. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either the full-length recombinant Int-6 or the C-terminal truncated form. Both proteins were used at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml in 0.5% LDAO in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween and incubated with the antibody directed against the N-terminal 19 residues of Int-6 (19Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors like H2O2 or pervanadate causes a rapid and strong induction of protein phosphorylation on tyrosine. This phenomenon is reversible and has been observed with membrane fractions of Jurkat cell extracts (28Jin Y.J. Friedman J. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1743-1750PubMed Google Scholar). This induction of phosphorylation, which resembles that resulting from TCR/CD3 stimulation, was not observed in the Jurkat variant JCAM, which is deficient in the Lck tyrosine kinase (28Jin Y.J. Friedman J. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1743-1750PubMed Google Scholar). To seek for phosphorylation on tyrosine of Int-6 in T cells, we prepared extracts from either normal or H2O2-treated Jurkat cells. This was also done with the MT4 T-cell line. Immunoblot analysis of these extracts with antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine proteins showed that H2O2 indeed induced appearance of multiple bands in both cell lines (Fig.1, compare lanes 2and 4 with lanes 1 and 3, respectively). These extracts were used for immunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody directed against the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Int-6 (19Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis with the antibody to phosphotyrosine of the precipitated proteins did not reveal any band at the position of Int-6. Analysis of the same membrane using an antibody directed against the C-terminal 169 amino acids of Int-6 (19Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with a secondary antibody fluorescently labeled with cyanine 5, showed that equal amounts of Int-6 were precipitated with extracts of both untreated and H2O2-treated cells (Fig.1 C). These data indicate that, under these conditions, either Int-6 is not phosphorylated on tyrosine or such a modification was not recognized by the antibodies to phosphotyrosine that were used. By contrast, the same immunoblot showed a clear band at an apparent molecular mass of 69 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This band was observed with extracts of both Jurkat and MT4 H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 5). It was not observed with extracts of untreated cells or when the antibody to Int-6 was omitted in the immunoprecipitation reaction (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1, 3, 4, and6). With the extract of H2O2-treated Jurkat cells, a band was also seen at 55 kDa (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). At this position, a nonspecific band due to cross-reaction with protein A released from the beads was observed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 6). It is not clear why this nonspecific band was reinforced by the H2O2 treatment with the Jurkat cell extract, but it was not further considered. These observations showed that Int-6 is apparently not phosphorylated on tyrosine by itself but is associated with a phosphotyrosine protein of 69 kDa. To characterize p69, immunoprecipitation using the C-20 antibody to Int-6 was performed on a larger scale (see “Experimental Procedures”). Proteins were eluted by incubation in a buffer containing 1% SDS at 37 °C. This moderate temperature was important to avoid release of contaminant proteins associated with the beads (data not shown). After acetone precipitation and SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained, and the band migrating at 69 kDa was excised. Proteins present in the gel piece were digested with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF analysis indicated that 12 of 25 peptides matched with a GenBankTM entry named HSPC021 (accession number AF077207) (Fig. 2 A). In order to verify the presence of HSPC021 within this band, which was very likely to contain a protein mixture, tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out. MS/MS results confirmed that HSPC021 was the main protein within this gel piece (Fig. 2 A). This analysis also revealed the presence in lesser amounts of eIF3-p66 (data not shown). The same approach was ta"
https://openalex.org/W2143132863,"Pathological nitric oxide (NO) generation in sepsis, inflammation, and stroke may be therapeutically controlled by inhibiting NO synthases (NOS). Here we targeted the (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4Bip)-binding site of NOS, which, upon cofactor binding, maximally increases enzyme activity and NO production from substratel-arginine. The first generation of H4Bip-based NOS inhibitors employed a 4-amino pharmacophore of H4Bip analogous to antifolates such as methotrexate. We developed a novel series of 4-oxo-pteridine derivatives that were screened for inhibition against neuronal NOS (NOS-I) and a structure-activity relationship was determined. To understand the structural basis for pterin antagonism, selected derivatives were docked into the NOS pterin binding cavity. Using a reduced 4-oxo-pteridine scaffold, derivatives with certain modifications such as electron-rich aromatic phenyl or benzoyl groups at the 5- and 6-positions, were discovered to markedly inhibit NOS-I, possibly due to hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with Phe462 and Ser104, respectively, within the pterin binding pocket. One of the most effective 4-oxo compounds and, for comparisons an active 4-amino derivative, were then co-crystallized with the endothelial NOS (NOS-III) oxygenase domain and this structure solved to confirm the hypothetical binding modes. Collectively, these findings suggest (i) that, unlike the antifolate principle, the 4-amino substituent is not essential for developing pterin-based NOS inhibitors and (ii), provide a steric and electrostatic basis for their rational design. Pathological nitric oxide (NO) generation in sepsis, inflammation, and stroke may be therapeutically controlled by inhibiting NO synthases (NOS).

To understand the structural basis for pterin antagonism, selected derivatives were docked into the NOS pterin binding cavity. Using a reduced 4-oxo-pteridine scaffold, derivatives with certain modifications such as electron-rich aromatic phenyl or benzoyl groups at the 5- and 6-positions, were discovered to markedly inhibit NOS-I, possibly due to hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with Phe462 and Ser104, respectively, within the pterin binding pocket. One of the most effective 4-oxo compounds and, for comparisons an active 4-amino derivative, were then co-crystallized with the endothelial NOS (NOS-III) oxygenase domain and this structure solved to confirm the hypothetical binding modes. Collectively, these findings suggest (i) that, unlike the antifolate principle, the 4-amino substituent is not essential for developing pterin-based NOS inhibitors and (ii), provide a steric and electrostatic basis for their rational design. nitric-oxide synthase enzyme family (EC 1.14.13.39) (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin concentration of inhibitor required for half-maximal inhibition nitric oxide (synonym nitrogen monoxide) structurally conserved region 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate Inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS1; EC 1.14.13.39) have been developed as therapeutic agents to modulate pathologically high nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (1Griffith O.W.

The so-called “inducible” NOS-II isoform (or iNOS) is expressed in a number of tissues in response to endotoxin/cytokines and plays a role in the immune response (2Hobbs A.J. Higgs A. Moncada S.

Finally, for two of the isoforms, NOS-II and III, structural information is available from x-ray crystallography studies using recombinantly expressed NOS oxygenase domain which show highly conserved cofactor and substrate binding modes (15Raman C.S.

To date, a wide variety of NOS inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic candidates and used in both animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans (1Griffith O.W. Gross S.S. Feelisch M.

Toxicol. 1999; 39: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). However, substrate-based inhibitors, which may also interfere with other l-arginine-dependent biological pathway(s), have failed to succeed in clinical development (1Griffith O.W. Gross S.S.

Potent and irreversible inhibitors such as diphenyleneiodonium (IC50 of 50–150 nm) interfere with flavin function (1Griffith O.W. Gross S.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley and Sons, NY1996: 187-208Google Scholar). However, given the ubiquitous distribution of NADPH-dependent flavoproteins within the body, the use of diphenyleneiodonium may be of limited value. NOS catalysis can be inhibited within the oxygenase domain by compounds binding to the heme prosthetic group such as indazoles and imidazoles (33Chabin R.M. McCauley E. Calaycay J.R. Kelly T.M.

However, the specificity of various indazoles and imidazoles for the heme-binding site is questionable. A more promising target within NOS is the H4Bip-binding site, which, upon cofactor binding markedly increases NOS activity or stability and, consequently NO synthesis (35Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F.

This suggested a close similarity between anti-pterin inhibitors of NOS and antifolate inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase since both chemical scaffolds appeared to require a 4-amino functionality to inhibit their target enzyme. However, due to structural similarities with tetrahydrofolic acid, 4-amino H4Bip additionally inhibits dihydropteridine and folate reductases (40Werner E.R. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Handbook Exp. Pharmacol. 2001; 143: 137-158Crossref Google Scholar) and, therefore, other 4-amino analogs may also lack selectivity for NOS. Herein we synthesized and refined a novel series of pterin-based NOS inhibitors based on an intact 4-oxo-pteridine nucleus analogous to the naturally occurring H4Bip. By systematically varying the substitution patterns in the 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-positions of the 4-oxo-pteridine nucleus, these compounds were discovered to be effective NOS inhibitors and we here describe their structure-activity relationship. Importantly, docking studies with the most effective inhibitors led to a better understanding of the molecular considerations underlying NOS inhibition and was supported by co-crystallization within the largely conserved NOS-III oxygenase domain. These findings indicate that, unlike the antifolates, the 4-amino moiety is not a structural prerequisite for NOS inhibition thus allowing for the design of inhibitors with greater NOS selectivity. Collectively, this information provides a molecular basis for the rational design and optimization of novel, pteridine-based NOS inhibitors. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride (2.85 TBq mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biochem (Braunschweig, Germany); NADPH from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany); reduced glutathione (GSH) fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany); (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4Bip) from Dr. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland); FAD, FMN, l-arginine hydrochloride, and phosphodiesterase 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide activator (calmodulin, CaM) from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany).

As previously, we therefore defined the IC50 value in the present study as the concentration of inhibitor required to produce half-maximal enzyme inhibition that can be achieved by each compound. The apparent lack of potency of the inhibitors is to some extent assay related since in our standard “functional” assay, we use a concentration of H4Bip (2 μm) that is in excess in relation to the EC50 of H4Bip (50–100 nm) for enzyme activation and saturation. However, in radioligand binding studies, we and others (e.g. Ref. 41Werner E.R. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have seen a quantitatively different picture with Ki values in the low nanomolar range when using an amount of [3H]H4Bip at the Kd from saturation experiments (about 10 nm). we initially examined the effects of the derivatives on H4Bip-stimulated NOS-I activity at a single concentration of 100 μm. Those derivatives identified as being active (>50% inhibition of H4Bip-stimulated NOS activity) were re-screened over a full concentration range (0–1000 μm) to determine accurate log(concentration)-response relationships and establish potency (IC50). The corresponding IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using either Biosoft UltraFit software (Cambridge, United Kingdom) or GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Individual curves from each triplicate were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to sigmoidal concentration-response curves of variable slope (that is, the Hill slope was not fixed equal to 1). The corresponding IC50value from each curve was then calculated by the software and is represented as means.

The N-terminal three-quarters of the protein has helicase activity, whereas the ∼30-kDa C-terminal portion of RecB constitutes a separate domain that exhibits very weak endonuclease activity (3Yu M.

The only proteins that have significant similarity scores in a simple BLAST data base search that uses the nuclease domain from E. coliRecB as the query sequence (residues 930–1180 of RecB) are RecB homologues from other bacteria. This analysis thus sheds no light on the evolutionary origin of the nuclease domain in RecB nor on whether any other enzymes have domains that are related to the RecB nuclease domain.

The set of 33 proteins that turned up was dubbed the “RecB nuclease domain family” and is proposed to constitute a group of proteins that are related structurally and evolutionarily. The structures of five of these proteins are shown schematically in Fig. 1 A, and the amino acid sequence that defines the “RecB family” is given in Fig. 1 B. Some of the family members are hypothetical and uncharacterized open reading frames from completely sequenced genomes (e.g. the sequence shown from Archaeoglobus fulgidus), but a few are proteins that have been studied previously. AddA is a RecB homologue from Bacillus subtilisthat assembles with AddB to make a two-subunit enzyme (AddAB) that performs essentially the same enzymatic and biological functions as RecBCD (9Kooistra J. Haijema B.J. Venema G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic Dna2 protein has both nuclease and helicase activities (10Budd M.E. Choe W.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the enzyme encoded by the recE gene is a dsDNA1-specific nuclease known as exonuclease VIII (12Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3593-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The recE gene is situated within a cryptic prophage called rac that is found in the chromosome of someE. coli strains (13Willis D.K. Satin L.H. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Campbell A.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2041-2046Google Scholar). The RecE protein and the RecT protein, encoded by a neighboring gene and functionally similar to theE. coli RecA protein, can substitute for RecBCD and RecA in some types of homologous recombination (15Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The RecE enzyme is a 5′–3′-specific exonuclease that degrades processively one strand of a linear dsDNA substrate to mononucleotide products (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10418-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RecE (866 amino acid residues) is quite a bit larger than the RecB nuclease domain (253 residues), but the sequence that RecE has in common with RecB is found near the C terminus of RecE (Fig. 1 A) (8Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Previous work using deletion mutants has shown that a large fraction of the N terminus of RecE can be deleted without loss of nuclease activity (18Luisi-DeLuca C. Clark A.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5797-5805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chu C.C. Templin A. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Muyrers J.P. Zhang Y. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1971-1982PubMed Google Scholar). The overall sequence similarity among the proteins in the putative RecB family is very low, and thus the question arises as to its structural and mechanistic significance. The answer must come from biochemical and structural study of these proteins. We have begun by carrying out mutagenesis and proteolysis experiments with the E. coliRecE protein. First, we altered by site-directed mutagenesis the residues that are conserved among the RecB family members and determined their importance in the nuclease reaction. Second, we investigated the domain structure of RecE by limited proteolysis. The results confirm the relation between RecE and RecB that was proposed from the sequence analysis. Restriction enzymes, calf intestinal phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Promega or New England Biolabs and were used as recommended by the suppliers. Subtilisin Carlsberg and trypsin were purchased from Sigma, and thrombin was from Novagen, Inc. Turbo Pfu DNA polymerase for PCR was obtained from Stratagene. Oligonucleotides for PCR and mutagenesis were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The plasmid pRAC31 that contains theE. coli recE gene (13Willis D.K. Satin L.H. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Prof. A. J. Clark, University of California, Berkeley. 3H-Labeled plasmid DNA (pTZ19R-recE BHM (4023 bp, see below) and pPvSm19 (6250 bp (21Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar))) were isolated from cultures of E. coli strains JM109 or XL-1 grown as described previously (22Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA was purified using the Qiafilter Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The His-tagged RecE protein (HisRecE) was expressed using the vector pET15b (Novagen, Inc.). The recE gene was transferred to the vector as follows. A 2601-bp fragment from the plasmid pRAC31 that encompasses the recE gene was amplified by PCR. The downstream primer annealed at the 3′-end of the gene and introduced an XhoI site (bold) after the RecE stop codon (primer recE xho1, 5′-GG GGT CTC GAG TTAGTCATTTGCATATTCCTTAGCCC). The upstream primer annealed at the 5′-end of the gene and introduced an NdeI site at the start of the RecE coding region (primer recE nde1, 5′-G CAA AAA CATATG AGCACAAAACCACTCTTCC). Both primers are partially complementary to therecE gene (underlined). The amplified 2601-bp fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET15b to produce pET15b-recE. The recE gene insert in pET15b-recE was sequenced completely. The site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by one of the following two procedures. 1) The pET15b-recE plasmid was used directly as the template for site-directed mutagenesis for the Y785F mutation. 2) A 1165-bpBamHI fragment, which encodes the C terminus of RecE protein, was first subcloned to pTZ19R to make pTZ19R-recE BHM. This plasmid was then used as the template for the D748A, D759A, K761Q, and Y785N mutations. The different mutated 1165-bp fragments were ligated back into pET15b-recE to express the mutant proteins. The oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis are as follows: 5′-GT CGG TGC CGT CCG GCC AAA ATT ATC CCT G and 5′-C AGG GAT AAT TTT GGC CGG ACG GCA CCG AC for the D748A mutation; 5′-CAC TGG ATC ATG GCC GTG AAA ACT ACG GCG and 5′-CGC CGT AGT TTT CAC GGC CAT GAT CCA GTG for the D759A mutation; 5′-CAC TGG ATC ATG GAC GTG CAA ACT ACG GCG GAT ATT C and 5′-G AAT ATC CGC CGT AGT TTG CAC GTC CAT GAT CCA GTG for the K761Q mutation; 5′-C GTT CAG GAT GCA TTC TTC AGT GAC GGT TAT GAA GCA C and 5′-G TGC TTC ATA ACC GTC ACT GAA GAA TGC ATC CTG AAC G for the Y785F mutation; and 5′-C GTT CAG GAT GCA TTC AAC AGT GAC GGT TAT GAA GC and 5′-GC TTC ATA ACC GTC ACT GTT GAA TGC ATC CTG AAC G for the Y785N mutation. The mutagenic nucleotides are underlined. The reaction conditions and subsequent manipulations were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids containing the mutant genes were identified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The HisRecE protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pET15b recE. A 70-ml overnight culture in LB broth containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was transferred to 2 liters of the same medium. The cells were grown at 37 °C until theA 600 = 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to 1 mm, and growth was continued for 1 h before the cells were harvested. The cell pellet (8 g) was resuspended in 40 ml of native binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5m NaCl). A protease inhibitor mixture for polyhistidine-tagged proteins (0.4 ml; Sigma, Inc.) and lysozyme (100 μg/ml cell suspension) was added to the cell suspension followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. The mixture was sonicated until it was no longer viscous, and the cell debris was removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The crude cell extract was applied to a 5-ml Ni2+-NTA column (ProBond resin, Invitrogen Corp.) in native binding buffer. The column was then washed with 5 volumes of native wash buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole), and the HisRecE protein was eluted in a gradient of 60 mm to 1 m imidazole in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl. The fractions containing HisRecE, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE, were collected and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm NaCl. The dialyzed pool was then applied to a 5-ml ssDNA agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. The ssDNA-agarose column was washed with 1 volume of buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl, and the HisRecE was eluted in a gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing HisRecE were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) and dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mmNaCl and 60% (v/v) glycerol. The resulting protein solution was stored at −20 °C. The HisRecE protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm, using ε280 = 102,840m−1 cm−1 calculated for HisRecE using the program ProtParam (ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). The typical yield was about 0.45 mg from a 2-liter culture. The mutant HisRecE proteins and the C-terminal segment of RecE (see below) were purified using these same procedures. The HisRecE protein was prepared as described above, except that the purified protein was dialyzed by ultrafiltration (Amicon) into 10 mmNH4HCO3. A sample of HisRecE (18 mg/ml) was diluted 10-fold by mixing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The diluted protein was mixed with an equal volume (0.3 μl) of sinapinic acid solution (50 mm in 70/30 v/v of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and then characterized on a Kratos MALDI 4 TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a 337 nm ultraviolet laser (Kratos Analytical Instruments, UK). The mass spectrometer was externally calibrated using bovine serum albumin. This test was kindly done by Dr. Xudong Yao of Prof. Catherine Fenselau's research group at the University of Maryland. The standard exonuclease reaction conditions were 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, at 37 °C. The DNA substrate was 3H-labeled plasmid DNA (pTZ19R-recE BHM or pPvSm19) linearized by cleavage with HindIII. The RecE protein was diluted 10–50-fold when necessary in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and was kept on ice. Nuclease activity was determined by measuring the production of trichloroacetic acid-soluble mononucleotide products (22Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the RecE proteins is always given as the monomer concentration, although the active form may be a larger oligomer ((16) data not shown). DNA binding assays were done using the two-filter method developed by Wong and Lohman (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) in which DNA-protein complexes were trapped on a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell), and the unbound DNA is trapped on a DEAE filter (DE81, Whatman) put immediately beneath the nitrocellulose filter, as described. The standard binding mixtures contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mmDTT, and [3H]pTZ19R-recE BHM DNA (51.1 μm nt, equivalent to 12.7 nm ends). The protein and DNA were mixed and incubated for 2 min at room temperature before being applied to the nitrocellulose/DEAE filter sandwich. The radioactivity bound to each dried filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The fraction of DNA bound to the nitrocellulose filter (f) was calculated as shown in Equation 1,f=cpmNC−ςcpmDEcpmNC+cpmDEEquation 1 where cpmNC and cpmDE are the counts bound to the nitrocellulose and DEAE filters, respectively, for a given binding mixture, and ς indicates cpmNC/cpmDEfor a mixture having no RecE enzyme. This corrects for the background of DNA that binds nonspecifically to the nitrocellulose filter in the absence of protein (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The filter binding data were then analyzed assuming that RecE molecules can bind independently to each end of the DNA with identical dissociation constant K d . The binding data were fit to Equation 2 (24Woodbury C.P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4730-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the SigmaPlot program (SSPS, Inc.)f=1âˆ’(1+Î¶[RecE]/Kd)2(1+[RecE]/Kd)2Equation 2 where [RecE] is the free RecE concentration, and ζ is the probability that a DNA molecule with one RecE enzyme bound to one end will not be retained on the filter (the fitted values of ζ were very small (∼10−9) for most binding experiments). The purified HisRecE protein was treated with 6.25 μg of subtilisin Carlsberg per mg of HisRecE in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm NaCl and 60% glycerol, at room temperature. Samples were removed at the indicated times, quenched with 33 mm (final concentration) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HisRecE protein was also treated with trypsin (0.1 μg of trypsin per mg of HisRecE) under the same conditions, at room temperature for 0–60 min. Samples were quenched and analyzed as above. To prepare the samples for N-terminal sequencing, the digested protein bands in the unstained SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The N-terminal sequencing was performed by Dr. Brian Martin (National Institutes of Health). The 34-kDa C-terminal domain of RecE protein (HisRecE34kDa) was also expressed using the vector pET15b (Novagen, Inc.). The truncated recE gene was transferred to the vector as follows. An 849-bp fragment from the plasmid pET15b-recE was amplified by PCR. The downstream primer annealed at the 3′-end of the gene (primer recE xho1, see above), and the upstream primer annealed at nt 1692–1712 of the gene (primer recE-34 nde1, 5′-CAG GAA CAT ATG GAACATCCGCACAATGAGAATGC). PrimerrecE-34 nde1 was partially complementary to therecE gene (codons 564–571, underlined) and introduced anNdeI site (bold) and an ATG start codon. The truncated recE gene fragment was inserted into pET15b as described above for the full-length recE gene. The plasmid containing the truncated gene was identified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. A protein of about 120–140 kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the lysate of cells transformed with pET15b-recE, the RecE overexpression plasmid, after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (not shown). This HisRecE protein can be purified in a single step by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA resin, and further purification can be achieved by chromatography on ssDNA-agarose. The apparent size of this protein on SDS-PAGE is larger than the calculated molecular weight of HisRecE (98 kDa; see Fig. 2). Native RecE protein was found previously to migrate on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also greater than that predicted from the recE DNA sequence (96 kDa; (25Clark A.J. Sharma V. Brenowitz S. Chu C.C. Sandler S. Satin L. Templin A. Berger I. Cohen A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7673-7682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The molecular mass of the purified HisRecE was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to be 99,274.2 Da (data not shown), in good agreement for a protein of this size with the predicted molecular mass (98,516 Da). This result shows that the HisRecE protein is translated correctly and that the apparent molecular mass from the SDS-PAGE is an overestimate. The purified HisRecE protein has ATP-independent nuclease activity on linear dsDNA (Fig.3). The reaction time courses are linear for the first ∼10 min, but then the reactions slow down considerably even though most of the substrate DNA has not been digested (Fig. 3). The reaction resumed if more enzyme was added (data not shown), indicating that the enzyme is unstable under the assay conditions, as observed previously with the native RecE protein (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of acid-soluble DNA product did not exceed about 50% of the total DNA substrate present, even in reactions with high concentrations of active HisRecE (not shown), consistent with degradation of only one strand of the duplex by RecE (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of purified HisRecE, determined from the linear part of the nuclease reaction time courses (0–4 min), was as high as 200 mol of nucleotides produced per mol of enzyme per min but varied somewhat among different enzyme preparations (∼50–200 min−1). The purified HisRecE protein retained its activity for at least 3 months when stored at −20 °C in the storage buffer, suggesting that there was variable loss of activity during the purification procedure itself that accounted for the irregularity among the different preparations. 2The specific activity of HisRecE was lower than the values that can be estimated from the results for native RecE obtained by Joseph and Kolodner (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (∼1000 min−1), probably due to differences in the purification procedures used and in the methods for protein concentration determination (Lowry method (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)versus absorbance at 280 nm, using a calculated extinction coefficient). Removing the 22-residue N-terminal His tag peptide by treatment with thrombin (done with the purified His-tagged 34-kDa nuclease domain protein) did not lead to any increase in the nuclease activity. We made five mutations (D748A, D759A, K761Q, Y785F, and Y785N) in the residues of the RecE protein that are conserved among the RecB family members (Fig. 1). Asp-748, Asp-759, and Lys-761 correspond to the residues that are important for the RecBCD nuclease activities (4Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Wang J. Chen R. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 507-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins (HisRecED748A, HisRecED759A, HisRecEK761Q, HisRecEY785F, and HisRecEY785N) were expressed and purified by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA and ssDNA-agarose exactly as for the wild-type protein. All tests with the mutant HisRecE proteins (nuclease and DNA binding) were done immediately after the proteins were purified (within 4 days or less), because at least one of the mutants (HisRecEK761Q) gradually lost the ability to bind dsDNA after about 1 month of storage at −20 °C. Nuclease assays were done on the purified mutant enzymes with linear dsDNA under the same reaction conditions used for the wild-type enzyme. The HisRecED748A, HisRecED759A, and HisRecEK761Q mutants had no detectable nuclease activity in these reactions (Fig. 3 A). The amount of acid-soluble DNA produced by these mutant enzymes was indistinguishable from the background of soluble radioactivity that was present initially in the reaction mixture (0.5–1.5% of the total radioactivity present), in reactions that were followed for 60 min. Wild-type HisRecE (19.3 nm) solubilized 10–20% of the linear DNA substrate in ∼20 min under the same conditions (Fig. 3, A andB). The nuclease activity of the HisRecEY785F mutant was similar to that of comparable amounts of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.3 B), and thus the mutation appeared to have essentially no effect on the enzyme activity (the variability of the wild-type specific activity does not allow a more rigorous comparison of their activities). The removal of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-785 thus did not have much effect on the exonuclease activity of HisRecE. The HisRecEY785N mutant had very low but detectable activity (∼1% of the DNA was made acid-soluble in 60 min, after subtracting out the background (Fig. 3 B)). Thus the hydroxyl group of Tyr-785 is not necessary for catalysis, but replacing the large aromatic ring of Tyr or Phe with the smaller and more polar Asn side chain may partially disrupt the structure of the enzyme leading to loss of activity. 3We also changed Tyr-785 to Ala in HisRecE (HisRecEY785A mutant). A large fraction of the overexpressed mutant enzyme was insoluble (much more so than for the other mutants), and we were unable to purify HisRecEY785Aby the procedure that we used for the wild-type and the other mutants. This suggests that the Tyr to Ala mutation affects the structure of HisRecE. Interestingly, the conserved tyrosine in RecB (Tyr-1114; Fig. 1 B) could be changed to Phe or Ala with little if any effect on the nuclease activity of RecBCD (6Wang J. Chen R. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 507-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA binding assays were done to test whether the mutant enzymes that were inactive as nucleases had retained the ability to bind to the DNA substrate. Ca2+was used in the binding buffer instead of Mg2+ because the exonuclease activity of the RecE protein requires Mg2+ and is inhibited by Ca2+ (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10411-10417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the HisRecED748A, HisRecED759A, and HisRecEK761Q mutant proteins have lost the ability to hydrolyze DNA, they retain essentially the same DNA binding activity as the wild-type protein (Fig. 4). The equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were obtained by fitting the binding data to Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The K d values for the wild-type, HisRecED748A, HisRecED759A, and HisRecEK761Q mutant proteins under these conditions are 182, 154, 85, and 77 nm, respectively, from duplicate determinations. 4Duplicate determinations agreed to within 20%. The K d value for HisRecEK761Q is from a single determination. The wild-type enzyme bound specifically to the DNA ends under these conditions, because very little (∼1%) of uncut circular plasmid DNA was retained on the filter with 400 nm HisRecE (data not shown). Truncated RecE proteins, in which as many as 587 residues are deleted from the N terminus and therecE gene is fused to an upstream gene, retain high levels of nuclease activity (18Luisi-DeLuca C. Clark A.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5797-5805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chu C.C. Templin A. Clark A.J. J.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1971-1982PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to test for the existence of separate structural domains in RecE and further define their limits by proteolysis experiments. HisRecE was treated with either trypsin or the nonspecific protease subtilisin (26Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and samples"

Active site-inhibited factor VIIa, similar to factor VIIa, binds to tissue factor on cell surfaces and subsequently gets internalized and degraded. At present, it is unknown whether factor VIIa and active site-inhibited factor VIIa undergo a similar intracellular processing. The data presented herein show that although a fraction of both the internalized factor VIIa and active site-inhibited factor VIIa recycle back to the cell surface, the amount of active site-inhibited factor VIIa recycled back to the cell surface was substantially higher than that of factor VIIa. Furthermore, internalized factor VIIa and not active site-inhibited factor VIIa associates with nuclear fractions. Factor VIIa associated with the nuclear fraction was intact and functionally active. In contrast to factor VIIa, tissue factor is not found in the nuclear fraction. Additional studies show that the internalized factor VIIa specifically associates with cytoskeletal proteins, actin, and tubulin.

Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar, 7Taubman M.B. Fallon J.T. Schecter A.D. Giesen P. Mendlowitz M. Fyfe B.S. Marmur J.D. Nemerson Y. Thromb.

Rao L.V.M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. Academic Press, San Diego2002Google Scholar). In agreement with this, attenuation of aberrant expression of TF·FVIIa was shown to provide protection against the clotting as well as pathogenesis of the disease. For example, blocking of TF·FVIIa functional activity with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against TF (10Taylor F.B. Chang A. Ruf W. Morrissey J.H. Hinshaw L.B. Catlett R. Blick K. Edgington T.S. Circ. Shock. 1991; 33: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar) or by its plasma inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (11Creasey A.A. Chang A.C.K. Feigen L. Wun T.C. Taylor F.B. Hinshaw L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2850-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), or active site-inhibited factor FVIIa (FVIIai) (12Taylor F.B. Chang A.C.K. Peer G. Li A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) not only attenuated the coagulopathic response but also protected the baboons from the lethal inflammatory effects of LD100 Escherichia coli.Similarly, administration of anti-TF IgG (13Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11832-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) or FVIIai (14Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited the TF-induced tumor metastasis in a murine model system. Although FVIIai has been thought to inhibit TF-FVIIa induced clotting and cellular responses by competing with FVIIa for a limited number of TF sites expressed in vivo and thus blocking the generation of proteolytically active TF·FVIIa complexes, it is not clear whether this could alone explain prolonged and distinctive effects associated with FVIIai (15Rao L.V.M. Ezban M. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinol. 2000; 11: S135-S143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that potential differences between FVIIa and FVIIai in their interaction with TF on cell surfaces and their subsequent internalization and intracellular trafficking may also play a role in mediating the protective effects of FVIIai. At present, it is unknown whether FVIIa and FVIIai undergo a similar cellular catabolism once they bound to TF on cells. Radioligand binding studies with a human bladder carcinoma cell line (J82) showed that FVIIai associated with TF at a faster rate and dissociated from it at a slower rate compared with FVIIa (16Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These studies also revealed that the affinity of FVIIai to nonfunctional (cryptic) TF was 5-fold higher than that of FVIIa, whereas both FVIIa and FVIIai bound to functional TF sites with the same high affinity. Differences between FVIIa and FVIIai for their affinity to TF was also evident in studies with relipidated TF, as shown first by Bach and colleagues (17Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and extended by others (16Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol.

Our recent studies show that FVIIa and FVIIai bound to TF on cell surfaces was internalized in a time-dependent manner and a substantial portion of the internalized ligand recycles back to the cell surface as the intact protein (20Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Voigt J. Ezban M. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36995-37003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Hansen C.B. Pyke C. Petersen L.C. Rao L.V.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the pattern of endocytosis and intracellular distribution of FVIIa and FVIIai in fibroblasts to determine potential differences between FVIIa and FVIIai in their cellular processing. The data presented herein reveal that despite the common pathway of TF-mediated processing, considerable differences exist in the trafficking of FVIIa and FVIIai in fibroblasts. Compared with FVIIa, more internalized FVIIai recycles back to the cell surface. Furthermore, internalized FVIIa and not FVIIai is co-isolated with nuclei. Additional experiments revealed that FVIIa binds to cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin and this interaction may be responsible for FVIIa association with the nuclear fraction. A human fibroblast cell line, WI-38, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Cellgro, Herndon, VA), 1% penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 ng/ml) mixture, and 1% l-glutamine (2 mm). When cells reached near confluency, the culture medium was removed and the cells were washed with buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, and 11 mmglucose) before they were subjected to specific treatments. Recombinant human FVIIa was a gift from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). FVIIai was prepared by incubating recombinant human FVIIa with a peptidyl inhibitor,d-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg chloromethyl ketone, as described earlier (16Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and hereafter referred to as FFR-FVIIa. Factors X and Xa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Preparation of monospecific, polyclonal rabbit anti-human TF IgG was described earlier (22Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Res. 1988; 51: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against human TF (TF9–10H10) was provided by Dr. Wolfram Ruf (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). α-Actin, β-tubulin, and other proteins were obtained from Sigma. FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa were labeled by using IODO-GEN-coated tubes and Na125I according to the manufacturer's (Pierce) technical bulletin and as described previously (23Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free iodine was removed by extensive dialysis against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The concentration of labeled proteins was determined spectrophotometrically at A 280 using E1cm1% of 13.8. Specific radioactivity of labeled proteins was 5–9 × 109cpm/mg. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the radiolabeled proteins were intact with no apparent degradation.125I-Labeled FVIIa retained 80% or more of the functional activity of the unlabeled material (as measured for its ability to activate factor X in the presence of tissue factor). FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa were labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using slight modifications to a protocol recommended by the manufacturer for labeling of proteins with amine reactive probes. Briefly, FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa (3 mg/ml) was incubated in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, buffer with the fluorophore (0.5 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. Free probe was removed by gel filtration on PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeled FVIIa retained about 70% of its original functional activity. TF monoclonal antibody (TF9 10H10) was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. WI-38 cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with labeled FVIIa (or FFR-FVIIa) (1 μg/ml) and TF9 10H10 antibody (1 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer B (buffer A containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) . (TF9 10H10 antibody binds to TF without interfering FVIIa binding to TF.) Unbound FVIIa and the antibody were removed, cells were washed with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, and fixed with 2% p-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Thereafter, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using SlowFade (Molecular Probes) antifade kit for microscopy. The cells were examined with Olympus Fluoview 500 laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cell surface binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-labeled FVIIa or125I-labeled FFR-FVIIa were performed essentially as described previously (20Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Voigt J. Ezban M. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36995-37003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine TF-specific binding, internalization and degradation of FVIIa, parallel experiments were carried out in which the monolayers were first incubated for 30 min with rabbit anti-human TF IgG (100 μg/ml) before radioactive ligands were added to cells. TF-specific binding and internalization were determined by subtracting the values from the corresponding values obtained in the absence of anti-TF antibody. Duplicate wells were used for all measurements and each experiment was repeated 3–4 times. Control and treated cells were washed four times with ice-cold buffer B and the cell surface TF activity was assayed in a factor Xa generation assay after the addition of fresh FVIIa (10 nm) and FX (175 nm) (23Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional activity of FVIIa in nuclear fractions was also determined in factor X activation assay by providing exogenous TF. Briefly, suspension of nuclei (10 μl) was incubated in a well of microtiter plate with FX (175 nm) and relipidated TF (1 nm) in buffer B (in a total volume of 50 μl) for 20 min at room temperature. At the end of incubation, Chromozym X (50 μl to 1.25 mg/ml) was added to the well and the rate of increasing of absorbance at 405 nm was monitored using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of FVIIa in experimental samples was determined by using a calibration curve created with known concentrations of FVIIa. To determine the nuclear association of FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa, monolayers of WI-38 cells were first incubated with 125I-FVIIa (10 nm) or125I-FFR-FVIIa (10 nm) in buffer B for varying time periods either at 37 or 4 °C to allow internalization of FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa. At selected times, unbound ligand and the cell surface-bound ligand were removed by discarding the supernatant and washing the monolayers for 3 min with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, to strip the cell surface-associated ligand. After washing the monolayers three times with buffer A, the cells were detached from the dish mechanically using a cell scraper and suspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing calcium ions (5 mm CaCl2) and Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration). Cells were disrupted by shear stress, using 4 syringe strokes with 22-gauge needle. Nuclei were pelleted and washed twice by centrifugation for 2 min at 500 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The integrity of isolated nuclei and purity of nuclear preparations were monitored under microscope by staining nuclei with hematoxilin-eosine. The above procedure resulted in the release of nuclei from almost all the cells and the nuclear fraction was devoid of unbroken cells and noticeable cell debris. In some experiments, nuclear fractions were further purified by applying the above isolated fraction on the top of barrier, containing 2m sucrose and 20% glycerol, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To determine whether nuclear preparations are contaminated with plasma membranes, the nuclear pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with anti-TF. These analyses confirmed that the isolated nuclear fractions contained no or only minute amounts (less than 1%) of membrane proteins (see “Results”). To test whether FVIIa binds DNA, we have used a modified gel shift assay (reverse EMSA).125I-FVIIa (10 ng) was incubated with DNA (0.6 μg), which was digested by restriction endonucleases (ALU1, DPN, and NDE) for 1 h at 37 °C and the mixture was electrophoresed on a 4–15% gradient gel. Electrophoresis was performed in TB buffer (89 mm Tris-HCl and 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.0) and the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. To determine whether FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa binds to cytoskeletal proteins, WI-38 cells, grown in a 96-well microplate, were fixed and permeabilized by treatment with cold (−20 °C) methanol for 3 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation of fixed cells with 5% dry milk in buffer A containing 5 mm CaCl2 overnight. Then,125I-FVIIa (10 nm), in the presence and absence of actin, tubulin, or other test proteins (0 to 5 mg/ml), was added to the cells and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of 60 min, the unbound FVIIa was removed by washing the cells 4 times with buffer A containing calcium. The bound FVIIa was eluted with trypsin-EDTA solution and the radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. As a variant of this assay, binding of FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa to immobilized purified actin or tubulin was also determined. Briefly, wells in a 96-well microplate were coated with actin, tubulin, or fibronectin (as a control) (100 μl of 10 μg/ml in 0.1 mNaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.4) overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with buffer A containing 10 mg/ml BSA. 125I-FVIIa or 125I-FFR-FVIIa (10 nm), with or without 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled FVIIa (or FFR-VIIa), was added to the wells and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa bound to the immobilized ligand was determined as the above. Our recent studies show that incubation of125I-FVIIa or 125I-FFR-FVIIa with WI-38 fibroblasts resulted in a similar TF-mediated cell surface binding, internalization, and degradation of these molecules (20Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Voigt J. Ezban M. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36995-37003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, a closer look into the binding kinetics of these ligands suggest that, despite the common mechanism of cell association, the steady-state distribution of FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa between cell surface and internalized pools may differ, especially at 10–30-min intervals at which time more FFR-FVIIa appears to be associated with the cell surface, as compared with FVIIa. To verify and confirm this observation, we analyzed data from more than 10 experiments and presented them in a normalized form, where the amount of internalized ligand was taken as a 100%. The results, as depicted in Fig.1, show that the amount of FFR-FVIIa associated with the cell surface was substantially higher than the amount of FVIIa associated with the cell surface. It is possible that a faster association and/or higher affinity of FFR-FVIIa, compared with FVIIa, for cryptic TF (16Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) may be responsible for this difference. If so, the difference between FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa associated with the cell surface would be reduced if the cells contain a higher percentage of TF as an active TF. Indeed, the cells that supported 70 to 90% of maximal FVIIa binding during the first 10 min of the incubation period, which indicates that most of the TF is in active form (23Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed a negligible difference between FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa binding and internalization measured at 10 min (Fig.2). However, the data depicted in Fig. 2also show that the ratio of internalized/surface bound ligand for FFR-FVIIa is not changed over a period of 1 h, whereas the amount of internalized FVIIa was clearly increasing during this period. These data suggest that FVIIa, but not FFR-FVIIa, accumulates intracellularly. Although the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 are consistent with our earlier observation (20Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Voigt J. Ezban M. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36995-37003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), i.e. a higher percentage of FVIIa was internalized (in relative to the surface bound) compared with FFR-FVIIa, the extent of internalization of both FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa was much higher in the present study compared with the earlier study. Variation in cell batches and culture media may be responsible for this difference.Figure 2Time-dependent intracellular accumulation of FVIIa but not FFR-FVIIa. 125I-FVIIa or125I-FFR-FVIIa (10 nm) was added to monolayers of WI-38 cells. At the end of 10-, 30-, and 60-min incubations at 37 °C, unbound radioligands were removed and the amount of surface bound and internalized ligands were determined. Data were normalized to the amount of surface bound FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa at 10 min, which was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the mechanism of distinct intracellular distribution of FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa, recycling of these ligands after internalization was studied. For these experiments, WI-38 cells were incubated with 125I-FVIIa or 125I-FFR-FVIIa (10 nm each) for 60 min at 37 °C to allow the internalization. Thereafter, the cell surface-associated ligand was removed by washing the cells with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, followed by buffer A. Then, the monolayers were overlaid with buffer B and allowed to stand at 37 °C for 30 min. At the end of 30 min, the amount of cell surface associated, dissociated (both intact and degraded), and the remaining internalized ligand were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, more internalized FFR-FVIIa returns back to the cell surface as compared with FVIIa. Despite the higher amount of FFR-FVIIa on the cell surface, the amount of dissociated FFR-FVIIa into overlying incubation medium was slightly lower than that of FVIIa. This is an expected finding since FFR-FVIIa was shown to dissociate from cell surface TF at a slower rate than that of FVIIa (16Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Determination of internalized ligand in totality will not provide information on a possible distinct intracellular compartmentalization of FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa, because internalization is an integral parameter, which includes ligands in endosomal, lysosomal, cytosolic, nuclear, and other compartments. Therefore, to reveal potential differences in intracellular distribution of internalized FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa, we compared the amounts of FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa associated with the nuclear fraction. Measurement of radioactivity associated with nuclear fractions of WI-38 cells that were incubated with125I-FVIIa for varying times showed a time-dependent increase in the radioactivity in the nuclear fraction. At the end of 4-h incubation, about 20 to 23% of internalized 125I-FVIIa was associated with the nuclear fraction. In contrast, only 7–8% of internalized FFR-FVIIa was associated with the nuclear fraction (Fig.4). A comparison of time-dependent FVIIa association with the cells and the nuclear fractions revealed that a steady state condition for the cell surface binding was reached within the first 60 min of FVIIa incubation with the cells as shown in our earlier studies (20Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Voigt J. Ezban M. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36995-37003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the amount of FVIIa associated with the nuclear fraction was increased steadily until the end of experiment duration (4–6 h). When cells were incubated with FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa on ice instead of 37 °C to block endocytosis, but allow the binding of FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa to cells, the amount of radioactivity associated in the nuclear fractions was minimal for both FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa, i.e. 2–4% of the total cell associated radioactivity. These results suggest that the endocytosed FVIIa, but not FFR-FVIIa is accumulated intracellularly in the form, which is associated with nuclei or co-isolating with nuclei. To exclude the possibility of contamination of nuclear fractions with other cell organelles/membranes during isolation, additional experiments were carried out in which nuclear fractions were further purified by ultracentrifugation. In these experiments, nuclear fractions isolated from the homogenates of the cells incubated with FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa were applied on the top of the sucrose barrier, consisting of 2m sucrose supplemented with 20% glycerol. Measurement of the radioactivity in nuclear fractions (bottom fractions) revealed a 4-fold higher amount of 125I-FVIIa in these fractions (normalized to total radioactivity present in the remaining fractions) compared with FFR-FVIIa. These results confirmed the translocation of internalized FVIIa but not FFR-FVIIa to nuclear fractions. WI-38 cells were incubated with unlabeled FVIIa (10 nm) for 4 h at 37 °C and nuclear fractions were prepared as described above. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-TF antibody. As shown in Fig.5, TF content in the nuclear fraction was less than 1% of cellular TF antigen (see lane 2). This observation also rules out the possibility that the nuclear association of FVIIa observed in the above experiments is the result of contaminating plasma membrane or endosomes in nuclear fractions. These results also suggest that FVIIa is dissociated rapidly from TF if it was internalized as FVIIa·TF complexes. Since FVIIa and not FFR-FVIIa translocates into the nuclear fraction, we hypothesized that the FVIIa active site is required to interact with a binding protein, such as Kunitz-type inhibitors like amyloid precursor protein (APP). Such an interaction may be responsible for FVIIa association with the nuclear fraction. It has been shown that a part of APP in neural cell lines was associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton (24Refolo L.M. Wittenberg I.S. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3888-3897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could associate with nuclei. If FVIIa interacts with such a protein, then the nuclear-associated FVIIa would be in catalytically inactive form. Therefore, we have tested the proteolytic activity of FVIIa associated with the nuclear fractions. Contrary to our assumption, FVIIa associated with the nuclear fraction, based on its ability to activate factor X in the presence of TF, is functionally fully active (TableI). Additional experiments were performed to test whether the FVIIa associated with nuclei was intact. Trichloroacetic acid (12% w/v) precipitation of SDS-solubilized nuclear fractions showed that 80–90% of radioactivity of this fraction can be precipitated, suggesting that FVIIa associated with the nuclei was intact. Indeed, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of125I-FVIIa associated with nuclear fractions showed that the apparent molecular weight of 125I-FVIIa in nuclear fraction was similar to that of native FVIIa, i.e. 50,000 (Fig. 6). A faint band seen at 32 kDa (difficult to visualize) may represent the heavy chain of FVIIa, probably derived by intracellular reduction. In addition, a substantial amount of FVIIa is in complex with high molecular weight material, which failed to enter into the separating gel. The intensity of both the radioactive bands increased with the increased times of125I-FVIIa incubation with cells. Overall, the data coupled with the above observations provide strong evidence for a time-dependent translocation of FVIIa molecules into the nuclear fraction.Table IFVIIa levels in nuclear fractionsTimeLevels of nuclear FVIIa determined from% of InternalizedSpecific radioactivityFunctional activitymin303.40.74 ngND1-aND, not determined.605.01.60 ngND12011.32.58 ng5.6 ng24023.07.12 ng8.6 ngMonolayers of WI-38 cells were incubated with either 125I-FVIIa or unlabeled FVIIa (10 nm).
