https://openalex.org/W2037434894,"Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosines and serines following PDGF and EGF treatment of quiescent 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and A431 human epidermoid cells, respectively, PDGF treatment increased PLC-gamma phosphorylation within 30 sec. This lasted for up to 1 hr, and occurred at high stoichiometry. Continuous receptor occupancy was required to maintain this phosphorylation. Three major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in PLC-gamma, two of which were phosphorylated in EGF-treated A431 cells. Under certain conditions PDGF receptor coimmunoprecipitated with PLC-gamma, suggesting that PDGF receptor can phosphorylate PLC-gamma directly. Indeed, purified PDGF or EGF receptor phosphorylated purified PLC-gamma on tyrosines identical to those phosphorylated in vivo. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma was not induced by bombesin, TPA, or insulin. Stimulation of PLC-gamma tyrosine phosphorylation and the reported ability of PDGF and EGF to induce phosphatidylinositol turnover in different cells were strongly correlated. We propose that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma by PDGF and EGF receptors leads to its activation, and a consequent increase in phosphatidylinositol turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1968610357,"Binding of EGF to cells expressing human EGF receptor stimulated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-II (PLC-II), as revealed by immunoblotting analysis with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-II was stimulated by low physiological concentrations of EGF (1 nM), was quantitative, and was already maximal after a 30 sec incubation with 50 nM EGF at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, antibodies specific for PLC-II were able to coimmunoprecipitate the EGF receptor and antibodies against EGF receptor also coimmunoprecipitated PLC-II. According to this analysis, approximately 1% of EGF receptor molecules were associated with PLC-II molecules. The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin RG50864, which blocks EGF-dependent cell proliferation, blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-II, its association with EGF receptor, and EGF-induced Ca2+ release. Hence, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-II may be a regulatory event linking the tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptor to the PIP2 hydrolysis signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2069947334,"THE majority of T cells bear the T-cell receptor (TCR) αβ complex which recognizes foreign antigen peptides only in the context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules1. Such T cells function in a variety of effector roles and secrete cytokines that mediate the activation and differentiation of other cells in the immune system. Recently, a small subpopulation T cells was found to bear a distinct TCR composed of γ and δ subunits2. In man, TCR γδ+ cells are distributed as ~5 per cent of the CD3+ cells in all organized lymphoid organs as well as in the skin- and gut-associated lymphoid tissues3. Although a limited number of germ-line genes encode the TCR γ and δ subunits, extensive junctional variation particularly in the δ gene, results in unprecedented diversity for this receptor4,5 The nature of the specificity and immunological functions of these T cells remains enigmatic. We report here that in contrast to the normal low frequency of γδ-bearing cells in lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood, or normal skin, the frequency is increased five to eightfold in particular granulomatous reactions of leprosy. TCR γδ+lymphocyte lines from these leprosy skin lesions proliferate in vitro specifically to mycobacterial antigens. This reactivity to foreign antigens appears to require presentation in the context of self-molecules. Moreover, culture supernatants from activated γδT lymphocytes induce adhesion and aggregation of bone-marrow monocytes in the presence of granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (CSF), suggesting that products of γδ-bearing T cells may play a role in the immune response, possibly by stimulating granuloma formation."

https://openalex.org/W1999557771,"Arachidonic acid, as well as fatty acids that are not substrates for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, activated a specific type of potassium channel in freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells. Activation occurred in excised membrane patches in the absence of calcium and all nucleotides. Therefore signal transduction pathways that require such soluble factors, including the NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 pathway, do not mediate the response. Thus, fatty acids directly activate potassium channels and so may constitute a class of signal molecules that regulate ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2035622733,"In the mouse, the zona pellucida (ZP) glycoprotein ZP3 both binds intact sperm and induces acrosomal exocytosis. The subsequent signaling pathway(s) is still uncertain, but Gi-like proteins have been implicated. By analogy with other signal transduction mechanisms, we examined anti-phosphotyrosine antibody reactivity in mouse sperm. Antibodies reacted with three proteins of 52, 75, and 95 kd. Indirect immunofluorescence localized reactivity to the acrosomal region of the sperm head. The 52 kd and 75 kd phosphoproteins are detected only in capacitated sperm, whereas the 95 kd protein is detected in both fresh and capacitated sperm. For the 95 kd protein, the level of immunoreactivity is not related to sperm motility but is enhanced by both capacitation and sperm interaction with solubilized ZP proteins. In addition, binding of radiolabeled whole ZP or purified ZP3 to blots of separated sperm proteins identified two ZP binding proteins of 95 kd and 42 kd. 95 kd sperm proteins that bind to ZP3 also react with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (in a ZP concentration-dependent manner), supporting the idea that the same 95 kd sperm protein serves as a ZP3 receptor and as a tyrosine kinase substrate. These findings and our evidence on acrosome reaction triggering via sperm receptor aggregation suggest that a 95 kd protein in the sperm plasma membrane is aggregated by ZP3, which stimulates tyrosine kinase activity leading to acrosomal exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1582984670,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), a recently discovered 60-kDa acute phase protein, is present in the acute phase serum of many species including human, rabbits, mice, and rats. Using either highly purified LBP from acute phase rabbit serum or unfractionated acute phase rabbit serum as a source of LBP, we examined the binding of LBP to LPS immobilized on plastic microtiter plates and to LPS electrotransferred to nitrocellulose after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The presence of LBP bound to LPS was detected with goat anti-rabbit LBP and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG. LBP was found to bind to a variety of LPS types from both rough and smooth strains of Gram-negative bacteria, to lipid A, and to the tetraacyl glucosamine disaccharide diphosphate precursor IVA, but bound very poorly to the diacyl glucosamine phosphate, lipid X. No binding to 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid was observed. Binding affinities for LPS are near 10(9) M-1. The data presented here support the concept that LBP contains a binding site for lipid A."
https://openalex.org/W1981961617,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize foreign antigens, including viral proteins, in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Brefeldin A, a specific inhibitor of exocytosis, completely and reversibly inhibited the presentation of viral proteins, but not exogenous peptides, to MHC class I-restricted CTLs directed against influenza virus antigens. The effect of brefeldin A on antigen presentation correlated with its inhibition of intracellular transport of newly synthesized class I molecules. Brefeldin A is thus a specific inhibitor of antigen processing for class I-restricted T cell recognition. Its effect on antigen presentation supports the idea that exogenous peptide antigens associate with cell surface class I molecules, whereas protein antigens processed via the cytosolic route associate with nascent class I molecules before they leave the trans-Golgi complex."

https://openalex.org/W1513376696,"Abstract In the human circulation, the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) circulate as part of a growth hormone-dependent 125- to 150-kDa complex. This complex has been postulated to contain, in addition to IGFs and one or more IGF-binding proteins, an acid-labile subunit (ALS) which does not itself bind IGFs. In this study, the ALS has been purified 1600-fold from human serum, and its binding properties have been examined. Fresh serum was fractionated on DEAE-Sephadex, and active fractions (determined by radioimmunoassay) were purified by affinity chromatography on an IGF-agarose column saturated with the plasma IGF-binding protein BP-53. After further high performance anion exchange chromatography, an ALS preparation was obtained which contained only an 84-86-kDa protein doublet, converting to a single 70-kDa band on N-glycanase treatment, and having an amino-terminal sequence unrelated to IGF-binding proteins or receptors. Pure ALS formed a complex with BP-53 (Ka approximately 5 x 10(8) M-1), immunoprecipitable by anti-BP-53 antiserum, only in the presence of IGF-I or IGF-II. This complex appeared at approximately 150 kDa on high performance gel chromatography. Pure ALS had no intrinsic IGF-binding activity and no effect on the binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to BP-53. These studies suggest that formation of the high molecular weight IGF-binding protein complex requires ALS, BP-53, and IGF."

https://openalex.org/W2042305464,"Secretory chloride channels can be activated by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase in normal airway epithelial cells but not in cells from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). In excised, inside-out patches of apical membrane of normal human airway cells and airway cells from three patients with CF, the chloride channels exhibited a characteristic outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation and depolarization-induced activation. Channels from normal tissues were activated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. However, chloride channels from CF patients could not be activated by either kinase. Thus, gating of normal epithelial chloride channels is regulated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, and regulation by both kinases is defective in CF."
https://openalex.org/W1583339960,"Abstract A hallmark of the multidrug-resistant phenotype is the overproduction of a family of 130-180-kDa integral membrane phosphoglycoproteins collectively called P-glycoprotein. Gene-specific hybridization probes were derived from three classes of mouse P-glycoprotein cDNAs. These probes revealed the differential amplification and/or transcriptional activation of three distinct but closely related mdr genes (mdr1a, mdr1b, and mdr2) in independently selected multidrug-resistant J774.2 mouse cell lines. Overexpression of mdr1a and mdr1b was found to correlate, in general, with the differential overproduction of either a 120- or 125-kDa P-glycoprotein precursor, respectively. This same correlation was observed in a single cell line during the course of stepwise selection for resistance to vinblastine in which a switch in gene expression from mdr1b to mdr1a resulted in a switch from the 125- to 120-kDa P-glycoprotein precursor. These findings suggest that differential overexpression of distinct mdr genes which encode unique P-glycoprotein isoforms is a possible mechanism for generating diversity in the multidrug-resistant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1581840018,"Wheat germ RNA polymerase II was used to raise monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that cross-react with the largest subunit of calf thymus RNA polymerase II. Most of these mAbs were of the IgM isotype and were shown to react with a synthetic peptide containing the consensus sequence for the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat that has been found on the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II from a variety of eukaryotic organisms. A representative mAb (3WG2) was tested for its effect on transcription in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Antibody 3WG2 did not affect the transcription (elongation) of wheat germ RNA polymerase II on denatured calf thymus DNA. When HeLa cell nuclear extracts were preincubated with the mAb, run-off transcription from a promoter that contains a TATA box (the adenovirus-2 major late promoter) and from a promoter that does not contain a TATA box (the murine dihydrofolate reductase gene promoter = dhfr) was inhibited. Transcription from these promoters was also inhibited by the synthetic peptide containing the consensus sequence when it was conjugated to bovine serum albumin. HeLa cell nuclear extract in which the endogenous RNA polymerase II had been inhibited by the specific mAb was used to examine the ability of added mammalian RNA polymerase II that lacks the C-terminal domain to accurately transcribe specific genes. When calf thymus RNA polymerase II that lacked the C-terminal domain was added back to the inhibited extract, a discrete transcript that was initiated correctly was obtained with the adenovirus-2 major late promoter; however, no discrete transcript was observed from the mouse dhfr gene promoter. When injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, antibody 3WG2 inhibited transcription of the human histone H2b gene (contains a TATA box) and the human U1 small nuclear RNA gene (does not contain a TATA box), but did not inhibit transcription from RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase III promoters. These results indicate that the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat plays a critical role in promoter-directed transcription, although enzyme that lacks this domain can initiate from some promoters in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2041730140,"The methylated nucleoside 1-methylguanosine (m1G) is present next to the 3' end of the anticodon (position 37) in all transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that read codons starting with C except in those tRNAs that read CAN codons. All of the three proline tRNA species, which read CCN codons in Salmonella typhimurium, have been sequenced and shown to contain m1G in position 37. A mutant of S. typhimurium that lacks m1G in its tRNA when grown at temperatures above 37 degrees C, has now been isolated. The mutation (trmD3) responsible for this methylation deficiency is in the structural gene (trmD) for the tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase. Therefore, the three proline tRNAs in the trmD3 mutant have an unmodified guanosine at position 37. Furthermore, the trmD3 mutation also causes at least one of the tRNAPro species to frequently shift frame when C's are present successively in the message. Thus, m1G appears to prevent frameshifting. The data from eubacteria apply to both eukaryotes and archaebacteria."

The anti-ergotypic response thus combines with the previously shown anti-idiotypic T cell response to regulate autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1595785723,"Elongation and termination by RNA polymerase II are important regulatory steps for eukaryotic gene expression. We have previously studied the transcription of linear DNA templates where specific initiation of transcription by highly purified RNA polymerase II can be achieved in the absence of promoters and promoter-specific factors. Using these templates we have shown that a human histone gene, H3.3, contains sequences (intrinsic terminators) within which purified RNA polymerase II will efficiently terminate transcription (Reines, D., Wells, D., Chamberlin, M.J., and Kane, C. M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 299-312). Curiously, these signals were found within an intron, 3'-untranslated, and protein-encoding regions of the gene suggesting that they might act to attenuate transcription of H3.3 in vivo. Here we show that intrinsic terminator sequences from an H3.3 gene intron also block in vitro transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II when the enzyme has initiated transcription from a promoter using highly purified transcription initiation factors. However, under the conditions used for promoter-specific transcription there is little transcript release. Instead the polymerase can pause at these sites for periods exceeding 60 min. We have identified and partially purified an activity from HeLa cells that causes the transcription complex to read through this block to transcription elongation. This readthrough activity fractionates with a previously characterized elongation factor (SII) over three chromatographic columns. A homogeneous preparation of calf thymus SII can also provide this activity in trans. This factor may facilitate passage of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex through such intragenic sites in cellular genes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2084647191,"Chloride channels mediate absorption and secretion of fluid in epithelia, and the regulation of these channels is now known to be defective in cystic fibrosis. Indanyl-oxyacetic acid 94 (IAA-94) is a high-affinity ligand for the chloride channel, and an affinity resin based on that structure was developed. Solubilized proteins from kidney and trachea membranes were applied to the affinity matrix, and four proteins with apparent molecular masses of 97, 64, 40, and 27 kilodaltons were eluted from the column by excess IAA-94. A potential-dependent 36Cl- uptake was observed after reconstituting these proteins into liposomes. Three types of chloride channels with single-channel conductances of 26, 100, and 400 picosiemens were observed after fusion of these liposomes with planar lipid bilayers. Similar types of chloride channels have been observed in epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1550857893,"IgE-mediated stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells results in the secretion of histamine. Myosin immunoprecipitated from these cells shows an increase in the amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated into its heavy (200 kDa) and light (20 kDa) chains. In unstimulated cells two-dimensional mapping of tryptic peptides of the myosin light chain reveals one phosphopeptide containing the serine residue phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase. Following stimulation a second phosphopeptide appears containing a serine residue phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps derived from myosin heavy chains show that unstimulated cells contain three major phosphopeptides. Following stimulation a new tryptic phosphopeptide appears containing a serine site phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of the myosin light and heavy chains was determined before and after antigenic stimulation. Before stimulation, myosin light chains contained 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of light chain all confined to a serine not phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Cells that secreted 44% of their total histamine in 10 min exhibited an increase in phosphate content at sites phosphorylated by protein kinase C from 0 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin subunit to 0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of light chain and to 1 mol of phosphate/mol of heavy chain. When RBL-2H3 cells were made permeable with streptolysin O they still showed a qualitatively similar pattern of secretion and phosphorylation. Our results show that the time course of histamine secretion from stimulated RBL-2H3 cells parallels that of myosin heavy and light chain phosphorylation by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1577282104,"We have examined how the alpha 2(I), alpha 1(III), alpha 1(IV), and alpha 2(V) collagen genes as well as the thrombospondin and fibronectin genes are regulated by conditions that modulate the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vitro. We find that smooth muscle cells (SMC) arrested by low serum containing media continue to express similar or slightly lower levels of mRNA for all the genes studied except type III collagen which exhibited a 5-fold increase. By contrast, when SMC are density-arrested, a coordinate increase in mRNA levels for all the extracellular matrix genes studied is observed. The increases range from approximately 1.5-fold for fibronectin to 5-fold for type III collagen. The mRNA levels for beta-tubulin and vimentin, however, are decreased in these density-arrested cells. Interestingly, the time course of increase for type IV collagen and fibronectin can be distinguished from the other extracellular matrix genes and best correlates with an increase in cell-cell contact. The increase in steady-state RNA levels for alpha 1(IV) collagen is not shared by fibroblasts similarly treated and may provide a useful marker for SMC in culture. Heparin, a potent inhibitor of SMC growth, increased the level of type III collagen mRNA about 2.5-fold and also increased the level of alpha 2(V) collagen and fibronectin. Transforming growth factor-beta is found to be a cell density-dependent modulator of SMC growth. Surprisingly, transforming growth factor-beta had little effect on most of the extracellular matrix genes studied. However, transforming growth factor-beta treatment of SMC increased thrombospondin mRNA levels about 4-fold, whereas type IV collagen mRNA exhibited a 2-fold increase. We conclude that type III collagen mRNA levels are positively and tightly coupled to SMC quiescence. The effect of cellular quiescence on other extracellular matrix mRNAs is complex but, in general, positive. This is particularly evident in SMC arrested by high cell density."
https://openalex.org/W1527291914,"In order to characterize more fully the mechanism by which casein kinase II is regulated in mammalian cells, the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the activity of the kinase in human A-431 carcinoma cells was examined. Treatment of cells with EGF prior to lysis consistently resulted in a transient 4-fold increase in the activity of cytosolic casein kinase II. Activity rose sharply between 20 and 30 min, peaked at approximately 50 min, and returned to basal levels by approximately 120 min. Similar results were obtained using the casein kinase II specific peptide substrate, Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu, or DNA topoisomerase II (which is specifically modified by the kinase in vivo and serves as a high affinity substrate in vitro) as the phosphate acceptor in assays. Identification of casein kinase II as the stimulated activity was confirmed by partial proteolytic mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis of modified topoisomerase II, by inhibition at nanomolar levels of heparin or micromolar levels of nonradioactive GTP, and by the ability to employ radioactive GTP as a direct phosphate donor. The EGF stimulation of casein kinase II was dependent on the availability of intracellular (but not extracellular) calcium. In addition, hormonal action was modulated by calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Casein kinase II stimulation did not require an increase in the concentration of the kinase, protein synthesis, the continual presence of a small effector molecule, or a direct interaction with the EGF receptor/tyrosine kinase. In contrast, hormonal activation of the kinase was dependent on the phosphorylation of casein kinase II or a terminal stimulatory factor."
https://openalex.org/W1481438227,"Little is known about the important cellular substrates for protein kinase C and their potential roles in mediating protein kinase C-dependent processes. We evaluated the protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in a major cellular substrate for the kinase, a protein of apparent Mr 80,000 in bovine and 60,000 in chicken tissues; we have recently determined the primary sequences of these proteins and tentatively named them the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrates. The proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine and chicken brains, phosphorylated with protein kinase C, digested with trypsin, and the phosphopeptides purified and sequenced. Four distinct phosphopeptides were identified from both the bovine and chicken proteins. Two of the phosphorylated serines were contained in the repeated motif FSFKK, one in the sequence LSGF, and one in the sequence SFK. All four sites were contained within a basic domain of 25 amino acids which was identical in the chicken and bovine proteins. All of the sites phosphorylated in the cell-free system appeared to be phosphorylated in intact cells; an additional site may have been present in the proteins from intact cells. The identity of the phosphorylation site domains from two proteins of overall 65% amino acid sequence identity suggests a potential role for this domain in the physiological function of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1969879168,"Large T antigen, the regulatory protein encoded by simian virus 40, has DNA helicase activity and unwinds double-stranded DNA at the expense of ATP. T antigen also functions as an RNA helicase separating duplex regions in partially double-stranded RNA substrates. Surprisingly, T antigen RNA helicase activity requires UTP, CTP, or GTP as a cofactor, whereas ATP is an inefficient energy source for the RNA unwinding reaction. Accordingly, T antigen has both an intrinsic non-ATP NTPase activity that is stimulated by single-stranded RNA and an ATPase activity stimulated by single-stranded DNA. Thus, it appears that the bound nucleotide determines whether T antigen acts as an RNA helicase or as a DNA helicase."
https://openalex.org/W2049827739,An airway epithelial cell line (CF/T43) was developed by infecting cultured airway epithelial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with the pZIPneoSV(X)1/SV40T retrovirus and selecting for G418 resistance and ion transport properties. The distinctive chloride secretory phenotypes of the CF cell line CF/T43 and a normal cell line (NL/T4) were not perturbed by SV40T-induced cell transformation. Epithelial cell lines generated from CF cells with the SV40T gene can be used to test candidate CF genes and to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the CF phenotype.
https://openalex.org/W2042169196,The gramicidin A transmembrane channel is believed to consist of two head-to-head β helices. Computer-generated models were used to formulate the structure of new single-chain channel molecules based on the gramicidin motif. The chemical synthesis of two tartaric acid-gramicidin A hybrids and single-channel analyses of their conducting properties are reported. These studies illustrate the rational design and synthesis of long-lived channels with tunable conductance properties and provide support for current molecular models of the natural (dimeric) gramicidin channel.
https://openalex.org/W1582334046,"The monoclonal antibody FDC-6 defines a structure specific to oncofetal fibronectins (onf-FN) isolated from fetal and malignant cells and tissues. The absence of this structure is characteristic of normal fibronectin (nor-FN) isolated from plasma and adult normal tissue (Matsuura, H., and Hakomori, S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 6517–6521). The minimum structure required for FDC-6 reactivity was determined to be Val-Thr-His-Pro-Gly-Tyr (VTHPGY) with α-N-acetylgalactosamine (α-GalNAc) at Thr, although α-GalNAc per se is not involved in the FDC-6 epitope (Matsuura, H., Takio, K., Titani, K., Greene, T., Levery, S. B., Salyan, M. E. K., and Hakomori, S. (1988) J. Biol. Ckem. 263, 3314–3322). Thus, a single glycosylation on the normally occurring peptide of FN may induce conformational changes in the peptide to form the specific oncofetal epitope recognized by FDC-6 antibody. The FDC-6-nonreactive synthetic peptide containing the VTHPGY sequence was converted into FDC-6-reactive form on incubation with α-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase and UDP-[3H]GalNAc in the homogenate of hepatoma cell line HUH-7, human fetal fibroblast cell line WI-38, or human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. Such a conversion did not take place when the same enzyme fraction of normal adult tissue was incubated with the VTHPGY peptide under the same conditions. Thus, the occurrence of α-GalNAc transferase recognizing the VTHPGY peptide sequence (UDP-GalNAc:VTHPGY α-GalNAc transferase) is specific for fetal and cancer tissues, and absent in normal adult tissues. However, a similar α-GalNAc transferase activity capable of transferring the GalNAc residue to other Ser or Thr hydroxyl groups of nor-FN, and presumably located at the type III connecting segment region, was detectable in homogenate of various normal tissues. Such enzyme activity was determined with the use of enzymatically de-O-glycosylated nor-FN. Thus, the enzymatic basis of FDC-6 epitope formation is a subtle change in the substrate specificity of α-GalNAc transferase. The normal enzyme is incapable of transferring α-GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the Thr residue of the VTHPGY sequence, but is capable of transferring α-GalNAc to other Ser or Thr residues of FN. In contrast, α-GalNAc transferase of fetal and cancer tissues may have broader specificity and the capability to transfer GalNAc to Thr or Ser residues, including those of the VTHPGY sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2127833208,"The complete amino acid sequence of a Lolium perenne (rye grass) pollen allergen, Lol p II was determined by automated Edman degradation of the protein and selected fragments. Cleavage of the protein by enzymatic and chemical techniques established an unambiguous sequence for the protein. Lol p II contains 97 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular weight of 10,882. The protein lacks cysteine and glutamine and shows no evidence of glycosylation. Theoretical predictions by Fraga's (Fraga, S. (1982) Can. J. Chem. 60, 2606–2610) and Hopp and Woods' (Hopp, T. P., and Woods, K. R. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 3824–3828) methods indicate the presence of four hydrophilic regions, which may contribute to sequential or parts of conformational B-cell epitopes. Analysis of amphipathic regions by Berzofsky's method indicates the presence of a highly amphipathic region, which may contain, or contribute to, an Ia/Tcell epitope. This latter segment of Lol p II was found to be highly homologous with an antibody-binding segment of the major rye allergen Lol p I and may explain why immune responsiveness to both the allergens is associated with HLA-DR3."
https://openalex.org/W1485805147,"We have localized the binding epitope(s) of two murine monoclonal antibodies (B7C9 and P5-2-1) that were shown previously to inhibit the activation of human coagulation factor XII by negatively charged surfaces. A factor XII cDNA expression library in lambda gt11 was screened with antibody B7C9, and 16 immunoreactive bacteriophage were isolated. Fusion proteins from each of the recombinant phage were reactive with both monoclonal antibodies. Two of the phage cDNA inserts were found to code for amino acid residues -6-+31 and +1-+47 of factor XII, respectively, thereby defining the limits of the antigenic peptide to amino acids +1-+31. Each of the remaining 14 recombinant phage contained longer factor XII cDNA inserts that included sequences coding for the amino-terminal 31 amino acid residues. These results were confirmed by direct binding of antibody B7C9 to synthetic peptides containing amino acids 1-14 and 1-28 of factor XII. Further experiments with a set of nested peptides also indicated that amino acid residues 1-4 were essential but not sufficient for binding of B7C9 to the peptides. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino-terminal region of plasma factor XII revealed a highly hydrophilic region between amino acid residues 5 and 15 that contained positively charged lysine residues at positions 8, 11, and 13. We conclude that a major epitope(s) recognized by monoclonal antibodies B7C9 and P5-2-1 is present in the amino-terminal 28 amino acids of factor XII. It is proposed that binding of these antibodies to factor XII blocks interaction of the positively charged region between residues 5 and 15 with negatively charged surfaces, thereby inhibiting activation."
https://openalex.org/W1540510234,"The present study shows that insulin causes an increase in the binding of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) to 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Scatchard analysis of the binding at 4 degrees C indicated an approximate 2-fold increase in the number of alpha 2M binding sites, with no change in the apparent affinity of the receptor. In addition, a 2-3-fold increase in the binding of monoclonal antibody 2C6, which recognizes a component of the alpha 2M receptor, was found in cells treated at 37 degrees C with insulin and then KCN to inhibit receptor endocytosis. An increased cellular accumulation of alpha 2M was also observed in response to insulin. Interestingly, the increase in the rate of accumulation of alpha 2M was significantly smaller than the increase in the number of alpha 2M receptors on the cell surface, suggesting that the rate of ligand internalization or subsequent processing is altered in response to insulin. Ultrastructural analysis of the internalization pathway of the alpha 2M receptor was performed using colloidal gold-coupled 2C6 monoclonal antibody. Control cells incubated for 20 min at 37 degrees C with the gold-conjugated antibody displayed 40% of cellular gold particles on the cell surface and 60% within intracellular structures. In insulin-treated cells this proportion was reversed, with 64% of the particles being found on the cell surface, and only 36% within intracellular structures. Significant differences in the distribution of gold particles among intracellular structures were detected between control and insulin-treated cells. Whereas in control cells, 18% of the total cellular gold particles internalized into tubulovesicles and multivesicular bodies, in insulin-treated cells only 3% of the gold particles were found within these structures. These data indicate that the movement of this receptor between endocytic compartments is altered in response to insulin, and suggest that the effect of insulin to increase the cell surface concentration of alpha 2M receptors and the accumulation of alpha 2M is due, at least in part, to alterations in the endocytic portion of the receptor recycling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1512874960,"Two peptides with hydropathic complementarity to residues 356-375 of the c-raf protein were synthesized to determine if they recognize the raf-(356-375) peptide as well as the entire protein. One peptide was deduced from the complementary mRNA for the raf protein corresponding to residues 356-375, whereas the other was deduced solely from the amino acid sequence of the 20-mer segment using a computer program able to generate peptide sequences with hydropathic complementarity to a given sequence. Specific binding of both peptides to the raf 20-mer segment was demonstrated when either the raf 20-mer peptide or the complementary peptides were immobilized on a column. Binding affinities were in the millimolar-micromolar range. Identical binding properties were observed with peptides synthesized with either all D- or all L-amino acids, suggesting a lack of conformational dependence. Binding was also unaffected by the presence of 8 M urea or detergents, was dependent on solvent characteristics of pH and ionic strength, and was abolished by the presence of competing peptides in the eluting buffer. Recognition between raf complementary peptides was accompanied by spectral changes in the far and near UV region, as monitored by circular dichroism. Proteolytic degradation was retarded by the binding of these peptides. Once immobilized on a column, these peptides proved useful for the isolation by affinity chromatography of a recombinant c-raf protein from an Escherichia coli crude cell extract."

https://openalex.org/W1523384460,"The biochemical events encompassing the dephosphorylation of protein kinase C substrates by protein kinase A activators have been investigated in a neurotumor cell line, NCB-20. Treatment of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells with protein kinase A activators (e.g. forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, prostaglandin E1) resulted in an inhibition of protein kinase C activity due to a failure of the protein kinase C complex to translocate into the membrane. Phospholipase C activity, as measured by the synchronous release of diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and inositol 1-phosphate) in response to bradykinin, was inhibited up to 50% following exposure to protein kinase A activators. At the same time, phospholipase C-specific inositol phospholipid substrates (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) were found to accumulate in NCB-20 cells following treatment with protein kinase A activators. This suggests that phospholipase C may be altered through protein kinase A-mediated protein phosphorylation. Second messenger generation (inositol phosphates, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+) is therefore inhibited through cyclic AMP-mediated shutdown of the inositol lipid cycle at the level of phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1491383374,"Balb/MK keratinocytes require epidermal growth factor for proliferation and terminally differentiate in response to elevated extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The molecular pathways controlling cell differentiation in this system have yet to be established. We show that a dramatic and sustained activation of phosphoinositide metabolism is produced upon addition of Ca2+ to Balb/MK cultures. The pattern of inositol trisphosphate isomers released in response to Ca2+ challenge appeared to be atypical. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate release was observed by 30s and was produced earlier than any alteration in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels. Concomitant with the liberation of inositol phosphates, an increased production of diacylglycerol was observed. Despite a 3-fold increase in diacylglycerol levels detected even at 12 h after Ca2+ addition, no evidence of functional activation or down-regulation of protein kinase C was found. This was established by measuring p80 phosphorylation, epidermal growth factor binding, and protein kinase C levels by immunoblotting. Analysis of the diacylglycerol generated following Ca2+ addition to Balb/MK cells revealed that a significant proportion of that lipid was an alkyl ether glyceride molecular species. Therefore, it is possible that this diacylglycerol molecular species may play a role in the Ca2+-induced differentiation program of Balb/MK cells through mechanisms other than stimulation of classical protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1646658324,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates calcium mobilization and influx in pituitary gonadotrophs, and agonist-induced calcium entry through voltage-sensitive channels (VSCC) is required for the maintenance of gonadotropin secretion. However, prolonged or frequent exposure to GnRH attenuates the extracellular Ca2+-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ signal and diminishes hormone secretion. Measurements of membrane Ca2+ currents revealed significant impairment of VSCC activity in gonadotrophs during desensitization by GnRH. VSSC were also inactivated in a calcium-dependent manner during exposure to high K+. Prolonged inactivation of such Ca2+ channels by high K+ reduced the calcium and secretory responses to GnRH and vice versa. The calcium-dependent inactivation of VSCC during GnRH action appears to be a primary factor in the onset of desensitization in pituitary gonadotrophs. This mechanism could also account for the development of agonist-induced refractoriness in other calcium-regulated target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508938331,"Fetuin is a major protein of fetal bovine serum that exhibits heterogeneity and has been found to be associated with some biological active growth factors. Preliminary studies indicated that commercial fetuin preparations contain lipids. We investigated in detail the nature of lipids associated with fetuin by using ultracentrifugation and agarose gel chromatography followed by lipid analysis. Fetuin was associated with a variety of lipids, predominantly cholesterol, cholesteryl ester with smaller amounts of phospholipids, triglycerides, and free fatty acids. Adjustment of fetuin preparation for various densities followed by ultracentrifugation resulted in a fraction with a density 1.063-1.21 g/ml (1-2% of total protein) that contained the bulk of the lipids. This fraction eluted as a single peak upon high pressure liquid chromatography and agarose gel chromatography. Delipidation of the lipoprotein-like particle followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a major band in the range of fetuin itself. These studies suggest that a fraction of fetuin (or isoform) binds lipids forming a particle with floating characteristics similar to high density lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1970292550,"Abstract Transverse tubule membranes isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle consist mainly of sealed vesicles that are oriented primarily inside out. These membranes contain a high density of binding sites for 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. The presence of functional voltage-dependent calcium channels in these membranes has been demonstrated by their ability to mediate 45Ca2+ efflux in response to changes in membrane potential. Fluorescence changes of the voltage-sensitive dye, 3,3'-dipropyl-2,2'-thiadicarbocyanine, have shown that transverse tubule vesicles may generate and maintain membrane potentials in response to establishing potassium gradients across the membrane in the presence of valinomycin. A two-step procedure has been developed to measure voltage-dependent calcium fluxes. Vesicles loaded with 45Ca2+ are first diluted into a buffer designed to generate a membrane potential mimicking the resting state of the cell and to reduce the extravesicular Ca2+ to sub-micromolar levels. 45Ca2+ efflux is then measured upon subsequent depolarization. Flux responses are modulated with appropriate pharmacological specificity by 1,4-dihydropyridines and are inhibited by other calcium channel antagonists such as lanthanum and verapamil."
https://openalex.org/W1512346901,"Abstract P-450IIB genes (P-450b and P-450e in rat) are induced following treatment with phenobarbital predominantly in hepatocytes located in zones 2 and 3 of the liver acinus. The previous finding of phenobarbital-mediated induction of P-450IIB mRNAs and apoproteins in the same zonal hepatocytes suggests that this differential induction is most likely due to zonal differences in the activation of gene transcription. To determine whether differential P-450IIB gene transcription was dependent on the type of inducer (i.e., inducer specificity) or on the capacity of hepatocytes located in different acinar zones to respond to inducers (i.e. zonal specificity), the pattern of acinar induction was evaluated following treatment with inducers that have diverse physiochemical properties and inductive capacities. The zonal distribution of P-450b and P-450e mRNAs in liver was determined by in situ hybridization after the administration of either phenobarbital, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordane, or chlorpromazine. Liver sections were hybridized with 3H-labeled RNA transcripts of a P-450e cDNA that recognizes sequences of both P-450b and P-450e mRNAs and the pattern of zonal mRNA induction was measured by quantitative image analysis. Each inducer increased P-450b,e mRNA levels predominantly in hepatocytes of zones 2 and 3 of the hepatic acinus. The P-450b and P-450e apoproteins were induced in the same zonal hepatocytes as the P-450b,e mRNAs as shown by immunofluorescence studies using monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, differential transcriptional induction of the P-450IIB genes in the liver acinus does not seem to be dependent on a specific chemical inducer, but rather is a characteristic capacity of hepatocytes located in different acinar zones. To determine whether the induction of P-450b and P-450e was dependent on the liver tissue organization, hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of the liver and transplanted into the spleens of syngeneic rats. Induction of P-450b and P-450e mRNAs and apoproteins, assessed 1 month after transplantation, was evident with each of the chemical inducers. These data suggest that, once hepatocytes have attained the capacity to respond to inducers, the organization of hepatocytes into acini and the sinusoidal microenvironment of the liver are not required for hepatocytes to maintain the ability to respond to inducers with an increase in transcription of P-450IIB genes. Moreover, the splenic hepatocytes demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of P-450b,e apoprotein induction; this raises the possibility that the acinar organization is also not required for the heterogenous expression of P-450IIB genes."
https://openalex.org/W2032531332,"Although the T cell receptor (TCR) αβ heterodimer and its encoding genes have been characterized, a cell-free form of this receptor, which is needed for the study of functional or ligand-binding properties of the receptor, has not previously been isolated. When the cell-free supernatant products of activated cloned T helper (TH) cells were found to mediate helper activity with antigen specificity identical to that of intact T cells, experiments were carried out to determine whether this functional activity was mediated by a cell-free form of TCR-related material. A disulfide-linked dimer indistinguishable from the T cell surface αβ heterodimer was precipitated from cell-free supernatants of cloned TH cells with F23.1, a monoclonal antibody specific for a TCR Vβ8 determinant. Moreover, when cell-free TH products were bound to and eluted from immobilized F23.1, these affinity-purified materials had antigen-specific and major histocompatibility complex-restricted helper activity that synergized with recombinant lymphokines in the generation of B cell antibody responses. These findings suggest that the factor isolated from T cell supernatants is a cell-free form of the TCRαβ dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1552175108,"Comparative x-ray scattering experiments and electron microscopic observations have been performed on native S-form, and on different F-forms of human plasma α2-macroglobulin (α2M), obtained by proteinase (chymotrypsin, plasmin, and thrombin) or methylamine treatment. Image processing of electron micrographs of the α2M molecules transformed by chymotrypsin, plasmin, and methylamine displayed average images which could be compared. The proteinase-complex α2M molecules exhibited the usual H-like structure, but the methylamine-inactivated ones showed a different organization, with almost no stain-excluding material in the central region of the molecule, which therefore presented a central cavity filled with stain. By subtracting average images of α2M-methylamine from α2M-chymotrypsin or α2M-plasmin, a putative localization of the proteinases inside the α2M molecule, very close to its center was revealed. The values of the radii of gyration for the S- and F-forms obtained by x-ray scattering were very different (78 and 67.7 A, respectively). All four scattering curves of the F-forms were comparable in shape and showed maxima and minima different from that of the S-form α2M. Image processing of electron micrographs and x-ray scattering have provided independent results which indicate that a large cavity exists in the α2M-methylamine molecule and that the proteinases might be located in a very central position inside the α2M-proteinase molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1499747057,"In an attempt to define an active domain of the protein, fragments of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) were obtained by limited digestion of the native, plasma-derived protein with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or by expression of CETP cDNA restriction fragments in Escherichia coli. Although digestion of native CETP with these proteases resulted in extensive fragmentation of the protein and loss of the intact 74-kDa molecule as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CE transfer activity was unaffected (trypsin or chymotrypsin treatment) or only partially lost (V8 protease treatment). Analysis by molecular sieve chromatography showed that the CE transfer-active product of this proteolysis consisted of polypeptide fragments which remained associated, retaining the native molecular weight of CETP. These proteolyzed complexes were resistant to dissociation by dithiothreitol, 8 M urea, or delipidating agents. As shown by CE transfer activity, native CETP was found to possess a stable conformation which remained unchanged in buffers containing up to 4.5 M urea, or following exposure to even higher (8 M) urea concentrations. CETP polypeptides from bacterially expressed cDNA fragments were found to be catalytically inactive although they contained the epitope for an inhibitory anti-CETP monoclonal antibody and had emulsion binding properties similar to native CETP. Selected synthetic CETP peptides (including the peptide containing the inhibitory monoclonal antibody epitope) were also devoid of CE transfer activity. Thus, no evidence was found for an independently active subunit of the CETP. Together, the results indicate that the CETP possesses a distinct and highly stable tertiary structure which is required for CE transfer catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1536256430,"Abstract The methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases HpaII and HhaI and the methylation-insensitive enzyme MspI were used to examine the methylation status of the 5' end of the human apolipoprotein B gene in cells in which the gene is transcriptionally active, such as HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells, and in HeLa cells, which do not express the gene. Several CCGG and GCGC sequences present in the region from -899 to +121 relative to the transcriptional start of the gene were undermethylated in HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells but methylated in HeLa cells. Because the region between -899 and +121 had previously been shown to exhibit tissue-specific promoter activity and to contain many DNaseI- and micrococcal nuclease-hypersensitive sites (Levy-Wilson, B., Fortier, C., Blackhart, B.D., and McCarthy, B.J.

https://openalex.org/W1482899652,"Abstract Fusion proteins are used to define with precision an evolutionarily conserved domain on the carboxyl-terminal portion of the chromoprotein phytochrome. Simultaneously, assignments of two other epitopes are made with significantly greater precision, while the location of a fourth is confirmed. The epitope-mapping method that is described here is systematic, using complementary, overlapping nested sets of fusion proteins of predefined sequence rather than randomly generated peptides. Moreover, in contrast to previous methods, this approach yields rigorous and unambiguous assignments because it relies solely upon the ability of an antibody to detect a given polypeptide. A cDNA fragment encoding phytochrome amino acids 464-1129, which is its carboxyl terminus, was identified in lambda gt11 and subcloned in frame into the lacZ alpha sequence of pUC18. Four nested sets of subclones in pUC18 were created by digestion with selected restriction endonucleases and with the exonuclease Bal31. Fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The epitope for monoclonal antibody Oat-13 was confirmed to be between residues 551 and 617, while the epitopes for Oat-8 and Oat-28 were narrowed to 624-686 and 624-747, respectively. The epitope recognized by Pea-25, Pea-2, and Oat-15 was resolved unequivocally to a sequence of only seven residues (residues 765-771): N-Pro-Ile-Phe-Gly-Ala-Asp-Glu-C."
https://openalex.org/W1538938046,"We have previously demonstrated that cultures of myocytes from embryonic chick atria grown in media supplemented with fetal calf serum from which lipoproteins have been removed demonstrate a nearly 10-fold increase in sensitivity of beating to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine compared with cells grown with control medium. This increased response to carbamylcholine was associated with a 1.4-fold increase in total cell cholesterol, a 2-fold increase in the number of muscarinic receptors which bind agonist with high affinity, and a 2-fold increase in the levels of the alpha subunits of Go and Gi (Haigh, L. S., Leatherman, G. F., O'Hara, D. S., Smith, T. W., and Galper, J. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15608-15618). In the studies reported here, we determined the responsiveness of cells grown in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Isoproterenol stimulated a contractile response of 58% measured as an increase in amplitude of contraction with a half-maximal effect at 3 x 10(-7) M for cells grown in fetal calf serum, but had no significant effect on amplitude of contraction on cells grown in LPDS. In cells grown in media supplemented with fetal calf serum, isoproterenol (1 x 10(-3) M) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity 100% over basal with an EC50 of 7 x 10(-6) M compared with an increase of 32% in cells grown in media supplemented with LPDS. beta-Adrenergic receptor number as measured by the binding of 125I-pindolol decreased from 24 +/- 3 (+/- S.E., n = 6) fmol/mg protein in cells grown under control conditions to 12 +/- 2 (n = 6) fmol/mg protein in media supplemented with LPDS. The level of alpha s as measured both by ADP-ribosylation with cholera toxin in the presence of 32P-NAD and by immunoblotting with specific antibody to alpha s decreased by 3-fold in cells grown in media supplemented with LPDS compared with control. All of these effects of growth of cells in LPDS were reversed by incubating cells with LPDS plus 30 microM mevinolin, an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. These studies indicate that growth of cells in media supplemented with LPDS results in a coordinate decrease in the levels of beta-adrenergic receptors and alpha s. Taken together with our previous studies these data support the hypothesis that the receptors and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins which mediate sympathetic and parasympathetic responsiveness in the heart are reciprocally regulated."
