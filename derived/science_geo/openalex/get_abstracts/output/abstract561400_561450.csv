https://openalex.org/W2395887422,"Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets. Quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of genomically annotated human breast cancer samples elucidates functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies potential therapeutic targets. This large-scale collaborative study describes quantitative-mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), representing the four principal mRNA-defined breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. The result is a high-quality proteomic resource for human breast cancer investigation, achieved using technologies and analytical approaches that illuminate the connections between genome and proteome. The data narrow candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identify potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2404947714,"A similar neural ensemble participates in the encoding of two distinct memories, resulting in the recall of one memory increasing the likelihood of recalling the other, but only if those memories occur very closely in time—within a day rather than across a week. This paper tests and provides support for the emerging hypothesis that two distinct memories formed close in time may be linked, such that recall of one triggers recall of the other. Using a range of techniques including in vivo calcium imaging with miniature head-mounted fluorescent microscopes in freely behaving mice, Alcino Silva and colleagues show that learning-dependent changes in excitability can temporally and contextually link memories formed close in time. Interestingly the overlap between memory encoding ensembles and strengthening of the second memory within short periods of time do not occur in aged animals, which do not exhibit the increased hippocampal excitability necessary for such links to occur. Recent studies suggest that a shared neural ensemble may link distinct memories encoded close in time1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. According to the memory allocation hypothesis1,2, learning triggers a temporary increase in neuronal excitability13,14,15 that biases the representation of a subsequent memory to the neuronal ensemble encoding the first memory, such that recall of one memory increases the likelihood of recalling the other memory. Here we show in mice that the overlap between the hippocampal CA1 ensembles activated by two distinct contexts acquired within a day is higher than when they are separated by a week. Several findings indicate that this overlap of neuronal ensembles links two contextual memories. First, fear paired with one context is transferred to a neutral context when the two contexts are acquired within a day but not across a week. Second, the first memory strengthens the second memory within a day but not across a week. Older mice, known to have lower CA1 excitability15,16, do not show the overlap between ensembles, the transfer of fear between contexts, or the strengthening of the second memory. Finally, in aged mice, increasing cellular excitability and activating a common ensemble of CA1 neurons during two distinct context exposures rescued the deficit in linking memories. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that contextual memories encoded close in time are linked by directing storage into overlapping ensembles. Alteration of these processes by ageing could affect the temporal structure of memories, thus impairing efficient recall of related information."
https://openalex.org/W2400274474,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments for non-small cell lung cancers harbouring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase, but resistance arises rapidly, most frequently owing to the secondary T790M mutation within the ATP site of the receptor. Recently developed mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors are highly active against the T790M mutant, but their efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of C797, the cysteine residue with which they form a key covalent bond. All current EGFR TKIs target the ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with alternative mechanisms of action. Here we describe the rational discovery of EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants but spares the wild-type receptor. The crystal structure shows that the compound binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory C-helix in an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays. However, as a single agent it is not effective in blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells owing to differential potency on the two subunits of the dimeric receptor, which interact in an asymmetric manner in the active state. We observe marked synergy of EAI045 with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR dimerization, rendering the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in combination with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by EGFR(L858R/T790M) and by EGFR(L858R/T790M/C797S), a mutant that is resistant to all currently available EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the utility of purposefully targeting allosteric sites to obtain mutant-selective inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2411105275,"The thermal conductivity of solid iron at the pressure and temperature conditions that prevail in the cores of planets is measured directly using a dynamically laser-heated diamond-anvil cell, yielding values that support findings from ancient magnetized rocks that suggest Earth’s magnetic field has persisted since the Earth’s earliest history. The thermal conductivity of iron and its alloys at high pressure and temperature is a critical factor in the evolution and dynamics of Earth-like planets. Recently, increasing uncertainty in these values has produced dramatically variable predictions for Earth's history that challenge traditional geophysical theories. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature use laser-heated diamond-anvil cells to study the properties of iron at the extreme temperatures and pressures relevant to Earth's core, but using different methodologies, and they arrive at contrasting results. Kenji Ohta and co-authors measured the electrical resistivity of iron at up to 4,500 kelvin and obtained an estimate that is even lower than the low values predicted from recent ab initio studies. They conclude that this suggests a high thermal conductivity for Earth's core, which would imply rapid core cooling by conduction and a relatively young inner core. Zuzana Konôpková and co-authors measured heat pulses propagating through solid iron after heating with a laser pulse at pressures and temperatures relevant to the cores of planets ranging in size from Mercury to Earth. Their measurements place the thermal conductivity of Earth's core near the low end of previous estimates, implying that thermal convection in Earth's core could have driven the geodynamo for billions of years, and allowing for an ancient inner core. In a linked News & Views, David Dobson discusses the interpretation of these two tours de force of experimental geophysics. The conduction of heat through minerals and melts at extreme pressures and temperatures is of central importance to the evolution and dynamics of planets. In the cooling Earth’s core, the thermal conductivity of iron alloys defines the adiabatic heat flux and therefore the thermal and compositional energy available to support the production of Earth’s magnetic field via dynamo action1,2,3. Attempts to describe thermal transport in Earth’s core have been problematic, with predictions of high thermal conductivity4,5,6,7 at odds with traditional geophysical models and direct evidence for a primordial magnetic field in the rock record8,9,10. Measurements of core heat transport are needed to resolve this difference. Here we present direct measurements of the thermal conductivity of solid iron at pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the cores of Mercury-sized to Earth-sized planets, using a dynamically laser-heated diamond-anvil cell11,12. Our measurements place the thermal conductivity of Earth’s core near the low end of previous estimates, at 18–44 watts per metre per kelvin. The result is in agreement with palaeomagnetic measurements10 indicating that Earth’s geodynamo has persisted since the beginning of Earth’s history, and allows for a solid inner core as old as the dynamo."
https://openalex.org/W2397220502,"Myocardial infarction results in compromised myocardial function and heart failure owing to insufficient cardiomyocyte self-renewal. Unlike many vertebrates, mammalian hearts have only a transient neonatal renewal capacity. Reactivating primitive reparative ability in the mature mammalian heart requires knowledge of the mechanisms that promote early heart repair. By testing an established Hippo-deficient heart regeneration mouse model for factors that promote renewal, here we show that the expression of Pitx2 is induced in injured, Hippo-deficient ventricles. Pitx2-deficient neonatal mouse hearts failed to repair after apex resection, whereas adult mouse cardiomyocytes with Pitx2 gain-of-function efficiently regenerated after myocardial infarction. Genomic analyses indicated that Pitx2 activated genes encoding electron transport chain components and reactive oxygen species scavengers. A subset of Pitx2 target genes was cooperatively regulated with the Hippo pathway effector Yap. Furthermore, Nrf2, a regulator of the antioxidant response, directly regulated the expression and subcellular localization of Pitx2. Pitx2 mutant myocardium had increased levels of reactive oxygen species, while antioxidant supplementation suppressed the Pitx2 loss-of-function phenotype. These findings reveal a genetic pathway activated by tissue damage that is essential for cardiac repair."

https://openalex.org/W2413031428,"Wing colour patterning of multiple species in the butterfly genus Heliconius is controlled by differential expression of the gene cortex, a member of a conserved family of cell cycle regulators. The darkening of the peppered moth Biston betularia, the phenomenon known as industrial melanism, is a textbook example of evolutionary biology in action. However, the genetic background of the black or carbonaria variants has remained unclear. Building on their earlier work that isolated the gene responsible to within a roughly 400-kilobase region containing 13 genes, Ilik Saccheri and colleagues have identified the melanism-causing event as the insertion of a class II transposable element into the first intron of a gene called cortex. Statistical inference indicates that the polymorphism occurred around 1819, when the Industrial Revolution was well under way. In a separate study, Nicola Nadeau et al. report that colour patterning in butterflies of the genus Heliconius is also mediated by expression of the cortex gene, apparently co-opted to control the rate of scale cell development, on which colour depends. Taken together, these two papers suggest that cortex, conserved widely within Lepidoptera, is a major target for natural selection acting on colour and pattern variation. The wing patterns of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are diverse and striking examples of evolutionary diversification by natural selection1,2. Lepidopteran wing colour patterns are a key innovation, consisting of arrays of coloured scales. We still lack a general understanding of how these patterns are controlled and whether this control shows any commonality across the 160,000 moth and 17,000 butterfly species. Here, we use fine-scale mapping with population genomics and gene expression analyses to identify a gene, cortex, that regulates pattern switches in multiple species across the mimetic radiation in Heliconius butterflies. cortex belongs to a fast-evolving subfamily of the otherwise highly conserved fizzy family of cell-cycle regulators3, suggesting that it probably regulates pigmentation patterning by regulating scale cell development. In parallel with findings in the peppered moth (Biston betularia)4, our results suggest that this mechanism is common within Lepidoptera and that cortex has become a major target for natural selection acting on colour and pattern variation in this group of insects."
https://openalex.org/W2407366427,"Ribosome biogenesis is a highly complex process in eukaryotes, involving temporally and spatially regulated ribosomal protein (r-protein) binding and ribosomal RNA remodelling events in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Hundreds of assembly factors, organized into sequential functional groups, facilitate and guide the maturation process into productive assembly branches in and across different cellular compartments. However, the precise mechanisms by which these assembly factors function are largely unknown. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the structures of yeast nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles affinity-purified using the epitope-tagged assembly factor Nog2. Our data pinpoint the locations and determine the structures of over 20 assembly factors, which are enriched in two areas: an arc region extending from the central protuberance to the polypeptide tunnel exit, and the domain including the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) that separates 5.8S and 25S ribosomal RNAs. In particular, two regulatory GTPases, Nog2 and Nog1, act as hub proteins to interact with multiple, distant assembly factors and functional ribosomal RNA elements, manifesting their critical roles in structural remodelling checkpoints and nuclear export. Moreover, our snapshots of compositionally and structurally different pre-60S intermediates provide essential mechanistic details for three major remodelling events before nuclear export: rotation of the 5S ribonucleoprotein, construction of the active centre and ITS2 removal. The rich structural information in our structures provides a framework to dissect molecular roles of diverse assembly factors in eukaryotic ribosome assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2348844796,"The activation of lipid X receptors (LXRs) in mouse liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux but also inhibits cholesterol synthesis simultaneously; this is mediated by the lipid-responsive long non-coding RNA LeXis, which is induced by a Western diet and orchestrates crosstalk between LXRs and the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Liver X receptors (LXRs) and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that act as key regulators of cellular and systemic cholesterol homeostasis, controlling cholesterol efflux and cholesterol production, respectively. This study shows that the activation of LXRs in mouse liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux but also inhibits cholesterol synthesis. This activation is mediated by the lipid-responsive long non-coding RNA LeXis, which is induced by a Western diet and orchestrates crosstalk between LXRs and the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcriptional regulators of cellular and systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Under conditions of excess cholesterol, LXR activation induces the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux1, facilitates cholesterol esterification by promoting fatty acid synthesis2, and inhibits cholesterol uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor3. The fact that sterol content is maintained in a narrow range in most cell types and in the organism as a whole suggests that extensive crosstalk between regulatory pathways must exist. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate LXRs with other lipid metabolic pathways are incompletely understood. Here we show that ligand activation of LXRs in mouse liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux, but also simultaneously inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the long non-coding RNA LeXis as a mediator of this effect. Hepatic LeXis expression is robustly induced in response to a Western diet (high in fat and cholesterol) or to pharmacological LXR activation. Raising or lowering LeXis levels in the liver affects the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and alters the cholesterol levels in the liver and plasma. LeXis interacts with and affects the DNA interactions of RALY, a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein that acts as a transcriptional cofactor for cholesterol biosynthetic genes in the mouse liver. These findings outline a regulatory role for a non-coding RNA in lipid metabolism and advance our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate sterol homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2409823238,"The vast, deep, volatile-ice-filled basin informally named Sputnik Planum is central to Pluto's geological activity[1,2]. Composed of molecular nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices[3], but dominated by N2-ice, this ice layer is organized into cells or polygons, typically ~10-40 km across, that resemble the surface manifestation of solid state convection[1,2]. Here we report, based on available rheological measurements[4], that solid layers of N2 ice approximately greater than 1 km thick should convect for estimated present-day heat flow conditions on Pluto. More importantly, we show numerically that convective overturn in a several-km-thick layer of solid nitrogen can explain the great lateral width of the cells. The temperature dependence of N2-ice viscosity implies that the SP ice layer convects in the so-called sluggish lid regime[5], a unique convective mode heretofore not definitively observed in the Solar System. Average surface horizontal velocities of a few cm/yr imply surface transport or renewal times of ~500,000 years, well under the 10 Myr upper limit crater retention age for Sputnik Planum[2]. Similar convective surface renewal may also occur on other dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt, which may help explain the high albedos of some of them."
https://openalex.org/W2346584380,"Accretion of matter onto black holes is universally associated with strong radiative feedback and powerful outflows. In particular, black-hole transients have outflows whose properties are strongly coupled to those of the accretion flow. This includes X-ray winds of ionized material, expelled from the accretion disk encircling the black hole, and collimated radio jets. Very recently, a distinct optical variability pattern has been reported in the transient stellar-mass black hole V404 Cygni, and interpreted as disrupted mass flow into the inner regions of its large accretion disk. Here we report observations of a sustained outer accretion disk wind in V404 Cyg, which is unlike any seen hitherto. We find that the outflowing wind is neutral, has a large covering factor, expands at one per cent of the speed of light and triggers a nebular phase once accretion drops sharply and the ejecta become optically thin. The large expelled mass (>10(-8) solar masses) indicates that the outburst was prematurely ended when a sizeable fraction of the outer disk was depleted by the wind, detaching the inner regions from the rest of the disk. The luminous, but brief, accretion phases shown by transients with large accretion disks imply that this outflow is probably a fundamental ingredient in regulating mass accretion onto black holes."
https://openalex.org/W2416541804,"The light reactions of photosynthesis, which include light-harvesting and charge separation, take place in the amphiphilic environment of the thylakoid membrane. The light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) is the main responsible for light absorption in plants and green algae and is involved in photoprotective mechanisms that regulate the amount of excited states in the membrane. The dual function of LHCII has been extensively studied in detergent micelles, but recent results have indicated that the properties of this complex differ in a lipid environment. In this work we checked these suggestions by studying LHCII in liposomes. By combining bulk and single molecule measurements, we monitored the fluorescence characteristics of liposomes containing single complexes up to densely packed proteoliposomes. We show that the natural lipid environment per se does not alter the properties of LHCII, which for single complexes remain very similar to that in detergent. However, we show that LHCII has the strong tendency to cluster in the membrane and that protein interactions and the extent of crowding modulate the lifetimes of the excited state in the membrane.

Finally, the presence of LHCII monomers at low concentrations of complexes per liposome is discussed. Photosynthetic organisms evolved the capacity to harvest the energy of solar radiation and store it into chemical compounds. In vascular plants and green algae, sunlight is absorbed by a series of membrane proteins called light-harvesting complexes (LHC). 3The abbreviations used are: LHCIIlight harvesting complex IINPQnon-photochemical quenchingChl achlorophyll aChl bchlorophyll bTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineQylight absorption due to electronic transition along the y-axis of the chlorophyll molecule. The most abundant of these pigment-protein complexes is LHCII. The LHCs have a dual function; in low light conditions they absorb solar energy and efficiently transfer the excitation energy to the reaction center, and in high light they additionally play a role in photoprotection by dissipating the energy absorbed in excess as heat (1.Croce R. van Amerongen H. et al.Natural strategies for photosynthetic light harvesting.Nat.

Plant Biol. 2014; 65: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This last process called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) leads to a decrease of the excited state lifetime of chlorophyll a (Chl a), limiting the possibility of Chl triplet formation and thus the production of singlet oxygen (3.Roach T. Krieger-Liszkay A. et al.Regulation of photosynthetic electron transport and photoinhibition.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2014; 15: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The fast, on the timescale of seconds, and fully reversible part of NPQ is called qE. This mechanism is triggered by the acidification of the lumenal space of the thylakoids, which activates PsbS (4.Li X.P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S.

Although the precise molecular mechanism of quenching has not been fully elucidated yet, a prominent idea discussed in literature is that NPQ is regulated via conformational changes of LHCII. Those changes could be correlated to, or even caused by, LHCII aggregation (8.Jahns P. Depka B.

The study of NPQ in vivo is complicated by the presence of many parallel processes that make it difficult to extract its molecular details. A large part of the studies on NPQ has then been performed in vitro on isolated complexes in detergent micelles. However, these preparations represent an over-simplified system in a non-native environment. To overcome these problems, several approaches have been put forward: (i) reducing the number of components involved in NPQ in the thylakoid membrane by using mutants lacking photosystems I and II core complexes or blocking the chloroplast translation that leads to membranes enriched in LHCII (15.Tian L.

Liposomes containing zeaxanthin and PsbS, which are two essential factors in NPQ, in addition to LHCII were described (24.Wilk L. Grunwald M. Liao P.-N. Walla P.J. Kühlbrandt W. et al.Direct interaction of the major light-harvesting complex II and PsbS in nonphotochemical quenching.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Res. 2016; 127: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), opening way to study the molecular mechanism of NPQ in vitro. However, to be able to disentangle the effect of lateral aggregation, conformational switches, and protein-lipid interactions, all of which have been suggested to play a role in NPQ, it is essential to know how the lipid environment influences the properties of the complex and to have full control of their organization in the proteoliposome. In this work we investigated in detail the relation between protein crowding and the fluorescence decay, which is the reporter for the quenched state of the complexes, by generating a series of proteoliposomes with different lipid/Chl ratios. Using a combination of ensemble and single molecule spectroscopy measurements we show that the different properties observed in LHCII in the membrane, as compared with detergent micelles, are not due to a different conformation of single complexes caused by the lipid environment but due to the clustering of LHCII. The latter most likely leads to conformational changes due to protein-protein interactions. The similarity with the results in cells suggests that this is what happens in vivo. To mimic the thylakoid membrane of C. reinhardtii, we generated liposome vesicles composed of an identical mix of lipids: monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (41.2%), digalactosyl diacylglycerol (26.7%), sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (15.6%), and the phospholipids (11.5%) and phosphatidylcholine (5%) (26.Vieler A.

Antenna complexes (LHCII) isolated from the membranes (Fig. 1) or reconstituted in vitro with pigments (Fig. 2) were incorporated into liposome vesicles by the removal of detergent via dialysis. The initial preparation consists of a lipid/protein molar ratio of ∼230:1. The resulting proteoliposomes show absorption maxima at 672 nm and 436 nm with shoulders at 651 nm and 473 nm. The absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 1A where it is compared with that of detergent-isolated LHCII trimers. In general, no large differences were observed between the spectra, indicating that the incorporation into liposomes does not lead to loss of pigments. These features are in agreement with previously published works on LHCII incorporated into liposomes (21.Yang C. Boggasch S. Haase W.

This indicates that the excitation energy is efficiently transferred from Chl b and carotenoids to Chl a, which confirms the correct folding of the complexes. The high efficiency of excitation energy transfer is further supported by the fluorescence excitation spectrum (Fig. 1C). The CD spectrum depicted in Fig. 1D confirms that LHCII in liposomes and detergent have the same pigment organization. The spectrum clearly shows the typical −+− signal in the Qy absorption region and the negative CD feature in the blue region associated with Chl-Chl and Chl-carotenoid interactions (28.Georgakopoulou S. van der Zwan G. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H.

It is known that in vitro aggregation of LHCII is accompanied by a decrease of the fluorescence quantum yield (9.Horton P. Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Noctor G.

Acta. 2003; 1606: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, which is induced in vitro by the removal of detergent, may also occur during or after the incorporation of the complexes into liposomes, complicating the interpretation of the results. We note that the topology of aggregation might be different in solution and in the plane of a lipid bilayer, where mainly lateral aggregates are expected. However, the topology of insertion of the complexes in the liposomes is undetermined, and we cannot exclude the presence of interactions between complexes with opposite orientation. The formation of lateral aggregates in liposomes (at a lipid/protein molar ratio of ∼230:1) is confirmed by the fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K (Fig. 3A), which shows a peak at 696 nm typical of aggregated antennas (29.Ruban A.V. Calkoen F. Kwa S.L.S. Van Grondelle R. Horton P. Dekker J.P. et al.Characterisation of LHC II in the aggregated state by linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 61-70Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Aggregation, quantified by the relative intensity of the 696 nm band, decreased by reducing the amount of LHCII per liposome (Fig. 3B). By recording the fluorescence decay kinetics of LHCII at different levels of aggregation, we could also confirm the tight relation between lateral aggregation and fluorescence quenching. Fig. 3B clearly illustrates that the peak at 696 nm increased with the increase of the amount of chlorophyll per liposome. At the same time, the fluorescence lifetime decreased down to a minimum of 0.97 ns (Table 1). On the other hand, the lifetime of the sample in liposomes with a high lipid/protein molar ratio of ∼7000:1 (0.1 μg of Chl a) had a similar value compared with isolated monomeric LHCII in detergent (Table 1) (30.Drop B. Webber-Birungi M. Yadav S.K. Filipowicz-Szymanska A. Fusetti F. Boekema E.J.

Croce R. et al.Characterization of the major light-harvesting complexes (LHCBM) of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0119211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A further decrease in the amount of protein per liposome (0.05 μg of Chl a equal to a lipid/protein molar ratio of ∼14,000:1) induced the appearance of free Chls in the sample. This is indicated by the presence of a shoulder at 650 nm in the fluorescence emission spectrum upon selective Chl b excitation (Fig. 3B) and by a long lifetime component above 4 ns in the time-resolved data, typical of free chlorophylls (Table 1).TABLE 1Excited-state lifetimes of proteoliposomes with different amounts of LHCIILHCII (μg Chl a)τaveA1τ1A2τ2A3τ3ns%ns%ns%ns70.97350.41571.1482.2231.84230.56561.89213.122.51.36350.53561.5983.2612.12260.72622.34114.210.13.34111.06703.21195.200.053.4990.92753.37165.52 Open table in a new tab The structure and size of liposomes were investigated by EM. In Fig. 4 EM images of proteoliposomes containing LHCII (Fig. 4A) and recombinant LHCBM1 (Fig. 4B) showed a homogeneous morphology and size distribution. The average diameter of the proteoliposomes was ∼50 nm, and no indication of multi-lamellar structures was observed. To acquire more quantitative information on the composition of proteoliposomes and hence on the level of protein aggregation, we performed single molecule confocal fluorescence experiments and analyzed the fluorescence intensity, the fluorescence spectrum, and the fluorescence lifetime of single immobilized proteoliposomes. The information about the absolute fluorescence intensity together with the average fluorescence lifetime allowed us to approximate the absorption cross-section σ of the fluorescence particle within the confocal excitation (see “Experimental Procedures”). This effectively provides the size of the cluster via the number of absorbing pigments. By dividing the absorption cross-section of a single fluorescent particle (i.e. a single proteoliposome) by the absorption cross-section of a LHCII trimer at 633 nm (σLHCII = 1.4 × 10−15 cm2) we can estimate the number of incorporated LHCIIs. Fig. 5A shows the resulting distribution of proteoliposomes with a low and high protein concentration and a control experiment on LHCII trimers in detergent. To make sure that we were measuring LHCII in liposomes and not random aggregates in solution, we performed a control experiment without lipids at detergent concentrations below the CMC, which leads to protein aggregation in solution. This experiment yielded different results than LHC complexes within liposomes (data not shown). In particular, large protein aggregates were formed in solution as indicated by a significantly increased fluorescence intensity compared with proteoliposomes at an identical protein-liposome ratio. In agreement with this, the density of detected fluorescent particles per imaging area decreased for aggregates in solution. These results indicate that it is possible to discriminate between lateral aggregation of LHCII in liposomes and random aggregates in solution and that all the experiments reported below were conducted on LHCII in liposomes. The high concentrated sample contains dozens of LHCII trimers with a peak at ∼30 trimers. The dotted black line in Fig. 5A indicates the hypothetical situation in which the complete surface of a liposome with a 50-nm diameter is fully covered with LHCII. This implies that LHCII complexes constitute a significant fraction of the surface area of a single proteoliposome and explains the aggregation features observed in bulk measurements. The fluorescence intensity of those large aggregates shows a gradual decrease over time most likely caused by bleaching and light-induced formation of energy traps that can influence a large number of connected complexes. Proteoliposomes with the lowest protein concentration of ∼7000:1 lipid/protein molar ratio instead show clear reversible intensity steps, often referred to as “blinking,” characteristic for individual light-harvesting complexes. Fig. 5B illustrates some typical examples of such fluorescence time traces for the highest (black line) and lowest protein concentration (light- and dark blue line). It should be noted that at very low concentrations the number of LHC complexes per liposome varies from one to three, but in all cases the LHCII blink individually. The corresponding fluorescence lifetimes are plotted in Fig. 5C. The decrease in lifetime for a larger number of incorporated LHC complexes matches the trend seen in ensemble measurements. Fig. 5D shows a distribution of the measured fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime for proteoliposomes at the indicated protein density. The slope of such a distribution depends among other parameters on the absorption cross-section and, therefore, also indicates the size distribution of the measured particles. A decreasing slope corresponds to a larger absorption cross-section as indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 5D. The lifetimes of proteoliposomes with 7 μg of Chl a (lipid/protein molar ratio of 100:1) are shorter (∼450 ps) than measured in the ensemble due to the much higher excitation intensity, which can generate light-induced traps. The lifetime of single complexes instead matches very well with the dominating 3-ns lifetime component found in bulk. The long lifetime shown for the light blue example in Fig. 5B demonstrates that individual complexes are either poorly connected or more likely floating in the bilayer completely isolated from each other. Blinking events, partial quenching, and bleaching of individual complexes instead results in an additional shorter lifetime component, but the long lifetime component of other isolated complexes is not affected. A surprising outcome was the low absolute fluorescence intensity of single complexes (at 0.1 μg of Chl a) that is only ∼35% that of the expected value for LHCII trimers. It actually better matches the fluorescence intensity of monomeric LHC complexes than that of the trimer. The absorption cross-section distribution for that sample in Fig. 5A also clearly shows a peak at less than half a trimeric complex. Interestingly, most of the proteoliposomes with 0.1 μg of Chl a (∼7000:1 lipid/protein molar ratio) show a fluorescence intensity equivalent to ∼1:3 monomeric complexes. To further clarify this monomerization effect, we measured proteoliposomes that were loaded directly with monomeric LHCBM1 (∼7000:1 lipid/protein molar ratio), and here we indeed found a matching fluorescence intensity between isolated monomeric complexes in detergent and single complexes in liposomes (see Fig. 6A). Finally, we confirmed the monomeric state of incorporated LHC complexes using LHCII from plants, the CD spectrum of which differs for monomers and trimers (28.Georgakopoulou S. van der Zwan G. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Croce R. et al.Understanding the changes in the circular dichroism of light harvesting complex II upon varying its pigment composition and organization.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4745-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); LHCII trimers of tobacco inserted into liposomes show a CD spectrum typical for the monomeric state (Fig. 6B) (28.Georgakopoulou S. van der Zwan G. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Croce R. et al.Understanding the changes in the circular dichroism of light harvesting complex II upon varying its pigment composition and organization.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4745-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A remaining question concerns the presence of free pigments in proteoliposomes. To that end, we recorded multiple fluorescence spectra (1-s integration time) of single proteoliposomes, which allows us to follow the spectral evolution over 30 s. The majority of measured proteoliposomes (LHCII; 7000:1 lipid/protein molar ratio) indeed exhibits a small blue shoulder below 680 nm as illustrated in Fig. 7. The amplitude of that shoulder varies between different particles but always decreases exponentially in time, and only the main emission peak at 681 nm remains. Control experiments on liposomes that contained only free Chl (not shown) displayed the same exponential bleaching feature and had a fluorescence peak emission of 678 nm, matching th"

https://openalex.org/W2416636197,"Introduction Currently available clinical assays to detect antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) test for IgG and IgM antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL) and β2-glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI). It has been suggested that testing for IgA aPL and for antibodies to Domain I (DI), which carries the key antigenic epitopes of β2GPI, could add value to these current tests. We performed an observational, multicenter cohort study to evaluate the utility of IgG, IgM and IgA assays to each of CL, β2GPI and DI in APS. Methods Serum from 230 patients with APS (n = 111), SLE but not APS (n = 119), and 200 healthy controls were tested for IgG, IgM and IgA aCL, aβ2GPI and aDI activity. Patients with APS were further classified into thrombotic or obstetric APS. Logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic analyses were employed to compare results from the nine different assays. Results All assays displayed good specificity for APS; IgG aCL and IgG aβ2GPI assays however, had the highest sensitivity. Testing positive for IgA aβ2GPI resulted in a higher hazard ratio for APS compared to IgM aβ2GPI. Positive IgG, IgM or IgA aDI were all associated with APS, and in subjects positive for aCL and/or aβ2GPI, the presence of aDI raised the hazard ratio for APS by 3–5 fold. IgG aCL, aβ2GPI, aDI and IgA aDI were associated with thrombotic but not obstetric complications in patients with APS. Conclusion Measuring IgG aDI and IgA aβ2GPI and aDI may be useful in the management of patients with APS, particularly thrombotic APS."

Lambs fed L-A diet showed lower average daily gain and greater slaughter age compared to Control and L (P < 0.001). Carcass traits were not affected by L and L-A diets, but a trend towards greater adipocyte diameter was observed in L and L-A in the subcutaneous AT (P = 0.057). Adding either linseed or linseed and algae increased α-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid contents in both AT (P < 0.001); however, docosahexaenoic acid was increased by L-A (P < 0.001). The n-6/n-3 ratio decreased in L and L-A (P < 0.001). Algae had adverse effects on meat quality, with greater lipid oxidation and reduced ratings for odor and flavor. The expression of lipogenic genes was downregulated in the subcutaneous AT (P < 0.05): acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA) in L and L-A and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in L-A. Fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) and fatty acid elongase 5 (ELOVL5) were unaffected. In the subcutaneous AT, supplementing either L or L-A increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and CAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) (P < 0.05), although it had no effect on sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 (SREBF1). In the intramuscular AT, expression of ACACA, SCD, FADS1 and FADS2 decreased in L and L-A (P < 0.001) and LPL in L (P < 0.01), but PPARG, CEBPA and SREBF1 were unaffected."

To evaluate the possibility of using HRV to screen for OSAHS, we investigated the relationship between HRV and polysomnography (PSG) diagnostic indices using electrocardiography (ECG) and PSG data from 25 patients with OSAHS and 27 healthy participants. We evaluated the relationship between various PSG diagnostic indices (including the apnea hypopnea index [AHI], micro-arousal index [MI], oxygen desaturation index [ODI]) and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters using Spearman’s correlation analysis. Moreover, we used multiple linear regression analyses to construct linear models for the AHI, MI, and ODI. In our analysis, the AHI was significantly associated with relative powers of very low frequency (VLF [%]) (r = 0.641, P = 0.001), relative powers of high frequency (HF [%]) (r = -0.586, P = 0.002), ratio between low frequency and high frequency powers (LF/HF) (r = 0.545, P = 0.049), normalized powers of low frequency (LF [n.u.]) (r = 0.506, P = 0.004), and normalized powers of high frequency (HF [n.u.]) (r = -0.506, P = 0.010) among patients with OSAHS. The MI was significantly related to standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) (r = 0.550, P = 0.031), VLF [%] (r = 0.626, P = 0.001), HF [%] (r = -0.632, P = 0.001), LF/HF (r = 0.591, P = 0.011), LF [n.u.] (r = 0.553, P = 0.004), HF [n.u.] (r = -0.553, P = 0.004), and absolute powers of very low frequency (VLF [abs]) (r = 0.525, P = 0.007) among patients with OSAHS. The ODI was significantly correlated with VLF [%] (r = 0.617, P = 0.001), HF [%] (r = -0.574, P = 0.003), LF [n.u.] (r = 0.510, P = 0.012), and HF [n.u.] (r = -0.510, P = 0.012) among patients with OSAHS. The linear models for the PSG diagnostic indices were AHI = -38.357+1.318VLF [%], MI = -13.389+11.297LF/HF+0.266SDNN, and ODI = -55.588+1.715VLF [%].

We sought to identify personal characteristics associated with reported quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors, and sub-groups of survivors potentially vulnerable to very low quality of life. Methods We assessed quality of life using the Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey within a population-based sample of 1,021 colorectal cancer survivors in the Seattle Colorectal Cancer Family Registry, approximately 5 years post-diagnosis. In this case-only study, mean physical component summary scores and mental component summary scores were examined with linear regression. To identify survivors with substantially reduced ability to complete daily tasks, logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for “very low” summary scores, defined as a score in the lowest decile of the reference US population. All cases were followed for vital status following QoL assessment, and mortality was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Lower mean physical component summary score was associated with older age, female sex, obesity, smoking, and diabetes or other co-morbidity; lower mean mental component summary score was associated with younger age and female sex. Higher odds of very low physical component summary score was associated with older age, obesity, less education, smoking, co-morbidities, and later stage at diagnosis; smoking was associated with higher odds of very low mental component summary score. A very low physical component score was associated with higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 3.97 (2.95–5.34)). Conclusions Our results suggest that identifiable sub-groups of survivors are vulnerable to very low physical components of quality of life, decrements that may represent meaningful impairment in completing everyday tasks and are associated with higher risk of death."

Compared to other satellite sensors, the spatial, temporal and spectral specifications of MODIS are considered as highly suitable for LULC classifications which support many different aspects of social, environmental and developmental research. The LULC mapping of this study was carried out in the context of the development of an evaluation approach for Zimbabwe's land reform program. Within the discourse about the success of this program, a lack of spatially explicit methods to produce objective data, such as on the extent of agricultural area, is apparent. We therefore assessed the suitability of moderate spatial and high temporal resolution imagery and phenological parameters to retrieve regional figures about the extent of cropland area in former freehold tenure in a series of 13 years from 2001-2013. Time-series data was processed with TIMESAT and was stratified according to agro-ecological potential zoning of Zimbabwe. Random Forest (RF) classifications were used to produce annual binary crop/non crop maps which were evaluated with high spatial resolution data from other satellite sensors. We assessed the cropland products in former freehold tenure in terms of classification accuracy, inter-annual comparability and heterogeneity. Although general LULC patterns were depicted in classification results and an overall accuracy of over 80% was achieved, user accuracies for rainfed agriculture were limited to below 65%. We conclude that phenological analysis has to be treated with caution when rainfed agriculture and grassland in semi-humid tropical regions have to be separated based on MODIS spectral data and phenological parameters. Because classification results significantly underestimate redistributed commercial farmland in Zimbabwe, we argue that the method cannot be used to produce spatial information on land-use which could be linked to tenure change. Hence capabilities of moderate resolution data are limited to assess Zimbabwe's land reform. To make use of the unquestionable potential of MODIS time-series analysis, we propose an analysis of plant productivity which allows to link annual growth and production of vegetation to ownership after Zimbabwe's land reform."

However, little information is available regarding molecular response of these plants to the frost stress. Using high throughput sequencing, this study was conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs, both the conserved and the non-conserved ones, in the reproductive tissues of almond tolerant H genotype under cold stress. Analysis of 50 to 58 million raw reads led to identification of 174 unique conserved and 59 novel microRNAs (miRNAs). Differential expression pattern analysis showed that 50 miRNA families were expressed differentially in one or both of almond reproductive tissues (anther and ovary). Out of these 50 miRNA families, 12 and 15 displayed up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively. The distribution of conserved miRNA families indicated that miR482f harbor the highest number of members. Confirmation of miRNAs expression patterns by quantitative real- time PCR (qPCR) was performed in cold tolerant (H genotype) alongside a sensitive variety (Sh12 genotype). Our analysis revealed differential expression for 9 miRNAs in anther and 3 miRNAs in ovary between these two varieties. Target prediction of miRNAs followed by differential expression analysis resulted in identification of 83 target genes, mostly transcription factors. This study comprehensively catalogued expressed miRNAs under different temperatures in two reproductive tissues (anther and ovary). Results of current study and the previous RNA-seq study, which was conducted in the same tissues by our group, provide a unique opportunity to understand the molecular basis of responses of almond to cold stress. The results can also enhance the possibility for gene manipulation to develop cold tolerant plants."

The aim of this study was to examine whether combining Xe and TH is neuroprotective as applied in a P7 rat model of severe HI. Design/Methods 120 P7 rat pups underwent a severe HI insult; unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (8% O2 for 150min at experimental normothermia (NT-37: Trectal 37°C). Surviving pups were randomised to immediate NT-37 for 5h (n = 36), immediate TH-32: Trectal 32°C for 5h (n = 25) or immediate TH-32 plus 50% inhaled Xe for 5h (n = 24). Pups were sacrificed after one week of survival. Relative area loss of the ligated hemisphere was measured, and neurons in the subventricular zone of this injured hemisphere were counted, to quantify brain damage. Results Following the HI insult, median (interquartile range, IQR) hemispheric brain area loss was similar in all groups: 63.5% (55.5–75.0) for NT-37 group, 65.0% (57.0–65.0) for TH-32 group, and 66.5% (59.0–72.0) for TH-32+Xe50% group (not significant). Correspondingly, there was no difference in neuronal cell count (NeuN marker) in the subventricular zone across the three treatment groups. Conclusions Immediate therapeutic hypothermia with or without additional 50% inhaled Xe, does not provide neuroprotection one week after severe HI brain injury in the P7 neonatal rat. This model aims to mimic the clinical situation in severely asphyxiated neonates and treatment these newborns remains an ongoing challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2432998471,"Background Medication reviews are recognized services to increase quality of therapy and reduce medication risks. The selection of eligible patients with potential to receive a major benefit is based on assumptions rather than on factual data. Acceptance of interprofessional collaboration is crucial to increase the quality of medication therapy. Objective The research question was to identify and prioritize eligible patients for a medication review and to provide evidence-based criteria for patient selection. Acceptance of the prescribing general practitioner to implement pharmaceutical recommendations was measured and factors influencing physicians’ acceptance were explored to obtain an impression on the extent of collaboration in medication review in an ambulatory care setting. Methods Based on data of a cluster-randomized controlled study (WestGem-study), the correlation between patient parameters and the individual performance in a medication review was calculated in a multiple logistic regression model. Physician’s acceptance of the suggested intervention was assessed using feedback forms. Influential factors were analyzed. Results The number of drugs in use (p = 0.001), discrepancies between prescribed and used medicines (p = 0.014), the baseline Medication Appropriateness Index score (p<0.001) and the duration of the intervention (p = 0.006) could be identified as influential factors for a major benefit from a medication review, whereas morbidity (p>0.05) and a low kidney function (p>0.05) do not predetermine the outcome. Longitudinal patient care with repeated reviews showed higher interprofessional acceptance and superior patient benefit. A total of 54.9% of the recommendations in a medication review on drug therapy were accepted for implementation. Conclusions The number of drugs in use and medication reconciliation could be a first rational step in patient selection for a medication review. Most elderly, multimorbid patients with polymedication experience a similar chance of receiving a benefit from a medication review. Longitudinal patient care should be preferred over confined medication reviews. The acceptance of medication reviews by physicians supports further implementation into health care systems.

HBV enters hepatocytes by binding to sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), the genome of which contains 2 active farnesoid X receptor (FXR) a response elements that participate in HBV transcriptional activity. We investigated in differentiated HepaRG cells and in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) effects of FXR activation on HBV replication and of infection on the FXR pathway. In HepaRG cells, FXR agonists (6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid and GW4064), but no antagonist, and an FXR-unrelated bile salt inhibited viral mRNA, DNA, and protein production (IC50, 0.1–0.5 mM) and reduced covalently closed circular DNA pool size. These effects were independent of the NTCP inhibitor cyclosporine-A, which suggests inhibition occurred at a postentry step. Similar results were obtained in PHHs with GW4064. Infection of these cells increased expression of FXR and modified expression of FXR-regulated genes SHP, APOA1, NTCP, CYP7A1, and CYP8B1 with a more pronounced effect in PHHs than in HepaRG cells. FXR agonists reversed all but one of the HBV-induced FXR gene profile modifications. HBV replication and FXR regulation seem to be interdependent, and altered bile salt metabolism homeostasis might contribute to the persistence of HBV infection.—Radreau, P., Porcherot, M., Rami`ere, C., Mouzannar, K., Lotteau, V., André, P.

However, whether long noncoding RNAs also participate in the regulation of insulin sensitivity is still largely unknown. We identified and characterized a long noncoding RNA, regulator of insulin sensitivity and autophagy (Risa), which is a poly(A)+ cytoplasmic RNA. Overexpression of Risa in mouse primary hepatocytes or C2C12 myotubes attenuated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor, Akt, and Gsk3β, and knockdown of Risa alleviated insulin resistance. Further studies showed that overexpression of Risa in hepatocytes or myotubes decreased autophagy, and knockdown of Risa up-regulated autophagy. Moreover, knockdown of Atg7 or −5 significantly inhibited the effect of knockdown of Risa on insulin resistance, suggesting that knockdown of Risa alleviated insulin resistance via enhancing autophagy. In addition, tail vein injection of adenovirus to knock down Risa enhanced insulin sensitivity and hepatic autophagy in both C57BL/6 and ob/ob mice. Taken together, the data demonstrate that Risa regulates insulin sensitivity by affecting autophagy and suggest that Risa is a potential target for treating insulin-resistance–related diseases.—Wang, Y., Hu, Y., Sun, C., Zhuo, S., He, Z., Wang, H., Yan, M., Liu, J., Luan, Y., Dai, C., Yang, Y., Huang, R., Zhou, B., Zhang, F., Zhai, Q.

Alginate lyase (AlgL) might therefore facilitate treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected cystic fibrosis patients. However, the catalytic activity of wild-type AlgL is not sufficiently high. Therefore, molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of AlgL might assist in enzyme engineering for therapeutic development. AlgL, isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii, catalyzes depolymerization of alginate via a β-elimination reaction. AlgL was modeled based on the crystal structure template of Sphingomonas AlgL species A1-III. Based on this computational analysis, AlgL was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to improve its catalytic activity. The kcat/Km of the K194E mutant showed a nearly 5-fold increase against the acetylated alginate substrate, as compared to the wild-type. Double and triple mutants (K194E/K245D, K245D/K319A, K194E/K245D/E312D, and K194E/K245D/K319A) were also prepared. The most potent mutant was observed to be K194E/K245D/K319A, which has a 10-fold improved kcat value (against acetylated alginate) compared to the wild-type enzyme. The antibiofilm effect of both AlgL forms was identified in combination with piperacillin/tazobactam (PT) and the disruption effect was significantly higher in mutant AlgL combined with PT than wild-type AlgL. However, for both the wild-type and K194E/K245D/K319A mutant, the use of the AlgL enzyme alone did not show significant antibiofilm effect."

https://openalex.org/W2410221640,"The lectin (LP) and classical (CP) pathways are two of the three main activation cascades of the complement system. These pathways start with recognition of different pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns and include identical steps of proteolytic activation of complement component C4, formation of the C3 proconvertase C4b2, followed by cleavage of complement component C2 within C4b2 resulting in the C3 convertase C4b2a. Here, we describe the solution structures of the two central complexes of the pathways, C3 proconvertase and C3 convertase, as well as the unbound zymogen C2 obtained by small angle x-ray scattering analysis. We analyzed both native and enzymatically deglycosylated C4b2 and C2 and showed that the resulting structural models were independent of the glycans. The small angle x-ray scattering-derived models suggest a different activation mode for the CP/LP C3 proconvertase as compared with that established for the alternative pathway proconvertase C3bB. This is likely due to the rather different structural and functional properties of the proteases activating the proconvertases. The solution structure of a stabilized form of the active CP/LP C3 convertase C4b2a is strikingly similar to the crystal structure of the alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb, which is in accordance with their identical functions in cleaving the complement proteins C3 and C5."

Serine 8 is shown to be located in a region of high conformational flexibility in monomeric Aβ, which upon phosphorylation undergoes changes in local conformational dynamics. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR and fluorescence quenching techniques, we demonstrate that Aβ phosphorylation at serine 8 causes structural changes in the N-terminal region of Aβ aggregates in favor of less compact conformations. Structural changes induced by serine 8 phosphorylation can provide a mechanistic link between phosphorylation and other biological events that involve the N-terminal region of Aβ aggregates.

Its prognosis is dismal and there is still no accepted standard of care. We report here a good clinical effect with a partial response in three out of nine patients and a stable disease with improvement on symptoms in two more patients following systemic anti-angiogenic treatment with bevacizumab (BEV) alone or in combination with chemo- and/or radiotherapy in a series of patients with leptomeningeal dissemination from primary brain tumors (diffuse astrocytoma WHO°II, anaplastic astrocytoma WHO°III, anaplastic oligodendroglioma WHO°III, primitive neuroectodermal tumor and glioblastoma, both WHO°IV). This translated into effective symptom control in five out of nine patients, but only moderate progression-free and overall survival times were reached. Partial responses as assessed by RANO criteria were observed in three patients (each one with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor and glioblastoma). In these patients progression-free survival (PFS) intervals of 17, 10 and 20 weeks were achieved. In three patients (each one with diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor) stable disease was observed with PFS of 13, 30 and 8 weeks. Another three patients (all with glioblastoma) were primary non-responders and deteriorated rapidly with PFS of 3 to 4 weeks. No severe adverse events were seen.

A recent study using a conditional knock-out mouse model identified 58 putative PAX8 target genes. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of 11 of these genes in normal and tumoral thyroid tissues from patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). ATP1B1, GPC3, KCNIP3, and PRLR transcript levels in tumor tissues were significantly lower in PTCs than in NT, whereas LCN2, LGALS1 and SCD1 expression was upregulated in PTC compared with NT. Principal component analysis of the expression of the most markedly dysregulated PAX8 target genes was able to discriminate between PTC and NT. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess levels of proteins encoded by the two most dyregulated PAX8 target genes, LCN2 and GPC3. Interestingly, GPC3 was detectable in all of the NT samples but none of the PTC samples. Collectively, these findings point to significant PTC-associated dysregulation of several PAX8 target genes, supporting the notion that PAX8-regulated molecular cascades play important roles during thyroid tumorigenesis."

Native speakers of French with varying levels of self-reported English ability were asked to identify emotions from vocal expressions produced by American actors in a forced-choice task, and to rate their pleasantness, power, alertness and intensity on continuous scales. Stimuli included emotionally expressive English speech (emotional prosody) and non-linguistic vocalizations (affect bursts), and a baseline condition with Swiss-French pseudo-speech. Results revealed effects of English ability on the recognition of emotions in English speech but not in non-linguistic vocalizations. Specifically, higher English ability was associated with less accurate identification of positive emotions, but not with the interpretation of negative emotions. Moreover, higher English ability was associated with lower ratings of pleasantness and power, again only for emotional prosody. This suggests that second language skills may sometimes interfere with emotion recognition from speech prosody, particularly for positive emotions."

However, the involvement of histone deacetylases (HDACs) on alcohol-induced oxidative stress of human primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) has not been elucidated. In the current study, we took a novel approach combining ex vivo, in vitro and in silico analyses to elucidate the mechanisms of alcohol-induced oxidative stress and role of HDACs in the periphery. ex vivo and in vitro analyses of alcohol-modulation of class I HDACs and activity by MDDCs from self-reported alcohol users and non-alcohol users was performed. Additionally, MDDCs treated with alcohol were assessed using qRT-PCR, western blot, and fluorometric assay. The functional effects of alcohol-induce oxidative stress were measured in vitro using PCR array and in silico using gene expression network analysis. Our findings show, for the first time, that MDDCs from self-reported alcohol users have higher levels of class I HDACs compare to controls and alcohol treatment in vitro differentially modulates HDACs expression. Further, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) blocked alcohol-induction of class I HDACs and modulated alcohol-induced oxidative stress related genes expressed by MDDCs. In silico analysis revealed new target genes and pathways on the mode of action of alcohol and HDACi. Findings elucidating the ability of alcohol to modulate class I HDACs may be useful for the treatment of alcohol-induced oxidative damage and may delineate new potential immune-modulatory mechanisms."

Data on 164 Preparing for Life participants who were randomly assigned into an intervention group, involving home visits from pregnancy onwards, or a control group, was used to test the impact of the intervention on Child Behavior Checklist scores at 24-months. Using inverse probability weighting to account for differential attrition, permutation testing to address small sample size, and quantile regression to characterize the distributional impact of the intervention, we found that the few treatment effects were largely concentrated among boys most at risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. The average treatment effect identified a 13% reduction in the likelihood of falling into the borderline clinical threshold for Total Problems. The interaction and subgroup analysis found that this main effect was driven by boys. The distributional analysis identified a 10-point reduction in the Externalizing Problems score for boys at the 90th percentile. No effects were observed for girls or for the continuous measures of Total, Internalizing, and Externalizing problems. These findings suggest that the impact of this prenatally commencing home visiting program may be limited to boys experiencing the most difficulties. Further adoption of the statistical methods applied here may help to improve the internal validity of randomized controlled trials and contribute to the field of evaluation science more generally.

https://openalex.org/W2416995998,"Although human walking gait rhythms are generated by native individual gait dynamics, these gait dynamics change during interactions between humans. A typical phenomenon is synchronization of gait rhythms during cooperative walking. Our previous research revealed that fluctuation characteristics in stride interval of subjects with Parkinson's disease changed from random to 1/f fluctuation as fractal characteristics during cooperative walking with the gait assist system Walk-Mate, which emulates a human interaction using interactive rhythmic cues. Moreover, gait dynamics were relearned through Walk-Mate gait training. However, the system's clinical efficacy was unclear because the previous studies did not focus on specific gait rhythm disorder symptoms. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of Walk-Mate on festinating gait among subjects with Parkinson's disease. Three within-subject experimental conditions were used: (1) preinteraction condition, (2) interaction condition, and (3) postinteraction condition. The only difference between conditions was the interactive rhythmic cues generated by Walk-Mate. Because subjects with festinating gait gradually and involuntarily decreased their stride interval, the regression slope of stride interval as an index of severity of preinteraction festinating gait was elevated. The regression slope in the interaction condition was more gradual than during the preinteraction condition, indicating that the interactive rhythmic cues contributed to relieving festinating gait and stabilizing gait dynamics. Moreover, the gradual regression slope was carried over to the postinteraction condition, indicating that subjects with festinating gait have the potential to relearn stable gait dynamics. These results suggest that disordered gait dynamics are clinically restored through interactive rhythmic cues and that Walk-Mate may have the potential to assist therapists in more effective rehabilitation.UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000012591."

https://openalex.org/W2417464042,"COMMENT OBITUARY Walter Kohn the properties of a system, including the distribution of electron density. The density functional theory swapped the cause and effect roles between the energy landscape and the electron-density distribution. This paved a way to compute the properties of functional importance to technologies and to life, such as electronics and photosynthesis. Around 1960, Kohn started to examine the change that occurs to the spatial dis- tribution of the electron density when an impurity is added to a metal. For a posi- tively charged impurity, the electrons pile up around it as expected. They also exhibit a wave-like distribution (Friedel oscilla- tions), which reflects a quantum property of the electrons. This quantum feature led Kohn to examine the possibility that the electron density contained the key to other properties. In 1964, while on sabbatical in Paris, he established with Pierre Hohenberg, a postdoc at the Ecole Normale Superieure, the Hohenberg–Kohn density theorem. This stated that the electron-density distribution (not the energy landscape) determines the properties of a many-electron system. Returning to San Diego, Kohn prompted a postdoc, David Mermin, to generalize the theorem so that it could be applied to all temperatures. In 1965, he established with another postdoc (me) a way to use density functional theory to compute the properties of materials. 3 8 | NAT U R E | VO L 5 3 4 | 2 J U N E 2 0 1 6 Kohn’s PhD student at San Diego, Philip Tong, was the first to apply density functional theory to infer the electron energies of atoms of noble gases and of the sodium lattice. With his postdoc, Norton Lang, Kohn applied the theory to calculate properties of metal sur- faces in the early 1970s. Kohn and Lang won the Davisson–Germer prize in 1977 for their contribution to surface physics. For his work on density functional theory, Kohn shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. For several years after the Hohenberg– Kohn theorem was published, theoretical chemists raised objections — almost unani- mously — to the central role of the electron- density distribution. They could prove that a more general property known as the density matrix was the fount of all electronic proper- ties. They thought that the electron-density distribution, which was only a component of this matrix, could not offer the same predictive power. In the end, people were persuaded by the simplicity of the proof of the theorem, and by the efforts of numerous researchers who showed its usefulness. Walter was meticulous in his research — but in sports he was adventurous. In 1996, he wrecked his shoulder skiing the day before a widely anticipated talk on density functional theory at an annual meeting of the American Physical Society, and asked me to speak in his stead. He said that he had used a mogul to launch a jump, recalling the ski jumps he had made as a child in Austria. On another occasion, he took his eldest daughter, Marilyn, and me sailing beyond the surf at La Jolla Shores beach in Califor- nia on a windy day. The boat capsized, and as we pushed it back towards the beach the surf ripped it from our hands. Walter cared deeply about social issues. At San Diego, he promoted the Judaic studies programme. He was also a vocal critic of the University of California’s association with the national weapons laboratories in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and in Livermore, California. And he was proud of producing a documentary film promoting solar energy. Walter was an admired mentor and colleague, and will be missed by the many who came within his orbit. ■ Lu J. Sham is distinguished professor emeritus of physics at University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California, USA. e-mail: lsham@ucsd.edu KARL SCHOENDORFER/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK alter Kohn’s profound questioning of what the arrangement of elec- trons can tell us about a material’s character led to density functional theory. The theory, which predicts electron energies, became a basic tool in efforts to compute the properties of materials and the outcomes of chemical reactions. Some say that it revolu- tionized quantum chemistry, the applica- tion of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules. Kohn, who died on 19 April, was born in Vienna in 1923. In 1939, not long after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Kohn’s parents sent him to England on a convoy of the Kindertransport, an opera- tion to rescue Jewish children from Europe before the outbreak of the war. His mother and father were later killed at Auschwitz. In 1940, as a holder of a German passport, Kohn was shipped to the first of what would be a series of internment camps in Canada. Once free to leave, he began studies at the University of Toronto, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and phys- ics and master’s degree in applied mathemat- ics. In 1948, he completed a PhD in nuclear physics at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts; his supervisor was the Nobel-prizewinning theoretical physicist Julian Schwinger. In 1950, after a short stint of postdoc- toral work, Kohn took a professorship at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (now Carnegie Mellon University). A decade later, he joined the physics department at the University of California, San Diego, where he worked for nearly 20 years before becoming the found- ing director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (now the Kavli Institute). A condensed-matter system, from a sin- gle atom to a living organism, is composed of nuclei and electrons. The electrons roam in an energy landscape provided by the nuclei, and each electron is influenced by the others. The electrical charges of any pair of electrons in the same energy landscape interact, and no electron can exist in the same state as another in the same energy landscape (the Pauli exclusion principle). In the 1950s and 1960s, physicists were using two different approaches to compute the energy states of electrons in a material. In both approaches, the energy landscape was thought to be key to the prediction of d e v r e s e r s t h g i r l l A d e t i m i L s r e h s i l b u P n a l l i m c a M W Condensed-matter physicist who revolutionized quantum chemistry."
