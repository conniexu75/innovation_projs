Analog circuits that use large crossbar arrays of synaptic memory elements represent a low-power alternative, but most devices cannot update the synaptic weights uniformly or scale to large array sizes. Fuller et al. developed an integrated device, ionic floating-gate memory, that has the gate terminal of a redox transistor electrically connected to a diffusive memristor. This low-power device enabled linear and symmetric weight updates in parallel over an entire crossbar array at megahertz rates over 10 9 write-read cycles. Science , this issue p. 570"

The former process promotes metabolic disease, and the latter protects against it. Merrick et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing to define the hierarchy of mesenchymal progenitor cells that give rise to adipose tissue in mice and humans (see the Perspective by Chau and Cawthorn). They found that progenitor cells expressing a protein called DPP4 give rise to two distinct types of preadipocytes in response to different signals. The DPP4 progenitors reside in a fluid-filled network of collagen and elastin fibers surrounding adipose tissue. In principle, therapeutic interventions that increase progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes could ameliorate metabolic disease. Science , this issue p. eaav2501 ; see also p. 328"
https://openalex.org/W3102565420,"The recent discovery of ferromagnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdw) crystals has generated widespread interest, owing to their potential for fundamental and applied research. Advancing the understanding and applications of vdw magnets requires methods to quantitatively probe their magnetic properties on the nanoscale. Here, we report the study of atomically thin crystals of the vdw magnet CrI$_3$ down to individual monolayers using scanning single-spin magnetometry, and demonstrate quantitative, nanoscale imaging of magnetisation, localised defects and magnetic domains. We determine the magnetisation of CrI$_3$ monolayers to be $\approx16~\mu_B/$nm$^2$ and find comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers, whereas the magnetisation vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also establish that this inscrutable even-odd effect is intimately connected to the material structure, and that structural modifications can induce switching between ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic interlayer ordering. Besides revealing new aspects of magnetism in atomically thin CrI$_3$ crystals, these results demonstrate the power of single-spin scanning magnetometry for the study of magnetism in 2D vdw magnets."

The analysis uses an extensive database obtained from 31 satellite missions comprising three types of instruments-altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers. The analysis shows small increases in mean wind speed and significant wave height over this period, with larger increases in extreme conditions (90th percentiles). The largest increases occur in the Southern Ocean. Confidence in the results is strengthened because the wind speed trends are confirmed by all three satellite systems. An extensive set of sensitivity analyses confirms that both the mean and 90th percentile trends are robust, with only small impacts caused by satellite calibration and sampling patterns."

Ice adhesion, even to a surface treated to minimize the bonded force, will usually depend on the amount of surface coverage. Golovin et al. compared strength-limited deicing with toughness-limited deicing. Whereas normal deicing materials focus on minimizing the adhesion strength, the authors show that if a material is designed with low-adhesion toughness, deicing is no longer a function of the coverage area.

Recent experiments have shown that superconducting qubits can control and detect individual phonons in a resonant structure, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. Here, we report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two superconducting qubits. Using a 2 mm-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500 ns delay line, we demonstrate the emission and re-capture of a phonon by one qubit; quantum state transfer between two qubits with a 67\% efficiency; and, by partial transfer of a phonon between two qubits, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of $\mathcal{F}_B = 84 \pm 1$ %"

However, if energy does not flow out of this complex and into the rest of the molecule, the new bond will usually simply dissociate. Jiang et al. observed the scattering of hydrogen atoms from graphene and interpreted their results with a first-principles potential energy surface and a dynamical simulation (see the Perspective by Hornekaer). At near-normal incidence, these experiments probe transient carbon-hydrogen bond formation when the hydrogen atoms collide with the centers of the six-atom carbon rings. Rapid intramolecular vibrational relaxation results from orbital rehybridization and structural deformations that occur during bond formation. Science , this issue p. 379 ; see also p. 331"

However, there is a lack of consensus on how to interpret these results and translate them into effective intervention strategies. This study examined the association between visual acuity and time allocated to various activities among school-going children.Population-based survey of 19,934 students in grade 4 and 5 from 252 randomly selected rural primary schools in Northwest China in September 2012. This survey measured visual acuity and collected self-reported data on time spent outdoors and time spent doing various types of near activities.Prolonged (>60 minutes/day) computer usage (-0.025 LogMAR units, P = .011) and smartphone usage (-0.041 LogMAR units, P = .001) were significantly associated with greater refractive error, while television viewing and after-school study were not. For time spent outdoors, only time around midday was significantly associated with better uncorrected visual acuity. Compared to children who reported no midday time outdoors, those who spent time outdoors at midday for 31-60 minutes or more than 60 minutes had better uncorrected visual acuity by 0.016 LogMAR units (P = .014) and 0.016 units (P = .042), respectively.Use of smart phones and computers were associated with declines in children's vision, while television viewing was not. Statistically significant associations between outdoor time at midday and reduced myopia may support the hypothesis that light intensity plays a role in the protective effects of outdoor time."
https://openalex.org/W2941927468,"Evidence suggests that women in academia are hindered by conscious and unconscious biases, and often feel excluded from formal and informal opportunities for research collaboration. In addition to ensuring fairness and helping to redress gender imbalance in the academic workforce, increasing women’s access to collaboration could help scientific progress by drawing on more of the available human capital. Here, we test whether researchers tend to collaborate with same-gendered colleagues, using more stringent methods and a larger dataset than in past work. Our results reaffirm that researchers co-publish with colleagues of the same gender more often than expected by chance, and show that this ‘gender homophily’ is slightly stronger today than it was 10 years ago. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that homophily is driven mostly by senior academics, and no evidence that homophily is stronger in fields where women are in the minority. Interestingly, journals with a high impact factor for their discipline tended to have comparatively low homophily, as predicted if mixed-gender teams produce better research. We discuss some potential causes of gender homophily in science."

https://openalex.org/W2940800832,"This study aims at evaluating the effect of ultrafine granulated copper slag (UGCS) on hydration development of blended cement and mechanical properties of mortars. The UGCS with the median particle size of 4.78 μm and BET surface area of 1.31 m2/g was used as a cement replacement to prepare blended cements. Hydration heat emission of blended cement and mechanical performance of mortars were investigated by using isothermal calorimetry and strength tests, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied to the analysis of pozzolanic reaction and hydration products. The results illustrate that UGCS has influence on the hydration heat evolution of blended cement due to its filler effect and pozzolanic reaction. The cumulative hydration heat of blended cement is reduced by partial cement replacement with UGCS. The test mortar prepared by using blended cements with 30 wt. % UGCS shows a retardation of strength development with a low value at early ages (7 days) and a rapid growth at later ages (28 days). The 90-day compressive strength of test mortar is 45.0 MPa close to that of the control mortar (49.5 MPa). The obtained results from XRD and TGA analysis exhibit an increase in calcium hydroxide (CH) consumption and calcium silicate hydrates (C–S–H) formation in blended cement pastes with curing time. The cement replacement with UGCS induces changes in microstructure of blended cement paste and chemical composition of hydration products."

https://openalex.org/W2941816790,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a widespread neurological autoimmune disease that includes episodes of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). The accumulated evidence has suggested that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a ligand-activated transcription factor, is a promising treatment target for MS. Thus, the current study aimed to identify a novel Ahr ligand with anti-inflammatory potential in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods An in silico analysis was carried out to predict interactions between Ahr and potential natural ligands. The effects of a predicted interaction were examined in vitro using CD4+ T cells under T helper17 (Th17) cell-polarizing conditions and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Silencing Ahr and microRNA (miR)-132 was achieved by electroporation. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 and the adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells were used to induce EAE. Results Molecular docking analysis and in vitro data identified gallic acid (GA) as a novel Ahr ligand with potent activation potential. GA induced the expression of Ahr downstream genes, including cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp1a1) and the miR-212/132 cluster, and promoted the formation of the Ahr/Ahr nuclear translocator (Arnt) complex. In vivo, GA-treated mice were resistant to EAE and exhibited reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Furthermore, GA reduced infiltration of CD4+CD45+ T cells and monocytes into the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of GA were concomitant with miR-132-potentiated cholinergic anti-inflammation and the regulation of the pathogenic potential of astrocytes and microglia. Inducing EAE by adoptive transfer revealed that CD4+ T cells were not entirely responsible for the ameliorative effects of GA. Conclusion Our findings identify GA as a novel Ahr ligand and provide molecular mechanisms elucidating the ameliorative effects of GA on EAE, suggesting that GA is a potential therapeutic agent to control inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as MS."
https://openalex.org/W2942409201,"Childhood adversity is a potent risk factor for mental health conditions via disruptions to stress response systems. Dysregulations in oxidative stress systems have been associated with both childhood adversity and several psychological disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) in adult populations. However, few studies have examined associations between childhood adversity, oxidative stress, and mental health in pediatric populations. Childhood adversity (Adverse Childhood Events [ACE]), oxidative stress [F2t-isoprostanes (IsoPs)], and mental health pathology were assessed in 50 adolescent females recruited primarily through the Department of Youth Services. Standard ordinary least squares regression models were run co-varying for age, race/ethnicity, adolescent nicotine use, study condition, and parent history of ACEs. Adolescents who reported experiencing four or more ACEs had significantly elevated IsoP levels. Further, internalizing symptom scores across diagnoses were significantly associated with elevated IsoPs, whereas no externalizing symptoms scores, except Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, were related to altered oxidative stress. Results indicate that IsoPs may be a global marker of childhood adversity and mental health symptomatology, particularly within internalizing symptom domains. A limitation is that body mass index was not collected for this sample. Future studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings in larger, more diverse samples."
https://openalex.org/W2942123375,"Antibiotics have been used for over 60 years by the swine industry to improve growth performance and feed efficiency. With rising concerns over antimicrobial resistance and government restrictions such as the Veterinary Feed Directive on usage of in-feed antibiotics, alternatives to feeding antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) to nursery pigs are needed. However, the mechanism of action by which AGPs work is poorly understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of action by which AGPs increase nursery pig performance. Over two replicates, 24 weaned pigs (6.75 ± 0.75 kg body weight) were randomly allotted to either control (CON, n = 12) or sub-therapeutic antibiotic (sCTC, n = 12) treatments and housed individually. A 2-phase corn-soybean-based nursery diet was fed, with the sCTC diets containing 40 ppm feed-grade chlortetracycline. Individual pig average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were calculated weekly for 5 weeks. Thereafter, all pigs were euthanized and necropsied for tissue collection. The overall performance data indicated that sCTC pigs had increased ADG (0.43 vs. 0.32 kg/d, P = 0.001) and ADFI (0.51 vs. 0.37 kg/d, P = 0.002) compared with CON pigs; however, G:F was not different as a result of dietary treatment (0.85 vs. 0.88, P = 0.617). Intestinal barrier permeability, ileal active nutrient transport, and cecal short chain fatty acid concentrations did not differ (P > 0.10) due to dietary treatment, however changes in several ileum mRNA transcripts suggest that inflammation may be reduced in sCTC pigs. Further, the changes observed in the proteomes of the ileum, colon, skeletal muscle, and liver suggest that the sub-therapeutic mode of action of AGPs may include post-absorptive changes and warrants further investigation."

Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) was collected for quantification of innate antimicrobial activity against E. coli, HSV-2 and HIV and immune mediators by Luminex and ELISA. Microbiome studies by qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed on vaginal swabs.HIV+ postmenopausal compared to premenopausal participants had lower median E. coli bactericidal activity (41% vs. 62%, p = 0.001), lower median gene copies of Lactobacillus crispatus (p = 0.005) and Lactobacillus iners (p = 0.019), lower proportions of Lactobacillus iners, higher proportions of Gardnerella and Atopobium vaginae and lower levels of human beta defensins (HBD-2, HBD-3) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), p<0.001. HSV-2 inhibitory activity was higher in HIV+ postmenopausal compared to premenopausal participants (37% vs. 17%, p = 0.001) and correlated with the proinflammatory molecules interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, human neutrophil peptide (HNP) 1-3, lactoferrin and fibronectin. Similar trends were observed in HIV- postmenopausal compared to premenopausal participants. HIV inhibitory activity did not differ by reproductive status in the HIV+ participants but was significantly higher in HIV- postmenopausal compared to premenopausal participants and in participants with suppressed plasma viral load, and inversely correlated with gene copies of G. vaginalis and BVAB2. A significant proportion of HIV+ participants on ART exhibited HIV enhancing activity.HIV+ postmenopausal compared to premenopausal participants have less CVL E. coli bactericidal activity, reflecting a reduction in Lactobacilli and a greater proportion of Gardnerella and A. vaginae, and more HSV-2 inhibitory activity, reflecting increased mucosal inflammation. The effect of menopause on mucosal immunity was greater in HIV+ participants, suggesting a synergistic impact. Promotion of a lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiome and reduced mucosal inflammation may improve vaginal health and reduce risk for shedding of HIV and potential for HIV transmission in HIV+ menopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2952494793,"Anemia is frequently encountered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), decreasing the quality of life and significantly worsening the prognosis of the disease. The pathogenesis of anemia in IBD is multifactorial and results mainly from intestinal blood loss in inflamed mucosa and impaired dietary iron absorption. Multiple studies have proposed the use of the polyphenolic compound curcumin to counteract IBD pathogenesis since it has significant preventive and therapeutic properties as an anti-inflammatory agent and very low toxicity, even at high dosages. However, curcumin has been shown to possess properties consistent with those of an iron-chelator, such as the ability to modulate proteins of iron metabolism and decrease spleen and liver iron content. Thus, this property may further contribute to the development and severity of anemia of inflammation and iron deficiency in IBD. Herein, we evaluate the effects of curcumin on systemic iron balance in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mouse strains that were fed an iron-sufficient diet. In these conditions, curcumin supplementation caused mild anemia, lowered iron stores, worsened colitis and significantly decreased overall survival, independent of the mouse strain. These findings suggest that curcumin usage as an anti-inflammatory supplement should be accompanied by monitoring of erythroid parameters to avoid exacerbation of iron deficiency anemia in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2940906858,"The sexually transmitted pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is able to replicate and survive in human intestinal epithelial cells, being the gastro-intestinal tract a suitable site of residence for this microorganism. In this context, no detailed information about the mechanisms of cell death in intestinal cell lines after a chlamydial infection is available. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different CT serovars (D and L2) on the survival/death of different intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and COLO-205), using endocervical cells (HeLa) as a reference model of genital infection. Seventy two hours after chlamydial infection at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) levels, the viability of HeLa, Caco-2 and COLO 205 cells was evaluated through dose-response experiments by means of a MTS-based assay. To get deeper insights in the mechanisms of cell death induced by CT, cell viability was assessed in presence of different inhibitors (i.e. pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1, hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase, caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk). Moreover, the activation of effector caspases and the presence of cellular apoptotic/necrotic changes were evaluated at different time points after CT infection. Our results demonstrated that, for both chlamydial serovars, intestinal cell lines are more resistant to CT-induced cell death compared to HeLa, thus representing a suitable 'niche' for chlamydial residence and replication. In literature, apoptosis has been widely described to be the main cell death mechanism elicited by chlamydia infection. However, our data demonstrate that necroptosis plays a relevant role, proceeding in parallel with apoptosis. The protective effect of catalase suggests the involvement of oxidative stress in triggering both cell death pathways. Moreover, we demonstrated that caspase-1 is involved in CT-induced cell death, potentially contributing to host inflammatory response and tissue damage. Cells infected by L2 serovar displayed a higher activation of effector caspases compared to cells infected with serovar D, suggesting a serovar-specific activation of apoptotic pathways and potentially explaining the greater virulence of L serovars. Finally, we found that Chlamydia elicits the early externalization of phosphatidylserine on the external leaflet of plasma membrane independently of caspase activation."

Methods We identified the major cost components of a comprehensive SSP: (one-time start-up cost, and annual costs associated with personnel, operations, and prevention/medical services) and estimated the anticipated total costs (2016 US dollars) based on program size (number of clients served each year) and geographic location of the service (rural, suburban, and urban). Results The estimated costs ranged from $0.4 million for a small rural SSP (serving 250 clients) to $1.9 million for a large urban SSP (serving 2,500 clients), of which 1.6% and 0.8% is the start-up cost of a small rural and large urban SSP, respectively. Cost per syringe distributed varied from $3 (small urban SSP) to $1 (large rural SSP), and cost per client per year varied from $2000 (small urban SSP) to $700 (large rural SSP). Conclusions Estimates of the cost of SSPs in the United States vary by number of clients served and geographic location of service. Accurate costing can be useful for planning programs, developing policy, allocating funds for establishing and supporting SSPs, and providing data for economic evaluation of SSPs."
https://openalex.org/W2940588990,"Volunteer-based plant monitoring in the UK has focused mainly on distribution mapping; there has been less emphasis on the collection of data on plant communities and habitats. Abundance data provide different insights into ecological pattern and allow for more powerful inference when considering environmental change. Abundance monitoring for other groups of organisms is well-established in the UK, e.g. for birds and butterflies, and conservation agencies have long desired comparable schemes for plants. We describe a new citizen science scheme for the UK (the ‘National Plant Monitoring Scheme’; NPMS), with the primary aim of monitoring the abundance of plants at small scales. Scheme development emphasised volunteer flexibility through scheme co-creation and feedback, whilst retaining a rigorous approach to design. Sampling frameworks, target habitats and species, field methods and power are all described. We also evaluate several outcomes of the scheme design process, including: (i) landscape-context bias in the first two years of the scheme; (ii) the ability of different sets of indicator species to capture the main ecological gradients of UK vegetation; and, (iii) species richness bias in returns relative to a professional survey. Survey rates have been promising (over 60% of squares released have been surveyed), although upland squares are under-represented. Ecological gradients present in an ordination of an independent, unbiased, national survey were well-represented by NPMS indicator species, although further filtering to an entry-level set of easily identifiable species degraded signal in an ordination axis representing succession and disturbance. Comparison with another professional survey indicated that different biases might be present at different levels of participation within the scheme. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the NPMS will guide development, increase trust in outputs, and direct efforts for maintaining volunteer interest, as well as providing a set of ideas for other countries to experiment with."
https://openalex.org/W2941360829,"The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous opportunistic human pathogen capable of causing a life-threatening disease called invasive aspergillosis, or IA, with an associated 40-90% mortality rate in immunocompromised patients. Of the approximately 250 species known in the genus Aspergillus, A. fumigatus is responsible for up to 90% of IA infections. This study focuses on examining the role of the putative polysaccharide synthase cpsA gene in A. fumigatus virulence. Additionally, we evaluated its role in cellular processes that influence invasion and colonization of host tissue. Importantly, our results support that cpsA is indispensable for virulence in A. fumigatus infection of non-neutropenic hosts. Our study revealed that cpsA affects growth and sporulation in this fungus. Absence of cpsA resulted in a drastic reduction in conidiation, and forced overexpression of cpsA produced partially fluffy colonies with low sporulation levels, suggesting that wild-type cpsA expression levels are required for proper conidiation in this fungus. This study also showed that cpsA is necessary for normal cell wall integrity and composition. Furthermore, both deletion and overexpression of cpsA resulted in a reduction in the ability of A. fumigatus to adhere to surfaces, and caused increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Interestingly, metabolomics analysis indicated that cpsA affects A. fumigatus secondary metabolism. Forced overexpression of cpsA resulted in a statistically significant difference in the production of fumigaclavine A, fumigaclavine B, fumigaclavine C, verruculogen TR-2, and tryprostatin A."
https://openalex.org/W2941448547,"Progesterone membrane receptor component 1 (Pgrmc1) is a cytochrome b5-related protein with wide-ranging functions studied most extensively in non-neural tissues. We previously demonstrated that Pgrmc1 is widely distributed in the brain with highest expression in the limbic system. To determine Pgrmc1 functions in cells of these regions, we compared transcriptomes of control siRNA-treated and Pgrmc1 siRNA-treated N42 hypothalamic cells using whole genome microarrays. Our bioinformatics analyses suggested that Pgrmc1 plays a role in immune functions and likely regulates proinflammatory cytokine signaling. In follow-up studies, we showed that one of these cytokines, TNFα, increased expression of rtp4, ifit3 and gbp4, genes found on microarrays to be among the most highly upregulated by Pgrmc1 depletion. Moreover, either Pgrmc1 depletion or treatment with the Pgrmc1 antagonist, AG-205, increased both basal and TNFα-induced expression of these genes in N42 cells. TNFα had no effect on levels of Rtp4, Ifit3 or Gbp4 mRNAs in mHippoE-18 hippocampal control cells, but Pgrmc1 knock-down dramatically increased basal and TNFα-stimulated expression of these genes. P4 had no effect on gbp4, ifit3 or rtp4 expression or on the ability of Pgrmc1 to inhibit TNFα induction of these genes. However, a majority of the top upstream regulators of Pgrmc1 target genes were related to synthesis or activity of steroids, including P4, that exert neuroprotective effects. In addition, one of the identified Pgrmc1 targets was Nr4a1, an orphan receptor important for the synthesis of most steroidogenic molecules. Our findings indicate that Pgrmc1 may exert neuroprotective effects by suppressing TNFα-induced neuroinflammation and by regulating neurosteroid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2941152881,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are important in gene expression regulations by post-transcriptional control of RNAs and immune system development and its function. Due to the help of sequencing technology, numerous RNA sequences are newly discovered without knowing their binding partner RBPs. Therefore, demands for accurate prediction method for RBP binding sites are increasing. There are many attempts for RBP binding site predictions using various machine-learning techniques combined with various RNA features. In this work, we present a new deep convolution neural network model trained on CLIP-seq datasets using multi-sized filters and multi-modal features to predict the binding property of RBPs. With this model, we integrated sequence and structure information to extract sequence motifs, structure motifs, and combined motifs at the same time. The RBP binding site prediction on RBP-24 dataset was compared with two multi-modal methods, GraphProt and Deepnet-rbp, using area under curve (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristics (ROC). Our method (average AUC = 0.920) outperformed 20 RBPs with GraphProt (average AUC = 0.888) and 15 RBP with Deepnet-rbp (average AUC = 0.902). The improvement was achieved by using multi-sized convolution filters, where average relative error reduction was 17%. By introducing new RNA structure representation, structure probability matrix, average relative error was reduced by 3% when compared to one-hot encoded secondary structure representation. Interestingly, structure probability matrix was more effective on ALKBH5, where relative error reduction was 30%. We developed new sequence motif enrichment method, which we stated as response enrichment method. We successfully enriched sequence motif for 12 RBPs, which had high resemblance with other literature evidences, RBPgroup and CISBP-RNA. Finally by analyzing these results altogether, we found intricate interplay between sequence motif and structure motif, which agreed with other researches."

The survey was conducted from 2012 to 2015. Participants were 111 patients with MCS (mean age: 46 ± 20, 81% female) initially diagnosed by physicians, and 444 age- and gender-matched controls not diagnosed with MCS by doctors. The discriminatory validity of QEESI scores of patients and controls were evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses when considering interactions of the Masking Index (ongoing chemical exposure). New combined cut-off values were then set. Results New combined cut-off values (meeting conditions of Chemical Intolerances ≥ 30, Symptom Severity ≥ 13, and Life Impacts ≥ 17) showed high sensitivity (82.0%) and specificity (94.4%). Using new criteria when considering ongoing chemical exposure, study participants were categorized as: Very suggestive, Somewhat suggestive, Problematic, and Not suggestive. Participants classified as Very suggestive included 25 (5.6%) controls. Conclusions We have set new criteria with combined cut-off values based on current Japanese conditions. Such new criteria can be used for screening and as a diagnostic aid for Japanese patients with MCS and suggest approximately 6% of the Japanese general population may be classified as “Very suggestive people with MCS”."
https://openalex.org/W2941019302,"Objective The American College of Critical Care Medicine recommends that children with persistent fluid, catecholamine, and hormone-resistant septic shock be considered for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Current national estimates of ECMO use in hospitalized children with sepsis are unknown. We sought to examine the use of ECMO in these children and to examine the overall outcomes such as in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospitalization charges (HC). Methods A retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample, which approximates a 20% stratified sample of all discharges from United States community hospitals, was performed. All children (≤ 17 years) who were hospitalized for sepsis between 2012 and 2014 were included. The associations between ECMO and outcomes were examined by multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Results A total of 62,310 children were included in the study. The mean age was 4.2 years. ECMO was provided to 415 of the children (0.67% of the cohort with sepsis). Comparative outcomes of sepsis in children who received ECMO versus those who did not included in-hospital mortality rate (41% vs 2.8%), mean HC ($749,370 vs $90,568) and mean LOS (28.8 vs 9.1 days). After adjusting for confounding factors, children receiving ECMO had higher odds of mortality (OR 11.15, 95% CI 6.57–18.92, p < 0.001), longer LOS (6.6 days longer, p = 0.0004), and higher HC ($510,523 higher, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Use of ECMO in children with sepsis is associated with considerable resource utilization but has 59% survival to discharge. Further studies are needed to examine the post discharge and neurocognitive outcomes in survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2941668704,"There have been controversial debates across multiple disciplines regarding the underlying mechanism of developmental stuttering. Stuttering is often related to issues in the speech production system; however, the presence and extent of a speech perception deficit is less clear. This study aimed to investigate the speech perception of children who stutter (CWS) using the categorical perception paradigm to examine their ability to categorize different acoustic variations of speech sounds into the same or different phonemic categories. In this study, 15 CWS and 16 children who do not stutter (CWNS) completed identification and discrimination tasks involving acoustic variations of Cantonese speech sounds in three stimulus contexts: consonants (voice onset times, VOTs), lexical tones, and vowels. The results showed similar categorical perception performance in boundary position and width in the identification task and similar d' scores in the discrimination task between the CWS and CWNS groups. However, the reaction times (RTs) were slower in the CWS group compared with the CWNS group in both tasks. Moreover, the CWS group had slower RTs in identifying stimuli located across categorical boundaries compared with stimuli located away from categorical boundaries. Overall, the data implied that the phoneme representation evaluated in speech perception might be intact in CWS as revealed by similar patterns in categorical perception as those in CWNS. However, the CWS group had slower processing speeds during categorical perception, which may indicate an insufficiency in accessing the phonemic representations in a timely manner, especially when the acoustic stimuli were ambiguous."
https://openalex.org/W2941837211,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits a variety of phenotypes with regard to disease progression and treatment response. This variability complicates clinical decision-making despite the improvement of survival due to the recent introduction of FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and nab-paclitaxel. Questions remain as to the timing and sequence of therapies and the role of radiotherapy for unresectable PDAC. Here we developed a computational analysis platform to investigate the dynamics of growth, metastasis and treatment response to FFX, gemcitabine (GEM), and GEM+nab-paclitaxel. Our approach was informed using data of 1,089 patients treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital and validated using an independent cohort from Osaka Medical College. Our framework establishes a logistic growth pattern of PDAC and defines the Local Advancement Index (LAI), which determines the eventual primary tumor size and predicts the number of metastases. We found that a smaller LAI leads to a larger metastatic burden. Furthermore, our analyses ascertain that i) radiotherapy after induction chemotherapy improves survival in cases receiving induction FFX or with larger LAI, ii) neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in cases with resectable PDAC, and iii) temporary cessations of chemotherapies do not impact overall survival, which supports the feasibility of treatment holidays for patients with FFX-associated adverse effects. Our findings inform clinical decision-making for PDAC patients and allow for the rational design of clinical strategies using FFX, GEM, GEM+nab-paclitaxel, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2941361865,"Background NEETs (young people not in employment, education or training) are at higher risk for poorer mental and physical health. In France, the Missions locales (MLs) are the only social structures dedicated to this population. We sought to determine whether the systematic offer of a social and preventive medicine consultation at a ML might increase NEET participants’ access to training in the 12 months following the intervention. Methods This intervention research was a parallel randomised controlled interventional study conducted at five MLs in mainland France in 2011–2012. It included 976 NEETs aged 18 to 25 years who attended one of the five MLs. At inclusion, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to three groups: those in the first group were invited to see a social worker (not studied in this paper), those in the second group were invited to see a doctor and a social worker (intervention group), and the third was a control group. The primary outcome was participation in at least one training session during the year following study inclusion. Results Among the 976 participants, 504 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 472 to the control group; 704 (72.1%) were included in the analyses. A significantly higher proportion of the participants in the intervention group participated in a training session in the 12 months following the intervention than of those in the control group (63.3% vs 55.6%; p = 0.04). This difference was significantly greater for women, those less than 21 years of age, those unstably housed and those with a lower level of education. Conclusions Social and preventive medicine consultations that are fully integrated into the social services for NEETs have an impact on their access to training and contribute to changing some of their health-related behaviours. This may improve their access to the labour market."
https://openalex.org/W2940544526,"Mutations are not identified in ~5% of hemophilia A and 10–35% of type 1 VWD patients. The bleeding tendency also varies among patients carrying the same causative mutation, potentially indicating variants in additional genes modifying the phenotype that cannot be identified by routine single-gene analysis. The F8, F9 and VWF genes were analyzed in parallel using an AmpliSeq strategy and Ion Torrent sequencing. Targeting all exonic positions showed an average read depth of >2000X and coverage close to 100% in 24 male patients with known disease-causing mutations. Discrimination between reference alleles and alternative/indel alleles was adequate at a 25% frequency threshold. In F8, F9 and VWF there was an absolute majority of all reference alleles at allele frequencies >95% and the average alternative allele and indel frequencies never reached above 10% and 15%, respectively. In VWF, 4–5 regions showed lower reference allele frequencies; in two regions covered by the pseudogene close to the 25% cut-off for reference alleles. All known mutations, including indels, gross deletions and substitutions, were identified. Additional VWF variants were identified in three hemophilia patients. The presence of additional mutations in 2 out of 16 (12%) randomly selected hemophilia patients indicates a potential mutational contribution that may affect the disease phenotype and counseling in these patients. Parallel identification of disease-causing mutations in all three genes not only confirms the deficiency, but differentiates phenotypic overlaps and allows for correct genetic counseling."
https://openalex.org/W2941100477,"Small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants should be identified before birth because of an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of fetal growth rate by gestational age on the prediction of SGA and to identify the optimal time to initiate intensive fetal monitoring to detect SGA in low-risk women. We also sought to determine which the ultrasonographic parameters that contribute substantially to the birthweight determination.This was a retrospective study of 442 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancies. There were 328 adequate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates and 114 SGA infants delivered between 37+0 and 41+6 weeks of gestation. We compared the biparietal diameters (BPD), head circumferences (HC), abdominal circumferences (AC), femur lengths (FL), and estimated fetal weights (EFW) obtained on each ultrasound to determine which of these parameters was the best indicator of SGA. We created receiver operating characteristic curves, calculated the areas under the curves (AUCs), and analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regressions to assess the ultrasound screening performances and identify the best predictive factor.Among the four ultrasonographic parameters, the AC measurement between 24+0~28+6 weeks achieved a sensitivity of 79.5% and a specificity of 71.7%, with an AUC of 0.806 in the prediction of SGA. AC showed consistently higher AUCs above 0.8 with 64~80% sensitivities as gestational age progressed. EFW measurements from 33+0~35+6 gestational weeks achieved a sensitivity of 60.6% and a specificity of 87.6%, with an AUC of 0.826. In a conditional growth model developed from the linear mixed regression, the value differences between AC and EFW in the SGA and AGA groups became even more pronounced after 33+0~35+6 weeks.Healthy low-risk women with a low fetal AC after 24 weeks' gestation need to be monitored carefully for fetal growth to identify SGA infants with a risk for adverse perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2942228254,"Elasticity is the key technique to provisioning resources dynamically in order to flexibly meet the users' demand. Namely, the elasticity is aimed at meeting the demand at any time. However, the aforementioned approaches usually provision virtual machines (VMs) in a coarse-grained manner just by the CPU utilization. Actually, two or more elements are needed for the performance metric, including the CPU and the memory. It is challenging to determine a suitable threshold to efficiently scale the resources up or down. In this paper we present an elastic scaling framework that is implemented by the cloud layer model. First we propose the elastic resource provisioning (ERP) approach on the performance threshold. The proposed threshold is based on the Grey relational analysis (GRA) policy, including the CPU and the memory. Secondly, according to the fixed threshold, we scale up the resources from different granularities, such as in the physical machine level (PM-level) or virtual machine level (VM-level). In contrast, we scale down the resources and shut down the spare machines. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real workloads. The extensive experiments show that the ERP algorithm performs the elastic strategy efficiently by reducing the overhead and response time."
https://openalex.org/W2950517832,"Micronutrient deficiency is the cause of multiple diseases in developing countries. Staple crop biofortification is an efficient means to combat such deficiencies in the diets of local consumers. Biofortified lines of sweet potato (Ipomoea batata L. Lam) with enhanced beta-carotene content have been developed in Ghana to alleviate Vitamin A Deficiency. These genotypes are propagated using meristem micropropagation to ensure the generation of virus-free propagules. In vitro culture exposes micropropagated plants to conditions that can lead to the accumulation of somaclonal variation with the potential to generate unwanted aberrant phenotypes. However, the effect of micropropagation induced somaclonal variation on the production of key nutrients by field-grown plants has not been previously studied. Here we assessed the extent of in vitro culture induced somaclonal variation, at a phenotypic, compositional and genetic/epigenetic level, by comparing field-maintained and micropropagated lines of three elite Ghanaian sweet potato genotypes grown in a common garden. Although micropropagated plants presented no observable morphological abnormalities compared to field maintained lines, they presented significantly lower levels of iron, total protein, zinc, and glucose. Methylation Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism analysis showed a high level of in vitro culture induced molecular variation in micropropagated plants. Epigenetic, rather than genetic variation, accounts for most of the observed molecular variability. Taken collectively, our results highlight the importance of ensuring the clonal fidelity of the micropropagated biofortified lines in order to reduce potential losses in the nutritional value prior to their commercial release."
https://openalex.org/W2941294819,"Background Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) is an indicator used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess equity in households’ payments to the health system. In this paper, we prospectively calculated the population at risk of facing catastrophic expenditure due to purchasing three selected medicines (metformin, atorvastatin and amoxicillin) in Iran. Method This study draws on the data set of the Iranian National Household Survey of 38244 households in Iran. CHE was calculated based on ""capacity to pay"" using different thresholds. Results 20, 16 and 3 households had to spend more than 40% of their capacity to pay on amoxicillin, atorvastatin and metformin respectively. Lowest priced generic (LPG) medicines were found more affordable than the original brand (OB) medicines. Age, literacy and gender of head of household, economic status, settlement, size and number of breadwinners in the households share important association with CHE. Conclusion Requirement of these specific medicines for long-term may subject the Iranian households to CHE. The study demonstrates important and specific insights for health policy makers in Iran to protect the households from healthcare catastrophes."
https://openalex.org/W2941487377,"Background A major obstacle to using recombinant adenoviral vectors in gene therapy is the natural ability of human adenovirus to activate the classical and alternate complement pathways. These innate immune responses contribute to hepatic adenoviral uptake following systemic delivery and enhance the humoral immune responses associated with adenoviral infection. Methods A recombinant Ad5 vector was genetically modified to display a peptide sequence (“rH17d’”), a known inhibitor of the classical complement pathway. The replication-defective vectors Ad5.HVR2-rH17d’ and Ad5.HVR5-rH17d’ were constructed by engineering the rH17d’ peptide into the hypervariable region (HVR)-2 or HVR5 of their major capsid protein hexon. Control Ad5 vectors were created by incorporation of a 6-histidine (His6)-insert in either HVR2 or HVR5 (Ad5.HVR2-His6 and Ad5.HVR5-His6, respectively). All vectors encoded CMV promoter-controlled firefly luciferase (Luc). The four vectors were evaluated in TIB76 mouse liver cells and immunocompetent mice to compare infectivity and liver sequestration, respectively. Results In vitro studies demonstrated that preincubation of all the Ad5 vectors with fresh serum significantly increased their gene transfer relative to preincubation with PBS except Ad5.HVR5-rH17d’, whose infectivity of liver cells showed no serum-mediated enhancement. In line with that, mice injected with Ad5.HVR2-rH17d’ or Ad5.HVR5-rH17d’ showed significantly lower luciferase expression levels in the liver as compared to the respective control vectors, whereas efficiency of tumor transduction by rH17d’ and His6 vectors following their intratumoral injection was similar. Conclusions Displaying a complement-inhibiting peptide on the Ad5 capsid surface by genetic modification of the hexon protein could be a suitable strategy for reducing Ad5 liver tropism (Ad5 sequestration by liver), which may be applicable to other gene therapy vectors with natural liver tropism."
https://openalex.org/W2942283648,"Objective This study aimed to investigate the suture length to wound length ratio (SL:WL) in an in vitro model of abdominal wall closure. Effects of the surgeon’s experience level on the SL:WL ratio were evaluated, hypothesizing that small animal surgeons do not spontaneously apply SL:WL ratios equal to or larger than 4:1. Procedures Three groups of surgeons with varying levels of experience performed 4 simple continuous sutures before (3 sutures) and after (1 suture) being educated on principles of the SL:WL ratio. All sutures were evaluated for their gaping, number of stitches, stitch intervals, tissue bite size and suture length. Results No significant differences in suture parameters or SL:WL ratios were found among the 3 groups, and 60.5% of control sutures and 77.0% of test sutures had SL:WL ratios above 4:1. There was a significant improvement in the mean ratio after the information was provided (p = 0.003). Overall, the SL:WL ratios ranged from 1.54:1 to 6.81:1, with 36.3% falling between 4:1 and 5:1 (5.17 mm mean stitch interval, 5.52 mm mean tissue bite size). A significant negative correlation was observed between the SL:WL ratio and the stitch interval to tissue bite ratio (r = -0.886). Forty-nine of 120 sutures fulfilled the current recommendations for abdominal wall closure with a mean SL:WL ratio of 4.1:1. Conclusion A SL:WL ratio larger than 4:1 was achieved in 60% of the control sutures and in 77% of test sutures. Additional animal studies are necessary to evaluate the SL/WL ratio in small animal surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2940456591,"The transcription factor selectively binds with the cis-regulatory elements of the promoter and regulates the differential expression of genes. In this study, we aimed to identify and validate the presence of GCC-box and TCC-box motifs in the promoters of upregulated differentially expressed genes (UR-DEGs) and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DR-DEGs) under anoxia using molecular beacon probe (MBP) based real-time PCR. The GCC-box motif was detected in UR-DEGs (DnaJ and 60S ribosomal protein L7 genes), whereas, the TCC-box was detected in DR-DEGs (DnaK and CPuORF11 genes). In addition, the mechanism of interaction of AP2/EREBP family transcription factor (LOC_Os03g22170) with GCC-box promoter motif present in DnaJ gene (LOC_Os06g09560) and 60S ribosomal protein L7 gene (LOC_Os08g42920); and TCC-box promoter motif of DnaK gene (LOC_Os02g48110) and CPuORF11 gene (LOC_Os02g01240) were explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations analysis including binding free energy calculations, principal component analyses, and free energy landscapes. The binding free energy analysis revealed that AP2/EREBP model residues such as Arg68, Arg72, Arg83, Lys87, and Arg90 were commonly involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with GCC and TCC-box promoter motifs, suggesting that these residues are critical for strong interaction. The movement of the entire protein bound to DNA was restricted, confirming the stability of the complex. This study provides comprehensive binding information and a more detailed view of the dynamic interaction between proteins and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2941665904,"Using a mixture of neutral primary amine dehydroabietylamine (DHAA) and long-chain cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template, ordered lamellar supermicroporous silicas were synthesized with NaOH as the base source and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source. The concentrations of DHAA, CTAB, and NaOH in the synthesis system had great effects on the structural properties of the samples. When the molar ratio of components was nTEOS:nCTAB:nDHAA:nNaOH:nH2O = 1:0.114:0.00457:0.5:60, the material showed a lamellar phase with the highest ordering degree. By adding only a trace amount of DHAA into the synthesis system, the structure of the samples could be transformed from cubic phase to lamellar phase, since the added DHAA solubilized in CTAB micelles to change the effective surfactant ion pair packing parameter. The dosage of CTAB should be moderate; too high or too low will decay the ordering degree of the lamellar structure.A much higher concentration of NaOH resulted in an ethanol-rich solvent in which the DHAA did not solubilize in the micelles of CTAB, but adsorbed at the hydrophilic headgroup-solvent interface. Accordingly, a structural transformation from lamellar phase to hexagonal phase occurred."

In order to evaluate the correlation between the spatial attentional bias and the white matter microstructure high angular resolution diffusion MRI was acquired for each subjects. The Track Based Spatial Statistics method was used to measure the hemispheric differences of the white matter microstructure. Probabilistic tractography was used to reveal the connection of the identified regions.The analysis showed correlation between the behavioural scores and the lateralisation of the white matter microstructure in the parietal white matter (p<0.05, corrected for multiple correlations). Higher FA values on the left are associated to rightward bias. The parietal cluster showed connectivity along the superior longitudinal fascicle on one end to posterior parietal cortex and anteriorly to the putative frontal eye field. From the frontal eye field some of the fibres run towards the nodes of the dorsal attention network to the intraparietal suclus, while some of the fibres travelled toward to ventral attention network to the temporo-parietal junction.These results indicate that the structural integrity dorsal fronto-parietal network and the connection between the dorsal and ventral attention networks are responsible for the attentional bias in normal healthy controls."

I had recently earned tenure and become eligible for a sabbatical, but I had hesitated to take one. A break from teaching to focus on my research sounded nice in theory, but the truth was that I felt burned out on my science. I had no idea what I would do on a sabbatical, and the thought of losing the structure that teaching provides terrified me. Yet when I saw my former adviser at a conference and she mentioned that she would be spending the next year on sabbatical in a lab whose work I admired, something clicked. Maybe that was what I needed to get my spark back after the grueling, isolating process of getting tenure.

> “I could be a laboratory tourist and benefit from seeing new perspectives.” 

When I started in my tenure-track position 6 years earlier, I had all the enthusiasm in the world. I couldn't wait to set up and run my own lab. To earn tenure, I needed to prove my independence by publishing as a solo principal investigator. That's pretty standard for professors who run labs staffed by graduate students. But I work at a state university regional campus that serves only undergraduates. The students are wonderful, but they need a lot of training and only have limited time for research.

So, I thought the best approach was to publish as a single author and do the bulk of research myself. I was so concerned about proving that I could work independently that I didn't talk with colleagues or mentors about my work. The only people who read my manuscripts prior to publication were peer reviewers and editors.

It worked: I got tenure. But when I received the email notification from my dean, I realized the toll those years had taken on me. Instead of being ecstatic, as I had always imagined I would be, I sat blankly in front of my computer wondering, “What now?” I couldn't remember why I had ever been interested in the questions I had pursued, and I was convinced that I had already had all of the ideas I would ever have. I went to my living room and started to binge-watch Gilmore Girls .

That sense of emptiness continued for about 9 months, until my Ph.D. adviser and I got to talking at that conference. When she brought up her sabbatical and invited me to visit, I was intrigued. I didn't have an idea for a project, but maybe I could be a laboratory tourist and benefit from seeing new perspectives. I had recently been awarded a small grant—enough for an international flight and 6 weeks of housing. My students were advanced enough that they could manage without me for a while. I turned in my sabbatical application the day it was due, and 6 months later I was in Germany.

The first day, I set up my laptop and wondered what to do with myself. A few hours later, one of the lab's graduate students announced that it was time for lunch—a daily group activity. After I was introduced to everyone, one of the students mentioned that she was uncertain about how to implement a new experiment. As we discussed her project, I remembered how much I enjoyed this kind of collaborative exchange of ideas.

From then on, I made it a point to strike up conversations as we walked to lunch each day. The weeks flew by, and I felt my enthusiasm for research coming back. A colloquium I gave to the department at the end of my visit capped the experience. The audience was engaged and asked challenging questions. I felt energized and enthusiastic about my work for the first time in years.

I wish I hadn't allowed my tenure process to become so isolating. My ideas had been stuck in my own head for so long that they felt stale. In hindsight, I could have talked with my colleagues and mentors about my work. That wouldn't have jeopardized my independence and would have helped both my work and my mental state. But I've learned my lesson: Community and connection are a great antidote to burnout.

https://openalex.org/W2940511602,"Alan Krueger, the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at Princeton University, passed away on 16 March at the age of 58. He was among the most innovative and influential economists of the past four decades. Alan's scholarship revealed the operation of real-world labor markets, the impacts of the minimum wage and school resources, the measurement of subjective well-being, and the plight of the unemployed. He pushed the field of economics toward a more evidence-based and scientific approach to research and policy analysis.

Alan Krueger was born on 17 September 1960 and grew up in Livingston, New Jersey. After graduating from Cornell University in 1983 and pursuing graduate studies in economics at Harvard University, he earned his Ph.D. in 1987. He became an assistant professor that year in the Department of Economics and the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, earned tenure in 1992, and remained at Princeton for the rest of his career, where he served as a caring mentor to many generations of students, young scholars, and future policy-makers. From 1994 to 1995, he served as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton. Later, he was an assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2010 and then chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2013, both under President Barack Obama.

Alan gained prominence as a scholar in the early 1990s as a leader in the “credibility revolution” in empirical economics. His pioneering work used natural experiments to provide compelling estimates of the returns to educational investments and the impact of minimum wages. His pathbreaking work with economist Joshua Angrist used quasi-experimental variation in the date of birth combined with the operation of compulsory schooling laws to estimate a large positive causal impact of schooling on earnings, even for students on the margin of dropping out of school. Alan and economist David Card harnessed historical changes in state education resources across birth cohorts to provide convincing estimates of the substantial returns from increases in school resources on students' long-run economic outcomes. Alan used the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) class-size reduction experiment to illustrate the advantage of randomized controlled trials for policy evaluation.

Alan and I met in 1986 when I was a new assistant professor and Alan was completing his Ph.D. in the Harvard Economics Department. Alan quickly became one of my closest colleagues, collaborators, and intellectual confidantes and remained so for the next 33 years. My fondest memories of Alan come from our intense, yet entertaining, daily phone calls when we were both young scholars. Our conversations, ranging from research projects to professional gossip, always displayed his quick wit, laser focus on the most important questions, and infectious enthusiasm for new ideas. A multitasker, he would later regale visitors with a history of his Treasury office while devising new approaches to estimate the effect of tax credits. When we both gave talks at the National Governors Association meeting in Santa Fe this past summer, it was Alan who showed me the best swag and introduced me to the most engaging governors and staffers. He was involved in everything and connected to everybody.

My work with Alan exploited the federal minimum wage increase of 1991 to estimate its impact on employment and wages by collecting survey data on fast-food restaurants in a large, low-wage state (Texas). We found (contrary to our expectations and the prevailing wisdom) that employment increased more in the lower-wage restaurants directly affected by the higher minimum wage as compared with higher-wage restaurants that were not constrained. Alan's classic study on the minimum wage with David Card, comparing fast-food restaurants in New Jersey before and after the state increased its minimum wage in 1992 with those just across the border in Pennsylvania, also found no adverse employment impact. Card and Krueger expanded the scope of this research in their 1995 book Myth and Measurement to examine the impact of minimum wages on income distribution and to reassess models of the labor market.

His “can do” attitude enabled Alan to charge ahead with important research even if it meant collecting data from nonstandard sources. He founded the Princeton Survey Research Center in 1992 to facilitate such efforts. Alan's findings were often unconventional, such as his demonstration that poverty was unlikely to be a major cause of terrorism, that attending a more elite university did not raise earnings above those earned after attending a lesser institution for most, and that economic growth eventually improves the environment. He built the new field of “Rockonomics” by showing how economic analysis can illuminate concert ticket pricing and musician incomes. Alan helped develop innovative survey methods to improve the measurement of happiness. His research highlighted the psychological cost of searching for a job as well as the high incidence of pain among the long-term jobless. Alan's recent work documented the rise of the online gig economy and its complications for labor market regulations.

Alan's rigorous research methods were reminiscent of the best investigative journalism. His work with economist Alexandre Mas linked traffic fatalities to defective tires produced after a labor dispute. With economist Orley Ashenfelter, he used actual franchise contracts to provide smoking-gun evidence of nonpoaching agreements limiting worker mobility, research that quickly led to probes by multiple state attorneys general.

Because of Alan Krueger, the field of economics has become more scientific through the adoption of credible empirical methods that identify causal relationships and more humanistic through innovative survey methods that improve the measurement of well-being, pain, and work arrangements. He combined intellectual curiosity, a passion for using social science to improve lives, and an ability to uncover evidence from unexpected sources. Alan Krueger's work likely has benefited millions of workers from stronger evidence to guide public policy. Most important, he was a devoted husband and father who leaves behind his wife Lisa and his children Benjamin and Sydney.

https://openalex.org/W2942331555,"Background Pediatric diarrhea, a leading cause of under-five mortality, is predominantly infectious in etiology. As many putative causal agents are zoonotic, animal exposure is a likely risk factor. To evaluate the effect of animal-related factors on moderate to severe childhood diarrhea in rural Kenya, where animal contact is common, Conan et al. studied 73 matched case-control pairs from 2009-2011, collecting rich exposure data on many dimensions of animal contact. We review the challenges associated with analyzing moderately-sized datasets with a large number of predictors and present two alternative methodological approaches. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a simulation study to demonstrate that forward stepwise selection results in overfit models when data are high-dimensional, and that p values reported directly from the data used to train these models are misleading. We described how automated methods of variable selection, attractive when the number of predictors is large, can result in overadjustment bias. We proposed an alternative a priori regression approach not subject to this bias. Applied to Conan et al.’s data, this approach found a non-significant but positive trend for household’s sharing of water sources with livestock or poultry, child’s presence for poultry slaughter, and child’s habit of playing where poultry sleep or defecate. For many predictors evaluated few pairs were discordant, suggesting matching compromised the power of this analysis. Finally, we proposed latent variable modeling as a complimentary approach and performed Item Response Theory modeling on Conan et al.’s data, with animal contact as the latent trait. We found a moderate but non-significant effect (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.78, 1.87, unit = 1 standard deviation). Conclusions/Significance Automated methods of model selection are appropriate for prediction models when fit and evaluated on separate samples. However when the goal is inference, these methods can produce misleading results. Furthermore, case-control matching should be done with caution."
