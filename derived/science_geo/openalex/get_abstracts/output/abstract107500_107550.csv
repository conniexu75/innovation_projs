https://openalex.org/W2096276671,"Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer. The majority of the mutations occur in the core domain which contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of the p53 protein (residues 102-292), and they result in loss of DNA binding. The crystal structure of a complex containing the core domain of human p53 and a DNA binding site has been determined at 2.2 angstroms resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 20.5 percent. The core domain structure consists of a beta sandwich that serves as a scaffold for two large loops and a loop-sheet-helix motif. The two loops, which are held together in part by a tetrahedrally coordinated zinc atom, and the loop-sheet-helix motif form the DNA binding surface of p53. Residues from the loop-sheet-helix motif interact in the major groove of the DNA, while an arginine from one of the two large loops interacts in the minor groove. The loops and the loop-sheet-helix motif consist of the conserved regions of the core domain and contain the majority of the p53 mutations identified in tumors. The structure supports the hypothesis that DNA binding is critical for the biological activity of p53, and provides a framework for understanding how mutations inactivate it."

https://openalex.org/W2061404129,"A subset of patients who have undergone coronary angioplasty develop restenosis, a vessel renarrowing characterized by excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Of 60 human restenosis lesions examined, 23 (38 percent) were found to have accumulated high amounts of the tumor suppressor protein p53, and this correlated with the presence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the lesions. SMCs grown from the lesions expressed HCMV protein IE84 and high amounts of p53. HCMV infection of cultured SMCs enhanced p53 accumulation, which correlated temporally with IE84 expression. IE84 also bound to p53 and abolished its ability to transcriptionally activate a reporter gene. Thus, HCMV, and IE84-mediated inhibition of p53 function, may contribute to the development of restenosis."

https://openalex.org/W1994584656,"Interleukin-2 is an autocrine growth factor for T cells which also activates other cells including B cells and natural killer cells. The subunits of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, but protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical event following ligand binding and src family kinases, such as Lck, are known to be activated by IL-2 (refs 5-9). However, IL-2 signalling can occur in the absence of receptor interaction with Lck, suggesting that other protein tyrosine kinases might be important. Here we report that a new member of the Janus family of kinases (Jak-3) is coupled to the IL-2R in human peripheral blood T cells and natural killer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580090335,"Electrically silent Na(+)-(K+)-Cl- transporter systems are present in a wide variety of cells and serve diverse physiological functions. In chloride secretory and absorbing epithelia, these cotransporters provide the chloride entry mechanism crucial for transcellular chloride transport. We have isolated cDNAs encoding the two major electroneutral sodium-chloride transporters present in the mammalian kidney, the bumetanide-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- symporter and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl- cotransporter, and have characterized their functional activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Despite their differing sensitivities to bumetanide and thiazides and their different requirements for potassium, these approximately 115-kDa proteins share significant sequence similarity (approximately 60%) and exhibit a topology featuring 12 potential membrane-spanning helices flanked by long non-hydrophobic domains at the NH2 and COOH termini. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that these transporters are expressed predominantly in kidney with an intrarenal distribution consistent with their recognized functional localization. These proteins establish a new family of Na(+)-(K+)-Cl- cotransporters."
https://openalex.org/W2022760428,"Both interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) produced by T helper 1 (TH1) lymphocytes and interleukin-4 (IL-4) produced by TH2 lymphocytes were reduced in either bulk circulating mononuclear cells or mitogen-induced CD4+ T cell clones from the peripheral blood of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There was a preferential reduction in clones producing IL-4 and IL-5 in the advanced phases of infection. However, enhanced proportions of CD4+ T cell clones producing both TH1-type and TH2-type cytokines (TH0 clones) were generated from either skin-infiltrating T cells that had been activated in vivo or peripheral blood T cells stimulated by antigen in vitro when cells were isolated from HIV-infected individuals. All TH2 and most TH0 clones supported viral replication, although viral replication was not detected in any of the TH1 clones infected in vitro with HIV. These results suggest that HIV (i) does not induce a definite TH1 to TH2 switch, but can favor a shift to the TH0 phenotype in response to recall antigens, and (ii) preferentially replicates in CD4+ T cells producing TH2-type cytokines (TH2 and TH0)."

https://openalex.org/W2073223761,"In Thunberg's thermal grill illusion, first demonstrated in 1896, a sensation of strong, often painful heat is elicited by touching interlaced warm and cool bars to the skin. Neurophysiological recordings from two classes of ascending spinothalamic tract neurons that are sensitive to innocuous or noxious cold showed differential responses to the grill. On the basis of these results, a simple model of central disinhibition, or unmasking, predicted a quantitative correspondence between grill-evoked pain and cold-evoked pain, which was verified psychophysically. This integration of pain and temperature can explain the thermal grill illusion and the burning sensation of cold pain and may also provide a basis for the cold-evoked, burning pain of the classic thalamic pain syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2082703144,"Monoclonal antibodies, induced with a phosphonate diester hapten, catalyzed the coupling of p-nitrophenyl esters of N-acetyl valine, leucine, and phenylalanine with tryptophan amide to form the corresponding dipeptides. All possible stereoisomeric combinations of the ester and amide substrates were coupled at comparable rates. The antibodies did not catalyze the hydrolysis of the dipeptide product nor hydrolysis or racemization of the activated esters. The yields of the dipeptides ranged from 44 to 94 percent. The antibodies were capable of multiple turnovers at rates that exceeded the rate of spontaneous ester hydrolysis. This achievement suggests routes toward creating a small number of antibody catalysts for polypeptide syntheses."
https://openalex.org/W1989073611,The tailspike protein (TSP) of Salmonella typhimurium phage P22 is a part of the apparatus by which the phage attaches to the bacterial host and hydrolyzes the O antigen. It has served as a model system for genetic and biochemical analysis of protein folding. The x-ray structure of a shortened TSP (residues 109 to 666) was determined to a 2.0 angstrom resolution. Each subunit of the homotrimer contains a large parallel Î² helix. The interdigitation of the polypeptide chains at the carboxyl termini is important to protrimer formation in the folding pathway and to thermostability of the mature protein.
https://openalex.org/W2103262188,"The three-dimensional structure of the oligomerization domain (residues 319 to 360) of the tumor suppressor p53 has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The domain forms a 20-kilodalton symmetric tetramer with a topology made up from a dimer of dimers. The two primary dimers each comprise two antiparallel helices linked by an antiparallel beta sheet. One beta strand and one helix are contributed from each monomer. The interface between the two dimers forming the tetramer is mediated solely by helix-helix contacts. The overall result is a symmetric, four-helix bundle with adjacent helices oriented antiparallel to each other and with the two antiparallel beta sheets located on opposing faces of the molecule. The tetramer is stabilized not only by hydrophobic interactions within the protein core but also by a number of electrostatic interactions. The implications of the structure of the tetramer for the biological function of p53 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559438287,"N6-Methyladenosine is found at internal positions of mRNA in higher eukaryotes. This post-transcriptional modification occurs at a frequency of one to three methylation/average mRNA molecule in mammalian cell lines and is sequence-specific. A highly conserved consensus recognition site for the methyltransferase has been determined from both viral and cellular messages, consisting of the sequence Pu(G/A)AC(U/A) (with A being methylated). Despite the ubiquity and the specificity of this modification, little is known about the mechanism of formation of N6-methyladenosine. Utilizing an in vitro methylation system from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, and a substrate RNA derived from the mRNA coding for bovine prolactin, the mRNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase has been characterized and partially purified. Unique among other characterized nucleic acid methyltransferases, the enzyme is composed of three components which are separable under non-denaturing conditions. The molecular masses of the components are 30, 200, and 875 kDa as determined by gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The 200-kDa component appears to contain the S-adenosylmethionine-binding site on a 70-kDa subunit. The 875-kDa component has affinity for single-stranded DNA-agarose, suggesting that it may contain the mRNA-binding site. N6-Adenosine methyltransferase is not sensitive to treatment with micrococcal nuclease, nor to immunodepletion using an anti-trimethylguanosine antibody, suggesting that it does not contain an essential RNA component."
https://openalex.org/W2009703634,"An influenza virus matrix peptide in which either the charged amino or carboxyl terminus was substituted by methyl groups promoted folding of the class I human histocompatibility antigen (HLA-A2). A peptide modified at both termini did not promote stable folding. The thermal stability of HLA-A2 complexed with peptides that did not have either terminus was approximately 22 degrees C lower than that of the control peptide, whereas matrix peptide in which both anchor positions were substituted by alanines had its stability decreased by only 5.5 degrees C. Thus, the conserved major histocompatibility complex class I residues at both ends of the peptide binding site form energetically important sites for binding the termini of short peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1539232350,"Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid beta-protein (A beta), a molecule produced by post-translational processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). Mutations within the gene encoding beta APP have been linked to early onset forms of AD, but the pathogenetic mechanism(s) producing the phenotype are unknown. We analyzed the effects on beta APP processing in vitro of a naturally occurring Ala-->Gly mutation at position 692 of beta APP770 (A692G) (Hendriks, L., Duijin, C., Cras, P., Cruts, M., van Hul, W., van Harskamp, F., Warren, A., McInnis, M., Antonarakis, S., Martin, J.-J., Hofman, A., and van Broeckhoven, C. (1992) Nature Genet. 1, 218-221), as well as the effects of five genetically engineered mutations at or near this site. Substitution of glycine or proline for Ala692, or for Phe690, produced relative increases in secretion of A beta and relative decreases in secretion of the p3 peptide(s) arising after alpha-secretase generation of soluble APP (APPs). The Phe690-->Pro substitution also resulted in the synthesis of truncated APPs molecules. The structurally conservative substitutions Ala692-->Val and Phe690-->Tyr did not exhibit these effects. Certain of the substitutions also resulted in the production of a minor peptides, previously undescribed in vitro, beginning at Ala2, Lys16, and Phe19 of A beta. These data show that beta APP mutations carboxyl-terminal to alpha-secretase and beta-secretase cleavage sites can exert strong control over beta APP processing. Increased secretion of A beta may accelerate amyloidogenesis by providing more precursors for aggregation. It is also possible that truncated A beta peptides resulting from several of these mutations may accelerate amyloidogenesis through self-aggregation and/or seeding the fibrillogenesis of longer, more abundant A beta species."
https://openalex.org/W2087730230,"Adaptive reversion of a +1 frameshift mutation in Escherichia coli, which requires homologous recombination functions, is shown here to occur by -1 deletions in regions of small mononucleotide repeats. This pattern makes improbable recombinational mechanisms for adaptive mutation in which blocks of sequences are transferred into the mutating gene, and it supports mechanisms that use DNA polymerase errors. The pattern appears similar to that of mutations found in yeast cells and in hereditary colon cancer cells that are deficient in mismatch repair. These results suggest a recombinational mechanism for adaptive mutation that functions through polymerase errors that persist as a result of a deficiency in post-synthesis mismatch repair."
https://openalex.org/W2080935166,"A tendency for exons to correspond to discrete units of protein structure in protein-coding genes of ancient origin would provide clear evidence in favor of the exon theory of genes, which proposes that split genes arose not by insertion of introns into unsplit genes, but from combinations of primordial mini-genes (exons) separated by spacers (introns). Although putative examples of such correspondence have strongly influenced previous debate on the origin of introns, a general correspondence has not been rigorously proved. Objective methods for detecting correspondences were developed and applied to four examples that have been cited previously as evidence of the exon theory of genes. No significant correspondence between exons and units of protein structure was detected, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable."
https://openalex.org/W1563363363,"The main pathway for the fermentation of maltose or cellobiose by the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus was investigated by in vivo NMR and by enzyme measurements. Addition of [1-13C]glucose to cell suspensions resulted in the formation of C2-labeled acetate and C3-labeled alanine. No label was recovered in CO2 or HCO3-. In the presence of [3-13C]glucose, the label ended up in the C1 atom of alanine and in HCO3- and CO2. These labeling patterns indicate that glucose is converted along an Embden-Meyerhof pathway, and they disagree with the previously proposed nonphosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff pathway (pyroglycolysis). The NMR data were supported by enzyme measurements. Hexokinase (8.7 units/mg), phosphoglucose isomerase (6.8 units/mg), phosphofructokinase (0.81 unit/mg), and aldolase (0.26 unit/mg) were present in cell-free extracts (specific activities at 90 degrees C). Remarkably, the two kinases required ADP as the phosphoryl group donor instead of ATP. No activity was found with pyrophosphate. These are the first descriptions of ADP-dependent (AMP-forming) kinases to date. Since P. furiosus is a phylogenetically ancient organism, these enzymes may represent an ancestral kind of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1509097602,"The sodium channel from adult rat brain consists of a high molecular weight alpha subunit associated with low molecular weight subunits termed beta 1 and beta 2. Coexpression of beta 1 accelerates the macroscopic kinetics of inactivation of adult rat brain IIA, embryonic rat brain III, and rat skeletal muscle SkM1 sodium channel alpha subunits. In addition, beta 1 accelerates the kinetics of activation, as observed with a non-inactivating rat brain IIA mutant. Analysis of the effects of beta 1 on the slowly inactivating brain III alpha subunit shows that both of these effects may be the result of changes in the modal gating behavior of the sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Although the adult rat brain beta 1 subunit modulates the functional properties of rat skeletal muscle and embryonic brain III sodium channel alpha subunits, mRNA hybridizing to a beta 1 subunit cDNA probe was only faintly detected in RNA from adult skeletal muscle and not at all in RNA from embryonic brains. These results indicate that the adult rat brain beta 1 subunit can modify the modal gating properties of sodium channel alpha subunits with which it is not normally associated, suggesting the presence of conserved domains for interactions between the different alpha and beta 1 subunits of the sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1499823457,"Complementary DNAs encoding rat kidney chloride channels (ClC-K2L and ClC-K2S) were isolated by a polymerase chain reaction cloning strategy. Degenerate primers were designed based on the significant amino acid identity of the previously cloned chloride channels (ClC-0, -1, -2, and -K1). The 687-amino acid protein encoded by ClC-K2L is about 80% identical to rat ClC-K1 and about 40% identical to ClC-0, -1, and -2. ClC-K2S encodes a 632-amino acid protein in which 55 amino acids containing the putative second membrane-spanning domain of ClC-K2L are deleted. Chloride currents induced by both clones were very similar in terms of inhibitor sensitivity and anion selectivity (Br- > I- > Cl- >> cyclamate-). Northern blot with total ClC-K2L as a probe under high stringency revealed its message predominantly in kidney, especially in the outer and inner medulla. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique using microdissected nephron segments revealed that the main site of expression of both clones in kidney was the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and collecting ducts, where the existence of a variety of chloride channels and their importance for maintaining body fluid homeostasis have been demonstrated. These results suggest that ClC-K2L and -K2S are chloride channels in the thick ascending limb and collecting ducts and may be important routes for transcellular chloride transport like ClC-K1."
https://openalex.org/W1586115077,"The subcellular trafficking of GLUT4 in isolated rat adipose cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes exhibits many of the properties observed in regulated secretory processes and neurosecretion. GLUT4 is sorted and sequestered from endosomes into a specialized secretory compartment in the basal state and the initial stimulation of its exocytosis by insulin is more rapid than its recycling through the endosomes and secretory compartment during the steady-state response to insulin. We present a mathematical analysis which shows that this behavior is inconsistent with a simple 2-pool model with one plasma membrane and one intracellular compartment, but that a 3-pool model, with two intracellular compartments, can simulate these properties. We extend this model to include the presence of occluded pools in the plasma membrane. Our analysis compares the behavior expected when these occluded pools are precursors in stimulation and/or clathrin-associated-like intermediates in endocytosis. The presence of a precursor occluded pool can account for a lag between the appearance of GLUT4 in the membrane and before the full stimulation of glucose transport activity. The analysis also shows that since the pool size of the occluded GLUT4 is relatively small, the formation of endocytic occluded intermediates such as GLUT4 in clathrin-coated pits is likely to be slow compared with the rate of endocytosis of the coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2092793802,"Female mice form an olfactory memory of male pheromones at mating; exposure to the pheromones of a strange male after that mating will block pregnancy. The formation of this memory is mediated by the accessory olfactory system, in which an increase in norepinephrine after mating reduces inhibitory transmission of Î³-aminobutyric acid from the granule cells to the mitral cells. This study shows that the activation of mGluR2, a metabotropic glutamate receptor that suppresses the Î³-aminobutyric acid inhibition of the mitral cells, permits the formation of a specific olfactory memory without the occurrence of mating by infusion of mGluR2 agonists into the female's accessory olfactory bulb. This memory faithfully reflects the memory formed at mating."
https://openalex.org/W1993000462,"CENP-E is a kinesin-like protein that is transiently bound to kinetochores during early mitosis, becomes redistributed to the spindle midzone at anaphase, and is degraded after cytokinesis. At anaphase, CENP-E may cross-link the interdigitating microtubules in the spindle midzone through a motor-like binding site at the amino terminus and a 99-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain that bound microtubules in a distinct manner. Phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus by the mitotic kinase maturation promoting factor (MPF) inhibited microtubule-binding activity before anaphase. Thus, MPF suppresses the microtubule cross-linking activity of CENP-E until anaphase, when its activity is lost."
https://openalex.org/W1534320734,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) stimulate similar cellular responses. TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta are known to initiate signaling through a pathway involving hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide (Kolesnick, R. N., and Golde, D. W. (1994) Cell 77, 325-328). In this system, ceramide acts as a second messenger stimulating a ceramide-activated serine/threonine protein kinase. The present studies demonstrate that LPS, like TNF and IL-1, stimulates ceramide-activated protein kinase activity in human leukemia (HL-60) cells and in freshly isolated human neutrophils. Lipid A, the biologically active core of LPS, enhanced kinase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. As little as 10 nM lipid A was effective, and a maximal effect occurred with 500 nM lipid A, increasing kinase activity 5-fold. Native LPS similarly induced kinase activation. This effect of LPS was markedly enhanced by LPS binding protein and required the LPS receptor CD14. In contrast to TNF and IL-1, LPS did not cause sphingomyelin hydrolysis and thus stimulates ceramide-activated protein kinase without generating ceramide. Molecular modeling showed strong structural similarity between ceramide and a region of lipid A. Based on these observations, we propose that LPS stimulates cells by mimicking the second messenger function of ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1515920608,"Abstract Recently, we found the occurrence of N-deglycosylating enzyme, peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase), in mammalian cells and observed that PNGase is a rather common enzyme involved in post-translational remodification of proteins (Suzuki, T., Seko, A., Kitajima, K., Inoue, Y., and Inoue, S. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 194, 1124-1130). We report here a 460-fold purification to homogeneity with 11.5% yield of PNGase from crude extract of C3H mouse-derived L-929 fibroblast cells. The purified enzyme, designated as L-929 PNGase, had the apparent molecular weight of 212,000 and was composed of two 105,000 subunits. Although this enzyme was capable of hydrolyzing structurally diverse natural glycopeptide substrates bearing high mannose, hybrid, and complex-type glycan units, the activity was completely inhibited by the presence of the fucose residue either alpha-1-->3- or alpha-1-->6-linked to the proximal GlcNAc residue. The enzyme showed maximal activity at pH near 7. This and the inability to act on glycoasparagine strongly support our view that this enzyme would not be involved in lysosomal degradation pathway. L-929 PNGase was characterized by having distinctly a low Km value, which may be of physiological significance. Possible wide occurrence of N-deglycosylation of glycoproteins was shown by a data bank survey of the protein sequences showing discrepancies between those determined directly (-D-X-(S/T)-) and those deduced from cDNA sequencing (-N-X-(S/T)-). We propose here that PNGase-catalyzed N-deglycosylation is a functionally important universal feature in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W1605278057,"L-Arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (transamidinase) is the first and rate-limiting step in creatine biosynthesis. Rats fed a creatine-supplemented diet or hypophysectomized rats have only 20% of the kidney transamidinase activity as intact rats fed a creatine-free diet. A cDNA clone corresponding to transamidinase was isolated by immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 expression library prepared from rat kidney mRNA. The transamidinase cDNA had an open reading frame containing the known sequence of the amino-terminal peptide of transamidinase. Based on the cDNA sequence, transamidinase is synthesized as a precursor with an amino-terminal extension of 50 amino acids, consistent with its mitochondrial localization. Comparison of the transamidinase sequence with the protein data base identified only a single, related protein. Remarkably, this protein, which has a 37% amino acid identity with transamidinase, is also an amidinotransferase, catalyzing streptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus. Transamidinase cDNA was used to investigate the regulation of mRNA levels by creatine and growth hormone. Hypophysectomized rats were fed a creatine-free or a creatine-supplemented diet and maintained with and without injections of growth hormone. An excellent correlation was found between changes in transamidinase activity and mRNA levels in response to creatine and growth hormone. Thus, the regulation of transamidinase by creatine and growth hormone is at a pretranslational level. In addition, the two effectors do not act independently but interact at a pretranslational level to control transamidinase gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2160558176,"We have found that human cells respond to treatment with an alkylating carcinogen by producing a specific, highly conserved array of poly(ADP-ribose) molecules. Using in situ radiolabeling and boronate affinity chromatography, we have been able to isolate ADP-ribose polymers from living cells and to quantify individual molecular size classes on high resolution polyacrylamide gels. Despite carcinogen-induced changes in poly(ADP-ribose) turnover, the relative frequency of linear polymers was strictly conserved. However, the abundance of branched polymers with high affinity for histones increased 2.6-fold. These polymers were degraded more slowly than linear polymers. Our results indicate that the poly(ADP-ribose) molecules involved in the shuttling of histones on DNA in vitro also play a role in the repair of DNA damage in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1519402321,"Bafilomycin A1 (Baf), a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar-type proton pump, inhibited the entry of Semliki Forest virus and vesicular stomatitis virus into BHK-21 cells. The inhibition occurred at concentrations that dissipated intracellular acidic compartments. Viral infection was totally inhibited by 30 nM Baf while endocytosis of the virus or fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was not affected. Thus, a vacuolar-type proton pump was responsible for acidification of the endosomes needed for virus entry. When the cells were exposed to 100 nM Baf after virus entry, viral glycoprotein synthesis continued normally. The viral glycoproteins acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H, indicating arrival in the medial Golgi apparatus. However, maturation processes occurring in the trans-Golgi compartment were inhibited, and the amounts of viral glycoproteins appearing at the cell surface were reduced. Double immunofluorescence studies showed that in the presence of Baf the viral glycoproteins were found in and around mannosidase II-positive Golgi structures. To analyze whether Baf blocked transport from the trans-Golgi compartment to the cell surface, the viral glycoproteins were allowed to accumulate in the trans-Golgi network by utilizing a 20 degrees C block. Subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C in the presence of Baf did not inhibit the terminal maturation processes or transport to the cell surface, suggesting that the block was before the trans-Golgi network. These results indicate that an active vacuolar-type proton pump in the Golgi apparatus is essential for protein transport in BHK-21 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1548015936,"Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 are structurally similar but functionally distinct transcription factors that bind to the positive regulatory domains I and III (PRDI/III) within the human IFN-beta promoter. To begin structure-function analysis of IRF-1 and IRF-2, the regulatory potential of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants was analyzed by co-transfection studies in human cells and was correlated with DNA binding capacity. Transcriptional repression by IRF-2 was contained within the first 125 amino-terminal amino acids and correlated directly with IRF-2 DNA binding; deletion to a protein of 100 amino acids resulted in loss of repression and IRF-2 DNA binding. Thus, the carboxyl terminus appears dispensible for trans-repression. Hybrid constructs which fuse the DNA binding domain of IRF-1 and IRF-2 to the trans-activation domain of NF-kappa B p65 were also generated; both IRF-1/p65 and IRF-2/p65 chimeras were strong transcriptional activators. IRF-2-mediated repression was also dominant over trans-activation by these fusion proteins. The trans-activation region of IRF-1 resides in the carboxyl terminus, primarily carboxyl-terminal to amino acid 250. Mutation of three potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites within the IRF carboxyl terminus failed to identify an essential site that contributes to IRF-1 trans-activation potential."
https://openalex.org/W1513525284,"Previously, we characterized the prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha receptor linked to phospholipase C activation and DNA synthesis in NIH-3T3 cells (Nakao, A., Watanabe, T., Taniguchi, S., Nakamura, M., Honda, Z-I., Shimizu, T., and Kurokawa, K. (1993) J. Cell. Physiol. 155, 257-264). To elucidate intracellular events evoked via this receptor, we examined changes caused by PGF2 alpha stimulation in the phosphotyrosine composition of cellular proteins. The addition of PGF2 alpha to cells in quiescent culture rapidly increased the levels of phosphotyrosine in cellular proteins with Mr values of 70,000 (pp70), 85,000 (pp85), 92,000 (pp92), 100,000 (pp100), and 125,000 (pp125); the latter was immunologically identified as p125 focal adhesion kinase. The PGF2 alpha-induced changes in the level of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) elevation, formation of inositol phosphates, and [3H]thymidine incorporation followed a similar dose dependence as PGF2 alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. This tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of extracellular Ca2+, while a [Ca2+]i chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (50 microM), completely inhibited the PGF2 alpha-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i, tyrosine phosphorylation, and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Ionomycin (0.1 microM), which induced [Ca2+]i elevation without formation of inositol phosphates, mimicked the PGF2 alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner but had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation. The PGF2 alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation could be observed even in the cells pretreated with TPA (5 microM, 24 h). PGF2 alpha exhibited an additive effect on TPA-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation but had no effect on the 32P-phosphorylation of a known 80-kDa protein kinase (PK) C substrate. Both staurosporine and H-7 inhibited the PGF2 alpha-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and tyrosine phosphorylation in a similar dose-dependent manner whether or not cells were pretreated with TPA (5 microM, 24 h). However, W-7 and KN-62 had no effect on these cellular responses even at the concentration for the almost complete inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PKs (20 microM). These results, taken together, indicate that PGF2 alpha receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is evoked by a [Ca2+]i-dependent mechanism that is sensitive to staurosporine and H-7 but which is independent of PKC or Ca2+/calmodulin PKs. Finally, the data suggest that this PGF2 alpha-induced signaling pathway is linked to the proliferation of cells."

Charge recombination assayed by thermoluminescence measurements indicated similar RCII properties in control and mutant cells. The D1 protein is not degraded in the mutants during photoinactivation; however, RCII-D1 is irreversibly altered, and the protein is degraded when the cells are incubated in low light permitting slow reoxidation of the PQH2 pool. Photoinactivation precedes D1 degradation also in the control cells. Thus, in vivo under physiological conditions photoinactivation and tagging of RCII-D1 are resolved from the degradation process. RCII activity in photoinactivated cells may be recovered only following D1 degradation and replacement. Recovery may occur either in the light or dark in the absence of de novo chlorophyll synthesis. The degradation of the photoinactivated RCII-D1 protein is a prerequisite for the synthesis and stable integration of new D1 indicating that tagged D1 is still assembled in the inactive reaction centers. The physiological implication of these results is that oxidation of the PQH2 pool in photoinactivated cells affects RCII-D1 protein degradation and replacement, and, thus, D1 turnover in vivo is regulated by the turnover of PQ at the binding site of the secondary stable electron acceptor quinone of RCII."
https://openalex.org/W1542486750,"Methionine was a substrate for cDNA-expressed rabbit flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) 1, FMO2, and FMO3, while incubations with membrane fractions containing cDNA-expressed FMO5 did not lead to the detection of methionine sulfoxide; Km values with FMO1, FMO2, and FMO3 were about 48.0, 30.0, and 6.5 mM, respectively. With FMO3 methionine d-sulfoxide was formed in nearly 8-fold higher concentrations than the l-diastereomer, whereas with FMO1 and FMO2, the d:l diastereomeric ratios were approximately 1.5:1 and 0.7:1, respectively. These results provide evidence for methionine being the first identified endogenous compound metabolized to diastereomeric sulfoxides by flavin-containing monooxygenases. The Km values for methionine sulfoxidation in rabbit liver and kidney microsomes (3.7 and 6.0 mM, respectively) were more comparable to the Km value obtained with FMO3 than FMO1 or FMO2. This result provides evidence that FMO3 is the major FMO isoform involved in methionine sulfoxidation in rabbit liver and kidney microsomes. Further evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that methionine d-sulfoxide was also the preferred product in rabbit liver and kidney microsomes by nearly 8:1 and 6:1 over the l-diastereomer, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1597776583,"The 5' regulatory region and putative signal sequence of a rice alpha-amylase gene, alpha Amy8, was fused to a bacterial gene encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and introduced into rice, tobacco, and potato via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation systems. Expression of this chimeric gene in suspension cells of transgenic plants was suppressed by the presence of sucrose in the medium and induced by its absence. Induction or suppression of GUS expression in transgenic rice could be reversed by the deprivation or replenishment, respectively, of sucrose in the medium. The expressed GUS fusion protein was translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, modified by glycosylation, and secreted into the culture medium of transgenic cells. In the presence of a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, the enzymatically active form of GUS was assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum. The yield of GUS secreted by transgenic cells was estimated to be as high as 40% of total secreted proteins. The reversible induction of the alpha-amylase promoter in culture cells by sugar level in the medium provides an excellent inducible expression system for basic research in plant science. Combination of the alpha-amylase promoter and signal sequence also offers a novel approach for large scale production of low cost, easily purified, secreted recombinant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1547625123,"Our previous studies have shown that human monocytes can oxidize native low density lipoprotein (LDL) and transform it to a cytotoxin. We also found that intracellular Ca2+ levels are integrally involved in lipid oxidation of LDL by activated monocytes. In these studies, we investigated the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway for its contribution to the process of monocyte oxidation of LDL lipids. We found substantial protein phosphorylation induced upon monocyte activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKC activity with the PKC inhibitors H-7 (1-100 microM), calphostin C (1-10 microM), and GF109203X (0.1-10 microM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular protein phosphorylation, including that of several previously identified PKC substrates. These inhibitors of PKC activity also substantially inhibited LDL lipid oxidation by activated monocytes. This inhibition was correlated with a profound suppression of superoxide anion production by these cells. In contrast, inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity altered neither monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation nor O2- production by activated monocytes. Delaying the addition of PKC inhibitors until after the peak production of O2-, which occurs during the respiratory burst, still resulted in inhibition of LDL lipid oxidation, suggesting roles for PKC in both early and late events. To corroborate these findings using other approaches, we used phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to down-regulate PKC activity and also used antisense oligonucleotides as specific PKC inhibitors. Results of both types of studies support the conclusion that PKC activity is required for activated monocytes to oxidize LDL lipids. Thus, PKC activation in this system is essential, one critical pathway regulated by PKC activity is the production of O2-, and continued PKC activity is required for optimal oxidation of LDL lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1655303384,"The kappa B enhancer element regulates expression of many genes involved in immune responses and other processes. kappa B motif binds a number of proteins, some but not all, are related to the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors. We have previously identified a 65-kDa phosphoprotein that is specifically recognized by the kappa B motif (Ostrowski, J., Sims, J. E., Sibley, C. H., Valentine, M. A., Dower, S. K., Meier, K. E., and Bomsztyk, K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12722-12733). This protein is closely associated with a serine/threonine kinase that is responsive to treatment of cells with interleukin-1 and other agents. We report here purification, cloning, and expression of this kappa B motif-binding phosphoprotein. The primary structure deduced from the isolated murine cDNA, identifies the protein as the homolog of the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K protein. Antipeptide antibodies and expression of the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli, demonstrated that the K protein is the authentic phosphoprotein that binds the kappa B motif in vitro. We also demonstrate that the in vitro phosphorylation of the natural and the recombinant K proteins by the associated kinase is stimulated by the kappa B motif."
https://openalex.org/W1555536578,"Identification of annexin VI-binding proteins is essential to elucidate the physiological functions of annexin VI. Here, we developed the methods to identify an annexin VI-binding protein and characterized the binding. Annexin VI bound to about 14 species of proteins in the whole homogenate of rat forebrain, when examined with 125I-annexin VI using blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The binding was Ca(2+)-dependent and specific for phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid. A line of evidence indicates that the binding of annexin VI to its target proteins is a protein-protein interaction. One of annexin VI-binding proteins with M(r) 240,000 was enriched in the cytoskeletal fraction and was identified as calspectin (brain spectrin or fodrin). When the binding was examined with purified calspectin in the native state, the Ca2+ affinity (KCa) was 7.6 microM, and the affinity for annexin VI (Kd) was 68 nM. Annexin VI bound to beta subunit of calspectin, but not to alpha subunit. The binding site was localized to the NH2-terminal domain of beta subunit, which contains an actin-binding site and exhibits striking homology with the NH2-terminal regions of dystrophin and alpha-actinin. When the effect of annexin VI on the interaction between F-actin and calspectin was examined by low shear viscometry, annexin VI inhibited the F-actin cross-linking activity of calspectin in a Ca2+/PS-dependent manner. Cosedimentation assay showed that annexin VI dissociates calspectin from F-actin in the presence of Ca2+ and PS. These results suggest that annexin VI can dissociate and redistribute calspectin in a Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent manner under the plasma membrane and that annexin VI may be involved in the regulation of the membrane skeleton of neuronal cells in response to Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1528401050,"The breakpoint cluster region gene product (Bcr) is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for members of the Rho family, Cdc42Hs, and Rac1, as is the brain protein n-chimaerin. At least 15 proteins have sequence identity to the GAP domain (150 amino acid residues) of Bcr. The widespread occurrence of proteins that possess sequence identity to the Bcr-related GAP domain makes it especially important to understand its structure/function relationships. Amino acid sequence alignment of these proteins reveals three blocks of conservation in the GAP domain. Here, we present a mutational analysis of this domain using n-chimaerin sequences. Ten mutations were constructed (at least two in each of the blocks of conservation), expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and purified. Seven of the mutants, including deletions, still possessed GAP activity for Rac1. Three of the mutants had no Rac1-GAP activity but were still able to bind Rac1. IC50 values obtained from competition experiments suggest that n-chimaerin and the mutants with no GAP activity bound Rac1 with similar apparent binding constants. Thus, this mutant analysis allows discrimination between Rac1-binding and Rac1 GTPase- activating residues."
https://openalex.org/W1516092312,"We have previously described procedures for the isolation of potential nuclear pore complex proteins (nucleoporins or Nups) from rat liver nuclear envelopes and their subsequent subfractionation into those binding to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and those that do not. One of these non-WGA-reactive proteins, termed Nup155, was previously molecularly cloned and sequenced and by immunoelectron microscopy shown to be a bona fide nucleoporin. Here we have characterized a second protein of the non-WGA-reactive type and show that it is a Nup as well. Molecular cloning and sequencing revealed that the protein has a calculated molecular mass of 107.2 kDa. It is, therefore, termed Nup107 (for nucleoporin of 107 kDa). Like other Nups that have so far been analyzed, Nup107 contains an abundance of kinase consensus sites. However, the primary structure of Nup107 is unique and not similar to other proteins in the data banks. Its most striking feature is a leucine zipper in its carboxyl-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1579361634,"The role of two distinct kappa B sequence motifs found in the promotor of the murine IP-10 gene was studied in the transcriptional response of macrophages to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). When the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was stimulated with LPS, at least three different kappa B sequence-specific complex-forming activities were observed in nuclear extracts as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). These three complexes were distinguished from one another in terms of time of appearance following stimulation and selectivity for one of the two different kappa B sequence motifs. The participation of individual members of the Rel homology family of kappa B sequence binding factors was assessed by use of specific antibodies in combination with either EMSA or UV-cross-linking to radiolabeled, BrdUrd-substituted oligonucleotide probes. The C1 complex contained predominantly NF kappa B1 (p50). The C2 complex contained NF kappa B1, RelA (p65), and perhaps other factors. The C3 complex contained predominantly c-Rel. Both kappa B sequences were able to mediate reporter gene transcription in LPS-stimulated macrophages, but the sites behaved differentially in cells co-transfected with expression vectors encoding different members of the Rel homology family. The results indicate that LPS activates several different forms of kappa B binding activity in murine macrophages which are composed of at least three different members of the Rel homology family. These binding activities exhibit differential recognition of and functional activation through the two distinct kappa B sequence motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1570563769,"Osteoclast, the bone-resorbing cell, is formed from hematopoietic precursors via cell-cell fusion. To evaluate the possibility that under certain specific conditions mannose residues may be expressed on the mammalian cell surface, we examined the action of pradimicin derivatives, which bind specific sugars such as the mannose residue, on the formation of osteoclast induced in the coculture of mouse spleen cells with mouse stromal cells, a process in which cell-cell fusion is involved. Osteoclast formation was inhibited by treatment of this coculture system with pradimicin at the later stage (day 4-7), and this inhibition was specifically abrogated by mannose-rich yeast mannan. During the 8-day cocultivation, osteoclast formation was blocked by the pradimicin on days 6 and 7, when mononuclear preosteoclasts fused into multinucleated osteoclasts. With an interactive laser cytometer ACAS570, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled pradimicin was observed to bind osteoclast progenitors at the fusion stage and to have no binding affinity for osteoclast progenitors at the early stage (day 0-3) or for osteoclasts, which were formed after performing fusion between mononuclear preosteoclasts. These results suggest that mannose residues were expressed on outer membranes of monocytes under pathophysiological conditions and that they were involved in the osteoclast formation via cellular membrane fusion events."
https://openalex.org/W1547788546,"The yeast BAS1 protein is a transcriptional activator with an amino-terminal domain homologous to the DNA-binding domain of the oncoprotein Myb containing three imperfect tryptophan-rich repeats. In contrast to Myb-related transcription factors from higher eukaryotes, where the second and third repeat constitutes a minimal independent DNA-binding domain, all three repeats of BAS1 were found to be necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding. Moreover, an active DNA-binding subdomain was obtained only if the first repeat was enlarged in the amino-terminal direction to include 3 tryptophans and a 23-amino acid insertion and if 55 amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the third repeat were included. The BAS1 DNA-binding site was analyzed in detail and found to cover 8-9 base pairs with no similarity to the Myb recognition element. The binding site included a conserved hexameric TGACTC motif, the methylation of which abolished BAS1 binding, as well as a 3-base pair extension that seemed to have a modulatory effect on BAS1 affinity and where binding was less affected by methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1552588883,"Diphtheria toxin consists of two parts, fragments A and B. Fragment A has enzymatic activity inhibiting protein synthesis. Fragment B binds to cellular receptors and, upon exposure to low pH, inserts into the membrane, forms cation-selective channels, and facilitates translocation of fragment A. Previous data have suggested that the N-terminal part of fragment B, including the amphipathic alpha-helix TH1, plays an active role during translocation of fragment A (Madshus, I. H., Wiedlocha, A., and Sandvig, K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4648-4652). When replacing charged residues in TH1 with uncharged amino acids, translocation of fragment A was strongly inhibited, virtually without affecting binding of the toxin or channel activity. These data suggest that TH1 may act as a targeting/anchoring sequence. In a mutant with eight positive charges and one negative charge in TH1, increased specific binding was observed, even if TH1 was outside the toxin's binding domain. This suggests that TH1 could be important in binding to parts of the translocation machinery. Fragment A associated with this mutant fragment B was translocated 10-fold more efficiently than wild-type toxin. The fact that this mutant TH1 efficiently promoted translocation, while, a hydrophobic TH1 did not, suggests that TH1 does not interact with the hydrophobic part of the membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1563436601,"The Arabidopsis Atpk1 protein expressed in insect cells and plant cells exhibited multiple sizes consisting mainly of two doublets: p70 (68 and 70 kDa) and p85 (82 and 85 kDa). Extraction of p85 from cells required the presence of SDS, suggesting that p85 is associated with less soluble subcellular components. p70 was extracted by nonionic detergent without SDS, indicating that this form is cytoplasmic. p70 expressed in either Arabidopsis or insect cells underwent serine-specific autophosphorylation, indicating that Atpk1 is a protein-serine kinase. A point mutation (lysine 163 to arginine) in the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain substantially diminished activity when expressed in insect cells. A 14-kDa protein (p14) was co-immunoprecipitated with p70 from insect cells expressing wild-type Atpk1 and was phosphorylated in immune complex kinase assays with Atpk1, suggesting it is a homolog of a natural substrate of Atpk1. Two plant ribosomal proteins (14 and 16 kDa) can be phosphorylated by the Atpk1 protein kinase, and we propose that Atpk1 is a novel ribosomal protein kinase. A 60-kDa form of Atpk1 derived from the insect cell-expressed p70 was more highly phosphorylated than p70 in in vitro kinase assays, suggesting a negative regulatory domain can be removed by proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1501425607,"The localization of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B chain and the regulation of its release by thrombin were investigated in bovine aortic endothelial cells stably transfected with the cDNA for human PDGF B chain (c-sis). Northern blot analysis of c-sis transfected cells revealed increased expression of PDGF B mRNA and constitutive release of 5-10-fold greater amounts of PDGF than in control cells. Incubation with bovine alpha-thrombin further induced PDGF release into the conditioned medium. Metabolic labeling of bovine aortic endothelial cells overexpressing c-sis revealed an inefficient rate of constitutive PDGF release, with the majority of newly synthesized PDGF remaining extracellular matrix-associated. Thrombin treatment, however, led to a dramatic increase in the amount of PDGF released into the medium due to selective proteolytic cleavage of matrix-associated precursors. Incubation with a synthetic peptide representing residues 212-230 of precursor PDGF B chain, previously shown to induce the release of PDGF from cell- or matrix-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, led to the release of slightly larger species of PDGF which were susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by thrombin in vitro. In addition, PDGF precursors immunoprecipitated from cells were also cleaved by thrombin in vitro. We have demonstrated, using normal diploid endothelial cells overexpressing c-sis, that PDGF B chain is stably expressed as a matrix-associated protein which is either inefficiently released into the medium or cleaved by paracrine proteases such as thrombin. Modulation of PDGF release by selective cleavage of preformed, matrix-bound precursors may represent a significant mechanism for acute regulation of release of this growth factor independent of changes in the rate of synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1529654500,"A simple system for high yield expression of the neurospora plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase is described. Two neurospora H(+)-ATPase cDNAs differing only in a few bases preceding the coding region were cloned into a high copy number yeast expression vector under the control of the constitutive promoter of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, and the resulting plasmids were used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RS-72, which requires a plasmid-borne functional plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase for growth in glucose medium (Villalba, J. M., Palmgren, M. G., Berberian, G. E., Ferguson, C., and Serrano, R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12341-12349. Both plasmids supported growth of the cells, indicating that the neurospora ATPase is expressed in functional form in yeast. Western blots of membranes from the transformants confirmed that the neurospora ATPase is expressed in the yeast cells, with production in the range of several percent of the yeast membrane protein. Importantly, when the expressed, recombinant neurospora ATPase molecules are solubilized from the membranes with lysolecithin and subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation, they migrate to a position indistinguishable from that of the native ATPase and display a comparable specific ATPase activity, indicating that the great majority of the recombinant neurospora ATPase molecules produced in yeast fold in a natural manner. This expression system thus appears to be ideal for site-directed mutagenesis studies of the neurospora ATPase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1507470155,"Abstract 3',3,5',5-Tetraiodophenolsulfonephthalein (I4PSP) stimulated both Ca2+ transient levels and aggregation in response to thrombin in platelets. Ca2+ uptake into skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was inhibited by I4PSP (IC50, 1.8 microM) whereas that of red blood cell ghosts was not affected by it. Furthermore, I4PSP inhibited the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity (IC50, 1.1 microM). Kinetic analysis of the inhibitory effects of I4PSP reveals that I4PSP shows an inhibition of noncompetitive and competitive type with respect to low and high concentrations of ATP, respectively. The mode of inhibition by I4PSP is an uncompetitive type with respect to Ca2+. I4PSP decreased the decomposition rate of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate (EP). The change in the tryptophan fluorescence of SR Ca(2+)-ATPase induced by ATP was reduced by I4PSP indicating inhibition of the EP transition from Ca2E1P to E2P. The concentration-inhibitory response curves for I4PSP in Ca(2+)-ATPase activities and fluorescence changes were closely correlated. These results suggest that I4PSP slows down the structure transition from Ca2E1P to E2P, resulting in inhibition of the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the stimulation of Ca2+ transient levels in platelets and their aggregation in response to thrombin are due to the inhibition of Ca2+ pump in intracellular Ca2+ stores by I4PSP."
