https://openalex.org/W2016384173,"α-Synuclein plays a major role in Parkinson disease. Unraveling the mechanisms of α-synuclein aggregation is essential to understand the formation of Lewy bodies and their involvement in dopaminergic cell death. α-Synuclein is ubiquitylated in Lewy bodies, but the role of α-synuclein ubiquitylation has been mysterious. We now report that the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) directly interacts with and monoubiquitylates α-synuclein and promotes its aggregation in vitro and in vivo, which is toxic to cells. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates that SIAH monoubiquitylates α-synuclein at lysines 12, 21, and 23, which were previously shown to be ubiquitylated in Lewy bodies. SIAH ubiquitylates lysines 10, 34, 43, and 96 as well. Suppression of SIAH expression by short hairpin RNA to SIAH-1 and SIAH-2 abolished α-synuclein monoubiquitylation in dopaminergic cells, indicating that endogenous SIAH ubiquitylates α-synuclein. Moreover, SIAH co-immunoprecipitated with α-synuclein from brain extracts. Inhibition of proteasomal, lysosomal, and autophagic pathways, as well as overexpression of a ubiquitin mutant less prone to deubiquitylation, G76A, increased monoubiquitylation of α-synuclein by SIAH. Monoubiquitylation increased the aggregation of α-synuclein in vitro. At the electron microscopy level, monoubiquitylated α-synuclein promoted the formation of massive amounts of amorphous aggregates. Monoubiquitylation also increased α-synuclein aggregation in vivo as observed by increased formation of α-synuclein inclusion bodies within dopaminergic cells. These inclusions are toxic to cells, and their formation was prevented when endogenous SIAH expression was suppressed. Our data suggest that monoubiquitylation represents a possible trigger event for α-synuclein aggregation and Lewy body formation. α-Synuclein plays a major role in Parkinson disease.

The majority of PD cases are sporadic, but mutations in different genes have been found to be responsible for familial PD (1Moore D.J. West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Annu. Rev.

Neurol. 2006; 60: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is believed to play a crucial role in the disease because it is mutated in some familial forms of the disease, and it is a major component of Lewy bodies in sporadic PD (3Spillantini M.G.

Three missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene, leading to A53T, A30P, and E46K substitutions at the protein level, have been described so far (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E.

Duplication and triplication of the α-synuclein gene were also shown to cause disease, suggesting that increase in the levels of α-synuclein can be pathogenic (8Singleton A.B. Farrer M. Johnson J. Singleton A. Hague S. Kachergus J. Hulihan M. Peuralinna T. Dutra A. Nussbaum R. Lincoln S. Crawley A. Hanson M. Maraganore D. Adler C. Cookson M.R. Muenter M. Baptista M. Miller D. Blancato J.

In agreement, mouse models overexpressing α-synuclein revealed a correlation between α-synuclein accumulation and neuronal dysfunction (11Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q.

Drosophila models also recapitulate some features of the disease, such as aggregation of α-synuclein and death of dopaminergic neurons (14Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 15Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the absence of classical Lewy bodies in some live models suggests that specific α-synuclein modifications may be involved in its efficient aggregation. The role of α-synuclein in the formation of Lewy bodies is based on its ability to aggregate and to assemble into fibrils in vitro (16Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Also, A53T and E46K mutations accelerate the α-synuclein fibrillization process (16Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 17Greenbaum E.A. Graves C.L. Mishizen-Eberz A.J. Lupoli M.A. Lynch D.R. Englander S.W. Axelsen P.H. Giasson B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7800-7807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), suggesting that α-synuclein fibrillization may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Oligomerization of α-synuclein may also play a role in the disease because oligomerization, and not fibrillization, is common to all α-synuclein disease mutants (18Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms that trigger α-synuclein aggregation will provide the basis to better understand the disease and may help determine which α-synuclein-aggregated form is responsible to promote dopaminergic cell death. A possible dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been proposed to play a role in PD. The proteasome activity was found to be decreased in the substantia nigra of PD patients (19McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Also, Parkin and UCH-L1, which are components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, are mutated in familial forms of PD (20Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4166) Google Scholar, 21Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J.

In addition, different proteins involved in PD, such as Parkin, synphilin-1, UCH-L1 and PINK1, were shown to form inclusions when they are not properly degraded by the proteasome (22Liani E. Eyal A.

Ubiquitylation of α-synuclein has potentially important implications for its normal and pathological functions. α-Synuclein purified from Lewy bodies was found to be monoubiquitylated (28Hasegawa M.

Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), whereas UCH-L1 was shown to polyubiquitylate α-synuclein in vitro (32Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Recently, α-synuclein was shown to be monoubiquitylated by an unidentified E3 ubiquitin-ligase in HEK293 cells (33Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the role of α-synuclein ubiquitylation has been mysterious. Here we investigate the identity of the endogenous E3 ubiquitin-ligase for α-synuclein monoubiquitylation and its role in modulating α-synuclein aggregation. We present evidence that SIAH interacts with and monoubiquitylates α-synuclein in vivo. Also, we found in vivo and in vitro evidence that monoubiquitylated α-synuclein is more prone to aggregation. Our data indicate that monoubiquitylation of α-synuclein by SIAH plays an important role in α-synuclein aggregation and may contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. MaterialsUbiquitin aldehyde, purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme, UbcH5b, lactacystin, and 3-MA were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed MutagenesisFull-length α-synuclein constructs mutated at lysine residues identified by mass spectrometry were generated by PCR using primers that contained arginine codons instead of lysine codons. Mutations of relevant lysines were confirmed by double strand sequencing. Cell Culture and TransfectionsSH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transiently transfected with N-terminally tagged pRK5 and pFLAG-CMV-2 plasmids utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and processed after 36 h. For experiments using shRNA, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with shRNA sequences cloned into pSuper vector (34Yu J.Y. DeRuiter S.L. Turner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 and processed after 72 h. The shRNA sequences to suppress SIAH-1 and SIAH-2 expression, as well as to control shRNA, were described elsewhere (35Hara M.R. Agrawal N. Kim S.F. Cascio M.B. Fujimuro M. Ozeki Y. Takahashi M.

Western Blot AnalysisSamples were homogenized as described (22Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with antibodies mouse anti-HA (Covance), mouse anti-Myc (Oncogene), mouse anti-α-synuclein (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-α-synuclein (Sigma), rabbit anti-Myc, rabbit anti-HA, goat anti-SIAH-1, goat anti-SIAH-2, goat anti-SIAH-1/2, and mouse anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Endogenous Co-immunoprecipitation AssaysRat brains were homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Chaps, 30 μm MG132, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Brain homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Antibodies to SIAH-1/2 or SIAH-1 (H-18 and N-15, respectively) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were coupled to protein G beads (22Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and incubated for 7 h with brain homogenate (2 mg/ml). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and detected by Western blot using mouse anti-α-synuclein (BD Biosciences). In Vitro Ubiquitylation AssaysFor the in vitro ubiquitylation assays, His-α-synuclein was purified from bacteria using TALON beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Recombinant α-synuclein was incubated in reaction medium containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATPγS, 7.5 μg of ubiquitin, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 100 ng of ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and 200 ng of UbcH5b, in the presence or absence of 500 ng of SIAH-2. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and ubiquitylated α-synuclein was determined by Western blot using α-synuclein antibody. In Vitro Aggregation AssaysThe in vitro aggregation experiments were carried out after the in vitro ubiquitylation assays. To stop the in vitro ubiquitylation of α-synuclein, the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. To promote α-synuclein aggregation, the samples were further incubated at 65 °C for different time points as described previously (36Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein aggregation was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-α-synuclein antibody. Transmission Electron MicroscopyIn vitro ubiquitylated and aggregated samples were added over 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grids and counterstained with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were analyzed and photographed with JEOL JEM 100 SX electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Mass SpectrometryFifty combined reactions of in vitro His-α-synuclein ubiquitylation assays were carried out as above in a volume of 300 μl. His-α-synuclein was then pulled down with TALON beads in buffer containing 30 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm imidazole, 6 m urea, and 1% Triton X-100. The beads were extensively washed in pulldown buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Samples were run on 11% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and protein bands were excised and destained using multiple washings with 50% acetonitrile in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The protein bands were subsequently reduced, alkylated, and in-gel digested with bovine trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) at a concentration of 12.5 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C as described (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1966; 68: 850-858Crossref Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). An extracted peptide solution was dried for subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometric analyses (MS). Aliquots of the extracted peptide mixture, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or a mixture of formic acid/isopropyl alcohol/H2O (1:3:2 v/v), were used for MALDI-MS using either fast evaporation (38Vorm O.

Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) methods. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and/or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were used as matrices for analysis. Sample purification and preparation for ESI-MS were performed as described previously (41Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Microcolumns were prepared with Poros R2 reverse phase material (Perseptive Biosystem, Framingham, MA). Peptides were eluted with 60% methanol, 5% formic acid directly into a nano-electrospray capillary. Peptides were subjected to nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS (nano-liquid chromatography-ESI-MS/MS). Peptide Mass Mapping by MALDI-TOF/MS, Nano-ESI-MS/MS, and Nano-LC-MS/MSMass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Bruker Reflex III™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, a reflector, and a 337 nm nitrogen laser, and on API QSTAR Pulsari electrospray-quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometer (MDS-Sciex) equipped with a nano-electrospray source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS for protein identification was carried out with a nano-liquid chromatography system incorporating UltiMate™ Capillary/Nano LC System, consisting of Famos™ Micro Autosampler, Switchos™ Micro Column Switching Module (LC Packings, Dionex) on line with API Q-STAR Pulsari electrospray-quadrupole TOF. A C18 nanocolumn inner diameter 75 μm, length 15 mm, particle size 5 μm (LC Packings, Dionex) was used. The flow rate through the column was 150 nl/min. A methanol/acetonitrile gradient was employed with a mobile phase containing 0.1 and 2% formic acid in buffers A and B, respectively. The gradient used was 5–50% acetonitrile over 45 min. The injection volume was 5 μl. In the nano-electrospray ionization source, the end of the capillary from the nano-LC column was connected to the emitter with pico-tip silica tubing, inner diameter 20 μm (New Objective) by stainless steel union, with a PEEK sleeve for coupling the nanospray with the on-line nano-LC. The voltage applied to the union to produce an electrospray was 2 kV, and the cone voltage was 3 V. Argon was introduced as a collision gas at a pressure of 1 p.s.i. The identity of the peptides and the exact ubiquitylation sites were concluded from the detected collision-induced dissociation products manually and by Mascot software (Matrix Science) and confirmed by manual inspection of the fragmentation series. For determination of sites of ubiquitylation, a modification of 114 Da was specified for lysine residues. In Vivo Ubiquitylation AssaysTransfected SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm lactacystin, 10 mm NH4Cl, and/or 10 mm 3-MA for 12 h. The transfected cells were then resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, boiled for 5 min, and then diluted 10-fold with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 30 μm MG132, 10 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm 3-MA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Cell extracts were sonicated and then incubated for 16 h with anti-HA beads (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and detected by Western blot. Immunocytochemistry AssaysTransfected SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with or without 10 μm lactacystin, 10 mm NH4Cl, and/or 10 mm 3-MA for 12 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum. Cells were labeled with anti-HA (Covance) and anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (22Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A.

Immunolabeling was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratories). The percent of cells containing cytosolic inclusions was counted by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups. Statistics of the number of inclusion-containing cells was analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. Cell Death AnalysisTransfected SH-SY5Y cells were transfected and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above. Before mounting, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Cell death was determined by counting the number of α-synuclein/SIAH-transfected cells that were positive for nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Statistics of cell death were done by Student's t test. SIAH Monoubiquitylates α-Synuclein in VitroPreliminary evidence indicates that SIAH-2 is able to monoubiquitylate α-synuclein in vitro (22Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We then carried out additional in vitro ubiquitylation experiments using solely purified recombinant proteins to ascertain whether α-synuclein is indeed monoubiquitylated by SIAH and not by contaminants from the in vitro translation reaction employed previously (22Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We found that both recombinant SIAH-1 and SIAH-2 directly monoubiquitylate recombinant α-synuclein in the presence of purified components of the ubiquitin system (Fig. 1A). We next sought to characterize the monoubiquitylation by SIAH and its effect on α-synuclein. Although both SIAH isoforms monoubiquitylate α-synuclein, the more robust effect of SIAH-2 prompted us to extend the characterization of α-synuclein monoubiquitylation using SIAH-2. To confirm the monoubiquitylation nature of α-synuclein post-translation modification, we carried out additional in vitro assays using methylated ubiquitin or lysine-less ubiquitin (ubiquitin K0), which do not allow polyubiquitylation to occur (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, α-synuclein was monoubiquitylated by methylated ubiquitin and ubiquitin K0 as well (Fig. 1B). Using these modified ubiquitin molecules, we observed a slight difference in the migration of monoubiquitylated α-synuclein, which may be related to differences in the arrangement of ubiquitin molecules conjugated to α-synuclein. α-Synuclein was not ubiquitylated by other E3 ubiquitin-ligases, such as Parkin, XIAP, and E6AP (Fig. 1C), indicating that the effect of SIAH is specific. To identify the sites of ubiquitylation of α-synuclein by SIAH-2, we analyzed the ubiquitin-conjugated bands of our in vitro α-synuclein ubiquitylation reactions by mass spectrometry. After ubiquitylation, His-α-synuclein was purified by cobalt affinity column and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). Ubiquitylated α-synuclein bands were cut, digested by trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS, ESI-MS/MS, and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Ubiquitylation was identified by an increase in peptide mass of 114 Da, corresponding to diglycine-modified lysines upon tryptic cleavage. We observed diglycine-modified lysines at the positions 12, 21, and 23 (Table 1). These lysines were recently found to be ubiquitylated in Lewy bodies (30Anderson J.P. Walker D.E.

Additionally, we identified lysines 10, 34, 43, and 96 to be ubiquitylated by SIAH as well (Table 1).TABLE 1Ubiquitylated peptides of α-synucleinPosition in the sequenceSequenceMr calculatedMr measured7–12K.GLSK10AK.E + GlyGly(K)716.28716.3211–23K.AK12EGVVAAAEK21TK.Q + 2GlyGly(K)1528.741528.6813–32K.EGVVAAAEK21TK23QGVAEAAGK.E + 2 GlyGly(K)2141.042140.933–45K.TK34EGVLYVGSK43TK.E + 2 GlyGly(K)1522.781522.8481–97aPeptide fingerprinting was detected by MALDI-TOF/MS and LC-ESI-MS/MSK.TVEGAGSIAAATGFVK96K.D + GlyGly(K)1719.861719.92a Peptide fingerprinting was detected by MALDI-TOF/MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS Open table in a new tab In an attempt to determine whether the absence of these identified lysines would prevent the ubiquitylation of α-synuclein by SIAH, we gen"
https://openalex.org/W1986752758,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and related activities. HGF acts through its receptor c-Met, which activates downstream signaling pathways. HGF binds to c-Met at the plasma membrane, where it is generally believed that c-Met signaling is initiated. Here we report that c-Met rapidly translocates to the nucleus upon stimulation with HGF. Ca2+ signals that are induced by HGF result from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation within the nucleus rather than within the cytoplasm. Translocation of c-Met to the nucleus depends upon the adaptor protein Gab1 and importin β1, and formation of Ca2+ signals in turn depends upon this translocation. HGF may exert its particular effects on cells because it bypasses signaling pathways in the cytoplasm to directly activate signaling pathways in the nucleus.

J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Met is responsible for cell proliferation under normal conditions such as tissue regeneration (2Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar), as well as under abnormal conditions such as neoplasia (3Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For example, in the liver, HGF is secreted by stellate cells and then binds to c-Met on hepatocytes (1Maher J.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to mediate processes such as liver regeneration following liver resection (2Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C.

S. A. 1992; 89: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of action of c-Met are not entirely understood, but it is generally believed that this and other RTKs act at the plasma membrane (5Okano Y. Mizuno K. Osada S. Nakamura T. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T.

However, several RTKs have been found in the nucleus, including receptors for insulin, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor (8Kim S.J. Kahn C.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat.

The function of these receptors in the nucleus is controversial (11Massie C. Mills I.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Wells A. Marti U. Nat. Rev.

C-met and other RTKs act in part through Ca2+ signaling, which is initiated by the phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ)/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)/Ca2+ signaling cascade (13Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). A number of peptide hormones also increase Ca2+ via InsP3 but typically do so via G protein-coupled receptors that activate PLCβ (13Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals induced by growth factors typically have separate effects from hormone-induced Ca2+ signals, although both are mediated by PLC and InsP3 (13Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, for example, vasopressin activates the V1a receptor to modulate secretion (14Nathanson M.H. Gautam A. Bruck R. Isales C.M. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), glucose release (15Nathanson M.H. Rios-Velez L. Burgstahler A.D. Mennone A.

Physiol. 1992; 262: G1079-G1086PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HGF activates c-Met to regulate cell proliferation (17Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). The versatility of Ca2+ as a second messenger in part reflects that Ca2+ signals have distinct effects in different parts of the cell (13Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Moreover, cell proliferation depends upon Ca2+ signals in the nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm (18Rodrigues M.A. Gomes D.A. Leite M.F. Grant W. Zhang L. Lam W. Cheng Y.C. Bennett A.M. Nathanson M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17061-17068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the subcellular distribution of c-Met and the mechanism by which HGF induces c-Met to form Ca2+ signals. Cells and Cell Culture–SkHep1 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Immunoblots–SkHep1 cell immunoblots were performed as described previously (19Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell membranes were disrupted to release cytoplasmic contents. Intact nuclei were recovered from the cytoplasmic extract by centrifugation, and then the nuclei were washed with PBS and lysed to yield the nuclear extract. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) were added to all buffers. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantitatively analyzed using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Detection of PIP2–The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate mass strip kit was used for isolation and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) detection (Echelon). SkHep1 cells were starved overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were used in aliquots of 5 × 106 cells/sample and incubated without or with HGF (100 ng/ml) for 4 min or arginine vasopressin (AVP) (100 nm) for 30 s, and then the medium was aspirated, and cellular material was precipitated by the immediate addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid. The NE-PER kit (Pierce) was used to prepare the nuclear and cell fraction, as described above (20Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell membranes were disrupted to release cytoplasmic contents. Intact nuclei were recovered from the cytoplasmic extract by centrifugation, and then the nuclei were washed with PBS and precipitated with 3 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid. Isolation of lipids was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (21Gray A. Olsson H. Batty I.H. Priganica L. Peter D.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 313: 234-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The organic phase was collected into a clean tube and dried in a SpeedVac centrifuge. The pellet at this stage was faintly visible. The lipids were then resuspended by sonication in a cold water bath in 10 μl of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (1:2:0.8) and spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane strips prespotted with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate standards, PIP controls, and space for spotting unknown samples for probing with anti-PIP2 monoclonal antibody (Echelon) to specifically detect PIP2. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantitatively analyzed using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Assay for Cell Surface Protein by Biotinylation–Cells were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS and subsequently incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 5 ml of PBS containing 1mm sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce). Reactions were quenched for 10 min with 10 ml of PBS containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml HGF (R&D Systems) for 4 min and lysed on ice for 10 min in 500 μl of NE-PER to prepare nuclear and cytosolic cell fractions (20Echevarria W. Leite M.F.

Streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) (50 μl of a 50:50 slurry) or anti-c-Met antibody were added to 500 μl of adjusted cell lysate, containing 200-500 μg of protein, and the suspension was rocked overnight at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with anti-c-Met antibody and 50 μl of agarose G for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of PBS and analyzed by immunoblotting. Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Met antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was used. Immunofluorescence–Confocal immunofluorescence was performed as described (19Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cells were triple-labeled with monoclonal antibodies against c-Met (Upstate Biotechnology) and polyclonal antibodies against Lamin B1 (AbCam) plus the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and 555 (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a ×63, 1.4 NA objective lens with excitation at 488 nm and observation at 505-550 nm to detect Alexa Fluor 488, excitation at 543 nm and observation at 560-610 nm to detect Alexa Fluor 555, and excitation at 633 nm and observation using LP650 nm to detect TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen). InsP3 Buffer Constructs–The InsP3 binding domain (residues 224-605) of the human type I InsP3 receptor was tagged with monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP), and then the nuclear localization signal was subcloned to generate the nuclear InsP3 buffer expression vector. The nuclear exclusion signal sequence derived from MKK1 was subcloned in the InsP3 binding domain tagged with the mRFP construct to generate the cytoplasmic InsP3 buffer expression vector, as described previously (22Varnai P.

Transfection of siRNA–SkHep1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) with 50 nm siRNA for Gab1 (siRNA ID 1.927) (Ambion). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 for 48 h prior to use. Detection of Ca2+ Signals–For Ca2+ imaging, cells were incubated with fluo-4/AM (6 μm) (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then coverslips containing the cells were transferred to a custom-built perfusion chamber on the stage of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope, and fluo-4 fluorescence was monitored using a ×63, 1.4 NA objective lens at 1-5 frames/s. Changes in fluorescence were normalized by the initial fluorescence (F0) and were expressed as (F/F0) × 100% (19Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E.

In selected experiments, cells were transfected 48 h prior to study with targeted mRFP-InsP3 buffer constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Statistical Analysis–Significance of changes in treatment groups relative to controls were determined by Student's t test. Data are represented as mean ± S.E. c-Met Translocates to the Nucleus–Studies were performed in the SkHep1 liver cell line because of the well known effects of HGF in liver and because this liver cell line contains Ca2+ signaling machinery in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (20Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). As expected, c-Met was excluded from the nucleus of SkHep1 cells prior to stimulation with HGF (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylated, and hence active, form of c-Met accumulated in both the non-nuclear and the nuclear cell fraction of stimulated cells, reaching a peak in both compartments within 4 min (Fig. 1, A-C). The purity of nuclear preparations was confirmed using several nuclear and non-nuclear markers (Fig. 1D), although endoplasmic reticulum markers were not used because endoplasmic reticulum proteins can be found in the nucleus (20Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that this receptor was at the plasma membrane or within the cytoplasm prior to stimulation and revealed that c-Met appeared both at the nuclear envelope and within the nuclear interior within 4 min of exposure to HGF (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, c-Met that was biotinylated at the cell surface prior to stimulation with HGF could be recovered in the nucleus after cells were stimulated (Fig. 3). Together, these findings demonstrate that both total and activated c-Met rapidly translocates from the plasma membrane to the nucleus upon stimulation of cells with HGF.FIGURE 2Confocal immunofluorescence images of c-Met before and 4 min after stimulation with HGF. A, confocal immunofluorescence images of c-Met before and 4 min after stimulation with HGF, respectively. The images confirm that the receptor moves to the nucleus. In each image, c-Met labeling is in green, and the nucleus is stained with TO-PRO-3 (blue). Serial optical sections were collected for three-dimensional reconstruction; x-z sections are shown at the top, and y-z sections are shown at the right of each image. Note that c-Met redistributes to the region of the nuclear envelope as well as in a reticular pattern within the nuclear interior (arrows).

After treatment with HGF, the non-nuclear (Non-Nuc.) and nuclear fractions were used for immunoprecipitation (ip) with either c-Met antibody or streptavidin. Both immunoprecipitations confirm that c-Met within the nucleus is labeled with streptavidin.

The nucleus is known to contain PLC and PIP2 (24Irvine R.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which are necessary for the formation of InsP3. The nucleus also contains InsP3-gated Ca2+ stores, within both the nuclear envelope (25Stehno-Bittel L. Luckhoff A. Clapham D.E.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To define whether c-Met forms InsP3 in the cytoplasm or nucleus, we targeted the ligand binding domain (residues 224-605) of the InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) type 1 (22Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A. Rhee S.G. Hajnoczky G. Balla T. J. Biol.

RFP fluorescence was slightly greater in the construct expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 4C), perhaps because the construct was distributed in a slightly smaller compartment. This segment of InsP3R1 specifically binds to InsP3 with sufficient affinity to compete for binding to the native receptor (22Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A. Rhee S.G. Hajnoczky G. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27412-27422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These targeted InsP3 buffer constructs were expressed in the SkHep1 liver cell line, which express not only c-Met but also the G protein-coupled V1a vasopressin receptor (28Leite M.F. Hirata K. Pusl T. Burgstahler A.D. Okazaki K. Ortega J.M. Goes A.M. Prado M.A. Spray D.C. Nathanson M.H. J. Biol.

Stimulation of the V1a receptor was used as a cytoplasmic InsP3 control since G protein-coupled receptors activate PLC and form InsP3 at the plasma membrane (29Birnbaumer M. Trends Endocrinol.

Vasopressin (100 nm) increased Ca2+ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, in control (non-transfected) cells as well as in cells transfected with the nuclear InsP3 buffer (Fig. 5, A, B, and E). However, Ca2+ signaling was nearly abolished in cells expressing the cytoplasmic InsP3 buffer (Fig. 5, A, B, and E). These results show that vasopressin increases InsP3 only in the cytoplasm and that Ca2+ signals in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus result from this. Like vasopressin, HGF (100 ng/ml) increased Ca2+ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 5, C-E). However, Ca2+ signals induced by HGF were nearly abolished in cells expressing the nuclear InsP3 buffer rather than the cytoplasmic buffer (Fig. 5, C-E). These results show that although phosphorylated c-Met is in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A), HGF increases InsP3 only in the nucleus, and Ca2+ signals throughout the cell result from this. Consistent with this, Ca2+ signaling detected in cells in which images were collected more rapidly (Fig. 5F) occasionally identified cells in which vasopressin-induced signals began in the cytoplasm, whereas HGF-induced signals began in the nucleus, similar to what has been observed previously (20Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In other cells, Ca2+ signals appeared to begin simultaneously in both compartments, but vasopressin-induced signals never began in the nucleus, whereas HGF signals never began in the cytoplasm. To further demonstrate that HGF directly forms InsP3 within the nucleus, total and nuclear PIP2 hydrolysis was examined. Total cellular PIP2 was 17.8 ± 1.9 pmol/5 × 106 cells under control conditions. PIP2 was detected in the nucleus as well, although this represented less than 15% of total cellular PIP2. Vasopressin was more effective than HGF in reducing total cellular PIP2, but HGF selectively and potently reduced PIP2 within the nucleus (Fig. 6, A and B). Vasopressin had minimal effect on nuclear PIP2 (n = 2, not shown). PLC-γ is thought to be responsible for HGF-induced hydrolysis of PIP2, and both immunoblot (Fig. 6C) and confocal immunofluorescence (not shown) demonstrated that this isoform of PLC is in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. Together, these findings identify c-Met as an endogenous factor that selectively activates the nuclear machinery responsible for hydrolyzing PIP2 and thus generating InsP3 and Ca2+ signals within the nucleus.FIGURE 5c-Met generates InsP3 in the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm.

Gab1 is an adaptor protein that contains a nuclear localization sequence (30Osawa M. Itoh S. Ohta S. Huang Q. Berk B.C. Marmarosh N.L. Che W. Ding B. Yan C. Abe J. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Transport of proteins through the nuclear pore complex typically involves importins α/β and exportins (32Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Specifically, importin-α binds to the classical lysine-rich nuclear localization signal in the cargo, and importin-β interacts with the importin-α/cargo complex to guide it through the nuclear pore (32Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of cell fractions isolated at serial time points following HGF stimulation demonstrated that HGF induced translocation of Gab1 to the nucleus (Fig. 7). To determine whether Gab1 or importin-β1 are necessary for the translocation of c-Met to the nucleus, siRNAs were developed that reduced Gab1 expression by 83 ± 6% (Fig. 8A) and importin expression by 90 ± 7% (Fig. 8C) in SkHep1 cells, relative to non-transfected and scrambled siRNA-transfected controls. Immunoblots of nuclear and non-nuclear cell fractions demonstrated that treatment of cells with Gab1 and importin siRNAs reduced the translocation of c-Met to the nucleus by 48 ± 6% (Fig. 8B) and 55% ± 2% (Fig. 8D), respectively. These results suggest that Gab1 and importin each play a role in c-Met translocation. Finally, HGF-induced Ca2+ signals in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm were eliminated"
https://openalex.org/W2089592318,"Macroautophagy has been implicated as a mechanism of cell death. However, the relationship between this degradative pathway and cell death is unclear as macroautophagy has been shown recently to protect against apoptosis. To better define the interplay between these two critical cellular processes, we determined whether inhibition of macroautophagy could have both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects in the same cell. Embryonic fibroblasts from mice with a knock-out of the essential macroautophagy gene atg5 were treated with activators of the extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways. Loss of macroautophagy sensitized these cells to caspase-dependent apoptosis from the death receptor ligands Fas and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Atg5-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts had increased activation of the mitochondrial death pathway in response to Fas/TNF-alpha in concert with decreased ATP levels. Fas/TNF-alpha treatment failed to up-regulate macroautophagy, and in fact, decreased activity at late time points. In contrast to their sensitization to Fas/TNF-alpha, Atg5-/- cells were resistant to death from menadione and UV light. In the absence of macroautophagy, an up-regulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy induced resistance to these stressors. These results demonstrate that inhibition of macroautophagy can promote or prevent apoptosis in the same cell and that the response is governed by the nature of the death stimulus and compensatory changes in other forms of autophagy. Experimental findings that an inhibition of macroautophagy blocks apoptosis do not prove that autophagy mediates cell death as this effect may result from the protective up-regulation of other autophagic pathways such as chaperone-mediated autophagy."

Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, many homologs were found in mammals, non-mammals, plants, fungi, and bacteria (2Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The functional importance of this family is highlighted by several inherited human diseases caused by mutations in SLC26 genes (3Everett L.A. Green E.D. Hum. Mol.

The symptomatic variety of these diseases illustrates the diversity of cellular functions performed by this class of transport proteins.Mammalian SLC26s are the members of this family that have been functionally studied the best. Most of them operate as anion exchangers, and distinct isoforms differ significantly in anion specificity. Some transport monovalent and divalent anions, whereas others transport only monovalent anions (1Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol.

There are also family members that do not function as anion exchangers, most notably, SLC26A5 or prestin, the motor protein in the outer hair cells (10Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Outer hair cells in the mammalian cochlea change length in response to acoustic signals, and this mechanical amplification enhances the hearing sensitivity by >40 db. The basis for these length changes are voltage-dependent conformational changes of prestin that are transformed into somatic length changes of outer hair cells (11Dallos P. Fakler B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent work suggested that SLC26A7 and SLC26A9 are not anion carriers, but anion channels (12Kim K.H. Shcheynikov N. Wang Y. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Dorwart M.R. Shcheynikov N. Wang Y. Stippec S. Muallem S.

The SLC26 family thus exhibits an amazing variety of functions, yet the molecular basis of this diversity is poorly understood. As a fundamental step to understand structure-function relationships, we decided to study the subunit stoichiometry of various SLC26 homologs from humans, rat, zebrafish, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that all tested isoforms exhibit a dimeric subunit stoichiometry.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of His- or YFP Fusion Proteins in Xenopus Oocytes or in Mammalian Cells–pGEMHE-hSLC26A3-HisCT (polyhistidine tag at the carboxyl-terminal end) encoding the human SLC26A3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_000111) (14Schweinfest C.W.

Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). A construct encoding a rat prestin concatamer was generated by covalently linking two prestin copies in a single open reading frame by a cDNA sequence containing four repeats of the tripeptide AGS (17Nicke A. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PASulP (GenBank™ accession number NP_250338) was identified by searches for rat prestin homologues using BLAST searches at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). It was amplified by PCR from genomic P. aeruginosa DNA and subcloned into pGEMHE using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Transcription of cRNAs and handling of oocytes was performed as described (18Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar).To create YFP fusion proteins, the YFP cDNA was excised from pEYFP-N1/pECFP-N1 (Clontech) and inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) connected to the coding sequences of rat and zebrafish prestin and human SLC26A3 by short linker sequences in a single open reading frame. SLC26 proteins were expressed in tsA201 cells as described (19Hebeisen S. Biela A. Giese B. Muller-Newen G. Hidalgo P. Ch Fahlke J. Biol.

For some experiments, stable inducible cell lines, generated by selecting Flp-In T-REx cells (Invitrogen) transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO-YFP-rprestin, were used after 24-h incubation with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ method. All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. supplemental Fig. S1 gives an alignment of the SLC26 isoforms characterized in this study.Functional Characterization of SLC26A3 and Prestin–Radioactive chloride uptake into oocytes was studied 4-5 days after cRNA injection. Oocytes were preincubated for 10 min in chloride-free medium (98 mm potassium gluconate, 1.8 mm calcium gluconate, 5 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) and then transferred to the uptake solution (100 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm HEPES-Tris, 3 mm 36Cl, pH 7.5) above 300 μl of mineral oil. After various time periods, 36Cl uptake was terminated by centrifuging the oocytes into the mineral oil layer. Scintillation counting was performed after lysis of the oocytes in scintillation counting tubes containing 100 μl of 0.5% SDS. For each incubation period, uptake was also determined for at least two uninjected oocytes. These control values were averaged and subtracted from radioactive uptake levels measured on injected oocytes. Additional control experiments were performed with oocytes expressing SLC26A3 transporters incubated in the uptake solution supplemented by 100 μm DIDS. DIDS was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm and diluted into the uptake solution.Transfected HEK293 or tsA201 cells were studied through whole cell patch clamping using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. In experiments measuring voltage-dependent capacitances, the external solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, at pH 7.4, and the intracellular solution contained (in mm): 120 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, at pH 7.4. The initial pipette resistances were 1-2.5 megohms. Stray pipette capacitance was neutralized before establishing the whole cell configuration. All data acquisition and analysis were performed with the Windows-based patch clamp program, jClamp (SciSoft, Ridgefield, CT). Non-linear charge movement was calculated using a continuous high resolution (2.56-ms sampling) two-sine stimulus protocol (10-mV peaks at both 390.6 and 781.2 Hz) superimposed onto voltage steps (150-ms duration) from either -200 to +80 mV or -160 to +120 mV (20Santos-Sacchi J. Kakehata S. Takahashi S. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of the non-linear capacitance was fit to the first derivative of a two-state Boltzmann function (21Santos-Sacchi J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3096-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C(V)=βQmaxe-β(V-V1/2)(1+e-β(V-V1/2))2(Eq. 1) where β = z(eoδ/kBT). In addition, Qmax is the maximum charge transferred across the membrane; V½ is the potential at half-maximal charge transfer; z is the number of elementary charges, eo, displaced across a fraction, δ, of the membrane dielectric; kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.In co-transfected cells, the voltage dependence of the nonlinear capacitance was fit with, C(V)=pD154N2·CD154N+(1-pD154N)2·CD342Q+2(1-pD154N)pD154N·CHeterodimer(Eq. 2) where pD154N is the percentage of subunits carrying the D154N mutation. CD154N, CD342Q, and CHeterodimer are voltage-dependent capacitances of homogenous populations of homodimeric mutant prestin or of heterodimeric prestin. Qmax was assumed to be identical for each non-linear capacitance term.To measure Cl-/SO42- exchange by zebrafish prestin, external solutions containing (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 Na2SO4, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, and internal solutions (in mm) containing: 30 Na2SO4, 90 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, were used.Purification of [35S]Methionine-labeled Protein from Xenopus Oocytes–cRNA-injected and non-injected control oocytes were incubated for the indicated time with Revidue™ l-[35S]methionine (>37 TBq/mmol, GE Healthcare Biosciences) at ∼25 Mbq/ml (∼0.1 MBq/oocyte) in frog Ringer's solution at 19 °C for metabolic labeling. Either immediately after the pulse or after an additional chase period, the radiolabeled oocytes were extracted with digitonin (1.0%) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. His-tagged proteins were isolated by metal affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), as detailed previously (18Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), with the modification that iodoacetamide was routinely included at 10 mm and 1 mm in the lysis and washing buffers, respectively (22Sadtler S.

In some experiments, 1% perfluoro-octanoic acid, ammonium salt (PFO, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as detergent for membrane protein extraction and purification in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, with and without 10 mm iodoacetamide as indicated. Proteins were eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose with PFO elution buffer consisting of 250 mm imidazole/HCl and 1% PFO at pH 7.4 and stored at 0 °C until analysis later on the same day.Chemical Cross-linking–His-tagged SLC26 protein bound to Ni2+-NTA beads was washed in triplicate with imidazole-free sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.2% digitonin. The Ni2+-NTA beads (packed volume, ∼15 μl) were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.2 m triethanolamine/HCl (pH 8.5), 0.5% digitonin. The cross-linking reaction was initiated by adding glutardialdehyde (Roth Chemicals) or dimethyl adipimidate (Pierce) from freshly prepared solutions in distilled water or 0.2 m triethanolamine/HCl (pH 8.5), respectively. After 30 min at room temperature, the cross-linking reaction was terminated by washing the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads twice with imidazole-free sodium phosphate buffer, 0.2% digitonin. Proteins were eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose with non-denaturing elution buffer, consisting of 250 mm imidazole/HCl and 0.5% digitonin at pH 7.4, and then stored at 0 °C until analysis later on the same day.Purification of YFP Fusion Proteins from Mammalian Cells–tsA201 or HEK293 cell dishes were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 800 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 1% digitonin, protease inhibitors, and 50 mm iodoacetamide. For lysis, the whole dish was incubated 15 min on ice, followed by complete transfer of the cell lysate into a microtube and subsequent quadruplicate vortexing during incubation on ice for another 15 min. SLC26 proteins were isolated by metal affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). In some experiments, 1% PFO in PFO extraction buffer was used for cell lysis.SDS-PAGE, BN-PAGE, and PFO-PAGE–[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were denatured for 10 min at 56 °C with SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and electrophoresed in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (Rainbow, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Freiberg, Germany) on linear SDS-polyacrylamide gels. BN-PAGE was performed as described (18Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) immediately after protein purification. We loaded the protein purified from the equivalent of 0.5 oocytes in each lane. Molecular masses were determined by comparison with the defined membrane protein complexes generated by partial denaturing of the homopentameric α1 GlyR (23Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PFO-PAGE was performed as described using freshly poured Tris-glycine (Laemmli) gels without SDS and Tris-glycine running buffer supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) PFO instead of SDS (24Ramjeesingh M.

The homopentameric α1 GlyR was used as a mass marker as above.YFP-tagged proteins were visualized by scanning the wet PAGE gels with a fluorescence scanner (Typhoon, GE Healthcare Biosciences). PAGE gels with radioactive proteins were fixed and dried, exposed onto a phosphorscreen, and scanned with a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare Biosciences). Individual bands were quantified with the ImageQuaNT software. To investigate the glycosylation state of the proteins, samples were treated for 2 h with either endoglycosidase H (EndoH) or PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of reducing SDS sample buffer and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 to counteract SDS inactivation of PNGase F.Data Analysis–Protein intensities were quantified with the ImageQuaNT software (GE Healthcare Biosciences). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. Data are given as mean ± S.E.RESULTSHis and YFP Tags Leave Function of SLC26A3 and Prestin Unaltered–We added carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tags to various SLC26 isoforms to purify the proteins from Xenopus oocytes by a single Ni2+-metal affinity chromatography step. Moreover, SLC26 isoforms were expressed as YFP fusion proteins in mammalian cells, to visualize protein bands using a fluorescence scanner. To test whether these sequence alterations affect functional properties, we compared chloride transport by WT and His-tagged SLC26A3, non-linear charge movement by WT and His- or YFP-tagged rat prestin, and Cl-/SO42- antiport by WT and His- or YFP-tagged zebrafish prestin.SLC26A3 was initially identified as a potential tumor suppressor that was down-regulated in adenoma and abundant in normal colonic mucosa (14Schweinfest C.W. Henderson K.W. Suster S. Kondoh N. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated to be a DIDS-sensitive anion exchanger (27Moseley R.H. Hoglund P. Wu G.D. Silberg D.G. Haila S. de la C.A. Holmberg C. Kere J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G185-G192PubMed Google Scholar, 28Melvin J.E. Park K. Richardson L. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22855-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We expressed tagged and untagged SLC26A3 in Xenopus oocytes and measured radioactive chloride uptake with and without added DIDS (27Moseley R.H. Hoglund P. Wu G.D. Silberg D.G. Haila S. de la C.A. Holmberg C. Kere J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G185-G192PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing WT or His-tagged SLC26A3 accumulated chloride with similar time courses and magnitudes (Fig. 1A). In both cases, 36Cl uptake was significantly higher in oocytes expressing SLC26A3 than in control oocytes, and incubation with 100 μm DIDS caused a reduction of the chloride uptake to ∼50%.Rat prestin performs voltage-induced conformational changes that can be monitored as voltage-dependent capacitance changes (10Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 29Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We expressed WT and His- or YFP-tagged rat prestin in tsA201 cells and measured voltage-dependent capacitance using a software-based lock-in technique (phase tracking) in the whole cell patch clamp technique. Neither the absolute amplitude of the non-linear capacitance (data not shown) nor the voltage dependence of rat prestin (Fig. 1B) was affected by any of the added tags. Rat prestin charge movement is not affected by 100 μm DIDS (data not shown). However, non-linear capacitances by WT and tagged prestin were eliminated by salicylate (29Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B).Zebrafish prestin is functionally different from rat prestin. In addition to mediating voltage-dependent charge movements (30Albert J.T. Winter H. Schaechinger T.J. Weber T. Wang X. He D.Z. Hendrich O. Geisler H.S. Zimmermann U. Oelmann K. Knipper M. Gopfert M.C. Oliver D. J. Physiol. 2007; 580: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it functions as Cl-/SO42- exchanger with 1:1 stoichiometry (31Schaechinger T.J. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7693-7698Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We measured currents in cells expressing WT or YFP or His fusion proteins of zebrafish prestin. The three tested proteins displayed anion currents with identical reversal potential and therefore unchanged transport stoichiometry (Fig. 1C). Mean current amplitudes were comparable (data not shown), and 10 mm salicylate (31Schaechinger T.J. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7693-7698Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reduced current amplitudes to ∼50% in all cases (Fig. 1C). The addition of the His tag or YFP tag did not affect the function of the tested SLC26 isoforms. We conclude that none of the tags prevents oligomerization processes of SLC26 that are of functional importance.SDS-PAGE Analysis of Mammalian SLC26 Isoforms Heterologously Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes–Expression of SLC26 isoforms in Xenopus oocytes resulted in protein amounts that are below the resolution limit of Coomassie or silver staining. We therefore used metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine for signal enhancement to visualize analytical quantities of recombinant proteins.His-tagged SLC26A3 and rat prestin were expressed and metabolically labeled in Xenopus oocytes. After extraction with 1% (w/v) digitonin, proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography. Both proteins express well in Xenopus oocytes and are metabolically stable during a sustained chase. When resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE with a low percentage of acrylamide, as in Fig. 2A, the SLC26A3 and prestin polypeptides migrated at 15-20% lower masses than calculated from the amino acid sequences (85 kDa for His-SLC26A3 and 82 kDa for His-prestin). Both polypeptides shifted to higher apparent molecular masses at higher acrylamide concentrations (results not shown). This indicates that the mass deviations are due to anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE gels and not to post-translational processing of the polypeptide chains. Anomalous fast electrophoretic mobility has frequently been observed with highly hydrophobic membrane proteins (32Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S.

A-C, human SLC26A3 and rat prestin purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography after an overnight [35S]methionine pulse and a 24-h chase from X. laevis oocytes were resolved on a reducing SDS-PAGE urea gel (6% acrylamide/8 m urea) in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (positions indicated in kDa at the left margins). Mutation of single or multiple asparagine glycosyl acceptors to glutamine combined with deglycosylation analysis as indicated reveals that SLC26A3 and prestin carry three (B) or two (C) high mannose type N-glycans, respectively. Glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms are indicated by black and white dots, respectively. Black dots indicate the number of glycans of the respective polypeptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Human SLC26A3 harbors four sequons for N-glycosylation, 153NAT, 161NNS, 164NNS, and 165NSS, in the predicted second ectodomain loop, which is flanked by the transmembrane segments TM3 and TM4. Deglycosylation with either EndoH or PNGase F reduced the molecular mass by ∼8 kDa (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3), suggesting the presence of three N-linked high mannose-type oligosaccharides of 2-3 kDa each. Substitution of Asn153 by glutamine resulted in a di-glycosylated polypeptide (lanes 4-6), and additional glutamine substitution of Asn161, Asn164, and Asn165 resulted in a non-glycosylated polypeptide (lanes 10-12). Thus, the three sequons that are in close proximity to one another acquire only two oligosaccharides, indicating that either Asn164 or Asn165 is sterically inaccessible for the oligosaccharyltransferase (32Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G. Hidalgo P. Ch Fahlke J. Biol.

Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar).Rat prestin carries five potential glycosylation sites, with two adjacent sequons - 163NAT and 166NGT - located in the second ectodomain. Deglycosylation produced a ∼5-kDa mass shift (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-3), suggesting that two sites carry N-glycans. Glutamine substitution of Asn163 led to a monoglycosylated polypeptide (lanes 4-6), and no mass shift by PNGase F was observed when both sites, Asn163 and Asn166, were replaced by glutamines (lanes 7-9). The three remaining N-glycosylation sequons, 589NATV, 603NATK, and 736NATP, were not used.SLC26A3 and Rat Prestin Migrate as Discrete Dimers in BN-PAGE Gels–To examine whether SLC26 transporters assemble into stable higher order structures, we natively purified human SLC26A3 or rat prestin from Xenopus oocytes and resolved it on BN-PAGE gels. The non-denatured hSLC26A3 exchanger migrated as a distinct band of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The size of the native SLC26A3 oligomer was assessed by comparing it to a molecular weight standard produced by partial dissociation of the homopentameric α1 GlyR receptor (Fig. 3A, lane 8). This procedure results in the occurrence of oligomers consisting of one to five GlyR α1 subunits (molecular mass ∼52 kDa), representing a reliable size standard for membrane proteins of up to 260 kDa (32Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G. Hidalgo P. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39505-39512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To display the number of subunits incorporated in the SLC26A3 transporter complex, we weakened non-covalent subunit interactions by treating the natively purified protein with increasing concentrations of SDS. Incubation of the SLC26A3 exchanger with 0.01% SDS resulted in the complete disappearance of the 200-kDa band in favor of one faster migrating band of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The similarity with the calculated mass (91 kDa including the 6-kDa mass contributed by two N-linked glycans) and the absence of a faster migrating band in the presence of a 10-fold higher SDS concentration (Fig. 3A, lane 6) indicate that the 100-kDa band represents the monomeric state of SLC26A3, and the 200-kDa band represents the dimeric state. In the absence of the denaturant SDS, the 200-kDa band was resistant to 1-h incubation at 37 °C with Coomassie dye (Fig. 3A, lane 2) or Coomassie dye plus the strong reductant DTT (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Non-glycosylated SLC26A3 transporters also existed exclusively as dimers (results not shown). Other multimerization states were virtually absent (Fig. 3). Natively purified rat prestin migrated at three positions equal to ∼97, ∼190 kDa, and ∼250 kDa in BN-PAGE gels (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Denaturing by SDS resulted in a complete dissociation of the oligomeric prestin into the ∼90-kDa form (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6), closely similar to the calculated mass of the rat prestin monomer of 87 kDa (protein core of 82 kDa including His tag plus 5 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate). No faster migrating protein species was observed, indicating that the 90-kDa band represents the monomer and the ∼180-kDa band the dimer of rat prestin.FIGURE 3Oligomeric state of human SLC26A3 and rat prestin in Xenopus oocytes as determined by BN-PAGE.

NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for signal transduction by growth factor receptors. Here we investigated the dependence of PDGF-AA-induced ROS production on the cytosolic Nox subunits Rac-1 and p47phox, and we systematically evaluated the signal relay mechanisms by which the αPDGF receptor (αPDGFR) induces ROS liberation. Stimulation of the αPDGFR led to a time-dependent increase of intracellular ROS levels in fibroblasts. Pharmacological inhibitor experiments and enzyme activity assays disclosed Nox as the source of ROS. αPDGFR activation is rapidly followed by the translocation of p47phox and Rac-1 from the cytosol to the cell membrane. Experiments performed in p47phox(-/-) cells and inhibition of Rac-1 or overexpression of dominant-negative Rac revealed that these Nox subunits are required for PDGF-dependent Nox activation and ROS liberation. To evaluate the signaling pathway mediating PDGF-AA-dependent ROS production, we investigated Ph cells expressing mutant αPDGFRs that lack specific binding sites for αPDGFR-associated signaling molecules (Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cγ, and SHP-2). Lack of PI3K signaling (but not Src, phospholipase Cγ, or SHP-2) completely abolished PDGF-dependent p47phox and Rac-1 translocation, increase of Nox activity, and ROS production. Conversely, a mutant αPDGFR able to activate only PI3K was sufficient to mediate these subcellular events. Furthermore, the catalytic PI3K subunit p110α (but not p110β) was identified as the crucial isoform that elicits αPDGFR-mediated production of ROS. Finally, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and chemotaxis assays revealed that the lack of ROS liberation blunted PDGF-AA-dependent chemotaxis but not cell cycle progression. We conclude that PI3K/p110α mediates growth factor-dependent ROS production by recruiting p47phox and Rac-1 to the cell membrane, thereby assembling the active Nox complex.

It generally consists of two membranous components, the flavocytochrome b protein Nox (nonphagocytes) or gp91phox (phagocytes) and p22phox, and the two cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox (14Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although the cytosolic subunit p40phox known from phagocytic cells is usually not found in nonphagocytic cells, the small GTP-binding protein Rac (Rac-1/Rac-2) has regulatory function for the enzyme activity and migrates from the cytosol to the membrane during the activation process (1Droge W.

However, the contribution of each of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) subtypes and the mechanism how PI3K is involved in activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by PDGF remain unknown. Furthermore, the exact signaling mechanisms and the role of the various NAD(P)H oxidase subunits for PDGF-dependent ROS formation have not been studied. Biologically active PDGF is a dimeric protein consisting of two of the four known homologous chains (A, B, C, and D) that are linked by disulfide bonds (15Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A.

Binding of PDGF induces the dimerization of two receptor subunits that leads to an increase of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation of the dimeric receptor. The PDGF B-chain associates with both PDGFR subtypes (α and β), whereas the A-chain only interacts with the αPDGFR. Therefore, PDGF-AA selectively assembles αα-homodimers (17Gilbertson D.G. Duff M.E.

Upon stimulation with PDGF-AA, the activated αPDGFR recruits and activates several Src homology 2 domain containing signaling molecules, which interact with the activated receptor at specific tyrosine residues once they are phosphorylated as follows: Src family kinases (Src) bind to tyrosines 572 and 574 in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor; the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) interact with tyrosines 720 and 731/42 within the kinase insert, respectively; and a thus far unidentified protein and phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ) associate with tyrosines 988 and 1018 in the C-terminal tail region, respectively.This study focuses on the signal relay mechanisms by which the αPDGFR mediates NAD(P)H oxidase activation and superoxide production in nonphagocytic cells. The role of p47phox and Rac-1 was investigated by targeted gene deletion and pharmacological inhibition. To systematically evaluate the role of each of the signaling enzymes that are recruited to the activated αPDGFR, we stably expressed tyrosine to phenylalanine αPDGFR mutants that fail to associate with one or more of the signaling enzymes (Src, PI3K, PLCγ, and SHP-2) in an αPDGFR-deficient cell line (Ph cells) (19Bazenet C.E.

Furthermore, we sought to investigate the role of specific class IA PI3K isoforms and to evaluate the importance of ROS for PDGF-dependent cellular functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and αPDGFR Mutants—Ph cells and their maintenance were described previously (20Gelderloos J.A.

A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and the viral supernatant was collected for 7 days and concentrated by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 90 min, 4 °C). The virus was titered, and equal amounts of colony-forming units were used to infect Ph cells. The infected cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418, and mass populations of drug-resistant cells were used in all of the experiments.Primary cultures of p47phox(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts were derived from female mice from breeding pairs of p47phox(+/-) mice (kindly provided by Stephen M. Holland) as described previously (25Brüning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The p47phox knock-out mouse, which was created as a murine model for chronic granulomatous disease by targeted disruption of the p47phox gene, was described previously (26Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In brief, female mice were sacrificed on day 16.5 postconception, and embryos were dissected from the uterus. The genotype of the embryos was determined by using DNA extracted from removed embryonic tissues by PCR as described previously (27Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts were isolated by tryptic digest of embryo bodies, suspended, and plated at a density of 106/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and adherent cells were passaged according to the 3T3 protocol of Todaro and Green (28Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Gene deletion of p47phox in embryonic fibroblasts isolated from p47phox(-/-) mice was verified by RT-PCR.Determination of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species—ROS production was investigated by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Subconfluent cells plated on glass carriers were starved by serum deprivation for 24 h and stimulated as indicated. The cells were then washed once in buffer E1 (containing NaCl 135 mmol/liter, KCl 5.4 mmol/liter, CaCl2 1.8 mmol/liter, MgCl2 1 mmol/liter, glucose 10 mmol/liter, HEPES 10 μmol/liter, pH 7.5, 37 °C) and incubated in the dark for 30 min in the same buffer containing 10 mmol/liter 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate (H2DCF-DA, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). H2DCF-DA is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent polar derivative H2DCF and thereby trapped within the cell. In the presence of a proper oxidant, H2DCF is oxidized to the highly fluorescent DCF (29Frenkel K. Gleichauf C. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 12: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Culture dishes were transferred to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), equipped with a 25×, numerical aperture 0.8, oil immersion objective (Plan-Neofluar, Carl Zeiss), and Zeiss LSM 410 confocal attachment, and ROS generation was detected as a result of the oxidation of H2DCF (excitation, 488 nm; emission long pass LP515-nm filter set). 512 × 512 pixel images were collected by single rapid scans and identical parameters, such as contrast and brightness, for all samples. In three separate experiments, five groups of 25 cells each were randomly selected from the image, and fluorescent intensity was measured. Relative fluorescence intensity is expressed as means ± S.D. from three independent experiments, and each value reflects measurements performed on a minimum of 100 cells.Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT) Reduction Assay—Cells were plated in 6-well plates, grown to subconfluency, starved by serum deprivation for 24 h, and stimulated as indicated. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of Hanks' solution (Sigma). Filtered 0.25% NBT (1 ml, 37 °C, Sigma) was added with or without 600 units/ml superoxide dismutase (Sigma), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. They were then harvested, and NBT was pelleted by low speed centrifugation. The NBT pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of pyridine (Sigma) and solubilized by heating for 10 min at 100 °C. Reduced NBT was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 510 nm (extinction coefficient of 11,000 m-1 cm-1) (30Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The amount of released superoxide is reflected by the relative superoxide dismutase-inhibitable NBT reduction (in percent).NAD(P)H Oxidase Activity—NADH or NADPH oxidase activity was measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence in a 50 mmol/liter phosphate buffer (buffer A), pH 7.0, containing 1 mmol/liter EGTA, protease inhibitors (Complete®, Roche Applied Science), 150 mmol/liter sucrose, 5 μmol/liter lucigenin (Sigma), and either 100 μmol/liter NADH or NADPH as substrate (5Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2369) Google Scholar). Quiescent cells were starved by serum deprivation for 24 h and treated as indicated, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and harvested. After low spin centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A, lacking lucigenin and substrate. The cells were then mechanically lysed by using a glass/Teflon potter on ice. The total protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Heidelberg, Germany) and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. 100-μl aliquots of the protein sample were measured over 10 min in quadruplicate using NADH or NADPH as substrate in a scintillation counter (Berthold Lumat LB 9501). Data were collected at 1-min intervals to measure relative changes in NAD(P)H oxidase activity.RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by gandolinium. RNA (3 μg) was converted to cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR amplification using RedTaq® DNA polymerase (Sigma). Sequences for sense and antisense primers, PCR conditions, cycle counts, and amplification fragment lengths of the murine PCR products are given in Table 1.TABLE 1Detection of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits in Ph cellsPrimerConditionsProductbpNox 1S, 5′-AAG TGG CTG TAC TGG TTG GG-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 55 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 39 cycles411A, 5′-CCA CAT AAG AAA ACC CCC ACC G-3′Nox 2S, 5′-CCA GTG AAG ATG TGT TCA GCT A-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 55 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 39 cycles406A, 5′-AGG GTG TTC ACT TGC AAT GGT C-3′Nox 4S, 5′-GAA GCC CAT TTG AGG AGT CA-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 55 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 39 cycles409A, 5′-GGG TCC ACA GCA GAA AAC TC-3′p22phoxS, 5′-GAC GCT TCA CGC AGT GGT ACT-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 65 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 30 cycles485A, 5′-CAC GAC CTC ATC TGT CAC TGG-3′rac1S, 5′-GTA AAA CCT GCC TGC TCA TC-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 55 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 25 cycles692A, 5′-GCT TCG TCA AAC ACT GTC TTG-3′p47phoxS, 5′-CGA AGA AGC CTG AGA CAT ACC-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 65 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 30 cycles414A, 5′-ATA TCC CCT TTC CTG ACC ACC-3′p67phoxS, 5′-AGA CAC CTT GAA CTA CCA TCC-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 58 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 30 cycles473A, 5′-CTG CTC TTC TGC TTT CTT CC-3′p40phoxS, 5′-CAT TGC CAG CCA AAG TCT AC-3′60 min, 94 °C, 60 min, 58 °C, 90 min, 72 °C, 30 cycles498A, 5′-CCT TGA TGG TTT TGC CTG TG-3′ Open table in a new tab Membrane Preparation and Western Blotting—For preparation of membrane and cytosolic proteins, cells were washed with PBS, pelleted, and dissolved in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega; shaken), frozen three times at -80 °C, and sonicated. After centrifugation (10 min, 3000 rpm, 4 °C), the supernatant was transferred into ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Quickseal) and spun for 45 min at 25,000 rpm, 4 °C, in a Beckman NTV 65.2 rotor. The resulting pellet represented the membrane proteins, and the supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using antibodies as indicated. Immunodetection was accomplished using appropriate secondary antibodies as indicated and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences).Overexpression of Dominant-negative Rac-1 (rac-N17)—Ph cells were harvested and resuspended in electroporation medium (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany; MEF Nucleofector™ kit) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. The following constructs were transfected: insertless vector (pcDNA3) as control and pRK5-myc-rac1-N17 (dominant-negative Rac-1 mutant) (31Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3052) Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 100 μl of cell suspension were placed in a 0.2-cm cuvette and mixed, and transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were plated and cultured for 24 h prior to treatment with PDGF-AA or vehicle.Quantitative Immunocytochemistry—Antibody staining was performed on cells mounted on glass slides. Monoclonal anti-human Rac-1 and polyclonal anti-p47phox were each used at a final concentration of 1:50. Cells were washed in sterile PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (4 °C), and permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (PBST) (Sigma). Subsequently, they were incubated for 1 h in 0.01% PBST containing 10% fat-free milk powder to reduce nonspecific binding and further incubated for 2 h with primary antibody. After washing three times in PBS (0.1%), cells were incubated for 60 min in PBST (0.01%) supplemented with 10% milk powder and either a Cy5-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) or Cy5-conjugated F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:100). Excitation was performed using 633-nm helium-neon laser of the confocal setup. Emission was recorded using a long pass LP 655-nm filter set. For quantification of the optical signal, and the aim to measure signals in a mainly membrane-containing cellular volume, confocal images were recorded from cells grown in monolayers by tangential scans through the cell “caps.” The pinhole settings of the confocal setup were adjusted to yield optical slices of 2.5 μm. After subtraction from background fluorescence measured by cells stained with secondary antibody alone, the signal was counted by image analysis software of the confocal setup of the area of interest (“membrane fraction”) and exported for data processing to the Sigma Plot graphical software. At least three independent experiments were performed for each condition, and 25 randomly selected cells were recorded and analyzed in each experiment. Thus, each value reflects measurements performed on a minimum of 75 cells.BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—DNA synthesis was measured by a 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates to ∼90% confluence, washed, fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and starved for 24 h. PDGF-AA was added to cells for 18 h at the indicated concentrations. The BrdUrd incorporation assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Applied Science) with an incorporation time of 5 h.Chemotaxis Assay—PDGF-dependent chemotaxis was assayed utilizing a 48-well modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe Inc., Baltimore) and polyvinyl pyridine-free polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size) (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA) as described (32Godwin S.L. Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11307-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower wells of the chamber were filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.1% calf serum supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA or vehicle. The filters were coated with 50 μg/ml rat type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) and fixed atop the bottom wells. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% calf serum to a final concentration of 4 × 105 cells per ml, and 50 μl of this cell suspension was placed into the top wells of the chamber. In each experiment, at least 6 of the 48 wells of the chamber were used for each condition examined. The chamber was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Antibodies and Inhibitors—Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin was kindly provided by K. Aktories (University of Freiburg, Germany). Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), wortmannin, N-acetylcysteine, PEG catalase, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyacetophenone (apocynin) were purchased from Sigma. LY294002 was from Merck, and TGX-221 was from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). PIK75 was a kind gift from Peter R. Shepherd (University of Auckland, New Zealand). For immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, the following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-human Rac-1 (catalog number 05-389, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-p47phox (sc-7660, sc-7660, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The RasGAP antibody (69.3) was kindly provided by Andrius Kazlauskas (Harvard Medical School, Boston).Statistical Analysis—Data are given as means ± S.D. Student's t test for unpaired data was applied as appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSThe αPDGFR Induces Intracellular ROS Production via NAD(P)H Oxidase—To investigate whether αPDGFR activation induces the liberation of ROS in fibroblasts, intracellular ROS levels were determined by DCF fluorescence. Selective stimulation of the αPDGFR with PDGF-AA (50 ng/ml) in WT αPDGFR expressing Ph cells led to a time-dependent increase of intracellular ROS, which was maximally 189 ± 24% at 4 h (Fig. 1, A-C).Recent research focused on the molecular and biochemical characterization of growth factor-induced ROS production in nonphagocytic cells. Several authors proved the role of a phagocyte like NAD(P)H oxidase in this context. To identify the source of PDGF-AA-dependent ROS formation in our cells, we used common inhibitors of enzymes capable of ROS production. As shown in Fig. 1D, the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI (10 μmol/liter), a rather nonspecific but highly effective inhibitor of FAD-containing proteins like NAD(P)H oxidase, completely abolished ROS production induced by PDGF-AA. Other more specific inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase such as the serine protease AEBSF (10 μmol/liter) (33Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wikstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol.

By differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, we measured and mapped changes in the collagen melting temperature (ΔTm) for 41 different Gly substitutions from 47 OI patients. In contrast to peptides, we found no correlations of ΔTm with the identity of the substituting residue. Instead, we observed regular variations in ΔTm with the substitution location in different triple helix regions. To relate the ΔTm map to peptide-based stability predictions, we extracted the activation energy of local helix unfolding (ΔG‡) from the reported peptide data. We constructed the ΔG‡ map and tested it by measuring the H-D exchange rate for glycine NH residues involved in interchain hydrogen bonds. Based on the ΔTm and ΔG‡ maps, we delineated regional variations in the collagen triple helix stability. Two large, flexible regions deduced from the ΔTm map aligned with the regions important for collagen fibril assembly and ligand binding. One of these regions also aligned with a lethal region for Gly substitutions in the α1(I) chain.

One of these regions also aligned with a lethal region for Gly substitutions in the α1(I) chain. The mature type I collagen molecule is a 300-nm-long triple helix formed by two α1(I) and one α2(I) chains, which is flanked by short terminal peptides. Based on the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)338 triplet repeat within each chain (1Chu M.-L. Prockop D.J. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 223-248Google Scholar), the triple helix is commonly viewed as a single domain (Xaa and Yaa stand for variable residues). However, this picture may not accurately represent variations in the stability of different regions within the triple helix that fold and unfold cooperatively (2Privalov P.L. Tiktopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Privalov P.L. Adv.

The more labile regions may exist in a loose conformation, constantly undergoing unfolding/refolding transitions while more stable “clamp” regions prevent unfolding of the whole molecule (3Privalov P.L.

Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) of collagen fibers. Significant progress in understanding regional variations in the triple helix stability in different collagens has been reported in recent years. For example, some flexible sites were localized by observing triple helix bending in electron microscopy (14Hofmann H. Voss T. Kuhn K. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 325-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and/or increased susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage (9Ryhanen L. Zaragoza E.J. Uitto J. Arch. Biochem.

Genetically generated reshuffling of different triple helix regions was shown to have a significant effect on the overall stability of the molecule (11Arnold W.V. Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hattori H.

Relative local stability maps were proposed based on scoring different sequences (17Bachinger H.P. Davis J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or on the denaturation temperature (Tm) measured for triple-helical host-guest peptides (18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B.

The existence of looser, less stable, and tighter, more stable structural regions within the triple helix is now commonly accepted. However, knowledge of their locations, properties, and role in type I collagen function is still incomplete. In particular, it is still not understood if and how these regions affect the osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) 3The abbreviations used are: OIosteogenesis imperfectaEDSEhler-Danlos syndromeCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryMLBRmajor ligand-binding region. phenotype. osteogenesis imperfecta Ehler-Danlos syndrome 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid differential scanning calorimetry major ligand-binding region. OI is an autosomal dominant bone disorder caused primarily by mutations in type I collagen (19Byers P.H. Cole W.G. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders.

Saunders Co., Philadelphia2007: 2887-2890Google Scholar). Over 80% of lethal to moderately severe cases result from substitutions of the obligatory Gly residues that disrupt the triple helix, clearly pointing to structural defects as the underlying cause (21Marini J.C. Forlino A. Cabral W.A. Barnes A.M. San Antonio J.D. Milgrom S. Hyland J.C. Korkko J. Prockop D.J. De Paepe A. Coucke P. Symoens S. Glorieux F.H. Roughley P.J. Lund A.M. Kuurila-Svahn K. Hartikka H.

However, no correlations of OI severity with the predicted local stability of the helix at the substitution site or with the change in the measured denaturation temperature of the whole helix (ΔTm) were found (17Bachinger H.P.

Regional variations in collagen structure and stability may modulate the structural and functional consequences of otherwise similar mutations, thereby contributing to the lack of simple correlations between the structural disruptions and OI phenotype. Note that by local properties or disruptions of the triple helix we mean those involving less than 5-10 adjacent Gly-Xaa-Yaa (GXY) triplets. This is the characteristic distance scale of variations in the reported local stability maps (17Bachinger H.P. Davis J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We refer to disruptions or average helix properties on much larger distance scales as regional. One approach to better understanding regional variations in the triple helix structure and stability is a systematic study of molecules with Gly substitutions by the same techniques under similar conditions. For instance, such studies of α1(I) mutations at the N-terminal end of collagen allowed us to delineate a highly stable N-anchor region separated from the rest of the triple helix by a flexible microunfolding site (29Makareeva E. Cabral W.A. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This region is formed by ∼85 N-terminal residues in each chain (see “Discussion”). Mutations within this region cause structural changes in the molecule, resulting in a distinct OI/EDS phenotype with significant ligament laxity, characteristic of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) (30Cabral W.A. Makareeva E. Colige A. Letocha A.D. Ty J.M. Yeowell H.N. Pals G. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19259-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Analysis of these structural changes allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism for the EDS-like symptoms (29Makareeva E. Cabral W.A. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Cabral W.A. Makareeva E. Colige A. Letocha A.D. Ty J.M. Yeowell H.N. Pals G. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19259-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Another approach is to continue development of the local stability models. Many efforts were invested into detailed studies of collagen-like peptides with different sequences (see e.g. Refs. 18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 28Radmer R.J. Klein T.E.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 2683-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and references therein). We utilized the peptide-based local stability models (17Bachinger H.P. Davis J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) as one of the tools for delineating the N-anchor region (29Makareeva E. Cabral W.A. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, accurate evaluation of the local stability of full-length collagens from such data is still a challenge (18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The existing models have not been experimentally tested as yet. In the present study, we combine both of these approaches: (i) We report measurements of ΔTm for 41 Gly substitutions from OI patients, all performed at the same conditions by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. We test the effects of the identity and the position of the substitution along the triple helix. We differentiate contributions from molecules with different chain composition and map ΔTm for molecules with one mutant chain. (ii) We generalize the peptide-based models for quantitative prediction of the local stability of type I collagen. We test the predictions and determine the corresponding model parameters by measuring the H-D exchange kinetics of glycine amides involved in interchain hydrogen bonds. (iii) Based on the measured ΔTm map and calculated local stability map, we discuss regional variations in the triple helix stability and structure. We delineate two large, flexible regions, which may be important for collagen-collagen interactions, ligand binding, and OI phenotypes. To better understand our findings and eliminate potential artifacts, we utilize a variety of techniques and approaches. In the main text, we focus only on the most crucial results and ideas. The auxiliary techniques, results, and analyses are presented in the supplemental material. Human Procollagen–Skin fibroblast cultures were established from dermal punch biopsies collected from OI patients under an IRB-approved protocol. Normal control cells CRL-2127 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); GM04501, GM04503, GM07525, GM07753 were purchased from Coriell cell repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). Fibroblasts were grown to confluence at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in the presence of 5% CO2. Cultures were stimulated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml ascorbate. After 24 h, medium was harvested, buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, mixed with protease inhibitors (25 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.2% NaN3,) and cooled to 4 °C. Procollagen from media was precipitated by 176 mg/ml ammonium sulfate. Pepsin-treated Human Collagen–The ammonium sulfate precipitates were suspended in 0.5 m acetic acid and digested by pepsin (∼0.1 mg/ml, ∼1:10 pepsin:collagen) overnight at 4 °C. After digestion, collagen was selectively precipitated with 0.9 m NaCl (final concentration), suspended in 0.5 m acetic acid, and reprecipitated with 0.7 m NaCl. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and redissolved and dialyzed against 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol buffer, pH 7.4. Purity of the preparation, triple helix resistance to pepsin at 4 °C, and the content of type III and type V collagens were evaluated by gel electrophoresis as described previously (29Makareeva E. Cabral W.A. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Collagen concentration in each preparation was measured by circular dichroism (see below). Rat Tail Tendon Fibers–Frozen tails of 6-week-old rats were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals and stored at -80 °C. Tendons were excised, washed in 3.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5 and stored in this buffer at 4 °C. Crystalline organization of collagen in tendon fibrils was disrupted by overnight equilibration in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 1 m glycerol, pH 7.5 at 4 °C. Tendons were washed in 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 for several hours at 25 °C. A small fiber was separated from tendon with needlepoint tweezers, stretched, covered by a droplet of the NaCl/HEPES buffer, sandwiched between two 13 × 2 mm, round CaF2 infrared windows (one window with “in” and “out” ports for solution exchange) and sealed by a thin layer of ultra high-vacuum Apiezon L grease (M&I Materials, Manchester, UK) around window perimeter. Differential Scanning Calorimetry–DSC measurements were performed with 0.1-0.4 mg/ml procollagen and pepsin-treated collagen solutions in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.4. The thermograms were recorded from 10 to 60 °C in Nano II or Nano III calorimeters (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation, Lindon, UT). Except for α2(I)-G805D, all mutant collagens were scanned at 0.125 or 0.25 °C/min heating rate. We found that this 2-fold change in the heating rate results in a 0.4 ± 0.1 °C shift of the whole thermogram with negligible distortion of the shape of the denaturation peaks. Because of limited protein amount, α2(I)-G805D was scanned only at 1 °C/min, which results in a detectable distortion of the peak shape, reducing the accuracy of ΔTm measurement to ∼0.5 °C. All thermograms were corrected by subtraction of a linear baseline and normalized per unit collagen concentration (for quantitative analysis) or to give the same peak height (for visual comparison). To extract the contribution of type I collagen, whenever necessary normalized thermograms of purified human type III and type V collagens (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) were multiplied by their fractions in the sample and subtracted from the thermogram of the mixture (29Makareeva E. Cabral W.A. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of mutant peaks in DSC thermograms was performed with the PeakFit software (Systat, PointRichmond, CA). Circular Dichroism–CD spectra of pepsin-treated, purified collagen in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.4 (PGB) or in 2 mm HCl, pH 2.7 were measured in a quartz microcuvette with 1-cm optical path length in a J810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PFD-425S thermoelectric temperature controller (Jasco, Easton, MD). Collagen concentration in the solution was evaluated from the ellipticity at 221 nm at 20-25 °C. Triple helix unfolding upon heating was evaluated from the ellipticity change at 223.8 nm (see supplemental material). The temperature in the cuvette was calibrated by a thermocouple probe inserted into the buffer solution. CD spectra were recorded after 2-5 min equilibration at the selected temperature. Infrared (IR) spectra of solvated rat tail tendon fibers were measured in a Continuum IR microscope attached to a Nexus 670 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with a 15× Reflechromat IR objective/condenser and a narrow band MCT/A detector (Thermo Electron Corp., Madison, WI). Tendon fibers sandwiched between CaF2 IR windows were mounted in a custom built, thermostated (±0.05 °C), flow-through IR cell with built-in passive compensation for thermal expansion (United States Patent Applications 10/926,405; 11/826,806). The cell was designed for high mechanical and optical stability, allowing measurements of highly reproducible spectra (±10-4 OD units) of solvated samples (33Mertz E.L. Leikin S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14901-14912Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mounted sample was flattened by slight mechanical pressure to the optical path of 5-7 μm and extensively washed with 3 mm CAPS, 5 mm NaCl, pH 10.0 solution. The IR beam was restricted by a 150 × 40 μm rectangular mask and positioned in the middle of a ∼70-μm wide collagen sample. To obtain isotropic spectra, the beam was polarized before the sample with a BaF2 holographic polarizer at the “magic angle” of 55 deg with respect to the fiber direction. The spectra were collected from 900 to 7000 cm-1 at 4 cm-1 resolution by accumulation of 50-200 interferograms, depending on the desired time resolution. The H-D exchange reaction was initiated by rapid (≤10 s) replacement of the H2O buffer with a D2O buffer with matching buffer composition and pD (glass electrode reading +0.4). The disappearance of water O-H spectral bands (3000-3700 cm-1) indicated replacement of all interstitial H2O by D2O within 1 min. The spectra were collected with 1-30 min periodicity for up to a week at constant temperature. The fraction of unexchanged Gly-NH groups involved in interchain hydrogen bonds was measured at pD 10 from intensities of amide II (integrated from 1515 to 1600 cm-1) and amide A (integrated from 3150 to 3450 cm-1) bands. The intensities within these spectral regions in collagen with fully deuterated Gly amides were measured after pre-equilibration at 50 °C, pD 10 for 10 h. For quantitative analysis and comparison with experiments, we describe local stability of collagen in terms of activation energy for local triple helix unfolding. We calculate this activation energy from the amino acid sequence of collagen and apparent denaturation temperatures (Tm) of host-guest peptides reported by Persikov et al. (18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) within the following model. Denaturation of Host-guest Peptides–The Tm of host-guest peptides have been investigated mostly in a kinetically limited regime, in which the transition is irreversible at the experimental time scale (34Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At the same heating rate, the activation free energy of the transition G‡ is related to the apparent Tm as in Equation 1 (see supplemental material). δG‡≈H0‡T0δTm(Eq. 1) Here T0 is a reference temperature; δTm = Tm - T0, and δG‡ = G‡ (T0) - G0‡, and G0‡ and H0‡ are the activation free energy and enthalpy for a reference peptide which denatures at T0. Hereafter we refer to thermodynamic potentials only at the reference temperature T0 and omit the corresponding argument in their notation. Based on empirical δTm (18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and Equation 1, the change in the activation energy δGGXY upon changing one GXY triplet can be approximated by Equation 2, δGGXY≈H0‡T0(δTmGXY+δTintGXY)(Eq. 2) where δTmGXY is a component of δTm independent of adjacent triplets and δTintGXY is a correction for interaction with nearest neighbor triplets. The values of δTmGXY and δTintGXY for all common triplet sequences were tabulated by Persikov et al. (18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Local Stability and Unfolding of Type I Collagen–For full-length collagen triple helices, we use the following additional assumptions. (i) Local unfolding is opening of at least one GXY triplet i, which breaks interchain hydrogen bonds and exposes buried Gly-NH to water. It affects adjacent triplets j whose contribution is weighted by exp-(i-j)2/n2], where n characterizes the extent of the perturbation. (ii) The sequence dependence of the activation energies is the same in collagen and host-guest peptides. (iii) The contribution of each chain in type I collagen is independent and additive, even though type I collagen is a heterotrimer while all studied host-guest peptides were homotrimers (18Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Within this model, the difference ΔGi‡=Gi‡-Gref‡ between the activation free energy for local unfolding at triplet i (Gi‡) and within a reference sequence (Gref‡) is Equation 3, ΔGi‡=ΣjδGjexp[-(i-j)2/n2](Eq. 3) where δGi = (2/3)δGGXY(α1) + (1/3)δGGXY(α2), δGGXY(α1), and δGGXY(α2) are given by Equation 2, and GXY(α1) and GXY(α2) are the sequences within α1(I) and α2(I) chains of the triplet j, respectively. H-D Exchange Kinetics–In the IR experiment at pD 10, only glycine amides contribute to the kinetics of H-D exchange. All other exchangeable protons are substituted instantaneously. The kinetics is determined entirely by local unfolding exposing glycine amides to water, after which the exchange is instantaneous as well. We approximate the number of unexchanged protons in glycine amides at time t after replacing H2O by D2O by Equation 4, N(t)=Σiexp(-kit)(Eq. 4) where, as above, the index i labels GXY triplets in the triple helix and Equation 5, ki=k0exp(-ΔGi‡/RT)(Eq. 5) is the characteristic rate constant for local triple helix unfolding at the triplet i, ΔGi‡=Gi‡-Gref‡ is given by Equation 3, R is the universal molar gas constant, and k0 is the local H-D exchange rate constant within the same reference sequence as used for the definition of Gref‡. Thermal Stability of Gly Substitution Mutants–We systematically examined thermal stability of type I collagen secreted by cultured fibroblasts from 5 normal controls and 47 heterozygous patients with 41 different Gly substitutions. We measured DSC thermograms of pepsin-treated collagen at 0.125-1 °C/min heating rate (Figs. 1 and 2; Table 1) in 0.5 m glycerol, 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4.FIGURE 2Normalized DSC thermograms of selected collagens with Gly → Ser substitutions at different locations (measured and corrected as described in the legend to Fig. 1). In α1(I)-G352S, α1(I)-G448S, and α2(I)-G706S the contributions from molecules with two, one, and no mutant chains are fused into a single, broadened peak (see supplemental material). The normal control thermogram (dashed line) is overlaid onto α1(I)-G352S and α2(I)-G706S thermograms for better visualization of the peak broadening and apparent Tm shift caused by the mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Collagen composition The numbers in parentheses indicate ΔTm and % fraction of molecules with two mutant chains determined from DSC deconvolution (G76E and G523C) and S-S dimer intensity in gel electrophoresis (G313C, G523C, and G967C).

https://openalex.org/W2066602777,"THAP1, the founding member of a previously uncharacterized large family of cellular proteins (THAP proteins), is a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor that has recently been shown to regulate cell proliferation through modulation of pRb/E2F cell cycle target genes. THAP1 shares its DNA-binding THAP zinc finger domain with Drosophila P element transposase, zebrafish E2F6, and several nematode proteins interacting genetically with the retinoblastoma protein pRb. In this study, we report the three-dimensional structure and structure-function relationships of the THAP zinc finger of human THAP1. Deletion mutagenesis and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy revealed that the THAP domain of THAP1 is an atypical zinc finger of ∼80 residues, distinguished by the presence between the C2CH zinc coordinating residues of a short antiparallel β-sheet interspersed by a long loop-helix-loop insertion. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this loop-helix-loop motif resulted in the identification of a number of critical residues for DNA recognition. NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis was used to further characterize the residues involved in DNA binding. The combination of the mutagenesis and NMR data allowed the mapping of the DNA binding interface of the THAP zinc finger to a highly positively charged area harboring multiple lysine and arginine residues. Together, these data represent the first structure-function analysis of a functional THAP domain, with demonstrated sequence-specific DNA binding activity.

Zinc finger proteins represent the most abundant class of DNA-binding proteins in the human genome. Zinc fingers have been defined as small, functional, independently folded domains that require coordination of a zinc atom to stabilize their structure (1Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The zinc finger superfamily includes the C2H2-type zinc finger, a compact ∼30-amino acid DNA-binding module repeated in multiple copies in the protein structure (2Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O.

We recently described an atypical zinc finger motif, characterized by a large C2CH module (Cys-X2-4-Cys-X35-53-Cys-X2-His) with a spacing of up to 53 amino acids between the zinc-coordinating C2 and CH residues (6Roussigne M.

This motif, designated THAP domain or THAP zinc finger, defines a previously uncharacterized large family of cellular factors with more than 100 distinct members in the animal kingdom (6Roussigne M.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2432-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), possesses zinc-dependent sequence-specific DNA binding activity and recognizes a consensus DNA target sequence of 11 nucleotides (THABS, for the THAP1 binding sequence) (7Clouaire T.

Although the biological roles of cellular THAP proteins remain largely unknown, data supporting an important function in cell proliferation and cell cycle control have recently been provided. We found that human THAP1 is an endogenous physiological regulator of endothelial cell proliferation and G1/S cell cycle progression, which modulates expression of several pRb 4The abbreviations used are: pRbretinoblastoma proteinDTTdithiothreitolRRLrabbit reticulocyte lysateSPRsurface plasmon resonanceEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaywtwild typer.m.s.d.root mean square deviation.4The abbreviations used are: pRbretinoblastoma proteinDTTdithiothreitolRRLrabbit reticulocyte lysateSPRsurface plasmon resonanceEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaywtwild typer.m.s.d.root mean square deviation./E2F cell cycle target genes. In addition, we identified RRM1, aG1/S-regulated gene required for S-phase DNA synthesis, as a direct transcriptional target of endogenous THAP1 (10Cayrol C. Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V. Dessen P. Mantovani R. Aguilar L. Girard J.P. Blood. 2007; 109: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These data provided the first links in mammals between THAP proteins, cell proliferation, and pRB/E2F cell cycle pathways and complemented genetic data previously obtained in model animal organisms. Indeed, in zebra fish and other fish species, the ortholog of cell cycle transcription factor E2F6, a repressor of E2F-dependent transcription during S phase (11Giangrande P.H. Zhu W. Schlisio S. Sun X. Mori S. Gaubatz S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2941-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was found to contain a THAP zinc finger at its N terminus (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, five distinct THAP zinc finger proteins (LIN-36, LIN-15B, LIN-15A, HIM-17, and GON-14) (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among these, GON-14 appeared to function as a positive regulator of cell proliferation, because cell division defects were observed in the intestine, gonad, and vulva of gon-14 null mutant (16Chesney M.A. Kidd A.R. Kimble 3rd, J. Genetics. 2006; 172: 915-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, LIN-36 and LIN-15B, initially characterized for their role in the specification of vulval cell fates (synthetic Multivulva class B genes, synMuvB) (12Ferguson E.L. Horvitz H.R.

Biol. 2002; 12: 906-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LIN-36 behaved most similar to LIN-35/Rb and Efl-1/E2F, the ortholog of mammalian cell cycle transcription factors E2F4/5, and was therefore proposed to act in a transcriptional repressor complex with these factors to repress G1/S control genes (14Boxem M. van den Heuvel S.

However, LIN-36, LIN-15B, and THAP1 were not found in the evolutionary conserved pRb/E2F protein complexes (DREAM or DRM complexes) that have recently been described in Drosophila, C. elegans, and human cells and that contain pRb/p130, E2F4/5, DP, and five other synMuvB gene products LIN-9, LIN-37, LIN-52, LIN-53, LIN-54 (19Lewis P.W.

This suggests that THAP zinc finger proteins may function in distinct transcriptional regulatory complexes to regulate E2F target genes. Although not associated with Rb complexes, THAP zinc finger proteins may still act at the level of chromatin regulation because several C. elegans THAP family members have been found to interact genetically with components of diverse chromatin-modifying and/or chromatin-remodeling complexes, including members of the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complexes and components of the Tip60/NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex (12Ferguson E.L.

Solution structures of the THAP domains from two previously uncharacterized proteins, human THAP2 and C. elegans CtBP, have recently been reported (THAP2, PDB code 2D8R; CtBP, PDB code 2JM3 (26Liew C.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Nicholas H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). However, sequence-specific DNA binding properties have not yet been demonstrated for these two domains. Here, we report the first structure-function analysis of a functional THAP domain, the THAP zinc finger of human THAP1. The three-dimensional structure of the domain was determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and its DNA binding interface was characterized by a combination of alanine scanning mutagenesis and NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis. Together, these data provide a better understanding of the structure-function relationships of this atypical zinc finger. Plasmid Constructions–The THAP domain of human THAP1 (Met1-Phe81 or Met1-Lys90; GenBank™ NP_060575) was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with a C-terminal His tag into a modified pET-26 plasmid (Novagen). The pET-21c-THAP domain expression vectors for human THAP2 (residues 1-90; GenBank™ NP_113623), human THAP3 (residues 1-92; GenBank™ AAH92427), C. elegans CtBP (residues 1-88; GenBank™ NP_508983), and C. elegans GON-14 (residues 1-84; GenBank™ NP_741558) were generated by PCR as previously described for the pET-21c-THAP1 (Met1-Lys90) plasmid (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Construction of the pcDNA3-THAP1 eukaryotic expression vector has previously been described (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The THAP1 alanine-scanning single point and triple mutants were obtained by PCR using specific primers containing the corresponding mutations, and cloned as EcoRI-XbaI fragments in the pcDNA3 expression vector. Protein Expression and Purification–For NMR experiments, recombinant THAP domains of human THAP1 (Met1-Lys90) and (Met1-Phe81) were produced as His tag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, to obtain an unlabeled sample. ZnCl2 was added at this step (final concentration of 0.1 mm). Isotopically 15N/13C-labeled THAP domain (Met1-Lys90) and 15N-labeled THAP domain (Met1-Phe81)) were expressed in minimal (M9) medium containing 15NH4Cl and 15N Celtone and either [13C]glucose or [12C]glucose. Proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA column (HiTrap, Amersham Biosciences) followed by gel-filtration chromatography on Sephadex G75 (Amersham Biosciences). After digestion with thrombin (Novagen), proteins were further purified on a gel filtration column. NMR samples were concentrated to 0.4-1.7 mm in 50 mm deuterated Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm DTT with either 10 mm NaCl (for protein structure determination) or 250 mm NaCl (for DNA binding studies). For gel-shift assays, the recombinant THAP domain of human THAP1 was produced as previously described (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The recombinant THAP domains of THAP2, THAP3, Ce-CtBP, or GON-14 were produced in E. coli strain BL21trxB(DE3), transformed with the different pET-21c-THAP domain expression vectors. Protein expression and purification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI), as previously described (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The purity of the different THAP domains was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Full-length THAP1 wild-type and mutants were synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). The corresponding pcDNA3 expression vectors were used with the TNT-T7 kit (Promega). Protein production was performed in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine and verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments–DNA interaction kinetics was investigated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays using a four channel BIAcore 3000 optical biosensor instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Immobilization of biotinylated single-stranded DNA probes was performed on a streptavidin-coated sensorchip (BIAcore SA sensorchip) in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.0005% Surfactant P20) (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All immobilization steps of biotinylated single-stranded DNA probes were performed at a final DNA concentration of 100 ng/ml and at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Hybridization of complementary DNA strands was performed in HBS-EP buffer supplemented with 200 mm NaCl. Biotinylated oligonucleotide sequences and complementary DNA strands were purchased from MWG Biotech. Binding analyses were performed with multiple injections of THAP domain (Met1-Lys90) at different protein concentrations over the immobilized surfaces at 25 °C. A second DNA probe with unrelated sequence was used as a control. All samples were diluted in the running buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and were injected over the sensor surface for 4 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. No binding was observed to the DNA probe with unrelated sequence. The SPR signal was therefore analyzed as difference sensorgrams between the two DNA sequences immobilized to separate channels of the sensor chip (the signal from the unrelated DNA used as control was subtracted). NMR Spectroscopy–NMR experiments were recorded at 296 K on Bruker Avance 800, 700, and 600 MHz spectrometers. Backbone and side-chain resonances (1H, 15N, and 13C) of the THAP domain (Met1-Lys90) were assigned using a set of heteronuclear experiments (27Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griedinger C. Progr. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectr. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). This information was partially used to assign 1H and 15N resonances of the THAP domain (Met1-Phe81) using a combination of homonuclear and 15N heteronuclear spectra. φ/ψ torsion angles were derived using TALOS (28Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and the 3JHN-Hα coupling constants obtained from three-dimensional HNHA (29Ponstingl H. Otting G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Four X-Pro bonds were identified as being in the trans-configuration on the basis of strong NOEs between the Hδ proton of each Pro residue and the Hα protons of the preceding residues (30Wüthrich, K. (1986) NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, pp. 122-125, Wiley PressGoogle Scholar) and confirmed by 13C chemical shifts (31Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). From characteristic NOEs, the residue Pro26 was identified as being in the cis form (30Wüthrich, K. (1986) NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, pp. 122-125, Wiley PressGoogle Scholar). 15 stereo-specific assignments of Hβ methylene were obtained using the DQF-COSY spectrum (32Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed using TOPSPIN software (Bruker) and NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar) and analyzed using XEASY (34Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) and NMRView (35Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). 15N relaxation data were recorded at 296 K on a 0.9-mm protein sample at 10 mm and 250 mm NaCl using standard pulse sequences. The heteronuclear NOEs were determined from two 15N HSQC spectra recorded in the presence and absence of 1H presaturation period of 3 s and with a recycling delay of 5 s (36Auguin D. Barthe P. Auge-Senegas M.T. Stern M.H. Noguchi M. Roumestand C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations–To solve the structure of the THAP domain (Met1-Phe81), a set of distances was extracted from integration of two-dimensional 1H and three-dimensional 15N heteronuclear NOESY spectra. The secondary structure elements were derived from analysis of coupling constants, from identification of slowly exchanging amide protons and from characteristic NOEs. To maintain well-defined secondary structure elements, hydrogen bonds were added with restraints of 1.8 to 2.4 imposed on the distance between hydrogen and acceptor oxygen and restraints of 2.3 to 3.2 imposed on the distance between the donor nitrogen and acceptor oxygen. Preliminary structure calculations run either with Nδ1 or Nϵ2 of the His57 ring allowed us to identify Nϵ2 as the zinc-bound atom. Subsequent structural refinement including a zinc ion together with constraints defining tetrahedral coordination (3Lee M.S. Gippert G.P. Soman K.V. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1989; 245: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 37Daikun G.P. Fairall L. Klug A. Nature. 1986; 324: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was performed. The structures were calculated using a torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol using the CNS software suite (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). From 500 initial structures, a set of 20 structures were selected as accepted structures, based on the following criterions: low total energy, no distance violation larger than 0.2 Å and no torsion angle violation greater than 2°. Their structural quality was analyzed using PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). NMR Chemical Shift Perturbation Analysis–The 14-bp duplex DNA containing THABS was reconstituted by hybridizing the following oligonucleotides, 5′-CAAGTATGGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGCCCATACTTG-3′ in a 1:1 ratio. For NMR titration, two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra of the THAP domain at the concentration of 0.4 mm were collected at 296 K and 250 mm NaCl after each incremental addition of lyophilized DNA. One-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded after each DNA addition and the DNA/protein ratio was followed from integration of 1H protein and DNA signals on the 1H spectra. A DNA fragment with an unrelated sequence was reconstituted by hybridizing the oligonucleotides, 5′-GATTTGCATTTTAA-3′ and 5′-TTAAAATGCAAATC-3′, and added to the THAP domain following the same procedure as described above. Normalized chemical shift changes were calculated as: Δδ = [(ΔδHN)2 + (ΔδN × 0.154)2]1/2. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)–EMSA were performed with purified recombinant THAP domains produced in E. coli or with full-length THAP1 wild type or THAP1 mutants synthesized in vitro in RRL, using the following THABS probes, 25-bp (5′-AGCAAGTAAGGGCAAACTACTTCAT-3′) and 36-bp (5′-TATCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACGGGCAACAGGTAATG-3′), as previously described (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of purified recombinant THAP domains were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 10 μg/ml poly(dI/dC)). For in vitro translated proteins, 3 μl of RRLs expressing full-length THAP proteins or THAP1 mutants were incubated in 20 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 50 μg/ml of poly(dI/dC) and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Electrophoresis was performed and gels were exposed as previously described (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Supershift experiments were performed using 1 μg of anti-THAP1 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies (10Cayrol C.

Model Building of the Complex between the THAP Zinc Finger and the THABS Sequence–Computational docking of the THABS DNA target onto the THAP zinc finger (Met1-Phe81) of THAP1 was performed using HADDOCK1.3 (High Ambiguity Driven DOCKing) (40Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar), in conjunction with CNS (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). The docking was performed using an ensemble of THAP zinc finger structures of THAP1 and the 14-bp double-stranded DNA containing THABS built as a B-DNA template using Insight II (Accelrys). The active residues used to define the Ambiguous Interaction restraints (AIR) included residues showing relative solvent accessibility higher than 40% (as calculated by NACESS, Hubbard and Thornton, University College London) and either displaying a chemical shift perturbation higher than 0.2 ppm upon DNA binding or giving rise to loss of DNA binding from site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, active residues were Lys24, Glu37, Arg42, Lys46, and Thr48. Solvent accessible residues that were surface neighbors of the active residues were defined as passive residues including Lys34, Glu35, Ala38, Arg41, Lys43, Asn44, Lys49, and Tyr50. For DNA, bases corresponding to the core GGCA motif of the THABS sequence together with the thymine upstream were defined as active residues, as based on already reported data obtained from scanning mutagenesis (7Clouaire T. Roussigne M. Ecochard V. Mathe C. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The docking was performed on a SGI cluster equipped with 40 processors. Starting from 15 THAP domain structures of THAP1 and a model of the THABS target in B-DNA conformation, 1000 rigid-body solutions were generated. The best 200 solutions according to the HADDOCK rigid-body score were selected for semi-flexible refinement in torsion angle space; th"

In this study, we examined the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK5, an MAPK and specific substrate for MEK5) in prostate cancer. ERK5 immunoreactivity was significantly upregulated in high-grade prostate cancer when compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (P<0.0001). Increased ERK5 cytoplasmic signals correlated closely with Gleason sum score (P<0.0001), bony metastases (P=0.0044) and locally advanced disease at diagnosis (P=0.0023), with a weak association with shorter disease-specific survival (P=0.036). A subgroup of patients showed strong nuclear ERK5 localization, which correlated with poor disease-specific survival and, on multivariant analysis, was an independent prognostic factor (P<0.0001). Analysis of ERK5 expression in matched tumor pairs (before and after hormone relapse, n=26) revealed ERK5 nuclear expression was significantly associated with hormone-insensitive disease (P=0.0078). Similarly, ERK5 protein expression was increased in an androgen-independent LNCaP subline. We obtained the following in vitro and in vivo evidence to support the above expression data: (1) cotransfection of ERK5wt and MEK5D constructs in PC3 cells results in predominant ERK5 nuclear localization, similar to that observed in aggressive clinical disease; (2) ERK5-overexpressing PC3 cells have enhanced proliferative, migrative and invasive capabilities in vitro (P<0.0001), and were dramatically more efficient in forming tumors, with a shorter mean time for tumors to reach a critical volume of 1000 mm3, in vivo (P<0.0001); (3) the MEK1 inhibitor, PD184352, blocking ERK1/2 activation at low dose, did not suppress proliferation but did significantly decrease proliferation at a higher dose required to inhibit ERK5 activation. Taken together, our results establish the potential importance of ERK5 in aggressive prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2060034283,"Recent studies indicate that estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are involved in similar estrogen receptor (ER) regulatory pathways and play roles in energy and lipid metabolism. Here, we analysed the functional role of ERRbeta in prostate cancer cell growth regulation in an androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines. ERRbeta was expressed in normal human prostates, but exhibited a reduced expression in prostate cancer lesions. Stable ERRbeta expression suppressed significantly cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of LNCaP and DU145 cells, accompanied by an S-phase suppression and increased p21 expression. Reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that ERRbeta could directly transactivate p21 gene promoter, which could be further enhanced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha. Truncation analysis showed that ERRbeta-mediated p21 transactivation and prostate cancer cell growth inhibition required intact DNA-binding domain and AF2 domains in ERRbeta. Interestingly, ERRbeta displayed a cell cycle associated downregulated expression pattern in ERRbeta-transduced and non-transduced cells. Finally, we showed that ERRbeta-mediated growth inhibition could be potentiated by an ERRbeta/gamma agonist DY131. Knockdown of ERRbeta by RNA interference could reduce the DY131-induced growth inhibition in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that ERRbeta performs a tumor suppressing function in prostate cancer cells, and targeting ERRbeta could be a potential therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2079172441,"The mammalian TRPM gene family can be subdivided into distinct categories of cation channels that are either highly permeable for Ca(2+) (TRPM3/6/7), nonselective (TRPM2/8), or even Ca(2+) impermeable (TRPM4/5). TRPM6/7 are fused to alpha-kinase domains, whereas TRPM2 is linked to an ADP-ribose phosphohydrolase (Nudix domain). At a molecular level, the evolutionary steps that gave rise to the structural and functional TRPM channel diversity remain elusive. Here, we provide phylogenetic evidence that Nudix-linked channels represent an ancestral type of TRPMs that is present in various phyla, ranging from protists to humans. Surprisingly, the pore-forming segments of invertebrate TRPM2-like proteins display high sequence similarity to those of Ca(2+)-selective TRPMs, while human TRPM2 is characterized by a loss of several conserved residues. Using the patch-clamp technique, Ca(2+) imaging, and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that restoration of only two ""ancient"" pore residues in human TRPM2 (Q981E/P983Y) significantly increased (approximately 4-fold) its permeability for Ca(2+). Conversely, introduction of a ""modern"" sequence motif into mouse TRPM7 (E1047Q/Y1049P) resulted in the loss of Ca(2+) permeation and a linear TRPM2-like current-voltage relationship. Overall, our findings provide an integrative view on the evolution of the domain architecture and the structural basis of the distinct ion permeation profiles of TRPM channels."
https://openalex.org/W2008923412,"To evade the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immune response, the HIV Nef protein disrupts major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) trafficking by recruiting the clathrin adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail. Under normal conditions AP-1 binds dileucine and tyrosine signals (YXXϕ motifs) via physically separate binding sites. In the case of the Nef-MHC-I complex, a tyrosine in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 cytoplasmic tail (320YSQA) and a methionine in Nef (Met20) are absolutely required for AP-1 binding. Also present in Nef is a dileucine motif, which does not normally affect MHC-I trafficking and is not needed to recruit AP-1 to the Nef-MHC-I-complex. However, evidence is presented here that this dileucine motif can be activated by fusing Nef to the HLA-A2 tail in cis. Thus, the inability of this motif to function in trans likely results from a structural change that occurs when Nef binds to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail. The physiologically relevant tyrosine-dependent recruitment of AP-1 to MHC-I, which occurs whether Nef is present in cis or trans, was stabilized by the acidic and polyproline domains within Nef. Additionally, amino acids Ala324 and Asp327 in the cytoplasmic tails of HLA-A and (but not HLA-C and HLA-E) molecules also stabilized AP-1 binding. Finally, mutation of the tyrosine binding pocket in the μ subunit of AP-1 created a dominant negative inhibitor of Nef-induced down-modulation of HLA-A2 that disrupted binding of wild type AP-1 to the Nef-MHC-I complex. Thus, these data provide evidence that Nef binding to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail stabilizes the interaction of a tyrosine in the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail with the natural tyrosine binding pocket in AP-1.

Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Nef disrupts the trafficking of MHC-I HLA-A and HLA-B molecules but allows the normal expression of HLA-C and HLA-E. It has been postulated that continued expression of HLA-C and HLA-E may limit recognition by natural killer cells (5Le Gall S. Erdtmann L. Benichou S. Berlloz-Torrent C. Liu L. Benarous R. Heard J.

The differential effects of Nef on MHC-I molecules result from variations in MHC-I cytoplasmic tail sequences. There are three key amino acids in the cytoplasmic tails of Nef-responsive MHC-I molecules (Tyr320, Ala324, and Asp327). A subset of these amino acids is missing in HLA-C and HLA-E, causing them to be resistant to Nef (5Le Gall S. Erdtmann L. Benichou S. Berlloz-Torrent C. Liu L. Benarous R. Heard J. Schwartz O.

It has not yet been possible to define a discrete binding site on Nef that interacts with MHC-I. Thus far, mutation of each domain in Nef that has been implicated in MHC-I down-modulation (M20A, V10EΔ17–26, D123G, E62Q/E63Q/E64Q/E65Q, P72A/P75A, and P75A/P78A) results in disruption of Nef binding to MHC-I (7Williams M. Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Filzen T. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, this interaction may require a specific structure that is stabilized by a number of distinct Nef domains. Recent evidence has indicated that the heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor protein, AP-1, is the cellular trafficking factor that partners with Nef to disrupt MHC-I trafficking in HIV-infected cells (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). AP-1 is composed of four subunits (β1, γ, σ1, μ1A, and/or μ1B) (9Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 10Traub L.M. J.

AP-1 (and Nef) co-precipitates with MHC-I in HIV-infected primary T cells (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, siRNA to AP-1 dramatically inhibits MHC-I down-modulation caused by Nef (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Lubben N.B. Sahlender D.A. Motley A.M. Lehner P.J. Benaroch P. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3351-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nef binds AP-1 in yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pulldown analyses through a dileucine motif located in a solvent-exposed, unstructured loop near the carboxyl terminus. However, mutation of the dileucine motif has no effect on MHC-I down-modulation or on recruitment of AP-1 to the Nef-MHC-I complex (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Indeed, a different binding site composed of Tyr320 in HLA-A2 and a methionine at position 20 in Nef is needed for AP-1 recruitment to the Nef-MHC-I complex (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). There are currently no data indicating which AP-1 subunit(s) interacts with this novel binding site. To better understand the formation of this complex, we performed detailed mutagenesis and binding studies. We found that Tyr320 was the only amino acid in the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail absolutely required for Nef binding. In contrast, AP-1 binding to the Nef-MHC-I complex required Tyr320, Ala324, and Asp327 in the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail. Creation of a sequence that resembled a canonical AP-1 signal (substituting YSQA323 for YSQV323) allowed an interaction between HLA-A2 and AP-1 that was detectable even in the absence of Nef. Additional experiments presented here indicate that the Nef acidic and polyproline domains are not absolutely required for AP-1 recruitment but function to stabilize the interaction between AP-1 and MHC-I. Finally, we demonstrated that the natural tyrosine binding pocket in AP-1 was necessary for Nef-induced MHC-I down-modulation and for AP-1 to bind HLA-A2. In sum, these data support the model that multiple Nef domains work together to allow Tyr320 in the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail to behave as an AP-1 tyrosine signal. Cell CultureThe Bosc packaging cell line (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) and astrocytoma cells (373MG) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. CEM T4-lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Selection of transduced stable CEM cell lines was performed using 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Fisher) or 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Preparation of Plasmids That Express the HLA-A2 Cytoplasmic Tail MutantsA standard two-round mutational PCR approach was utilized to generate the seven mutants. Briefly, the 5′ portion of HLA-A2 was amplified from MSCV A2/Nef internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) GFP (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) using 5′BamHIKozakA2 and the reverse complement of the mutant primers listed insupplemental Table 1. In a second reaction performed in parallel, an overlapping 3′ portion of HLA-A2 was amplified using the forward mutant primers listed insupplemental Table 1 and the reverse primer, 3′EcoRIstopA2. In a third reaction the overlapping 3′ and 5′ fragments were annealed and amplified using 5′BamHIKozakA2 and 3′EcoRIstopA2 primers. The construction of the HLA-A2/C chimera has been described elsewhere. 5M. S. Schaefer, M. Williams, P. K. Gonzalez, and K. L. Collins, submitted for publication. Preparation of Plasmids That Express the AP-1 μ1 Tyrosine Binding Pocket Mutant (F172A/D174S)Human AP-1 μ1A was amplified from the MegaMan human transcriptome library (Stratagene) with the forward primer 5′BamHIKozakAP-1 and reverse primer named 3′EcoRIstopAP-1 as seen insupplemental Table 1. The F172A and D174S mutations were made using a two-round mutational PCR approach. The forward F172A/D174S primer was 5′ F172A/D174S AP-1. The reverse mutant primer was the reverse complement of this sequence. An IRES placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) cassette was generated by digesting the MSCV IRES PLAP vector with EcoRI and XhoI. AP-1 μ1A (BamHI-EcoRI) and the IRES PLAP cassette (EcoRI-XhoI) were then ligated into MSCV Puro digested with BglII to XhoI. This allowed for puromycin selection of stable lines and identification of F172A/D174S μ1-expressing cells by flow cytometry using PLAP expression. Preparation of Plasmids That Express the Amino-terminal α Helix Mutants of NefA two-round mutational PCR approach similar to the A2 tail mutants was utilized to generate the nine mutants. Nef was amplified from the MSCV A2/Nef IRES GFP previously described (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mutations were made in a two-step approach in which the forward primers found insupplemental Table 1 were used to amplify a fragment with reverse primer 3′EcoRIStopNef. At the same time, the reverse complement of the forward mutant primers plus 5′BamHIKozakNef generated an overlapping fragment. A full-length version of each mutant was made by then mixing the two overlapping fragments and amplifying with 5′BamHIKozakNef and the reverse primer 3′EcoRIStopNef. Preparation of Expression Plasmids Containing A2/Nef Fusion Protein MutantsThe A2/Nef fusion proteins have already been described (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Further mutations were made to each of these constructs to add the dileucine mutation using primers previously described (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) in a two-step mutational PCR approach.

Multiplicity of infection for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was 50–100. Transductions in low serum media ranged from 4 to 7 h.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), anti-AP-1 adaptin subunit μ1 (RY/1; 1:2,500, a generous gift from L.

The secondary antibody for AG11 and anti-HA was goat anti-mouse IgG1-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Zymed Laboratories Inc.; 1:25,000–50,000), for RY/1 was rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; 1:25,000–50,000), and for anti-AP-1 adaptin subunit γ was goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:25,000–50,000). The membranes were developed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection kit from Amersham Biosciences. RNA-mediated Interference TreatmentDuplex siRNAs (Ambion) were transfected into astrocytoma cells (373MG) as described previously (8Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Williams M. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 1, 1.25 × 106 373MG cells were plated onto a 100-mm dish. The next day the cells were transfected using 0.64 nmol of duplex siRNA and 16 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. On day 3 the cells were re-plated onto 6-well plates. On day 4 the cells were retransfected with siRNA using 0.16 nmol of duplex siRNA and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Fours hours after transfection, retroviral supernatants and 8 μg/ml polybrene were added to each well. Forty-eight hours later the cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry using an anti-HA antibody (1:50, Covance) or lysed for Western blot analysis. The μ1A siRNA used has been described previously (26Hirst J. Motley A. Harasaki K. Peak Chew S.Y. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 625-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Mutating Three Amino Acids in the Cytoplasmic Tail of HLA-A2 Abrogated Nef-induced Down-modulation and AP-1 RecruitmentThe HIV Nef protein binds to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail and recruits AP-1. However, it is not clear whether AP-1 is linked to MHC-I via the Nef protein or whether there are contacts among all three proteins. The sequences of the HLA-A, -B, -C, and -E cytoplasmic tails and the amino acids that differ between Nef-responsive and unresponsive molecules are shown in Fig. 1A. To elucidate the requirements for the formation of this complex, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis along the domain of MHC-I HLA-A2 that is needed for responsiveness to Nef (27Williams M. Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Fleis R.I. Przybycin C.G. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12173-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, Tyr320 was mutated to cysteine to mimic the HLA-C molecule, and Ala324 was mutated to glutamate to mimic the HLA-E molecule. We also utilized a construct in which the entire HLA-C cytoplasmic tail was fused to the HLA-A2 extracellular and transmembrane domains.5 Stable lines were made in CEM T cells, and each line was transduced with either control or Nef-expressing adenovirus. Surface expression of each HLA-A2 variant and endogenous CD4 was measured by flow cytometry as shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The endogenous CD4 stain was utilized to show that Nef was indeed being expressed and functioning inside the cell, even when the HLA-A2 variant was not affected by Nef expression. Consistent with previously published data, HLA-A2 with the C tail (A2/C) and the HLA-A2 mutants Y320A, Y320C, A324E, and D327A were all unaffected by Nef expression. Partial down-modulation was observed when amino acids Gln322, Ser325, and Ser326 were mutated (Figs. 1, B and C). Interestingly as seen in Fig. 1D, the mutation A323V caused a significant decrease in steady state surface expression (p value = 0.007) and even further decreased the surface expression of HLA-A2 in Nef-expressing cells (p value = 0.01). This substitution creates a sequence more similar to a canonical AP-1 binding motif (YXXϕ) and, thus, may allow AP-1 to interact with MHC-I even in the absence of Nef. To determine the mechanism for the variation in responsiveness to Nef caused by these sequence substitutions, we immunoprecipitated each HLA-A2 mutant and assayed for co-precipitation of Nef and AP-1. For these analyses we used a newly developed protocol that utilized digitonin lysis and wash buffers rather than our previously published protocol, which required protein cross-linking (8Roeth J.F.

https://openalex.org/W1997733493,"NPM/ALK is an oncogenic fusion protein expressed in ∼50% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases. It derives from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with the dimerization domain of the ubiquitously expressed nucleophosmin (NPM) protein. Dimerization of the ALK kinase domain leads to its autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. Activated NPM/ALK stimulates downstream survival and proliferation signaling pathways leading to malignant transformation. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of autoactivation of the catalytic domain of ALK. Because kinases are typically regulated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops, we systematically mutated (Tyr → Phe) three potential autophosphorylation sites contained in the “YXXXYY” motif of the ALK activation loop, and determined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity and biological function of NPM/ALK. We observed that mutation of both the second and third tyrosine residues (YFF mutant) did not affect the kinase activity or transforming ability of NPM/ALK. In contrast, mutation of the first and second (FFY), first and third (FYF), or all three (FFF) tyrosine residues impaired both kinase activity and transforming ability of NPM/ALK. Furthermore, a DFF mutant, in which the aspartic residue introduces a negative charge similar to a phosphorylated tyrosine, possessed catalytic activity similar to the YFF mutant. Together, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of the first tyrosine of the YXXXYY motif is necessary for the autoactivation of the ALK kinase domain and the transforming activity of NPM/ALK.

However, ALK is also aberrantly expressed in cancer as a result of chromosomal rearrangements involving the alk gene located on the 2p23 chromosome.

The docking sites for other important downstream targets of NPM/ALK, the Janus tyrosine kinases and STATs, remain to be identified (14Nieborowska-Skorska M. Slupianek A. Xue L. Zhang Q.

ALK, as a member of the IR kinase subfamily, is characterized by the “YXXXYY” motif contained in the activation loop (A-loop). The IR kinase has been extensively studied and provides a model for the autoregulation of the kinase domain by autoinhibition (17Hubbard S.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d330-d340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the inactive conformation, the A-loop traverses the cleft between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain occupying both the substrate and ATP binding sites. The second tyrosine in the YXXXYY motif (Tyr-1162) interacts with the catalytic loop (Asp-1132) by H-bonds and competes with peptide substrate for binding. Because Tyr-1162 is crucial for stabilizing the inactive conformation, it is not surprising that this second tyrosine is the preferred substrate of the IR kinase and is autophosphorylated first when the kinase undergoes autoactivation. Autophosphorylation of the A-loop tyrosines occurs in the order, second (Tyr-1162), first (Tyr-1158), and then third (Tyr-1163) (18Zhang B. Tavare J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequential phosphorylation of the A-loop is accompanied by partial and then full activation of the kinase domain, when the A-loop is in the trisphosphorylated state. Conformational changes induced by phosphorylation leads to the opening of the A-loop, allowing access of ATP and substrates to the active site. As ALK contains the YXXXYY motif in its A-loop (Tyr-1278, Tyr-1282, and Tyr-1283, respectively) it can be expected that ALK may be autoregulated in a similar fashion to the IR kinase. However, we have previously demonstrated that the amino acid sequence of the ALK A-loop differs significantly from the consensus sequence for the IR kinase family (19Donella-Deana A. Marin O. Cesaro L. Gunby R.H. Ferrarese A. Coluccia A.M. Tartari C.J. Mologni L. Scapozza L. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8533-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that purified ALK kinase domain preferentially phosphorylates the first tyrosine residue of the YXXXYY motif in synthetic peptides reproducing the ALK A-loop (19Donella-Deana A. Marin O. Cesaro L. Gunby R.H. Ferrarese A. Coluccia A.M. Tartari C.J. Mologni L. Scapozza L. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8533-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These in vitro results suggest that the mechanism of autoregulation of ALK might differ from that of the IR kinase and that the first tyrosine in the A-loop may play a central role in its autoactivation. To test this hypothesis we assessed the role of the three tyrosine residues in the activation of full-length NPM/ALK (Tyr-338, Tyr-342, and Tyr-343). We generated mutants of NPM/ALK (Fig. 1) in which the A-loop tyrosine residues were replaced by either the neutral and non-phosphorylatable amino acid, phenylalanine, or by a negatively charged, acidic amino acid, aspartate. NPM/ALK mutants were stably expressed in BaF3 cells and the effect of these mutations on the NPM/ALK kinase activity and in vitro/in vivo transforming abilities was determined. Mutagenesis and Generation of Stable BaF3 Cell Transfectants–Full-length human NPM/ALK cDNA, subcloned in the expression vector pcDNA3, was kindly provided by Dr. S. W. Morris (Dept. of Pathology and Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TE). Mutations in the NPM/ALK A-loop were generated using the QuikChangeXL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kinase-dead mutant was generated by mutating the residue Lys-210 to Arg (K210R) (9Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The IL-3-dependent murine pro-B BaF3 cell line was transfected by electroporation of 5 × 106 cells with 10 μg of linearized plasmid DNA at 260 V and 960 microfarads using the Gene Pulser Electroporator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Transfected cells were selected by culturing in the presence of G418 (Sigma) at 800 μg/ml for 2 weeks. The expression of NPM/ALK protein was verified by immunoblotting. Single cell clones were obtained for each mutant by limiting dilution in 96-well plates, and clones with comparable expression levels of NPM/ALK were selected. Mutations were verified by reverse transcription-PCR on total RNA extracted from 10,000 cells and DNA sequencing as previously described (20Gunby R.H. Cazzaniga G. Tassi E. Le Coutre P. Pogliani E. Specchia G. Biondi A. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Haematologica. 2003; 88: 408-415PubMed Google Scholar). BaF3 cells transfected with empty vector or mutated NPM/ALK were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.2% supernatant from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing IL-3 growth factor. BaF3 cells expressing wild-type NPM/ALK were grown in the absence of IL-3. All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Immunoblotting Analysis–Cells (2 × 106) were collected by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of Pepstatin-A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined in the supernatant using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (150 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. NPM/ALK expression was detected using the anti-ALK#1 monoclonal antibody, kindly supplied by Dr. K. Pulford (Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliff Hospital, Oxford, UK). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (anti-PY) from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Signaling molecules were detected using anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3, anti-p70S6K, anti-phospho-p70S6K, anti-MAPK, anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-Bcl-xL antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and the anti-p27 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein loading was controlled using the anti-actin antibody (Sigma). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from GE Healthcare (Princeton, NJ). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Radioactive Kinase Assay–NPM/ALK was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of protein from total cell lysate using the anti-ALKc antibody, kindly supplied by Dr. B. Falini (University of Perugia, Italy), and Gammabind™ G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Immunocomplexes were washed five times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). Phosphorylation of exogenous peptide substrate was measured by incubating immunocomplexes with kinase buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 μm peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) (19Donella-Deana A.

Filters were washed three times for 10 min with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone for 5 min. After drying cpm values were measured by scintillation using the Wallac Betacounter System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Autophosphorylation of NPM/ALK was measured by incubating immunocomplexes with kinase buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-gel loading buffer and heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Proliferation Assay–Cells were washed twice in IL-3-free medium and plated (10,000 cells/well) in 96-well plates. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after IL-3 withdrawal, cells were labeled with 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (GE Healthcare) for 8 h. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters (Printed Filtermat, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using a filter scintillation counter (1430 MicroBeta, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Annexin V Apoptosis Assay–Apoptosis in BaF3 cell transfectants after 24, 48, and 72 h IL-3 withdrawal was detected using the Annexin V-FITC Assay kit (Bender Med System, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, BaF3 cells (1 × 104) were incubated with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed using Q-Cell software and FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Animal Studies–Female CD-1 nu/nu mice (7–9 weeks old) were supplied by Charles River (Calco, Lecco, Italy) and kept under standard laboratory conditions according to the local ethical guidelines. Mice were subcutaneously injected with BaF3-transfected cells (10 × 106 cells/mouse) expressing different NPM/ALK mutants. Mice that developed tumors were sacrificed and tumor tissue was extracted and homogenized in 15 ml of RPMI medium. Cells were collected and lysed, and the expression of NPM/ALK protein was assessed by immunoblotting. Mutations were verified by reverse transcription-PCR and DNA sequencing. In Vitro Kinase Activity of NPM/ALK Activation Loop Mutants–We systematically mutated tyrosine residues to phenylalanine in the YXXXYY motif of the NPM/ALK A-loop (summarized in Fig. 1) and determined the effect of these mutations on ALK activity. The level of NPM/ALK tyrosine phosphorylation in BaF3-stable transfectants was assessed by anti-PY immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). The YFF mutant (Fig. 2A, lane 6) displayed a tyrosine phosphorylation level similar to WT NPM/ALK (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The FFY, FYF, and FFF mutants (Fig. 2A, lanes 7, 8, and 9, respectively) displayed a very low level of tyrosine phosphorylation that was only visible in an overexposed film (data not shown). The single mutants (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5) were not tyrosine-phosphorylated, similar to the kinase-dead mutant, K210R (Fig. 2A, lane 2). We assessed the ability of the NPM/ALK mutants to phosphorylate an exogenous peptide substrate (Fig. 2B). The YFF mutant displayed a phosphorylation activity comparable to WT NPM/ALK, whereas the FFY, FYF, and FFF mutants showed an impaired activity (35–50% of WT). The single mutants (FYY, YFY, and YYF) as well as the kinase-dead mutant were inactive. Similar results were also obtained in an in vitro radioactive autophosphorylation assay (Fig. 2C). In this semi-quantitative assay we observed that the activity of YFF mutant (Fig. 2C, lane 6) was comparable to WT NPM/ALK (Fig. 2C, lane 1), whereas the single mutants (FYY, YFY, and YYF) were inactive (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5). The FFY and FYF mutants displayed reduced autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). Interestingly, the autophosphorylation of FFF mutant appeared equivalent to WT NPM/ALK in this assay. This reflects autophosphorylation occurring outside the A-loop and is symptomatic of an active conformation of this mutant. Together these data suggest that the presence of the first tyrosine alone in the YXXXYY motif of the A-loop is necessary for the ALK kinase domain to adopt a fully active conformation. Furthermore, the activity data of YFY and YYF mutants on one side (inactive despite the presence of the first tyrosine) as opposed to those of FFY, FYF, and FFF mutants on the other (active despite their lack of the first tyrosine) (Fig. 2, B and C) suggest that the second and third tyrosines may play a role in stabilizing an inactive conformation. The absence of all three tyrosine residues in the A-loop appears to cause the destabilization of the inactive conformation leading to a partially active conformation, whose activity does not require the phosphorylation of the first tyrosine. Stimulation of Downstream Signaling Pathways and Cellular Transformation by NPM/ALK Activation Loop Mutants–To determine if the YFF mutant, in addition to possessing a fully activable kinase domain, was capable of activating downstream effectors of NPM/ALK in cells, we analyzed the phosphorylation of STAT3, p70S6K, MAPK, Akt, and p27 in total cell lysates after overnight IL-3 withdrawal. STAT3 phosphorylation has been associated with NPM/ALK activation in numerous studies and is crucial for NPM/ALK-mediated transformation (21Chiarle R. Simmons W.J. Cai H. Dhall G. Zamo A. Raz R.

The p70S6K is a downstream target of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which is also a key mediator of NPM/ALK transformation (28Chiang G.G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that, at least in part, NPM/ALK mediates oncogenesis through phosphorylation/activation of Akt (12Bai R.Y. Ouyang T. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Slupianek A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Hoser G. Morrione A. Majewski M. Xue L. Morris S.W. Wasik M.A. Skorski T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2194-2199PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the YFF mutant was able to promote the phosphorylation of both STAT3 and p70S6K to an extent comparable to WT (Fig. 3A, panel i, lanes 5 and 1). Furthermore, the YFF mutant was able to induce phosphorylation of Akt and to reduce the expression of p27, similarly to NPM/ALK WT (Fig. 3A, panel ii, lanes 5 and 1). In contrast, other NPM/ALK mutants (including FFF) were defective in the activation of these pathways. Consistent with these data, only the YFF mutant promoted growth and survival of BaF3 cells in the absence of IL-3, an indication of cellular transformation (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine if the A-loop mutants possessed in vivo transforming activity, nude mice were subcutaneously injected with BaF3 cells stably expressing similar levels of different NPM/ALK A-loop mutants. All mice injected with YFF-BaF3 cells developed tumors, although with a 7-day delay with respect to WT (Fig. 4A). Mice injected with FFY-BaF3 cells, FYF-BaF3 cells or FFF-BaF3 cells also developed tumors, albeit with a long delay (Fig. 4A) compared with WT. The FFF-positive tumors appeared after ∼30–35 days, whereas the FFY- and FYF-positive tumors appeared after 50–70 days. All growing tumors were examined by Western blotting for the presence of NPM/ALK (Fig. 4B) and found to be positive. The kinetics of tumor development for these mutants reflects well their catalytic activity measured in the radioactive kinase assays. In contrast, all mice injected with BaF3 cells expressing single mutants or kinase dead NPM/ALK did not develop tumors (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that the YFF mutant is fully capable of oncogenic transformation, although with slower kinetics compared with the WT. This may be attributable to a lack of signaling directed by the second and third tyrosines, which, although not essential for tumor development, may contribute to oncogenic signaling. Function of the First Tyrosine of the NPM/ALK Activation Loop–We hypothesized that the first tyrosine can represent an important autophosphorylation site for the regulation of ALK activity. To test this hypothesis, we generated an A-loop mutant in which the first tyrosine was replaced by aspartic acid. Aspartate has a negatively charged side chain and therefore has been used to mimic phosphotyrosine (18Zhang B. Tavare J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a DFF mutant that mimics the NPM/ALK A-loop phosphorylated on the first tyrosine residue. As judged from in vitro autophosphorylation, the DFF mutant proved active (Fig. 5A, panel i, lane 3). In contrast, the FYY mutant, which has the potential to be phosphorylated on both the second and third tyrosines, was not (Fig. 2C, lane 3). These findings suggest that the conformation of the A-loop induced by the introduced negative charge in DFF, can allow the in vitro autophosphorylation of ALK. Similarly, when we analyzed the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells, DFF was phosphorylated to similar extent to YFF (Fig. 5A, panel ii, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In addition, the DFF mutant was able to phosphorylate substrate (63% of WT) in a radioactive peptide kinase assay as the YFF mutant (Fig. 5A, panel iii). These results suggest that in cells the DFF mutant can mimic the YFF mutant resulting in phosphorylated NPM/ALK. Therefore, the negative charge of the aspartic residue can correctly mimic a phosphorylated tyrosine, causing the A-loop to adopt an open/active conformation as seen in the YFF mutant and WT NPM/ALK. The ability of the DFF mutant to activate anti-apoptotic pathways (Fig. 5, B and C) was also assessed. The annexin V assay was performed on different mutants after IL-3 withdrawal. Interestingly, the DFF mutant displayed a significant (p value = 0.027) level of protection from apoptosis at 48 h compared with the kinase-dead mutant (Fig. 5B). A key mediator of NPM/ALK induced survival is the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL (32Coluccia A.M. Perego S. Cleris L. Gunby R.H. Passoni L. Marchesi E. Formelli F. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Blood. 2004; 103: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After 48 h of IL-3 withdrawal we performed an immunoblotting analysis with the anti-Bcl-xL antibody. The DFF mutant (Fig. 5C, lane 2) displayed Bcl-xL expression levels comparable to YFF and WT NPM/ALK (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 1, respectively), in agreement with the annexin V results (Fig. 5B). The FFF mutant was also used as a control of the DFF one. Kinase assay showed that FFF displayed in vitro kinase activity (Fig. 5A, panel i, lane 5 and panel iii). This is likely the result of a structural destabilization of the A-loop resulting in an open/active conformation. However, the FFF mutant was not able to be phosphorylated in cells (Fig. 5A, panel ii), did not induce Bcl-xL, and could not protect cells from apoptosis (Fig. 5, B and C). We also assessed the ability of the DFF mutant to promote growth of BaF3 cells in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 6A). In contrast to the YFF mutant, the DFF mutant did not support IL-3-independent growth of BaF3 cells as the FFF mutant. We observed that the DFF mutant (Fig. 6B, lane 4) was unable to phosphorylate the downstream effectors STAT3 and p70S6K similarly to the FFF and K210R mutants (Fig. 6B lanes 5 and 2, respectively). In addition, p27 was down-regulated in cells expressing NPM/ALK WT and YFF (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 3) but not in cells expressing DFF or FFF mutants (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Together, these results suggest that introducing a negative charge to activate the kinase is sufficient for inducing some downstream signaling such as induction of Bcl-xL, and protection from apoptosis, but not others such as STAT3 phosphorylation, which may require direct phosphorylation of this residue. To assess if the first tyrosine is a docking site for signaling molecules involved in proliferative pathways a co-immunoprecipitation with the anti-ALKc antibody was performed (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the DFF mutant did not co-immunoprecipitate with STAT3 (Fig. 6C, lane 3) in contrast to WT NPM/ALK and the YFF mutant, suggesting that the first tyrosine might play an important role in the interaction of NPM/ALK and STAT3. The human genome contains 90 tyrosine kinase genes encoding 58 receptor tyrosine kinases grouped into 20 subfamilies and 32 non-receptor tyrosine kinases divided into 10 subfamilies (1Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6075) Google Scholar, 33Robinson D.R. Wu Y.M. Lin S.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5548-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for the autoactivation of the majority of these kinases and the stimulation of their downstream signaling pathways. The activation of downstream pathways is important for cellular processes in both normal and pathological conditions (34Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5001-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 35Gunby R.H. Sala E. Tartari C.J. Puttini M. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Mologni L. Anticancer Agents Med.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Here, we assessed the role of potential autophosphorylation sites in the NPM/ALK A-loop in the autoactivation of the kinase domain. We demonstrated that the first tyrosine is necessary for triggering the kinase activity of NPM/ALK and for stimulating its downstream signaling pathways, as demonstrated by the YFF mutant. This function of the first tyrosine is likely to be mediated by its phosphorylation, considering its unique susceptibility to ALK-catalyzed phosphorylation in vitro (19Donella-Deana A. Marin O. Cesaro L. Gunby R.H. Ferrarese A. Coluccia A.M. Tartari C.J. Mologni L. Scapozza L. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8533-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the cellular phosphorylation of the YFF mutant (Fig. 2A), at variance with all other mutants. In addition, the introduction of a negative charge at the position of the first tyrosine in the DFF mutant led to autophosphorylation in vitro and tyrosine phosphorylation in cells similar to that of the YFF mutant (Fig. 5A). This finding suggests that the aspartic acid residue is able to mimic a phosphorylated tyrosine residue and induce conformational changes in the A-loop that stabilize an open/active conformation. In accordance with our results, phosphopeptide mapping of NPM/ALK derived from SUDHL1 and Karpas cell lines has identified four ALK phosphopeptides containing the YXXXYY motif of the A-loop: all four peptides displayed phosphorylation of the first tyrosine in the YXXXYY motif, while only one peptide was phosphorylated on the second tyrosine, and none were phosphorylated of the third tyrosine residue (38Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). These results suggest that for the ALK kinase the order of tyrosine phosphorylation inside the A-loop could be first, second, and third. The presence of the first tyrosine is not a sufficient condition for activity, however, as disclosed by the failure of the mutants YFY and YYF to undergo autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylate the specific peptide substrate in vitro (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings indicate that the fully open/active conformation of the A-loop cannot be stabilized in these mutants. It is possible that the conformation of the A-loop in these mutants does not render the first tyrosine susceptible to autophosphorylation, suggesting a negative effect of the second and third residues on ALK activation. Alternatively, the inactivity of these mutants might reflect the inability of the first tyrosine, once phosphorylated in YFY and YYF contexts, to sustain an active conformation. The FFY, FYF, and FFF mutants, whose cellular phosphorylation levels and biological function are severely impaired (Fig. 2A), are nevertheless catalytically active in vitro (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings are consistent with a partially active conformation of the A-loop in these mutants, which under in vitro experimental conditions can be pushed toward a more active conformation, whereas in the cellular context a more inactive conformation is adopted. The observation that these mutants are capable of developing tumors in vivo, albeit with delayed kinetics (Fig. 4), despite such low catalytic activity in cells, may reflect the potency of NPM/ALK as an oncogene or may possibly be attributed to the accumulation of other oncogenic mutations. Our results suggest that ALK is characterized by a different mechanism of autoactivation from that of the IR kinase. In fact, assuming that the starting point of trans-phosphorylation is the existence for a short period of time of a non-phosphorylated protein in the active conformation, then, based on the models of ALK kinase domain and three-dimensional structure of IR kinase, it is plausible that the first tyrosine is phosphorylated and the most exposed one in the inactive conformation. The second tyrosine is more prone to cis-phosphorylation. In the active conformation, it is also conceivable, looking at the surroundings of the first tyrosine, that it can stabilize the active conformation by forming H-bonds with neighbor residues, which differ from those present in the IR kinase. In addition to its crucial role in the autoactivation of NPM/ALK, the first tyrosine residue in the YXXXYY motif might also be directly involved in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Our data demonstrate that cells expressing the DFF mutant were partially protected from apoptosis (Fig. 5, B and C), although unable to proliferate in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 6A). Our results also show that the first tyrosine, which remains exposed in the modeled ALK-active conformation, may be involved in the docking and activation of STAT3 (Fig. 6C). Investigating the role of tyrosine residues of the NPM/ALK A-loop has improved our knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the autoactivation of ALK kinase domain. We have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the first tyrosine plays a crucial role during autoactivation of NPM/ALK and may also mediate the activation of downstream pathways involved in cellular proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W1970489031,"The chromosomal translocation products AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemias. Here, we demonstrate that both AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that their turnover critically depends on the E2-conjugase UbcH8 and the E3-ligase SIAH-1. Contrary to its role in HDAC2 degradation, the E3-ligase RLIM does not target AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha for ubiquitin-dependent elimination. RLIM rather is a substrate of SIAH-1, which indicates that these E3-ligases operate in a hierarchical order. Remarkably, proteasomal degradation of leukemia fusion proteins, in addition to the block of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity is a consequence of HDAC-inhibitor treatment. The former requires the induction of UbcH8 expression and each of these processes might be beneficial for leukemia treatment. Our observations shed light on the mechanism determining the interplay between E2-conjugases, E3-ligases, and their substrates and suggest a strategy for utilizing the ubiquitylation machinery in a therapeutic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2077042147,"Oncolytic adenoviral mutants have considerable activity in ovarian cancer. However, the mechanisms by which they induce cell death remain uncertain. dl922-947, which contains a 24 bp deletion in E1A CR2, is more potent than both E1A wild-type adenoviruses and the E1B-55K deletion mutant dl1520 (Onyx-015). We investigated the mode of death induced by three E1A CR2-deleted replicating adenoviruses in models of ovarian cancer and also the importance of E3 11.6 (adenovirus death protein) in determining this mode of death. Ovarian cancer cells were infected with dl922-947 (E3 11.6+) and dlCR2 (E3 11.6−). We also generated dlCR2 tSmac, which also encodes the gene for processed Smac/DIABLO. Classical apoptosis does not occur in adenoviral cell death and there is no role for mitochondria. Expression of Smac/DIABLO does not enhance cytotoxicity nor increase apoptotic features. A role for cathepsins and lysosomal membrane permeability was excluded. Autophagy is induced, but is not the mode of death and may act as a cell survival mechanism. There is no evidence of pure necrosis, while the presence of E3 11.6 does not modulate the mode or extent of cell death. Thus, E1A CR2-deleted oncolytic adenoviral cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer may define a novel mode of programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2123027753,"The tumor suppressor RASSF1A is inactivated in many human cancers and is implicated in regulation of microtubule stability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms of RASSF1A action and their regulation remain unclear. Here we show that Skp2, an oncogenic subunit of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex, interacts with, ubiquitinates, and promotes the degradation of RASSF1A at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. This Skp2-dependent destruction of RASSF1A requires phosphorylation of the latter on serine-203 by cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Interestingly, mutation of RASSF1A-phosphorylation site Ser(203) to alanine results in a delay in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Moreover, enforced expression of Skp2 abolishes the inhibitory effect of RASSF1A on cell proliferation. Finally, the delay in G1-S progression after Skp2 removal is normalized by depletion of RASSF1A. These findings suggest that the Skp2-mediated degradation of RASSF1A plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W1966431536,"The recognition and removal of apoptotic cells is critical to development, tissue homeostasis, and the resolution of inflammation. Many studies have shown that phagocytosis is regulated by signaling mechanisms that involve distinct ligand-receptor interactions that drive the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the plasma protein β-2-glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1), a member of the short consensus repeat superfamily, binds phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles and apoptotic cells and promotes their bridging and subsequent engulfment by phagocytes. The phagocyte receptor for the protein/apoptotic cell complex, however, is unknown. Here we report that a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family on phagocytes binds and facilitates engulfment of β2GP1-phosphatidylserine and β2GP1-apoptotic cell complexes. Using recombinant β2GP1, we also show that β2GP1-dependent uptake is mediated by bridging of the target cell to the phagocyte through the protein C- and N-terminal domains, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2024873768,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a mature CD4+ T-cell malignancy etiologically associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Primary ATL cells frequently express CCR4 at high levels. Since HTLV-1 Tax does not induce CCR4 expression, transcription factor(s) constitutively active in ATL may be responsible for its strong expression. We identified an activator protein-1 (AP-1) site in the CCR4 promoter as the major positive regulatory element in ATL cells. Among the AP-1 family members, Fra-2, JunB and JunD are highly expressed in fresh primary ATL cells. Consistently, the Fra-2/JunB and Fra-2/JunD heterodimers strongly activated the CCR4 promoter in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, Fra-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or JunD siRNA, but not JunB siRNA, effectively reduced CCR4 expression and cell growth in ATL cells. Conversely, Fra-2 or JunD overexpression promoted cell growth in Jurkat cells. We identified 49 genes, including c-Myb, BCL-6 and MDM2, which were downregulated by Fra-2 siRNA in ATL cells. c-Myb, BCL-6 and MDM2 were also downregulated by JunD siRNA. As Fra-2, these proto-oncogenes were highly expressed in primary ATL cells but not in normal CD4+ T cells. Collectively, aberrantly expressed Fra-2 in association with JunD may play a major role in CCR4 expression and oncogenesis in ATL."
https://openalex.org/W1992586037,"Commonly used regimens in cancer therapy rely on the induction of apoptotic cell death, and drug resistance can be attributed, at least in part, to a disabled apoptotic program. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), exhibit an intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we show that co-treatment with etoposide (VP16) and the pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but not valproic acid (VPA), induced apoptotic cell death in drug-resistant NSCLC cells. Co-treatment, but not single treatment, with VP16 and TSA induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner accompanied by a crucial decrease in Bcl-xL expression allowing Bax activation and subsequent initiation of the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)-dependent death pathway. Importantly, AIF proved to be required for the effects of TSA/VP16 as RNA knockdown of AIF resulted in a complete abolishment of TSA/VP16-induced apoptotic cell death in drug-resistant NSCLC cells. Our results thus provide evidence for the requirement of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways in TSA/VP16-mediated death of drug-resistant NSCLC cells, and extend previous suggestions that HDAC inhibitors in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs could be valuable in the treatment of NSCLC cancer and other malignancies in which Bcl-xL is overexpressed."

Sculpting the Ca2+ signature may be expected to require modulation of both Ca2+ entry into the cytosol and of transporters affecting reuptake/efflux. Several lines of evidence, such as the increase in transcript levels of plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPases in tomato (20Wimmers L.E. Ewing N.N. Bennett A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9205-9209Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and tobacco (21Perez-Prat E. Narasimhan M.L. Binzel M.L. Botella M.A. Chen Z. Valpuesta V. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Plant. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggest the involvement of Ca2+ pumps in salt tolerance. The presence of multiple isoforms amenable to a range of regulation (11Sze H. Liang F. Hwang I. Curran A.C. Harper J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) also supports the hypothesis that Ca2+-ATPases may play a more direct role in signal transduction (22Hwang I. Sze H. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6224-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Niu X. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has not thus far been tested. Higher plants and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae share several conserved elements in the cellular mechanisms of Na+ homeostasis (24Serrano R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Multiple transport pathways mediate cellular Na+ homeostasis in S. cerevisiae.Na+ is believed to enter the yeast cell via the K+ transporters TRK1 and TRK2 (25Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The primary route of Na+ extrusion across the plasma membrane is through the P-type ion pump ENA1 (26Hirata D. Harada S. Namba H. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Na+/H+-antiporters in the plasma membrane (NHA1), the late endosomal/prevacuolar membrane (NHX1), and the vacuolar VNX1 (27Cagnac O. Leterrier M. Yeager M. Blumwald E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24284-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a monovalant cation/H+ antiporter, could also serve to deplete [Na+]cyt. NHA1 has been shown to extrude Na+ into acidic medium (28Banuelos M.A. Sychrova H. Bleykasten-Grosshans C. Souciet J.L. Potier S. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2749-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). No significant role in tolerance responses has been demonstrated for NHX1 at neutral pH, but it contributes to endosomal/vacuolar Na+ sequestration when stressed in acidic medium (29Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Nass R. Rao R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3221-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These multiple transport pathways regulating yeast Na+ homeostasis are under complex regulation; ENA1 is transcriptionally activated by several distinct pathways (26Hirata D. Harada S. Namba H. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), of which the HOG1 pathway has also been proposed to enhance activity of the plasma membrane-located NHA1 (32Proft M. Struhl K. Cell. 2004; 118: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A substantive understanding of the mechanisms of Ca2+ homeostasis makes yeast an ideal system to study how Ca2+ pumps could influence Na+ homeostasis and salt tolerance. Under normal conditions, extracellular Ca2+ enters the yeast cytosol through an as yet unidentified transporter (33Cui J. Kaandorp J.A. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase PMR1 pumps [Ca2+]cyt into the ER and Golgi, whereas the high affinity Ca2+-ATPase, PMC1, and low affinity Ca2+/H+ exchanger, VCX1, serve to sequester it in the vacuole (33Cui J. Kaandorp J.A. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hypertonic shock, induced by extracellular NaCl, induces release of vacuolar Ca2+ into the cytosol through the tonoplast-located Ca2+ channel YVC1 (34Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and possibly influx of external Ca2+ via the CCH1/MID1 Ca2+ channel on the plasma membrane (35Matsumoto T.K. Ellsmore A.J. Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Pardo J.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33075-33080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Expression and function of PMC1, PMR1, and VCX1 are regulated by calcineurin (36Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), a highly conserved protein phosphatase that is activated by Ca2+/CaM. In contrast to plants, there are no Ca2+-ATPases or exchangers detected on the yeast plasma membrane (33Cui J. Kaandorp J.A. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and consequently little or no active efflux of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. The ER-located ACA2 and vacuolar ACA4 are Arabidopsis Ca2+-ATPases that have previously been expressed in yeast (37Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo H.Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 38Geisler M. Frangne N. Gomes E. Martinoia E. Palmgren M.G. Plant. Physiol. 2000; 124: 1814-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and the latter has been shown to ameliorate the salt hypersensitivity of the host strain (38Geisler M. Frangne N. Gomes E. Martinoia E. Palmgren M.G. Plant. Physiol. 2000; 124: 1814-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This investigation was carried out to determine whether an ER-located plant Ca2+ pump could facilitate a salt tolerance response and, if so, to understand the underlying cellular mechanism involved. Here we demonstrate that the ER-located ACA2 relieves the hypersensitivity of the salt-sensitive triple mutant yeast strain K616, in which genes encoding the Ca2+ pumps (PMC1, PMR1, and the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, CNB1) have been deleted (39Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This strain requires 10-4 m Ca2+ to grow and millimolar Ca2+ to survive hypertonic stress. Heterologous expression of ACA2 in this strain alleviates the calcium requirement in both cases. ACA2-expressing cells sequester Na+ into internal stores rather than extrude it across the plasma membrane, as does wild type yeast. Using the aequorin reporter system, we demonstrate that ACA2 alters the [Ca2+]cyt transient induced by NaCl stress in K616. We propose that this action of the pump contributes to the triggering of an alternative pathway, which activates the endomembrane Na+/H+-antiporter, NHX1, resulting in enhanced salt tolerance. Yeast Strains and Growth MediaS. cerevisiae wild type strain K601 (MATa, leu2, his3, ade2, trp1, and ura3) and mutant strain K616 (MATa pmr1::HIS3 pmc1::TRP1 cnb1::LEU2, ura3) were grown in complete synthetic medium (SC) and SC minus Trp, His, and Leu, respectively, throughout this study. For the K616 strain, the medium was supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2. SC medium consisted of 1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 1.3 g/liter drop-out mix without Ura, Trp, His, and Leu (these amino acids were added from separate stock solutions when required), and 2% (w/w) dextrose as a carbon source. Medium pH was adjusted to 6 (buffered with 5 mm MES) prior to the addition of agar and sterilization. Buffering by MES was found to be efficient, since autoclaving did not introduce significant change in medium pH. In all experiments under hyperosmotic stress, a Ca-EGTA buffer was used to maintain the free Ca2+ of SC medium at 100 μm, unless otherwise mentioned. Yeast TransformationFor transformations with pYX112 constructs, K616 was transformed by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method (40Elbe R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of uracil on plates containing SC medium minus Trp, Leu, His, and Ura. For complementation studies, Ura-positive colonies were streaked on complete SC plates containing 10 mm EGTA and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. For transformations with yeast vector pKC147/AEQ, K601 and K616 were transformed and selected for Ura autotrophy as mentioned above. A Ura-positive K616 colony was then subjected to a second transformation with pYX112-ACA2. Transformants were then selected based on their ability to complement on low calcium medium by spreading on SC minus Trp, Leu, His, and Ura, containing 5 mm EGTA. Controls for this selection included a transformation with the same volume of water and a vector alone, both of which showed no growth on the EGTA selection plate. Double transformants were analyzed for the expression of apoaequorin by monitoring luminescence before and after lysis with 5% Triton X-100 and 2 m CaCl2 and by colony PCR to confirm the presence of the ACA2 gene. They were also tested for salt tolerance in SC-medium containing 400 mm NaCl. NHX1 Knock-out Mutants in K616 BackgroundA forward primer (5′-AAACGTGATAGCAAGGAACTG-3′) that hybridizes 200 bp upstream of the start codon of NHX1 and a reverse primer (5′-GGCGTTGAGTAAGAGAGAATG-3′) that hybridizes 80 bp downstream of the NHX1 stop codon were used to amplify the NHX1::KanMX cassette from the appropriate deletion strain in the background of the yeast strain, BY4742 (a gift from Dr. R. Rao). The 1.82-kb PCR product thus obtained was gel-eluted and used to transform K616. This strategy allows specific gene disruption by homologous recombination and chromosomal integration. Recombinants were selected on SC medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. A positive transformant was then subjected to a second round of transformation with pYX112-ACA2 and selected on SC minus Ura, Trp, Leu, and His plates containing 1 mg/ml G418. Genomic DNA was isolated from these colonies and analyzed for the presence of ACA2 and the KAN-NHX1 sequences by PCR using specific primers followed by DNA sequencing. Monitoring Expression of ENA1 and NHX1 by RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from yeast cells exposed to 400 mm NaCl for a range of time periods (0-50 h). The RNA was first treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to eliminate contaminating DNA. 500 ng of RNA each was then subject to a reverse transcriptase reaction using 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm each of dNTPs. The cDNA thus obtained was subjected to a 30-cycle PCR reaction using standard conditions with primers specific for ENA1 (forward primer, 5′-ATG GGC GAA GGA ACT ACT AA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAC ACA AAT GGC ATA GAT AGC-3′) amplifying a 960-bp product and for NHX1 (forward primer, 5′-ATG CTA TCC AAG GTA TTG CTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAC CGA CGA AAA TGT TGC-3′) amplifying a 759-bp product. The constitutively expressed ACT1 (actin) was amplified under identical PCR conditions using specific primers (forward primer, 5′-GAG GTT GCT GCT TTG GTT AT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCG GTT TGC ATT TCT TGT-3′) amplifying a 680-bp product. Stress ConditionsFor drop tests, midlog yeast cultures were washed twice with water, and A600 was adjusted to 0.5 with sterile double-distilled water. Cells were serially diluted with water to obtain 10-, 102-, and 103-fold dilutions. Five microliters of each dilution was then spotted on SC medium buffered at 20 nm, 100 μm, or 5 mm Ca2+ and supplemented with 300 mm KCl, 400/800 mm NaCl, or 750 mm sorbitol concentrations. Growth was recorded after a 3-day incubation at 30 °C. For growth curves, equal cell inocula were added into liquid SC medium buffered for Ca2+ at 100 μm with or without 400 mm NaCl. In some experiments, medium was also supplemented with amiloride (500 μm). Cells were incubated on an incubator shaker at 30 °C. Change in A600 was monitored over a period of 2 days. Alternatively, sensitivity curves were generated using log phase cells with or without preincubation with inhibitors such as 5 μm bafilomycin, N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA) (30 and 40 μm), KN62 (20, 50, and 100 μm), and SB 203580 (10 and 200 μm) prior to administrating the NaCl insult. A600 was determined at the 18th hour of salt stress. Estimation of Total Cellular Na+ and Ca2+%Yeast strains were grown to an A600 of 0.6 in SC medium buffered at 100 μm Ca2+. Cells were either taken as such or stressed with 400 mm NaCl, and 2-ml aliquots were collected over a range of time points extending up to 18 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed four times in ice-cold Buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% glucose, 0.6 m sorbitol), and dried at 50 °C for 4 days. Dried cells were acid-digested in a 4:1 diacid mixture of perchlorate, and nitrate and Na+ levels were estimated by flame photometry using a Systronics Flame Photometer 128 (Ahmedabad, India) (41Anil V.S. Krishnamurthy P. Kuruvilla S. Sucharitha K. Thomas G. Mathew M.K. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 124: 451-464Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In a few experiments, growth was carried out at Ca2+ concentrations of 100 μm and 5 mm. At an A600 of 0.6, a set of cells grown in 100 μm Ca2+ was washed three times with SC medium and adapted to 20 nm Ca2+ for 1 h before processing these cells, as well as those at 100 μm and 5 mm for total Ca2+ estimation using a Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model Z-6100; Hitachi). Permeabilization of Plasma Membranes with Cu2+ IonsYeast strains were grown in 300 ml of SC medium, to A600 of 0.6 and stressed for 3 h with 400 mm NaCl. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in ice-cold Buffer B, and resuspended in the same buffer at room temperature at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. After withdrawing 2-ml aliquots for total Na+ estimation, the remaining cell suspension was subjected to plasma membrane permeabilization with Cu2+ as described by Anraku and co-workers (42Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 500 μm and incubated at 23 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn and washed twice with buffer B, and cells were dried for acid digestion and flame photometry. Aequorin Luminescence Measurements and [Ca2+]cyt QuantificationAequorin luminescence was determined using a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) following procedures used to quantify [Ca2+]cyt in yeast (19Anil V.S. Rao K.S. J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 158: 1237-1256Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were transformed with the 2μ plasmid pKC147/AEQ (provided by Dr. K. Cunningham) containing the APOAEQUORIN gene. Transformants, grown to an A600 of ∼0.4-0.6, were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in fresh medium (SC-Ura + 1 mm EGTA) at an A600 of 10, and loaded with 25 μg/ml coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 3 h in the dark at room temperature. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in the same volume of fresh medium buffered at 100 μm Ca2+. After a preincubation of 1 h, the cells were diluted with the same medium to an A600 of 0.5, and a cellular luminescence base line was determined by 2-3 min of recordings at 10-s intervals. Hypertonic/ionic shock was administered to yeast cells by the addition of a range of NaCl (100-1200 mm), 300 mm KCl, 50 mm CaCl2, or 750 mm sorbitol. When required, loaded cells were preincubated for 20 min with 5 μm bafilomycin A1 or 30 μm ACA dissolved in Me2SO or 10 mm LaCl3 dissolved in water prior to the acquisition of the basal luminescence reading and the subsequent osmotic/ionic shock. Luminescence from aequorin that remained in cells at the end of an experiment was determined by diluting the cell suspension 1:1 with a solution containing 10% Triton X-100 and 4 m CaCl2. [Ca2+]cyt was calculated using Equation 1, [Ca2+]((LLmax)13+(118(LLmax)13)−1)(7×106−(7×106(LLmax)13))(Eq. 1) where L represents the luminescence intensity at any time point, and Lmax is the integrated luminescence intensity (34Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). L values did not exceed ∼1% of the maximal light emission capacity in all three strains. Figures are representative of a minimum of three experiments in each case. Complementation by Full-length ACA2K616 transformed with pYX112-ACA2 was selected by Ura autotrophy. K616 is a mutant for the endogenous Ca2+ pumps PMC1 and PMR1, a potentially lethal combination but for a third knock-out mutation of CNB1. In the absence of CNB1, the Ca2+/H+-antiporter (VCX1) located in the vacuolar membrane is active and suffices to populate intracellular calcium stores, provided K616 is grown in adequately high Ca2+. Ura-selected colonies expressing ACA2 exhibited growth on complementation plates comprising SC medium depleted of calcium with 10 mm EGTA, unlike K616 and K616 transformed with the vector alone (Fig. 1A). The ACA2 transformant strain will be referred to as K616-ACA2 henceforth for simplicity, whereas the strain transformed with vector alone will be referred to as K616-V. K616, in turn, is derived from the strain K601, which will be treated as wild type for this study. Saline and Osmotic Sensitivity of Yeast StrainsAt very low Ca2+ of 20 nm, K616-V grew very poorly on SC medium (Fig. 1B) and not at all under 400 mm NaCl stress. Interestingly, at a moderate free Ca2+ level of 100 μm, K616-V showed effective growth under unstressed conditions but failed to grow under salt stress (Fig. 1B). With 5 mm Ca2+ in the medium, however, K616-V was able to grow effectively under unstressed conditions, as well as mount a reasonable salt tolerance response when stressed with NaCl (Fig. 1B). Thus, K616-V requires two levels of media Ca2+: a lower concentration (∼100 μm) for growth and millimolar calcium for reasonable salt tolerance. K616 and K616-V behaved identically in Ca2+-depleted medium (Fig. 1A) and under hyperosmotic stress (supplemental Fig. 1D). The expression of ACA2 in K616 eliminated both requirements, transformants growing well and exhibiting salt tolerance even at 20 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). NaCl titration carried out at 100 μm medium Ca2+ showed that K616 did not grow in 300 mm NaCl (Fig. 1C). Sensitivity to NaCl was detected even at 100 mm, where a significant lag was observed in the growth curve (Fig. 1C). K601 and K616-ACA2, on the other hand, grew well in medium containing up to 1.2 m NaCl (growth curves not shown). To evaluate whether other hyperosmotic stresses affect these strains similarly, they were subjected to saline and osmotic stress comprising 300 mm KCl or 400/800 mm NaCl or 750 mm sorbitol in SC medium containing 100 μm free Ca2+. Although both K601 and K616-ACA2 grew well on plates containing 400 or 800 mm NaCl, K616-V did not grow on these plates (Fig. 1D). However, all three strains grew reasonably well on plates containing either 750 mm sorbitol or 300 mm KCl, indicating that purely osmotic stresses and ionic stresses up to 300 mm were tolerated by all of them (Fig. 1D). Curing the K616-ACA2 strain of pYX112-ACA2 generated colonies that did not grow on calcium-depleted media and were as sensitive to NaCl stress as was K616 (supplemental Fig. 1, A-D). ATP-induced Ca2+ pumping and vanadate-sensitive-ATPase activities were detected in ER-enriched vesicles prepared from K616-ACA2 but not in those from K616, indicating the expression of a functional Ca2+-ATPase in K616-ACA2 (supplemental Fig. 1, E-G). An N-terminal, autoinhibitory domain in ACA2 (43Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant. Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) does not appear to prevent activity of the full-length construct used here. ACA2 Changes Ca2+ Homeostasis in K616To test the degree to which internal calcium stores get filled, cellular Ca2+ of yeast preincubated with external Ca2+ of 20 nm, 100 μm, or 5 mm was estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Total cellular calcium is tightly controlled in wild type, K601, and K616-ACA2, remaining below 0.2 mg/g, dry weight, under all of the Ca2+ concentrations tested (Fig. 2A). K616 showed >8-fold higher total calcium than K601 when subjected to 20 nm external Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). However, at both 100 μm and 5 mm calcium, cellular Ca2+ levels were comparable among all of the yeast strains tested, suggesting that internal stores of Ca2+ are adequately filled in all. We focused on 100 μm Ca2+, since it is the concentration that is adequate for growth of K616 but insufficient for mounting a salt tolerance response. At 100 μm Ca2+, the sensitivity of K616 to hypersodic media could be a consequence of altered signaling due to an aberrant [Ca2+]cyt transient in response to saline stress. To test this hypothesis, we used aequorin to monitor [Ca2+]cyt. The addition of 400 mm NaCl to the yeast suspension resulted in rapid increases in aequorin luminescence in all three strains (Fig. 2B). In the case of K601 and K616-ACA2, the rise in [Ca2+]cyt was limited to a peak value between 0.6 and 0.8 μm, from which maximum it decayed to basal levels in 2-3 min (Fig. 2B). In K616, on the other hand, [Ca2+]cyt rose to over 1.2 μm over the course of 1 min. Thereafter, it declined very slowly, not reaching basal values even after 20 min (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2108350650,"Basement membranes (BMs) consisting of laminins, collagens, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are vital for proper endothelial cell function, but many aspects of their role in vascular development remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that vascular structures within differentiating embryoid bodies are wrapped in a BM composed of alpha4- and alpha5-chain laminins, fibronectin, collagen IV, and HSPGs. In sprouting angiogenesis, laminins were produced by stalk cells, as well as the leading tip cell, and deposited along the sprout length, including tip cell filopodia. In embryonic stem cells deficient in laminins, due to lamc1 (laminin gamma1) deletion, vascular development and organization were largely unaffected. However, the frequency of vessels with wide lumens was increased 4-fold. Laminin-deficient vessels were moreover characterized by increased fibronectin levels and enhanced endothelial cell proliferation. We conclude that laminins are dispensable for vascular development but that they regulate lumen formation in the absence of flow and vascular tone."
https://openalex.org/W2025300673,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cysteine protease calpain 3 (CAPN3) that leads to selective muscle wasting. We previously showed that CAPN3 deficiency is associated with a profound perturbation of the NF-kappaB/IkappaB alpha survival pathway. In this study, the consequences of altered NF-kappaB/IkappaB alpha pathway were investigated using biological materials from LGMD2A patients. We first show that the antiapoptotic factor cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), which is dependent on the NF-kappaB pathway in normal muscle cells, is down-regulated in LGMD2A biopsies. In muscle cells isolated from LGMD2A patients, NF-kappaB is readily activated on cytokine induction as shown by an increase in its DNA binding activity. However, we observed discrepant transcriptional responses depending on the NF-kappaB target genes. IkappaB alpha is expressed following NF-kappaB activation independent of the CAPN3 status, whereas expression of c-FLIP is obtained only when CAPN3 is present. These data lead us to postulate that CAPN3 intervenes in the regulation of the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent survival genes to prevent apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Deregulations in the NF-kappaB pathway could be part of the mechanism responsible for the muscle wasting resulting from CAPN3 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2042049735,"Mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene (NF2) encoding merlin (moesin–ezrin–radixin like-protein) induce tumors of the nervous system. Merlin localizes to the cell membrane where it links the actin cytoskeleton to membrane proteins. Cell proliferation is regulated by merlin in many cell types, but merlin's tumor suppressor function still remains unclear. Phosphorylation has been suggested to regulate merlin's activity. The C-terminal serine 518 is phosphorylated both by p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and protein kinase A (PKA). In this work, we identify a novel PKA phosphorylation site, serine 10, in the N terminus of merlin. We show that a non-phosphorylatable form of serine 10 (S10A) affects cellular morphology. Regulation of this site also influences actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics in vivo, as merlin S10A reduces the amount of cellular F-actin and merlin S10D stabilizes F-actin filaments. By using a wound-healing assay and live cell imaging, we demonstrate that dephosphorylation of serine 10 leads to defects in migration, possibly through altered ability of the cells to form lamellipodia. This study suggests a role for merlin in mediating PKA-induced changes of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1999545332,"Heparanase is a β-d-endoglucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate, an important structural component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and vascular basement membrane (BM). The cleavage of heparan sulfate by heparanase-expressing cells, such as activated leukocytes, metastatic tumor cells, and proliferating endothelial cells, facilitates degradation of the ECM/BM to promote cell invasion associated with inflammation, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis. In addition to its enzymatic function, heparanase has also recently been shown to act as a cell adhesion and/or signaling molecule upon interaction with cell surfaces. Despite the obvious importance of the mechanisms for the binding of heparanase to cell surfaces, the receptor(s) for heparanase remain poorly defined. In this study, we identify the 300-kDa cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) as a cell surface receptor for heparanase. Purified platelet heparanase was shown to bind the human CIMPR expressed on the surface of a transfected mouse L cell line. Optimal binding was determined to be at a slightly acidic pH (6.5-7.0) with heparanase remaining on the cell surface for up to 10 min at 37 °C. In contrast, mouse L cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CDMPR) showed no binding of heparanase. Interestingly, the binding of heparanase to CIMPR was independent of Man-6-P moieties. Significantly, primary human T cells upon activation were shown to dramatically up-regulate levels of cell surface-expressed CIMPR, which showed a concomitant increase in their capacity to bind heparanase. Furthermore, the tethering of heparanase to the surface of cells via CIMPR was found to increase their capacity to degrade an ECM or a reconstituted BM. These data suggest an important role for CIMPR in the cell surface presentation of enzymatically active heparanase for the efficient passage of T cells into an inflammatory site and have implications for the use of this mechanism by other cell types to enhance cell invasion.

HSPGs are a diverse family of complex macromolecules that consist of a protein core to which are attached linear side chains of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). They contribute to the assembly and stability of the ECM/BM by interacting with multiple matrix proteins, including collagen, laminin, nidogen, and fibronectin (3Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

Heparanase is a β-d-endoglucoronidase that cleaves HS and has been proposed to have an important role in facilitating the disassembly of the ECM/BM by acting in concert with the various matrix proteases. Heparanase is synthesized as a 65-kDa inactive proenzyme that is processed by removal of a 6-kDa linker fragment into an active form consisting of a heterodimer between the remaining 50- and 8-kDa polypeptide subunits (5Fairbanks M.B.

It is evident from recent studies that heparanase can bind efficiently to the surface of cells, a process that has been postulated as important in a number of key aspects of heparanase function (15Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M99-M108PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ilan N. Elkin M. Vlodavsky I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 2018-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cell surface display of heparanase has been implicated in cell adhesion, whereby heparanase can bind to T cells and aid adhesion to ECM components under shear flow conditions (9Gilat D. Hershkoviz R.

The interaction of heparanase with the surface of endothelial cells has also been shown to trigger signaling cascades, including the enhancement of protein kinase B/Akt signaling and stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and p38-dependent cell migration and invasion (38Gingis-Velitski S.

Bashenko Y. Edovitsky E. Levy-Adam F. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of cells to bind and internalize exogenous heparanase via cell surface receptors has been suggested as important for the cellular uptake, processing, and storage of the enzyme (7Zetser A.

Furthermore, the tethering of degradative enzymes to the surface of migrating cells promotes the efficient local and directed degradation of ECM/BM barriers (15Parish C.R. Freeman C.

The identification of heparanase receptor(s) expressed on the surface of cells is of fundamental importance in understanding the above processes; however, in most instances, these receptors remain undefined. A number of lines of evidence indicate that HS is important in the uptake of heparanase (12Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y.

More recently, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and an unidentified mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) were also suggested to mediate heparanase uptake; however, with the latter receptor it was only shown to be the case when in cooperation with HSPGs and receptor-associated protein-sensitive receptors (45Vreys V.

Here, we identify the 300-kDa CIMPR (CD222) as a novel receptor for heparanase. Interestingly, the binding of heparanase to CIMPR was independent of Man-6-P. The tethering of heparanase to cell surfaces via CIMPR was found to significantly enhance the ability of cells to degrade the ECM/BM. Human primary T cells upon stimulation were shown to up-regulate the cell surface expression of CIMPR, and concomitantly the binding of heparanase, suggesting that this is a mechanism utilized by T cells and possibly other cells types to mediate efficient ECM degradation.

Typically 2 μg/ml of biotinylated heparanase was added to 2 × 105 cells in 1 ml of PBS, pH 6.0 to 7.2, containing 0.1% fraction V bovine serum albumin (BSA) on ice for 60 min, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and 0.1% BSA, pH 6.0 to 7.2. Biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a control for background binding. Cell bound heparanase-biotin or anti-rabbit Ig-biotin was detected using Strep-PE (Caltag Laboratories) by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) with Weasel software (Walter and Eliza Analysis Software Eclectic and Lucid version 2.2.2). Assays to assess the binding of heparanase to CDMPR were performed as above in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5. Binding assays were performed on transiently transfected MS cells 48 h post-transfection. As no antibody was available to human CDMPR, expression of the transfected gene was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the primers 5′-ctactccagtttcccacgac-3′ and 5′-ctgcttgagaaatctggctg-3′ (data not shown), and cell surface expression of the receptor was demonstrated by binding of the Man-6-P containing molecule PPME (Fig. 1). Heparanase binding inhibition assays were carried out as above with the exception that the cells were first incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of different inhibitors (see figures legends) for 60 min on ice or pretreated with active bacterial heparinase (to remove cell surface HS) for 60 min at 37 °C. Iduronidase binding experiments were carried out in the same manner with 1 μg of iduronidase instead of biotinylated heparanase and detected using a mouse anti-iduronidase monoclonal antibody. Similarly, cell surface expression of CIMPR was determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody (JT-CIMPR) to the human CIMPR protein. The expression of cell surface HS was determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using the mouse monoclonal antibody to HS (F58-10E4). In each case the binding of the primary antibody was detected with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated to PE (Dako, Denmark). Cell surface binding of PPME was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled PPME by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Direct Binding Assay–Washed protein A-Sepharose (30-μl packed volume) (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 50 μl of culture supernatant of a mouse monoclonal antibody to human CIMPR (JT-CIMPR), 10 μg/ml of the mouse monoclonal antibody to CIMPR MEM-238 (Abcam, Cambridge UK), or 50 μl of a culture supernatant of an IgG1 isotype control antibody to mouse anti-trinitrobenzene sulfonate, at 4 °C for 120 min on a rotating wheel in PBS, 3% BSA. MS9-II cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 2 μg/ml HSPE at 4 °C. The cells were washed in two cycles of ice-cold PBS, 0.1% BSA and then resuspended in 100 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), and Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and lysed by three cycles of rapid freeze/thaw incubation. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 6500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C followed by two cycles of incubation in PBS, 5% BSA, 0.005% Tween for 1 h each cycle. The protein A-Sepharose was then incubated for 2 h with 100 μl of the cleared cell lysate. The beads were than washed with two cycles of PBS, 3% BSA, 0.005% Tween, and binding of heparanase to the CIMPR was assessed by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to heparanase (Hpa1) followed by an anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Melbourne, Australia). Alkaline Phosphatase Assay–Biotinylated heparanase (2 μg/ml), fluorescein isothiocyanate PPME-FITC (5 μg/ml), or iduronidase (1 μg/ml) were pretreated with 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) for 60 min at 37 °C in both normal saline and PO4 Buffer (64.5 mm Na2HPO4, 21 mm KH2PO4). MS and MS9-II cells (1 × 105/well) were incubated with the pretreated heparanase or PPME-FITC in PBS and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2, for 60 min on ice. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2. The cell surface binding of heparanase-biotin was detected with Strep-PE by incubation for 30 min on ice. Changes in binding because of CIP treatment were detected by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) with Weasel software (Walter and Eliza Analysis Software Eclectic"

Alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism generate DC-SIGN mRNA variants, which have been detected at sites of pathogen entrance and transmission. We present evidence that DC-SIGN neck variants are expressed on dendritic and myeloid cells at the RNA and protein levels. Structural analysis revealed that multimerization of DC-SIGN within a cellular context depends on the lectin domain and the number and arrangement of the repeats within the neck region, whose glycosylation negatively affects oligomer formation. Naturally occurring DC-SIGN neck variants differ in multimerization competence in the cell membrane, exhibit altered sugar binding ability, and retain pathogen-interacting capacity, implying that pathogen-induced cluster formation predominates over the basal multimerization capability. Analysis of DC-SIGN neck polymorphisms indicated that the number of allelic variants is higher than previously thought and that multimerization of the prototypic molecule is modulated in the presence of allelic variants with a different neck structure. Our results demonstrate that the presence of allelic variants or a high level of expression of neck domain splicing isoforms might influence the presence and stability of DC-SIGN multimers on the cell surface, thus providing a molecular explanation for the correlation between DC-SIGN polymorphisms and altered susceptibility to HIV-1 and other pathogens.

Analysis of recombinant molecules has revealed that the monomeric lectin domain has low affinity for carbohydrates, whereas full-length DC-SIGN molecules form tetramers through their neck domain, thus allowing high affinity recognition of specific ligands (33Bernhard O.K.

In addition to this prototypical structure, alternative splicing events generate DC-SIGN isoform transcripts whose presence exhibits inter-individual variations (36Mummidi S. Catano G. Lam L.

The numerous DC-SIGN isoform transcripts reported to date include an alternative cytoplasmic tail, an absent transmembrane region, truncated lectin domains, and a variable number of repeats within the neck domain (36Mummidi S.

Moreover, the 23-residue repeat region of DC-SIGN is polymorphic at the genomic level (37Sakuntabhai A. Turbpaiboon C. Casademont I. Chuansumrit A. Lowhnoo T. Kajaste-Rudnitski A. Kalayanarooj S.M.

Five different alleles for the DC-SIGN neck domain have been identified to date, whose presence correlates with altered susceptibility to HIV-1 transmission (38Liu H. Hwangbo Y. Holte S. Lee J. Wang C. Kaupp N. Zhu H. Celum C. Corey L. McElrath M.J. Zhu T. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of the DC-SIGN neck variants has been further suggested by their detection at mucosal HIV transmission sites (39Liu H. Hladik F. Andrus T. Sakchalathorn P. Lentz G.M. Fialkow M.F. Corey L. McElrath M.J. Zhu T. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 13: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Given the involvement of the neck domain in recombinant DC-SIGN multimerization, we hypothesized that the existence of this large array of polymorphic variants might have an impact on the repertoire of pathogen recognition by dendritic cells, as well as on the establishment of interactions between dendritic cells and other cell types. We have characterized naturally occurring alternative splicing isoforms, allelic variants and mutant isoforms of DC-SIGN in terms of surface receptor multimerization and adhesive and pathogen-recognition capabilities, and found that the lectin domain contributes to DC-SIGN multimerization on the cell surface, that glycosylation of the neck domain negatively regulates formation of multimers, and that a neck domain with a single 23-residue repeat is sufficient to mediate DC-SIGN multimerization on the cell surface. Functional comparison of the distinct constructs revealed that the basal multimerization of DC-SIGN does not correlate with enhanced binding to endogenous or pathogenic ligands, indicating that pathogen-induced cluster formation predominates over the basal multimerization capability of the DC-SIGN molecule and is the driving force for the DC-SIGN-dependent pathogen capture and internalization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of MDDCsHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats from healthy donors over a Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Norway) gradient according to standard procedures. Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic cell sorting using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and immediately subjected to the dendritic cell differentiation protocol (40Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4475) Google Scholar). Monocytes were cultured for 5–7 days in complete medium with 1000 units/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) and 1000 units/ml interleukin-4 (PreProtech, Rocky Hill, NJ) cytokine addition every second day, to obtain a population of immature MDDCs.CellsThe acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, and the erythroleukemic K562 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium). COS-7 and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% fetal calf serum. THP-1 differentiation was induced by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml), Bryostatin (10 nm), either alone or in combination with interleukin-4 (1000 units/ml), as described before (14Puig-Kroger A.

DC-SIGN mRNA was optimally amplified after 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, for 45 s), annealing (62 °C, for 45 s), and extension (72 °C, for 1 min), followed by a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. Oligonucleotides used for amplification of the coding region of the prototypical DC-SIGN isoform 1A (DC-SIGN 1A) mRNA were CD209s (5′-GGGAATTCAGAGTGGGGTGACATGAGTGAC-3′) and CD209as (5′-CCCCAAGCTTGTGAAGTTCTGCTACGCAGGAG-3′) (6Geijtenbeek T.B.

Amplification of DC-SIGN isoforms was accomplished using the primer pairs CD209s/CD209as, CD209soluble/CD209as, and CD209Ib/CD209as. The oligonucleotide CD209soluble (5′-GATACAAGAGCTTAGCAGTGTCCA-3′) spans through the exon Ic/exon III junction previously described for potentially soluble transmembrane-lacking DC-SIGN isoforms. The oligonucleotide CD209Ib (5′-GGGAATTCTGGCCAGCCATGGCCTCAGC-3′) includes the alternative translation initiation site found in exon Ib, which originates the DC-SIGN 1B isoforms (Fig. 1A). PCR-generated fragments were resolved in agarose gels, purified, sequenced, and cloned into pCDNA3.1(–) vector.Identification of DC-SIGN Polymorphic Isoforms and Generation of His- and FLAG-containing DC-SIGN Expression VectorsThree DC-SIGN allelic variants (-D3, -D5, and -D7) were identified by PCR on genomic DNA from 300 independent donors. Amplification of the DC-SIGN neck domain-encoding exon was carried out on 300 ng of genomic DNA using oligonucleotides CD209-4F, (5′-GGGATTAACCAAGACCTTGGCTC-3′) and CD209-4R, (5′-CCCAACTTCTCCTAGTCTGGAGG-3′). After 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, for 45 s), annealing (61 °C, for 30 s), and extension (72 °C, for 90 s), followed by a 10-min extension step at 72 °C, PCR-generated fragments were resolved in agarose gels, purified, cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced.Swapping of the neck domains between the allelic variants and the prototypic form of DC-SIGN was done after introduction of silent mutations creating restriction sites at Val63 (KpnI) and Ala247/Ala248 (SacII) in pCDNA3.1-DC-SIGN 1A and the allelic variants in pCR4-TOPO.

Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis included: DC-SIGN-C/Ss (5′-GAGCTTAGCAGGGTCTCTTGGCCATGGTC-3′) and DC-SIGN-C/Sas (5′-GACCATGGCCAAGAGACCCTGCTAAGCTC-3′), for mutation of Cys37 to Ser, with the resulting plasmid termed pCDNA3.1-(DC-SIGN C/S); and DC-SIGN-N/Qs (5′-GACGCGATCTACCAGCAGCTGACCCAGCTTAAAG-3′) and DC-SIGN-N/Qas (5′-CTTTAAGCTGGGTCAGCTGCTGGTAGATCGCGTC-3′), for mutation of Asn80 to Gln, with the resulting plasmid termed pCDNA3.1-(DC-SIGN N/Q). Each mutant construct was verified by DNA sequencing.To generate DC-SIGN expression vectors lacking the lectin domain, PCR was performed on the pCDNA3.1-DC-SIGN 1A using oligonucleotides CD209s and CD209ΔLectin (5′-CCCCAAGCTTGTCACAGGCGTTCCACTGCAGC-3′). PCR-generated fragments were resolved in agarose gels, purified, and sequenced. Fragments containing either the full-length (8dΔL) and a 7- and 6-repeat neck regions (repeats 1 through 7, 7dΔL; repeats 1 through 6, 6dΔL) were cloned into pCDNA3.1(–) to yield pCDNA3.1-DC-SIGN 8dΔL, pCDNA3.1-DC-SIGN 7dΔL, and pCDNA3.1-DC-SIGN 6dΔL plasmids.Flow Cytometry and AntibodiesCellular phenotypic analysis was carried out by indirect immunofluorescence, using FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK). Monoclonal antibodies used for cell surface staining included MR1 (directed against the lectin domain of DC-SIGN), and the supernatant from the mouse myeloma P3-X63Ag8 (X63) was used as the control. All incubations were done in the presence of 50 μg/ml human IgG to prevent binding through the Fc portion of the antibodies. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with an EPICS-CS (Coulter Científica, Madrid, Spain) using log amplifiers.ImmunofluorescenceCells were resuspended in PBS and allowed to adhere onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 60 min at 37 °C. After a brief washing step with PBS, cells were fixed and permeabilized in a 1:1 solution of acetone:methanol for 10 min at –20 °C, washed, and stained with the MR1 monoclonal antibody (13Relloso M.

For precipitation of biotin-labeled proteins, Streptavidin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the lysates, and the mixture incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, beads were extensively washed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide, 0.1% Brij 58, resuspended in 3× Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 6.25 mm Tris base, 10% glycerol), and boiled. Eluted material was resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions and subsequent Western blot with polyclonal antibodies specific for DC-SIGN. Coprecipitation of DC-SIGN 1A/DC-SIGN 8dΔL or DC-SIGN 1A-His/DC-SIGN-D3/-D5-FLAG hetero-oligomers was performed on lysates from transiently transfected COS-7 with MR1 antibody as previously described (42Caparros E.

Briefly, immature MDDC was washed with PBS 1 mm EDTA, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and incubated in the presence of 100 μl of 10 mm DTSSP in sodium citrate 5 mm, pH 5.0, for 30 min at room temperature. Stop solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was added (15 min at room temperature), and cells were washed twice with PBS. Total cell lysates were obtained in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm Pefabloc (Alexis Biochemicals), and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin (Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer). 10 μg of each lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described for Western blot experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2093908807,"The B-Raf(V600E) mutant, found in 65% of human melanomas, drives constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and is implicated in tumorigenesis. Recently, we showed that B-Raf is important for spindle formation and the mitotic spindle checkpoint arrest. In this study, we demonstrate that B-Raf(V600E) signaling deregulates the spindle checkpoint as a consequence of stabilizing monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) levels in human melanoma cells. Upon introducing the B-Raf(V600E) mutant into wild-type B-Raf melanoma cells, Mps1 protein and activity increased 3- and 10-fold, respectively. In addition, Mps1 became hyperphosphorylated, which correlated with stabilization of Mps1 protein levels. In contrast, reduction of B-Raf by RNAi or inactivation of ERK by the MEK inhibitor U0126 resulted in a precipitous decline in Mps1 levels. Together, these results suggest that B-Raf signaling through ERK regulates the stability of Mps1. Finally, B-Raf(V600E) expression induces a mitotic delay due to promoting robust activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. These effects were dependent on the induction of Mps1 levels by oncogenic B-Raf(V600E) as shown by depleting Mps1 with short interfering RNA. Collectively, our findings implicate a new mechanism through which B-Raf(V600E) exerts its oncogenic effects in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2093900947,"Channels formed by the gap junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) contribute to the proper control of insulin secretion. We investigated the impact of chronic hyperlipidemia on Cx36 expression in pancreatic beta-cells. Prolonged exposure to the saturated free fatty acid palmitate reduced the expression of Cx36 in several insulin-secreting cell lines and isolated mouse islets. The effect of palmitate was fully blocked upon protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition by H89 and (Rp)-cAMP, indicating that the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in the control of Cx36 expression. Palmitate treatment led to overexpression of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER-1gamma), which bound to a functional cAMP-response element located in the promoter of the CX36 gene. Inhibition of ICER-1gamma overexpression prevented the Cx36 decrease, as well as the palmitate-induced beta-cell secretory dysfunction. Finally, freshly isolated islets from mice undergoing a long term high fat diet expressed reduced Cx36 levels and increased ICER-1gamma levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that chronic exposure to palmitate inhibits the Cx36 expression through PKA-mediated ICER-1gamma overexpression. This Cx36 down-regulation may contribute to the reduced glucose sensitivity and altered insulin secretion observed during the pre-diabetic stage and in the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2081940444,"The mechanisms mediating and regulating assembly and disassembly of intercellular junctions is a subject of intensive research. The IgG autoantibodies produced in patients with the immunoblistering skin disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) can induce keratinocyte (KC) dyshesion (acantholysis) via mechanisms that involve signaling kinases targeting intercellular adhesion molecules, thus providing a useful model to study the physiologic regulation of KC cohesion. Previous studies showed that activation of Src and protein kinase C are the earliest events in the PV IgG-induced intracellular phosphorylation cascades and that cholinergic agonists are effective for treating patients with pemphigus. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms allowing cholinergic agonists to inhibit PV IgG-induced acantholysis and phosphorylation of KC adhesion molecules. The extent of acantholysis in KC monolayers correlated closely with the degree of PV IgG-induced phosphorylation of p120- and β-catenins, with classic isoforms of protein kinase C mediating serine phosphorylation of β-catenin and Src-tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-catenin. The M1 muscarinic agonist pilocarpine blocked phosphorylation of both catenins, which could be abolised by the M1 antagonist MT7. The α7 nicotinic agonist AR-R17779 inhibited phosphorylation of P120-cateinin. The α7 antagonist methyllycaconitine abolished the effect of AR-R17779. Okadaic acid abrogated protective effects of agonists on phosphorylation of β-catenin, and pervanadate, on that of p120-catenin. Stimulation of KCs with pilocarpine significantly (p < 0.05) elevated both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase activities in KCs. AR-R17779 both stimulated tyrosine phosphatase and decreased PV IgG-induced Src activity. Methyllycaconitine released Src activity in intact KCs and caused acantholysis. Thus, downstream signaling from M1 abolished PV IgG-dependent catenin phosphorylation due to activation of both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases, whereas α7 action involved both activation of tyrosine phosphatase and inhibition of Src. These findings identified novel paradigm of regulation of signaling kinases associated with cholinergic receptors and provided mechanistic explanation of therapeutic activity of cholinomimetics in PV patients.

The intercellular adhesion of epithelial cells is mediated by four types of junctions: tight (zonula occludens), adherens (zonula adherens), desmosomal (macula adherens), and gap junctions (macula communications). The mechanisms mediating and regulating assembly and disassembly of intercellular junctions is a subject of intensive research. Although functional components of adhesion complexes are well known, much less is known about the signaling mechanisms that initiate, sustain, and terminate cell cohesion. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of components of adhesion complexes are probably the most important regulatory events altering both their structural integrity and the adhesive capacity.

PV is an IgG autoantibody-mediated disease of skin and mucosa leading to progressive blistering and non-healing erosions.

Adherens junctions are assembled by classic cadherins, transmembrane proteins that form homodimers with other cadherin molecules on adjacent cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner. They interact with the submembrane plaque proteins β-catenin and γ-catenin (or plakoglobin) linked to the actin cytoskeleton via α-catenin directly, or indirectly via vinculin or α-actinin, as well as with p120-cateinin. Both β- and p120-catenins have been shown to participate in the pathways activated by cadherin engagement leading to stable adherens junction formation (1Alema S. Salvatore A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, p120-catenin is thought to regulate cadherin clustering during formation of adherens junctions. Desmosomal junctions also assemble in a Ca2+-dependent manner.

Some intercellular junction proteins are phosphorylated on serine, some on tyrosine, and some on both residues. The phosphorylation state of a given adhesion molecule is determined by both protein kinase and phosphatase activities. Experimental inhibition of either tyrosine- or serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases in both cases results in major changes of cell morphology manifested by rapid rounding-up of individual cells and alterations of monolayer integrity (3Volberg T.

Although both Src and EGFR kinases contribute to cell shrinkage and keratin filament aggregation, the peak of Src activity precedes that of EGFR kinase (17Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Kitajima Y.

Activation of PKC is also one of the earliest events of PV IgG-induced acantholysis (19Seishima M. Iwasaki-Bessho Y. Itoh Y. Nozawa Y. Amagai M. Kitajima Y. Arch. Dermatol.

This suggested that Dsg-dependent signaling is a secondary, or tertiary, pathway mediating processing and utilization of internalized Dsg molecules rather than a primary downstream signaling emanating from the cell membrane of KCs due to PV IgG binding. The network regulating phosphorylation of intercellular junction proteins is rather complex and interdependent with pathways mediating cell response to various kinds of environmental stimuli downstream of growth factors receptors, G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors, and ion channels/pumps (21Pasdar M.

Dermatol. 2006; 15: 265-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ACh is remarkably abundant in the epidermis and other types of the surface epithelium (25Grando S.A. Kist D.A. Qi M. Dahl M.V.

Wessler I. Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 515-523Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). ACh and related compounds affect keratinocyte function through binding to different classes of ACh receptors, the muscarinic (mAChR) and the nicotinic (nAChR) classes of cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Ref. 27Grando S.A. Pittelkow M.R. Schallreuter K.U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 1948-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Human KCs express five, M1–M5, mAChR subtypes and α3, α5, α7, α9, α10, β1, β2, and β4 nAChR subunits. Both muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists can increase the permeability of keratinocyte monolayers, cause acantholysis in vitro, and widen intercellular spaces in the epidermis. In contrast to antagonists, cholinergic agonists stimulate adhesion of KCs (reviewed in Ref. 24Grando S.A. Exp. Dermatol. 2006; 15: 265-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The agonists can reverse acantholysis induced in keratinocyte cultures by cholinergic antagonists, the serine proteinase trypsin, and the calcium chelator EDTA (28Grando S.A. Dahl M.V. J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol. 1993; 2: 72-86Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent research convincingly demonstrated that the molecular mechanism of cholinergic control of keratinocyte adhesion involves an ACh receptor-dependent changes in the phosphorylation status of keratinocyte adhesion molecules. The panmuscarinic antagonist atropine increased the phosphorylation level of E-cadherin by ∼120%, Dsg 3 by 33%, and that of β- and γ-catenin by 50%, whereas the antagonist of ganglionic-type nAChRs mecamylamine produced only minor changes in the phosphorylation status of keratinocyte adhesion molecules (29Nguyen V.T.

In the presence of carbachol, a mixed muscarinic and nicotinic agonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, atropine-induced phosphorylation was suppressed. Carbachol also treated PV IgG-induced acantholysis in culture of human KCs and epidermis of the neonatal mice that received PV autoantibodies (28Grando S.A. Dahl M.V. J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol. 1993; 2: 72-86Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Nguyen V.T. Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Pittelkow M.R. Kitajima Y. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 2004; 140: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cholinomimetic drugs pyridostigmine bromide, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and pilocarpine, a preferential M1 mAChR agonist (32Kebabian J.W. Neumeyer J.L. The RBI Handbook of Receptor Classification. Research Biochemicals International, Natick1994Google Scholar), both showed therapeutic efficacy in recent clinical trials involving PV patients (33Grando S.A. J. Invest Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2004; 9: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Iraji F. Yoosefi A. Int. J. Dermatol. 2006; 45: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An indirect finding that cholinomimetics may be an effective treatment of pemphigus was provided by studies showing successful use of nicotinamide as a steroid-sparing agent in pemphigus (35Chaffins M.L. Collison D. Fivenson D.P. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1993; 28: 998-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Nicotinamide exhibits cholinomimetic effects (36Romanenko A.V. Fiziologicheskii. Zhurnal. (Kiev). 1987; 33: 51-56PubMed Google Scholar) due to both stimulation of ACh release (37Koeppen A. Klein J. Erb C. Loeffelholz K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1139-1145PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (38Stoytcheva M. Zlatev R. Electroanalysis. 1996; 8: 676-679Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, because cigarette smoke contains the cholinomimetic agent nicotine, a reported case of PV that improved due to cigarette smoking (39Mehta J.N. Martin A.G. Arch. Dermatol. 2000; 136: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) further suggested that pharmacologic activation of the keratinocyte ACh axis can facilitate healing of pemphigus erosions. The therapeutic effects of cholinomimetics in PV may stem from their ability to abrogate PV IgG-induced phosphorylation of keratinocyte adhesion molecules, because carbachol and pyridostigmine bromide can decrease by severalfold the PV IgG-dependent phosphorylation of E-cadherin and γ-catenin (31Nguyen V.T. Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Pittelkow M.R. Kitajima Y. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 2004; 140: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the cholinergic control of keratinocyte adhesion merits further consideration because of a potential for development of novel anti-acantholytic therapies using cholinergic drugs. In this study, we sought to elucidate molecular mechanisms allowing cholinergic agonists to inhibit PV IgG-induced acantholysis and phosphorylation of keratinocyte adhesion molecules. We found that PV IgG effects on KCs involved phosphorylation of both p120- and β-catenins, with PKC mediating serine phosphorylation of β-catenin and Src-tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-catenin. Downstream signaling from keratinocyte M1 mAChR interfered with PV IgG-dependent catenin phosphorylation due to activation of both type II serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2A) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), whereas the mechanism of action of α7 nAChR involved both activation of PTP and inhibition of Src. The elevation of phosphorylation of p120- and β-catenins correlated directly with an increase of keratinocyte dyshesion. These findings identify novel paradigm of regulation of signaling kinases and phosphatases associated with ACh receptors and provide novel mechanistic explanation of therapeutic activity of cholinomimetics in PV patients. IgG Fractions and ReagentsThe results reported herein were obtained in experiments utilizing pooled IgG fractions isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography protein G affinity chromatography from sera of six patients with mucocutaneous PV characterized elsewhere (17Chernyavsky A.I.

The potent, M1-selective inhibitor MT7 (also known as M1-toxin 1 (40Karlsson E. Jolkkonen M. Mulugeta E. Onali P. Adem A.

The α7-preferring agonist AR-R17779 was synthesized at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (Wilmington, DE). Both the preferential M1 mAChR agonist pilocarpine and the preferential α7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PKC inhibitors Gö-6976 and rottlerin, the inhibitor of Src family of protein-tyrosine kinase PP2, the preferential inhibitor of PP2A phosphatase okadaic acid (OA), and the PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (converted to pervanadate by hydrogen peroxide) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (EMD Biosciences, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The PKC inhibitor chelerythrine was from Axxora, LLC (San Diego, CA). The FACE™ c-Src kit was purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferone (DiFMUP)-based assays for measurement of the activities of tyrosine phosphatase (R-22067) and serine/threonine phosphatases (R-33700, adjusted for PP2A measurement) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to β-catenin and phosphoserine/threonine were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), to p120-catenin, from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. Inc., and to phosphotyrosine, from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Keratinocyte Exposure ExperimentsHuman keratinocyte cultures were started from normal neonatal foreskins (25Grando S.A. Kist D.A. Qi M. Dahl M.V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 32-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning Glass Works, Coring, NY) in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium containing 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2 incubator at 0.09 mm calcium. The keratinocyte cultures used in experiments were between the passages 2 and 4, ∼80% confluent, grown from at least three different foreskin donors. The IgG fractions were diluted in culture medium and added to the monolayers at the final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Prior to exposures, some monolayers were pretreated with pharmacologic inhibitors (see “Results”). The control monolayers were left intact. Sixteen hours prior to experiments, the concentration of Ca2+ in growth medium was increased to 1.2 mm. All monolayers were exposed to test agents at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for different periods of time (see “Results”) and then used in the Src, PP2A, or PTP assays in accordance to manufacturer's protocols. Assay of Keratinocyte Cell-Cell AttachmentThe effects of test agents on spreading of keratinocyte cytoplasm and formation of intercellular junctions were measured using the monolayer permeability assay (28Grando S.A. Dahl M.V. J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol. 1993; 2: 72-86Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Nguyen V.T. Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Bercovich D. Orr-Urtreger A. Vetter D.E. Wess J. Beaudet A.L. Kitajima Y. Grando S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 534-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, a confluent keratinocyte monolayer was formed in Transwell-COL (Costar, Cambridge, MA) chambers inserted into the 24-well tissue culture plates 2–3 days after KCs were seeded at a cell density of 1 × 104/100 μl keratinocyte growth medium into the chambers and cultivated at 37 °C in humid atmosphere with 5% CO2. Confluent monolayers were fed with keratinocyte growth medium-containing test agents. After 1 h of incubation, the permeability of the monolayer was measured by adding 100 of μl keratinocyte growth medium containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/insert, 6.7 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) to each culture. Five minutes later, 100-μl aliquots of solution containing [3H]thymidine were taken in triplicate from each lower chamber. The more the cells became detached from each other and rounded up, the more the tracer penetrated into the lower chamber through the porous membrane of the upper chamber, and the higher the permeability coefficient (PC) values were obtained: PC = (cpm in experimental culture/cpm in control culture) × 100. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AssaysKCs were scraped from the bottom of the dishes and placed in lysis buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were homogenized, and protein concentration was determined. The anti-p120- or β-catenin antibody was added to cell lysate, and the preparation was gently rocked at 4 °C overnight. A protein G-agarose bead suspension from the Protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were collected by pulsing 5 s in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm and rinsed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer. The agarose beads were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2.5% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Protein samples were boiled and separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked overnight with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and incubated for 1 h with either phosphoserine (for β-catenin) or phosphotyrosine (for p120-catenin) antibody. Control blots stained with either anti-p120- or β-catenin antibody were run to confirm equal loading in the precipitates of the protein in question. After washing in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody, and then developed using the ECL + Plus chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To visualize antibody binding, the membranes were scanned with a Storm™/FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Mountain View, CA) or Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Quantitation of bands was done using ImageQuaNT software (43Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Jolkovsky D.L. Pinkerton K.E. Grando S.A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The signal was expressed as arbitrary densitometric units. All blots studied were within the linear range of exposure. Statistical AnalysisAll experiments were performed in triplicates, and the results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Differences were deemed significant if the calculated p value was <0.05. The Protein Kinases Mediating PV IgG-induced Phosphorylation of Keratinocyte CateninsPV IgG significantly (p < 0.05) elevated serine phosphorylation of β-catenin and tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-catenin (Fig. 1). Inactivation of PKC with chelerythrine, 1 μm, prevented PV IgG-induced serine phosphorylation of β-catenin (Fig. 1). The Src inhibitor PP2, 30 μm, inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-catenin (Fig. 1). These results indicated that PV IgG effects on KCs involve phosphorylation of both p120- and β-catenins, with PKC mediating serine phosphorylation of β-catenin and Src-tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-catenin. PKC Isoforms Preferentially Mediate PV IgG-induced Phosphorylation of β-CateninTo elucidate which PKC isoforms lead to serine phosphorylation of β-catenin in KCs exposed to PV IgG, we used the PKC inhibitor Gö-6976, which selectively inhibits PKC-α and -β isozymes without affecting PKC-δ, -ϵ, and -ζ isoforms, and rottlerin, a PKC inhibitor that exhibits greater selectivity for the δ isoform. As seen in Fig. 1, Gö-6976, 1 μm, decreased by >2.5-fold the level of PV-IgG-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin. The PKC-δ preferring inhibitor rottlerin, 5 μm, was much less effective (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the classic PKC isoforms are medi"

To examine the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon, Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in zinc-deficient (D, 0.5 μm zinc), zinc-supplemented (S, 50 μm zinc), or control (C, 4 μm zinc) media. After 24 h of culture, cells in the D group were characterized by a 50% decrease in intracellular zinc and a 35% increase in intracellular iron relative to cells in the S and C groups. The increase in cellular iron was associated with increased transferrin receptor 1 protein and mRNA levels and increased ferritin light chain expression. The divalent metal transporter 1(+)iron-responsive element isoform mRNA was decreased during zinc deficiency-induced iron accumulation. Examination of zinc-deficient cells revealed increased binding of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) and decreased binding of IRP1 to a consensus iron-responsive element. The increased IRP2-binding activity in zinc-deficient cells coincided with an increased level of IRP2 protein. The accumulation of IRP2 protein was independent of zinc deficiency-induced intracellular nitric oxide production but was attenuated by the addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or ascorbate to the D medium. These data support the concept that zinc deficiency can result in alterations in iron transporter, storage, and regulatory proteins, which facilitate iron accumulation.

These data support the concept that zinc deficiency can result in alterations in iron transporter, storage, and regulatory proteins, which facilitate iron accumulation.

IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although many of these effects can be attributed to reductions in the activities of select zinc-dependent enzymes, and reductions in circulating growth factors, some pathology can be a consequence of zinc deficiency-induced alterations in the metabolism of other nutrients. A number of studies indicate that a diet deficient in zinc can result in the accumulation of iron in numerous tissues, including testes, liver, kidney, and spleen, as well as in fetuses of zinc-deficient dams (2Keen C.L.

Cellular iron levels are primarily regulated by intake, recycling, and conservation of body iron stores, and to a limited extent, by excretion. Cellular iron uptake is predominantly controlled by the transferrin (Tf) 2The abbreviations used are: TftransferrinTEMPOL4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylDAF-2 DA4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetateASCascorbateβ-MEβ-mercaptoethanolDFOdesferrioxamine mesylateDMT1divalent metal transporter 1FACferric ammonium citrateFtferritinFtHferritin heavy chainFtLferritin light chainIREiron-responsive elementICP-AESinductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometryIRPiron regulatory proteinLIPlabile iron poolNACN-acetylcysteineRNSreactive nitrogen speciesROSreactive oxygen speciesSEITS-ethylisothioureaTfR1transferrin receptor 1UTRuntranslated regionFBSfetal bovine serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDzinc-deficient mediumSzinc-supplemented mediumCcontrol mediumiNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthase. 2The abbreviations used are: TftransferrinTEMPOL4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylDAF-2 DA4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetateASCascorbateβ-MEβ-mercaptoethanolDFOdesferrioxamine mesylateDMT1divalent metal transporter 1FACferric ammonium citrateFtferritinFtHferritin heavy chainFtLferritin light chainIREiron-responsive elementICP-AESinductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometryIRPiron regulatory proteinLIPlabile iron poolNACN-acetylcysteineRNSreactive nitrogen speciesROSreactive oxygen speciesSEITS-ethylisothioureaTfR1transferrin receptor 1UTRuntranslated regionFBSfetal bovine serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDzinc-deficient mediumSzinc-supplemented mediumCcontrol mediumiNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthase./transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) uptake system. When cellular iron is needed, TfR1 protein levels increase, allowing the cell to import iron as diferric Tf. Subsequently, iron is released from Tf in acidic endosomes where it is utilized, or stored in ferritin (Ft). In response to an increased iron load, cellular Ft levels are increased by a combination of transcriptional and translational mechanisms (8Hintze K.J. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15048-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), thus minimizing the labile iron pool (LIP), or the amount of “free” iron (9Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P. Cabantchik Z.I. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15382-15386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). High LIP levels can be detrimental to the cell's macromolecules via the ability of iron to participate in Fenton-mediated free radical damage (10Kruszewski M. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).The LIP is tightly regulated by post-translational control of mRNAs for iron carriers/transporters and storage proteins that contain either 5′- or 3′-untranslated (UTR) base sequences, which form hairpin loops, and are referred to as iron-responsive elements (IREs). Post-translational control of IRE-containing mRNAs is conferred by iron regulatory proteins (IRP) 1 and 2, which “sense” LIP levels of the cell. When cellular iron levels decrease, the affinities of IRPs for IREs increase, while conversely, if cellular iron levels rise, the affinities of IRPs for IREs decrease. The decreased affinity of IRPs for IREs under high iron conditions is a result of conformational alterations to IRP1 (11Walden W.E. Selezneva A.I. Dupuy J. Volbeda A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Theil E.C.

In the former, increased cellular iron results in the formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster, consequently decreasing the affinity of IRP1 for IREs and thereby switching the function of this protein to a cytosolic aconitase. In the latter case, increased cellular oxygen, and/or iron derived from increased non-heme iron, the breakdown of heme iron, or heme itself, result in enhanced proteasomal degradation of IRP2 (12Hanson E.S.

Conversely, if the cellular iron load increases, the Fe-S cluster assembly in IRP1 decreases its affinity for the IRE, releasing inhibition of translation of the mRNA for the Ft protein. Concomitantly, increased iron load enhances IRP2 degradation, which also contributes to increased Ft synthesis (23Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mRNAs for the iron transport proteins TfR1 and the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)(+)IRE isoform contain IREs in their 3′-UTR region, which when bound by IRPs, protect the mRNA from nucleases. This mRNA stability leads to increased translation. DMT1(-)IRE, an alternative splice form for DMT1, eliminates the 3′ IRE, and thus its iron responsiveness. This reciprocal arrangement between 3′ and 5′ IREs ensures that iron transport proteins will be abundant under conditions of iron deficiency and that iron storage proteins will be abundant during conditions of iron excess (24Hubert N.

Our results show that increased tissue iron load secondary to a zinc deficiency results from a departure from the normally tight regulation of cellular iron levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents–Fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 0.1% trypsin/EDTA solution, Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and the RiboGreen RNA and Cyquant DNA assay systems were purchased from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen.

The FtL TaqMan assay was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA). The RETROscript kit, RNase inhibitor, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) Gene Specific RT-PCR kit, and 18 S rRNA primer set were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). QIAshredder and RNeasy kits were purchased from Qiagen. 4,5-Diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA), Hoechst 33342, 1400W, and S-ethylisothiourea (SEIT) were purchased from Calbiochem. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Preparation of Zinc-free Buffers and Zinc Treatment Media–Zinc was removed from buffers by batch washing with 5% (w/v) Chelex-100 for 1 h. The first batch of supernatant wash was discarded, and subsequent batches were pooled. Removal of spurious Chelex-100 resin particles from buffer supernatants was ensured by filtration (0.22 μm). Zinc-deficient medium (D, 0.5 μm zinc) was prepared from FBS that had been subjected to a relatively short dialysis (12 h) against the chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. To remove the chelator after zinc binding, the FBS was subsequently dialyzed exhaustively (72 h) against several changes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The zinc-depleted FBS was diluted with DMEM, HEPES (final concentration, 20 mm), and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. Zinc-supplemented medium (S, 50 μm zinc) was prepared directly from D medium by adding a stock solution of ZnSO4 to obtain a final concentration of 50 μm zinc. Thus, D and S media differed only by their respective concentrations of zinc. Control medium (C, 4 μm zinc) was prepared from undialyzed FBS and had a final zinc concentration of 4 μm. All media contained 3 μm iron, 0.2 μm copper, and a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml (26Chou S.S. Clegg M.S. Momma T.Y. Niles B.J. Duffy J.Y. Daston G.P. Keen C.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Cell Culture–Swiss 3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were propagated under log phase growth conditions in C medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells (passages 3-12) were plated at a density of 1.5 million cells per 20 × 140-mm dish. After 24 h, C medium was removed, and cells were synchronized by incubation in DMEM for 24 h (t = 0 h). Subsequently, DMEM was removed, experimental media were added, and cells were grown for the indicated time frames (t = 16 h, t = 24 h, and t = 32 h).Media and Cell Mineral Analysis–Media and buffer trace element concentrations were determined directly by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometry (ICP-AES, Trace Scan, Thermo Elemental, Wilmington, MA). For the analysis of cell trace elements, medium was removed by vacuum suction, and the cells were then rinsed with two successive volumes of ice cold phosphate-buffered saline. Excess phosphate-buffered saline was removed from the dishes by vacuum suction, and the culture dishes with attached cells were placed directly in a -80 °C freezer to promote membrane disruption. After freezing, the cells were thawed and harvested by scraping them into buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The cell milieu from each dish was transferred by plastic transfer pipette into a microcentrifuge tube and vortexed at high speed for 1 min. An aliquot of each extract was removed for protein analysis, and the balance of each extract was acidified with Ultrex nitric acid (final concentration of 2 m). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was subjected to ICP-AES for the determination of zinc and iron. The ICP-AES was calibrated with a series of multielement standards diluted in 2 m nitric acid. Values were corrected for appropriate blank readings, dilution, and starting protein content. Data are expressed as pmol of metal/μg of cell protein.Total Protein, RNA, and DNA Quantification–Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined with the RiboGreen Assay. Cellular DNA was determined by the Cyquant DNA assay (26Chou S.S. Clegg M.S. Momma T.Y. Niles B.J. Duffy J.Y. Daston G.P. Keen C.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Immunoblot Analysis–Cytosolic fractions were prepared as described (26Chou S.S. Clegg M.S. Momma T.Y. Niles B.J. Duffy J.Y. Daston G.P. Keen C.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A solution of 5% (w/v) skim milk in TTBS (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) was used for blocking and antibody dilution. The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence. Membranes were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer, following manufacturer's specifications, and blotted for β-actin. Densitometry analysis was performed by Quantity One software after capturing the image in a ChemiDoc XRS gel documentation system (Bio-Rad).Semiquantitative Analysis of IRP1, IRP2, TfR1, FtL, iNOS, and DMT1 Isoform Transcripts–A real-time RT-PCR strategy was employed to measure relative transcript levels of IRP1, IRP2, TfR1, and FtL. RNA was isolated with QIAshredder and the RNeasy kits followed by quantification. Reverse transcription was performed with RETROscript on 0.2-0.9 μg of total RNA. Serial dilutions of cDNA were used to verify equivalent efficiency of real-time PCR reactions for each target compared with separate reactions for 18 S rRNA cDNA before multiplexing. The same cDNA was then used to measure each of the transcripts in multiplex with 18 S rRNA. Triplicate real-time PCR was conducted on 1/50 dilutions of cDNA in PCR buffer, 0.2 μm 18 S rRNA TaqMan, and 2 μm target TaqMan in an iCycler instrument (Bio-Rad). The threshold of detection was determined by iCycler software and triplicates were averaged for ΔCt (target Ct - 18 S rRNA Ct).DMT1 isoform and iNOS transcripts were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. cDNA was generated by RETROscript and PCR was done using 5% of that reaction, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.25 μg AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and 20 μm each of the primers DMT1(+)IRE forward 5′-CTGCTGAGCGAAGATACCAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCAGGAGCTTAGGTCAGAAG-3′ and DMT1(-)IRE forward 5′-CGCCCAGATTTTACACAGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGCTTCACTACCTGCACAC-3′ (24Hubert N. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12345-12350Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and the iNOS primer set obtained from Ambion. Amplification was normalized with 18 S rRNA primer set from Ambion, using a 3:7 ratio with 18 S rRNA competimers. PCR reactions were performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for 35 cycles in the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems). PCR products were resolved on 10% TBE gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. Densitometry was quantified as described for Western analysis.IRP-RNA Shift Assay–An IRE probe was made by first annealing 20 μm synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-CAATTCCTGCTTCAACAGTGCTTGGACGGAATTGTATACTTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCAAGTATACAATTCCGTCCAAGCACTGTTGAAGCAGGAATTGAGCT-3′, corresponding to a sequence shown to recognize both IRP1 and IRP2 (IRE loop sequence underlined) (28Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The pGEM-IRE was generated by cloning this sequence into pGEM. For confirmation of results, another vector was used that encoded the FtL IRE (generously provided by Dr. Elizabeth Leibold, University of Utah). Labeled RNA probes were transcribed from 0.5 μg of linearized templates using T7 RNA polymerase, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 10 mm ATP, GTP, UTP, and 100 μm CTP in a 20-μl reaction volume at 37 °C for 1 h. The DNA templates were digested for 15 min with RNase-free DNase at 37 °C, and free nucleotides were removed using a ProbeQuant G-50 micro column.Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped down in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, 3mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Igepal, 1× complete protease inhibitor without EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized in a glass homogenizer for 30 strokes. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 3,300 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The resulting supernatant fraction was stored at -80 °C until use.Binding activity of IRPs in cytosolic fractions was measured by diluting 10 μg of protein in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Igepal, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. Then, after addition of 60,000 cpm of RNA probe, the reaction was incubated for another 30 min, with 5 μg/μl heparin added for the last 10 min, in a final 20-μl reaction volume. To determine total IRP1 content, duplicate samples were incubated with 2% β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) for 5 min before addition of the probe. After addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 80% glycerol), samples were loaded onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run for 3 h at 150 V. The gel was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, imaged (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad), and quantified using Quantity One software.Live Cell NO Imaging and Conditioned Media Nitrite Levels–Synchronized 3T3 cells were grown for 24 h in 8-well glass chamber slides under 200 μl of the various zinc treatment media. At t = 24 h, medium was removed and the cells were carefully washed three times with rinse solution (phenol red-free DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated in 200 μl of DAF-2 DA solution (5 μm DAF-2 DA in 0.5% FBS, DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The solution was removed and replaced with 200 μl of DAF-2 DA-Hoechst solution (0.5% FBS, DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 μm DAF-2 DA, 3 μg/ml Hoechst 33342). After 10 min of further incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with rinse solution. Cells were imaged immediately for DAF-2 DA and Hoechst 33342 fluorescence under 200-μl rinse solution. Images were captured, processed, and stored via an imaging system composed of an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope (Melville, NY) with epi-fluorescence (mercury arc excitation source), and trichroic emission cube (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas Red), connected to an automated LEP filter wheel (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas Red excitation filters) controlled by a Mac 2002 controller (Ludl, New York, NY). A Hamamatsu Orca II charge-coupled device camera (Bridge-water, NJ) captured fluorescent images through a 10× UV/340 lens. Captured images were processed and stored on a Dell workstation running ISee imaging software (Inovision Corp., Raleigh, NC).Nitrite levels were determined in conditioned medium from synchronized 3T3 cells cultured for 24 h in the various treatment media. Nitrite was converted to NO in the purge vessel containing a reducing agent (1% (w/v) potassium iodide in acetic acid), which is carried by N2 gas and subsequently mixed with ozone to generate a chemiluminescence signal that was detected by a nitric-oxide analyzer 280i (Sievers Instruments Inc., Boulder, CO). The system was calibrated with a series of sodium nitrite standards ranging from 10 to 600 nm. Under the conditions used for nitrite determination, nitrate cannot be converted to NO. This outcome was verified by injecting a 10 μm solution of sodium nitrate into the reaction chamber, which yielded no detectable chemiluminescence.Statistics–All culture experiments were performed at least three times. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (SPSS version 10.0), and treatments generating a significant F-value were subjected to post-hoc analysis using the Fisher's least significant difference test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Data are presented as means ± S.E. In the case of real-time RT-PCR data, natural log ΔCt and ΔCt relative to t = 0h(2(ΔΔCt)) were used in one-way analysis of variance with least significant difference or Kruskal-Wallis post-hoc analysis. Outcomes of these statistical tests were confirmed to be similar for both types of data transformation for all targets. Data are expressed as -fold difference from t = 0h(2(ΔΔCt)).RESULTSZinc Deficiency Results in Decreased Cellular Zinc and Increased Cellular Iron Levels–Our first experiment was to demonstrate that, similar to whole animal models fed zinc-deficient diets, cells cultured in zinc-deficient medium would accumulate iron. Thus, 3T3 cells were cultured in various experimental media to examine potential changes in cellular zinc and iron as a function of time. Beginning at t = 16 h, 3T3 cells cultured in D medium showed a significantly decreased zinc concentration relative to cells cultured in S or C medium (Fig. 1A). At t = 16 h, no significant differences in iron concentrations were evident among groups (Fig. 1B). However, by t = 24 h, the iron concentration in the D group was significantly and persistently elevated over that found in the S and C groups (Fig. 1B). Thus, cells cultured in D medium first displayed a decline in cellular zinc, which was followed temporally by an increase in cellular iron concentrations.Zinc Deficiency Alters Levels of Iron Transport Proteins–Increased cellular iron concentration in cells could be a result of increased transport into cells, increased storage, decreased export of iron, or a combination of these events. Initially, we examined transcript and protein levels of the major iron transport proteins, TfR1 and DMT1. At t = 16 h and prior to iron accumulation, no significant changes in the level of TfR1 protein could be detected among the groups; however, after t = 24 h, TfR1 expression significantly increased in the D group relative to the S and C groups (Fig. 2A). The change in TfR1 expression coincided with the increase in cellular iron concentrations. We then examined mRNA transcript levels of TfR1. As depicted in Fig. 2B, there was a significant elevation in TfR1 mRNA in the D group at t = 16 h when compared with the S and C groups. Although still significantly elevated, TfR1 mRNA in the D group relative to the control groups is tempered at t = 24 h (Fig. 2B), perhaps as a consequence of the increased iron in the cell. At t = 32 h, although the levels of TfR1 did not significantly differ among groups, the trend (p < 0.08) was for higher TfR1 mRNA in the D group compared with the S and C groups. Contrary to the results observed with a zinc deficiency, a positive control for iron accumulation (100 μm FAC supplementation of C medium for t = 24 h) resulted in the predicted decrease in TfR1 mRNA, whereas iron chelation (100 μm DFO in C medium for t = 24 h) resulted in higher TfR1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Zinc regulation of TfR1 transcript and protein levels. 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in C, S, or D media for the indicated time periods. A, representative image of three individual Western blot analyses of cytosolic fractions, with densitometry normalized to actin expressed as mean ± S.E. B, -fold difference from t = 0 h levels of TfR1 mRNA determined by real-time RT-PCR. C plus FAC (control plus 100 μm ferric ammonium citrate) and C plus DFO (control plus 100 μm DFO) are shown to demonstrate iron-loaded and iron-deficient responses, respectively, at t = 24 h. Each time point and treatment consisted of 4-5 samples each of which was run in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. *, significantly different within the time point, while bars labeled with different letters are significantly different between time points (p ≤ 0.05).View Large"

Although the molecular targets of and defensive response against nitric oxide (NO) in Escherichia coli are well studied, the response elements specific to S-nitrosothiols are less clear. Previously, we employed an integrated systems biology approach to unravel the E. coli NO-response network. Here we use a similar approach to confirm that S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) primarily impacts the metabolic and regulatory programs of E. coli in minimal medium by reaction with homocysteine and cysteine and subsequent disruption of the methionine biosynthesis pathway. Targeting of homocysteine and cysteine results in altered regulatory activity of MetJ, MetR, and CysB, activation of the stringent response and growth inhibition. Deletion of metJ or supplementation with methionine strongly attenuated the effect of GSNO on growth and gene expression. Furthermore, GSNO inhibited the ArcAB two-component system. Consistent with the underlying nitrosative and thiol-oxidative chemistry, growth inhibition and the majority of the regulatory perturbations were dependent upon GSNO internalization by the Dpp dipeptide transporter. Contrastingly, perturbation of NsrR appeared to be a result of the submicromolar levels of NO released from GSNO and did not require GSNO internalization.

NO and RSNO exhibit distinct chemical reactivities. NO reacts directly with metal centers and free radicals or mediates indirect effects by formation of other RNS in conjunction with oxygen or superoxide (7Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol.

Additionally, NO can freely diffuse across membranes, whereas, GSNO susceptibility has been shown to be dependent on the Dpp dipeptide ABC transporter in Salmonella (12Degroote M.A. Granger D.

As the first step for studying RNS challenge in E. coli, previous investigations often did not distinguish between RSNO and NO-mediated effects (15Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Such studies set the foundation for further distinction between RSNO and NO. A recent comparison of the E. coli response to NO and GSNO during chemostat growth confirmed the expectation that NO and GSNO mediate distinct transcriptional perturbations (18Pullan S.T. Gidley M.D. Jones R.A. Barrett J. Stevanin T.A. Read R.C. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1845-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). E. coli possesses a NO-specific response network: the transcription factors (TFs) NorR and NsrR mediate increased expression of defense proteins NO reductase NorV and NO dioxygenase HmpA, respectively, in response to NO (17Bodenmiller D.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Rodionov D.A. Dubchak I.L. Arkin A.P. Alm E.J. Gelfand M.S. PLoS Comput.

Using a systems analysis (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we have shown that, consistent with the known chemistry, NO primarily affects E. coli by reacting with metal groups, including those in the cytochrome oxidases, the Fe-S clusters of IscR, and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) synthesis protein dihydroxy acid dehydratase (IlvD). These interactions result in activation of NO defense circuits, respiration inhibition, and BCAA starvation. BCAA starvation in turn leads to metabolic adjustments, including perturbation of biosynthesis regulators, activation of the stringent response, and bacteriostasis. However, in contrast to the NO response, there are no known E. coli TFs that react directly with RSNO or RSNO-consuming defensive proteins. NorR and the ferric iron repressor (Fur) were identified as regulators of the response to GSNO in rich medium (15Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but whether these TFs react directly with GSNO remains unclear. Other works have suggested that participation of Fur in the GSNO response may be condition-dependent (16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10065-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of confirmed protein or TF interactions, GSNO has been shown to react directly with the thiol group of homocysteine (Hcy) in E. coli. Because Hcy is a key metabolite in the methionine (Met) biosynthesis pathway and the co-effector for regulatory activity of MetR, this reactivity affects Met biosynthesis and the regulatory state of MetR (16Flatley J.

Science. 1996; 272: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Perturbation of Met biosynthesis by GSNO, but not by NO, was recognized as a major difference between the effects of GSNO and NO on E. coli during chemostat growth (18Pullan S.T.

We have recently applied a systems approach to map the NO response network in E. coli (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This approach integrated transcriptome analysis, network component analysis (NCA), genetic knockouts, phenotypes, and biochemical experiments to identify response networks and targets. Here, we use a similar approach to identify the GSNO targets and response network in aerobic batch culture, with particular focus on comparison of GSNO- and NO-mediated effects. Consistent with the known chemistry, we have shown that GSNO primarily reacts with thiols and not with the metal groups that are targeted by NO. The GSNO targets include cysteine (Cys) and Hcy. Depletion of Hcy and Cys has many downstream effects, including growth inhibition and altered activity of the CysB, MetJ, and MetR TFs. In addition to metabolic targets, GSNO decreases the activity of the ArcAB two-component system. Cell Growth–BW25113 was grown aerobically to mid-log (A600 = 0.4-0.5) from an initial A600 of 0.05 at 37 °C in MOPS, 0.2% glucose, as described in Ref. 24Wanner B.L. Adolph K.W.

Diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DeaNO, Cayman Chemical) solutions were made on the day of use with cold Tris/saline buffer, pH > 10.5. Cell Harvesting, RNA Purification, and Microarray–Half of the cell culture was withdrawn for RNA purification as the reference time point; the remainder was harvested 5 min after treatment. Harvesting, RNA purification, array design, hybridization with the Qiagen Array-Ready Oligo Set, and image and data analysis were performed as previously described (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The MIAME-compliant data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus data base (GSE8540) and gene expression ratios are given insupplemental Table S1. Network Component Analysis–NCA is an algorithm that deduces system structure from sparsely connected networks, such as transcriptional regulatory networks (27Liao J.C. Boscolo R. Yang Y.L. Tran L.M. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Tran L.M. Brynildsen M.P. Kao K.C. Suen J.K. Liao J.C. Metab. Eng. 2005; 7: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other bipartite network analysis methods have been applied to biological data, such as a probabilistic state-space model (29Sanguinetti G. Lawrence N.D. Rattray M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and an integration of expression and TF binding data (30Gao F. Foat B.C. Bussemaker H.J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). An advantage of NCA is that it can identify changes in transcription factor activity (TFA) when only a subset of a regulon is perturbed; this feature is useful in deconvoluting the output of combinatorial regulation, however, caution should be taken when only a small number of perturbations are considered. NCA decomposed significant gene expression perturbations into TFA ratios and control strengths. The expression and connectivity matrices are provided as supplemental Tables S2 and S3. To determine whether a TF was perturbed in a given experiment, we built null distributions of TFAs and then performed Z tests on individual data points of every TFA. The threshold p value for significant perturbation was 0.01. The null TFA distributions were constructed by: 1) randomly selecting N genes from the genome, where N is the size of the original network; 2) NCA decomposition of the expression data to obtain TFAs of the random network; and 3) repeating steps 1 and 2 100 times. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the relative response between two significantly perturbed TFAs, which were identified by the above statistical test, and also determine whether the variation in TFA was statistically significant. Because the statistical test described above assumed that the null TFA distribution of each individual data point was normal, the corresponding null distribution of the TFA discrepancy between two data points was also normal. For example, if the TFAi,t1 and TFAi,t2 of TF i in experiments t1 and t2 have null distributions of N(μ1,σ1) and N(μ1,σ2), respectively, the null distribution of TFAi,t1 - TFAi,t2 is N(μ2-μ1,σ22+σ21). Therefore, we performed Z tests on the discrepancies between two perturbed TFAs in specific experimental sets, TFAi,t1 - TFAi,t2, based on the new derived null distributions. The variation in TFAs was significant if its p value was less than 0.01. Real-time RT-PCR–Real-time PCR was performed in a Cepheid SmartCycler with QuantiTect RT-PCR SYBR mixture (Qiagen), as previously described (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transcript abundance was normalized relative to chaA, which is not perturbed in any of the related microarray data. The RT-PCR primers are listed insupplemental Table S4. Gene Deletion–Deletion mutants were generated using the method described by Datsenko and Wanner (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). Deletions that could potentially disrupt expression of co-transcribed genes were designed to be non-polar. NO Concentration Measurements–Extracellular NO concentration was measured using a microchip NO electrode (ISO-NOPMC; World Precision Instruments). Experiments were performed aerobically at 37 °C in a total volume of 10 ml. GSNO Reactivity Assays–Metabolites and GSNO, both 500 μm, were incubated in MOPS/glucose medium at 37 °C in the dark in a total volume of 1 ml. GSNO concentration was monitored by measuring A335. GSNO and NO Inhibit Growth through Distinct Mechanisms–GSNO and NO both transiently inhibit E. coli growth, and E. coli has an adaptive response to both compounds: after adaptation to an initial dose, a second dose does not impact growth (Fig. 1, A and B (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). However, whereas adaptation to GSNO (Fig. 1A) or the nitrosating agent sodium nitroprusside (32Stevanin T.M. Ioannidis N. Mills C.E. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35868-35875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) increased resistance to NO, adaptation to NO did not increase GSNO growth resistance (Fig. 1B). This indicates that whereas the GSNO response network includes NO-defensive elements, the NO response network does not include GSNO-defensive elements and therefore GSNO and NO have distinct modes of causing growth inhibition. In biological conditions, GSNO can release NO (8Stamler J.S. Coron. Artery Dis. 1999; 10: 273-276Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18596-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 10Dicks A.P. Swift H.R. Williams D.L.H. Butler A.R. AlSadoni H.H. Cox B.G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1996; 2: 481-487Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but the amount of NO released from 500 μm GSNO was much lower than that from 5 μm DeaNO (Fig. 1C). The amount of NO released from 5 μm DeaNO is insufficient for growth inhibition in our condition (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and therefore, the amount of NO released from 500 μm GSNO is insufficient to account for the observed growth inhibition. Whereas NO is a small uncharged molecule that can freely cross membranes, GSNO is a larger charged molecule that requires transport. In Salmonella typhimurium GSNO is internalized via the Dpp transporter system (12Degroote M.A. Granger D. Xu Y.S. Campbell G. Prince R. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6399-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To verify that growth inhibition by GSNO required GSNO internalization, as opposed to extracellular evolution of NO, we verified that a ΔdppABCDF E. coli has increased resistance to GSNO (data not shown). Whereas concentrations of up to 1000 μm GSNO did not inhibit growth of the Δdpp mutant, the NO sensitivity of this strain was similar to the WT (data not shown). These results provide further evidence for distinct NO and GSNO inhibitory mechanisms. NCA Identifies Potential Regulators of the GSNO Response–To identify GSNO-sensitive TFs, we performed NCA on transcriptome data of the GSNO response, as measured 5 min after addition of 100 or 500 μm GSNO (supplemental Table S1). To verify that NCA attributed transcriptional perturbations to the appropriate regulator and that the regulators contribute to mediation of the transcriptional response, we repeated the 500 μm GSNO exposure, transcriptomic analysis, and NCA for individual TF deletion mutants. Additionally, previously reported transcriptome data from treatment with 100 μm GSNO in rich medium batch cultures (15Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and 200 μm GSNO in minimal medium chemostat cultures (16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10065-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were subjected to NCA to assess the effect of growth conditions on the GSNO response. NCA is a mathematical approach that employs biologically relevant constraints to identify perturbed regulators in transcriptome data by accounting for regulator activity and separating the effects of multiple regulators (27Liao J.C. Boscolo R. Yang Y.L. Tran L.M. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Tran L.M. Brynildsen M.P. Kao K.C. Suen J.K. Liao J.C. Metab. Eng. 2005; 7: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Many TFs have both an active and an inactive state, where only the active state is able to affect transcript abundance. TFA is often dictated by properties that are not reflected in expression of the gene encoding the TF, such as oxidation state or phosphorylation. NCA accounts for both TFA and overlapping regulatory elements to identify regulators with significantly altered TFA relative to a random network (33Galbraith S.J. Tran L.M. Liao J.C. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1886-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The initial connectivity data used in NCA comes from existing data bases (34Salgado H. Gama-Castro S. Martinez-Antonio A. Diaz-Peredo E. Sanchez-Solano F. Peralta-Gil M. Garcia-Alonso D. Jimenez-Jacinto V. Santos-Zavaleta A. Bonavides-Martinez C. Collado-Vides J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D334-D337Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Additionally we have included a virtual “stringent factor” (SF) TF, which includes both the direct and indirect effects of the stringent response; the stringent factor regulon was defined by analyzing the transcriptomic response to serine starvation (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although MetR has been reported to regulate hmpA (22Membrillo-Hernandez J. Coopamah M.D. Channa A. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), RT-PCR showed that hmpA abundance in a ΔmetR mutant was equivalent to the WT both before and 5 min after treatment with 500 μm GSNO (Fig. 2A). Because this indicates that MetR is not an important regulator of hmpA expression in our condition, there is no connection between MetR and hmpA in the initial NCA connectivity. NCA identified CysB, MetJ, MetR, NsrR, SF, FlhDC, and the tryptophan transcriptional attenuator (“TTA”) as significantly perturbed in response to 100 μm GSNO relative to a control sample treated only with GSNO storage buffer (Fig. 3, p < 0.01); each of these regulators is discussed in more detail below. CysB, SF, FlhDC, and TTA have not been previously recognized as mediators of the GSNO response. A total of 74 TFs were analyzed; all TFs that are significantly perturbed in response to 100 μm GSNO are shown in Fig. 3. The full NCA subnetwork, expression data, and connectivity are given in the supplementary materials. Interestingly, the TFA of known RNS-responsive NorR was not perturbed in our transcriptome data. NorR activates transcription of flavorubredoxin norV and the co-transcribed oxidoreductase norW in response to NO (20D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but norV and norW were both unperturbed in our 100 and 500 μm GSNO response microarray data (supplemental Table S1). Previous transcriptome studies have shown increased abundance of norV in response to GSNO (15Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10065-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or increased activity of a norVp-lacZ fusion in response to nitrosative sodium nitroprusside (36Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Gardner A.M. Gessner C.R. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10081-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To further investigate our results, we measured the transcript abundance of two regions of norV by RT-PCR. The two regions flank the microarray probe and are separated by ∼600 bp (Fig. 2B). Expression of the region near the transcriptional start increased nearly 10-fold in response to 500 μm GSNO but the region downstream from the microarray probe was unperturbed, consistent with the microarray measurement. Contrastingly, the two regions were both increased ∼100-fold in the NO response (Fig. 2B). Other researchers have reported unexpected trends in norV expression: primer extension assays based near the transcriptional start demonstrated oscillatory expression patterns (15Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and comparison of protein and transcript abundance in the NO response was inconsistent (38da Costa P.N. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 218: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Investigation of the GSNO response during chemostat growth in minimal medium showed that whereas norV expression was increased in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, norW expression was increased only during anaerobic, and not aerobic, growth (16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10065-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that there may be as yet unidentified elements contributing to the regulation of norVW. NCA of deletion mutants verified CysB, MetJ, NsrR, and FlhDC as regulators responding to GSNO; the GSNO-induced change in TFA ratios became insignificant for the deletion mutants relative to the control experiment and were significantly different from the GSNO-treated WT (Fig. 3, p < 0.01). ΔmetR mutants require Met supplementation, but MetR TFA was not perturbed by GSNO in the Met-supplemented WT (Fig. 3). Thus, we were unable to separate the effects of Met supplementation and metR deletion and participation of MetR in the GSNO response was not confirmed. Interestingly, Met supplementation drastically reduced the impact of GSNO on the transcriptional network of E. coli (Fig. 3), consistent with the report that Met supplementation provides growth protection from GSNO (16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10065-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The GSNO transport-deficient Δdpp strain allowed us to confirm that most of the regulatory perturbations require GSNO internalization. Fewer than 10% of the transcriptional perturbations caused by 100 μm GSNO in the WT were observed in the Δdpp strain (supplemental Table S1) and perturbation of CysB, MetR, and the SF TFA was significantly reduced relative to the WT (Fig. 3, p < 0.01). Contrastingly, perturbation of NsrR was comparable in the WT and Δdpp mutant (Fig. 3). This indicates that CysB, MetR, and SF, and possibly MetJ, FlhDC, and TTA, require GSNO internalization for TFA perturbation but NsrR does not. Because 100 μm GSNO delivers submicromolar levels of NO, this result illustrates the exquisite sensitivity of NsrR and suggests that GSNO perturbs the other TFs through transnitrosation or S-thiolation. GSNO Induces the Stringent Response by Targeting Hcy and Cys–The stringent response is mediated by ppGpp(p) in response to stress conditions that require resource conservation (39Magnusson L.U. Farewell A. Nystrom T. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 236-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), such as amino acid depletion. We have previously shown that by damaging the Fe-S cluster of BCAA biosynthesis enzyme IlvD, NO causes BCAA starvation and induces the stringent response. Accordingly, derepression of the Fe-S repair system by deletion of the iscR TF increased the growth resistance to NO (21Hyduke D.R. Jarboe L.R. Tran L.M. Chou K.J. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8484-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, neither BCAA supplementation nor derepression"
https://openalex.org/W2046477264,"Hypoxia inhibits Na-K-ATPase activity and leads to its degradation in mammalian cells. Von Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) are key mediators in cellular adaptation to hypoxia; thus, we set out to investigate whether pVHL and HIF participate in the hypoxia-mediated degradation of plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase. We found that in the presence of pVHL hypoxia decreased Na-K-ATPase activity and promoted the degradation of plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase. In pVHL-deficient cells, hypoxia did not decrease the Na-K-ATPase activity and the degradation of plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase was prevented. pVHL-mediated degradation of Na-K-ATPase required the functional pVHL E3 ligase and Ubc5 since pVHL mutants and dominant-negative Ubc5 prevented Na-K-ATPase from degradation. The generation of reactive oxygen species was necessary for pVHL-mediated Na-K-ATPase degradation during hypoxia. Desferrioxamine, which stabilizes HIF1/2alpha, did not affect the half-life of plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase. In addition, stabilizing HIF1/2alpha by infecting mammalian cells with adenoviruses containing the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF1alpha did not affect the plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase degradation. In cells with suppression of pVHL by short hairpin RNA, the Na-K-ATPase was not degraded during hypoxia, whereas cells with knockdown of HIF1/2alpha retained the ability to degrade plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase. These findings suggest that pVHL participates in the hypoxia-mediated degradation of plasma membrane Na-K-ATPase in a HIF-independent manner."

For many years attention has focused on intracellular glucose sensing derived from glucose metabolism. Here, we studied the detection of extracellular glucose concentrations in vivo by invalidating the transduction pathway downstream from the transporter-detector GLUT2 and measured the physiological impact of this pathway.We produced mice that ubiquitously express the largest cytoplasmic loop of GLUT2, blocking glucose-mediated gene expression in vitro without affecting glucose metabolism. Impairment of GLUT2-mediated sugar detection transiently protected transgenic mice against starvation and streptozotocin-induced diabetes, suggesting that both low- and high-glucose concentrations were not detected. Transgenic mice favored lipid oxidation, and oral glucose was slowly cleared from blood due to low insulin production, despite massive urinary glucose excretion. Kidney adaptation was characterized by a lower rate of glucose reabsorption, whereas pancreatic adaptation was associated with a larger number of small islets.Molecular invalidation of sugar sensing in GLUT2-loop transgenic mice changed multiple aspects of glucose homeostasis, highlighting by a top-down approach, the role of membrane glucose receptors as potential therapeutic targets."

Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but unfortunately, amantadine does not inhibit the BM2 channel activity (5Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of the A/M2 channel had been investigated by several approaches. First, A/M2 was shown to form homo-oligomers, most likely homotetramers, by cross-linking and sedimentation experiments (12Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Panayotov P.P. Schlesinger R.W. Virology. 1992; 186: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the oligomeric structure of A/M2 channels is stabilized by disulfide bonds (14Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Finally, by functional analysis of mixed oligomers of known composition, the active oligomeric form of A/M2 protein was shown to be a tetramer (15Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Most recently the atomic structure of the A/M2 transmembrane region shows it forms a four-helix bundle (16Stouffer, A. L., Acharya, R., Salom, D., Levine A. S., Di Costanzo, L., Soto, C. S., Tereshko, V., Nanda, V., Stayrook, S., and DeGrado, W. F. (2007) Nature in pressGoogle Scholar). Little is known about BM2 structural and functional properties. The only available evidence for the stoichiometry of the BM2 channel comes from chemical cross-linking data that indicates BM2 can be chemically cross-linked to dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher order complexes, data interpreted to suggest that the most likely oligomeric state of the channel is a homotetramer (5Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike for A/M2, where disulfide bonds in the ectodomain stabilize the homotetramer (14Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) BM2 does not contain cysteines in its ectodomain. Thus, the lack of a BM2 disulfide bond raises the possibility that the BM2 channel assembly differs from that of A/M2 (5Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As knowledge of the active oligomeric state of a channel is an essential first step in understanding the mechanism of action of a channel, we determined the stoichiometry of the influenza B virus proton channel by utilizing three different approaches. In addition, we have demonstrated that A/M2 and BM2 proteins do not form heteromeric channels, when coexpressed and that the BM2 transmembrane domain is responsible for the oligomerization process. Molecular Biology, in Vitro cRNA Transcription, and Transient Expression of Plasmids in HEK293-cultured Cells–The cDNAs encoding influenza virus A/Udorn/72 A/M2 protein, the B/Lee/40 BM2 protein and chimeric cDNAs were inserted into pGEMHJ (a gift from N. Dascal, Tel-Aviv University, Israel) for the expression in Xenopus oocytes, or the cDNAs were inserted into the pCAGGS (17Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) for expression in HEK293 cells. Generation of the BM2(H19C) construct was described previously (4Mould J.A. Paterson R.G.

The epitope tags FLAG (DYKDDDDK), HA (YPYDVPDY), and Myc (EQKLISEEDL) were inserted in-frame at the N terminus after the first methionine residue or at the C terminus after the last amino acid of BM2 using the PCR extension method. The tagged subunits were indistinguishable from the respective wild-type subunits based on ion channel activity measured in oocytes. Chimeras between A/M2 and BM2 were generated using the PCR overlap extension method. For the generation of BM2-CFP and BM2-YFP constructs the DNA fragments encoding cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) 3The abbreviations used are: CFPcyan fluorescent proteinDTSSPdithiobis-[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate]DSTdisuccinimidyl tartrateBS3bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberateHAhemagglutininMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferROIregion of interestYFPyellow fluorescent protein. and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were prepared from pCFP-C1 and pYFP-C1 plasmids (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by standard PCR, the amplified fragments were linked to the C terminus of BM2 with the helical linker LAEAAAKEAAAKAAA (18Arai R.

Cloning details are available upon request. The regions amplified by PCR were verified by double-strand DNA sequencing. In all cases numbering of amino acids starts from the first methionine residue of the open reading frame. For expression in oocytes, plasmids were linearized with HindIII, and capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Austin, TX). The quality of transcripts was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and analytical UV spectroscopy. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown on 35-mm or 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were done on 30–50% confluent cultures using TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corporation, Madison, WI) with 3 μg/dish total plasmid cDNA. cyan fluorescent protein dithiobis-[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] disuccinimidyl tartrate bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate hemagglutinin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid fluorescence resonance energy transfer region of interest yellow fluorescent protein. Heterologous Expression and Electrophysiological Recordings–Stage V–VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared as described previously (19Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1335-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 5–10 ng of cRNA in 50 nl/oocyte, and assayed 2–3 days later. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out using TEV-200 (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) connected to DIGIDATA 1440A and pCLAMP10 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Oocytes were superfused with Barth's solution containing (in mm) 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 NaNO3, 0.71 CaCl2, 0.82 MgCl2, and 15 HEPES for pH 8.5 or 15 MES for pH 5.5. Currents were recorded at -20 mV. Amantadine (100 μm) (Sigma) was applied to inhibit A/M2 induced currents. Chemical Cross-linking, Coprecipitation Assays, and Western Blot Analysis–For chemical cross-linking HEK293 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection, removed from the culture dish by scraping with a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation, and homogenized in ice-cold solubilization buffer containing (in mm) 20 HEPES pH 8.0, 150 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Soluble fractions were incubated with appropriate working concentration of either 3,3′-dithiobis-[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP, diluted from a 25 mm stock in water), or disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST, diluted from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO), or bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3, diluted from a 10 mm stock in water). All the cross-linkers were obtained from Pierce. The reactions were quenched by 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5 for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-linked samples were examined by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels under non-reducing conditions and Western blot analysis was performed. For coimmunoprecipitation assays oocytes were homogenized in ice-cold solubilization buffer (15 μl/oocyte) containing (in mm) 50 Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture. Homogenates were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The soluble fraction was collected and incubated with 4 μg/ml of anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4 °C, loaded on prewashed Protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with shaking. Samples were washed twice with ice-cold solubilization buffer and bound proteins were released by 5 min of boiling with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, collected after centrifugation, and loaded on a 17% SDS-PAGE gel. Western blot analysis was performed and precipitated proteins were detected with appropriate antibodies. All other protein samples from HEK293 cells or oocytes which were subject to Western blot analysis were homogenized in the appropriate solubilization buffers described above. Primary antibodies and their respective working dilutions were: 14C2 (anti-A/M2) monoclonal antibody 1:1000 (20Zebedee S.L. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2762-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-BM2 polyclonal antibody 1:600 (21Horvath C.M. Williams M.A. Lamb R.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2639-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody 1:2000 (Sigma), anti-Myc polyclonal antibody 1:1000 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used at 1:20,000 dilution. Blots were visualized using a Storm 860 BioImager (Molecular Dynamics, Buckinghamshire, UK) and quantified using ImageJ software. Imaging Techniques, FRET Efficiency Measurements, and Distance Calculation–For FRET experiments HEK293 cells were cultured on coverslips in 35 mm dishes and co-transfected with BM2-CFP- and FLAG-BM2-YFP-expressing plasmids as described above. 24 h after transfection cells were fixed and mounted on slides as described previously (28Kerschensteiner D. Soto F. Stocker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A Zeiss LSM510 META ConfoCor3 system with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective was used for image acquisition. Images were collected at 8 bit resolution over 512 × 512 pixels at a pixel dwell time of 12.8 μs. The argon laser line of 458-nm was used to excite CFP and the line of 514-nm to excite and bleach YFP. To minimize the impact of bleaching due to imaging, the images were taken with both laser lines at 0.15% of full laser power. To prevent cross-talk images were obtained in a configuration described previously (28Kerschensteiner D. Soto F. Stocker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). FRET was measured by acceptor photobleaching method (donor dequenching), where an increase in CFP fluorescence during an incremental photobleaching of YFP was observed. Total YFP bleaching was achieved by repetitive (3 × 20 iterations) scanning of a region of interest (ROI) using the 514-nm laser line at 100% intensity. Background contamination of both fluorophores was quantified from the cell-free area and subtracted from the overall intensity. The overall intensity was measured from the ROI at the outer perimeter of the cell in order to restrict the analysis to the assembled channels at the plasma membrane. Mean fluorescent intensities were measured using FRET Plus (Version 4.0.6, Zeiss) software. FRET efficiencies (E) were calculated from the ratio of the normalized donor (CFP) fluorescence intensity before (IDA) and after (ID) the photobleaching of acceptor (YFP) in Equation 1. E=1-(IDA/ID)(Eq. 1) Computation of the FRET Efficiency for Dimeric Channels–Based on Equation 1, the FRET efficiency for channels consisting of two subunits can be presented as Equation 2, E=1-I(donor-donor)+(I(donor-acceptor)-Itransferred)I(donor-donor)+I(donor-acceptor)(Eq. 2) where I(donor-donor) is the fluorescence intensity of the population of donors that form donor-donor dimeric complexes; I(donor-acceptor) is the fluorescence intensity of the population of donors that form donor-acceptor dimeric complexes and Itransferred is the fluorescent intensity transferred from donors to acceptors in the donor-acceptor complexes. Because I(donor-donor) and I(donor-acceptor) are defined as intensities of the populations of donors, they can be presented as Equations 3 and 4, I(donor-donor)=p2*k(Eq. 3) I(donor-acceptor)=2p(1-p)*k(Eq. 4) where p2 is a probability of the formation of dimers consisting of two donor subunits, and 2p(1-p) is a probability of the formation of dimers consisting of one donor and one acceptor subunit. Those probabilities can be obtained from the binomial distribution models for each donor-acceptor ratio expressed in the cell. k is defined as the emission intensity of a single donor molecule. Then Itransferred can be defined as Equation 5, Itransferred=2p(1-p)*x(Eq. 5) where x stands for the amount of energy transferred from the donor to the acceptor in a single donor-acceptor pair. Thus, based on Equation 2, the FRET efficiency can be presented as Equation 6, E=1-pk+2k(1-p)-2x(1-p)pk+2k(1-p)(Eq. 6) according to Equation 6. The FRET efficiencies (E) were experimentally calculated using Equation 1 for each donor-acceptor coexpressed ratio. If BM2 channel protein consists of two subunits, according to Equation 71E=p22p(1-p)*kx+kx(Eq. 7) the relationship between 1/E and the ratio between the probabilities of donors to form homomeric dimers to the probabilities of donors to form heteromeric dimers (p2/2p(1 - p)) will be linear for the coexpressed donor-acceptor ratios. Intersubunit Distance Calculations–FRET efficiencies from the experiment shown in Fig. 4B were used to estimate the distances between the adjacent and diagonally opposite subunits. The FRET efficiency measured for the protein ratio of 1 BM2-CFP and 9 FLAG-BM2-YFP was assumed to represent the FRET efficiency of one donor and three acceptor channel configuration. Consider a single donor molecule in the presence of a number (k) of acceptors, located at distances r1,...rk from the donor, according to the Förster model in Equation 8, E=1-1+kΣi=1(R0/ri)6-1(Eq. 8) where R0 is a Förster distance, a physical constant that determines a distance corresponding to the 50% FRET efficiency for the specific donor-acceptor pair. For the CFP/YFP pair R0 was found to be 4.92 nm, assuming a relative dipole orientation factor k2 of 2/3 (22Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The k2 range was not estimated experimentally because we were not interested in the measurements of absolute distances between the fluorophores, but rather to support our interpretations concerning the BM2 channel geometry. Thus the total FRET efficiency for tetramers consisting of one donor and three acceptor subunits is given by Equation 9, E=1-{1+2(R0/Radj)6+(R0/Rdiag)6}-1(Eq. 9) where Radj and Rdiag are distances within adjacent and diagonally opposite donor-acceptor pairs. If we assume that for this channel configuration energy transfer form the donor to the diagonally opposite acceptor is negligible, Radj can be calculated according to Equation 10. Radj=R02(E-1-1)6(Eq. 10) The value of Radj can be used to calculate the FRET efficiency between the adjacent subunits in Equation 11. Eadj=1/(1+(Radj/R0))(Eq. 11) If we assume that FRET efficiency measured from cells expressing 9 BM2-CFP to 1 FLAG-BM2-YFP protein ratio is mainly contributed by channels with three donors and one acceptor subunit configuration, the total efficiency for this configuration can be presented as Equation 12. E=23Eadj+13Ediag(Eq. 12) Then the distance between the diagonally opposite subunits is given by Equation 13. Rdiag=R0(3E-2Eadj)-1-16(Eq. 13) The relation between Radj and Rdiag was compared with that expected for a quadratic arrangement of subunits by using the Pythagorean theorem in Equation 14. RdiagRadj=2(Eq. 14) BM2 Can Be Chemically Cross-Linked to the Tetrameric State–Unlike the A/M2 protein, the BM2 protein migrates on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel as a monomer of ∼15 kDa (5Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As no stable BM2 oligomers are detected under non-reducing conditions, chemical cross-linking of BM2 monomers can be indicative of the oligomeric state of the channel. We examined the cross-linking characteristics of BM2 monomers using three homobifunctional amino-reactive cross-linkers with different spacer arm lengths. BM2 protein was modified such that it contained the FLAG epitope tag at its C terminus (BM2-FLAG). HEK293 cells transiently expressing BM2-FLAG protein were homogenized and treated with various concentrations of a cross-linker, separated on non-reducing 12% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Treatment of BM2-FLAG homogenates either with disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST), or with bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3) (spacer arms of 6.4 Å and of 11.4 Å, respectively) did not result in the formation of BM2 protein complexes (data not shown). However, when protein samples were treated with 0.25–5 mm of DTSSP (spacer arm of 12 Å) protein complexes consistent with molecular masses of BM2 dimers, trimers, and tetramers were observed (Fig. 1). Treatment with increasing concentrations of DTSSP resulted in the graded attenuation of the intensity of the bands, which correspond to dimers along with the concomitant graded increase in the intensity of the bands which correspond to trimers and tetramers. Some less well resolved higher molecular mass complexes were detected on the blot. As the majority of these latter species disappeared upon protein dilution (data not shown) we suggest that these complexes can result from a nonspecific intramolecular cross-linking of proteins. Graded formation of tetrameric protein complexes as a function of increasing cross-linker concentrations suggests that the BM2 channel oligomeric state is a tetramer. Although this finding is consistent with our knowledge about the A/M2 oligomeric state (15Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and confirms suggestions regarding the BM2 oligomeric state made by Paterson et al. (5Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the data do not prove that BM2 channels function as tetramers. BM2 Wild Type and BM2(H19C) Non-functional Subunits Form Tetramers in Which Two Non-functional Subunits Are Sufficient to Eliminate the Channel Activity–To investigate further the oligomeric state of the functional BM2 channel we used the mixed oligomer strategy (23MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). BM2 channels allow proton flow upon the acidification of the extracellular medium (4Mould J.A. Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Venkataraman P. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Substitution of the pore lining residue His-19 with Cys (BM2(H19C)) results in the formation of non-functional channels (4Mould J.A. Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Venkataraman P. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We expressed BM2 wild-type proteins and BM2(H19C) proteins in Xenopus oocytes and measured the activity of the coexpressed channels by two electrode voltage clamp. Both constructs were tagged with a C-terminal FLAG (F) epitope for immunodetection and the wild-type BM2 construct was also tagged with the N-terminal HA (H) epitope tag (H-BM2-F and BM2(19C)-F, respectively). The channel activity of H-BM2-F construct was indistinguishable from that of the non-tagged BM2 (Fig. 2A, left), whereas BM2(H19C)-F mutant homomeric channels did not conduct current (Fig. 2A, right). The surface expression of both homomeric channels was found to be similar (Fig. 2B). Previous studies have shown that the subunit stoichiometry of some membrane complexes can be determined by combined measurements of protein function and surface expression for mixed oligomers, consisting of subunits with different phenotypes (15Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This approach requires that there is a dominance of one subunit phenotype, while it is assumed that both subunits are equally and independently expressed and assemble stochastically (23MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). To apply this approach to BM2 channels, we examined the ability of H-BM2-F and BM2(H19C) subunits to form mixed oligomers by coexpression in Xenopus oocytes, followed by current measurements and surface expression quantification. The ratio of coexpressed subunits was monitored by the different gel mobilities of H-BM2-F and BM2(H19C)-F subunits (Fig. 2B). If the H-BM2-F and BM2 (H19C)-F subunits co-assemble randomly, the influence of the non-functional BM2(H19C)-F subunit on the heteromeric channel activity will follow a binomial distribution (W(n) = Σpn(1 - p)n-1). Fig. 2C (upper part) demonstrates possible permutations of subunit assembly for tetrameric BM2 channels (models a–f). If we assume that each channel expresses either the wild-type or the mutant phenotype (no intermediate phenotypes), then the assembly models can be used to predict the total fraction of channels that express either the mutant or the wild-type phenotype. Fig. 2C (lower part) shows a series of Activity Models (1Lamb R.A. Zebedee S.L. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Lamb R.A.

Cell. 2003; 5: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), each of which assigns the mutant phenotype to a different subset of the six possible subunit configurations. Model 1 assumes that the inclusion of one or more BM2(H19C)-F non-functional subunits is sufficient to convert the phenotype of the assembled channels from fully conducting to non-conducting. In Model 2 two or more non-functional subunits are sufficient to convert the phenotype. Models 2A and 2B address the case in which two non-functional subunits influence the heteromeric channel activity as a function of their relative location in the tetramer. Model 3 assumes that a minimum of three BM2(H19C)-F subunits are required to convert the phenotype, whereas according to the Model 4 only when all four subunits are mutant, the channel fails to conduct current. We recorded currents from oocytes expressing H-BM2-F and BM2(H19C)-F subunits in various ratios. In Fig. 2D the amplitudes of the currents were normalized to the activity of homomeric H-BM2-F channels and plotted against the fraction of H-BM2-F subunits measured from the relative band intensities (Fig. 2B). The experimental data were compared with the predicted Activity Models (Fig. 2D gray curves) and the coexpression results were best described by Model 2 (Fig. 2D). This finding indicates that if the active oligomeric state of BM2 channel is a tetramer, two or more non-functional subun"
https://openalex.org/W2042750109,"The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cancer remains controversial. Using cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), the present study investigates the involvement of COX-2 in apoptosis elicited by the chemotherapeutics paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Each compound led to a profound induction of COX-2 expression and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, accompanied by a substantial decrease of viability and enhanced apoptosis. Cells were significantly less sensitive to apoptotic death when either COX-2 expression or its activity was suppressed by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, respectively. Experiments performed to clarify how COX-2 leads to apoptosis revealed a profound proapoptotic action of PGD2 and its dehydration product, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2). In line with these findings, chemotherapeutics-induced apoptosis was prevented by siRNA targeting lipocalin-type PGD synthase (L-PGDS), which catalyses the isomerization of PGH2 to PGD2. Moreover, apoptosis by chemotherapeutics, PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 was suppressed by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) antagonist, GW-9662 or PPARγ siRNA. Finally, a COX-2-dependent apoptotic mechanism of all investigated chemotherapeutics was confirmed in human lung cancer cells (A549) as well as in another cervical carcinoma cell line (C33A). Collectively, this study suggests COX-2 induction and synthesis of L-PGDS-derived, PPARγ-activating PGs as a decisive target by which several chemotherapeutics induce apoptosis. COX-2 is therefore suspected to sensitize cancer cells to apoptotic death under certain circumstances, suggesting that COX-2 inhibition during cancer therapy could diminish its efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1989428172,"Neuroblastic tumours are composed of variable proportions of neuroblasts and Schwann cells. Whether both components share a common neoplastic origin is highly debated and discrepant results have been reported about the presence of tumour-related genetic alterations in Schwann cells. We have used X-methylation analysis and array-CGH to investigate contiguous Schwannian and neuroblastic areas in tumours with a nodular pattern. A skewed X inactivation was observed in four out of five stromal components. Interestingly, in these four cases, the X-inactivation profiles of the neuroblastic components were identical to the matched stromal areas. However, whereas all neuroblastic areas displayed chromosomal imbalances, no alteration was found in any Schwann cell components. Similarly, no alteration was observed in a series of 19 tumours with a single stroma-rich component, which occasionally exhibited a skewed X-inactivation pattern (3/17 informative tumours). Altogether, this indicates that most stroma-rich tumours display a polyclonal proliferation and that Schwann cells do not derive from neuroblasts.

Products of the four mammalian MEF2 genes, MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D, are expressed with overlapping but distinct temporospatial patterns. Toward analysis of MEF2A functions and the determinants of its regulated expression, we have mapped and begun studies of the transcriptional control regions of this gene. Heterogeneous 5′-untranslated regions of MEF2A mRNAs result from use of alternative promoters and splicing patterns. The two closely approximated TATA-less promoters are ∼65 kb upstream of the exon containing the sole initiation codon. Ribonuclease protection and primer extension assays show that each promoter is active in various adult tissues. A canonical MEF2 site overlies the major promoter 1 transcription start site. This element specifically binds MEF2 factors, including endogenous nuclear MEF2A according to chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, and is critical to MEF2A transcription in myocytes. The site exerts reciprocal control of the alternative promoters, silencing promoter 1 and activating promoter 2 under some conditions. Erk5 and p38 MAPK signaling stimulate MEF2A expression by activating both promoters from the MEF2 element. MEF2A transcription is therefore subject to positive or negative regulation by its protein products, depending on signaling activities that influence MEF2 factor trans-activity. The sole MEF2 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus has a similar regulatory region structure, suggesting that this mode of autoregulatory control is conserved among higher metazoan MEF2 genes.

Other metazoans, from Porifera to Chordata, also have MEF2 genes. All MEF2 proteins have an N-terminal MADS box and an adjacent MEF2-specific signature domain that function together to specify MEF2 dimerization and sequence-specific dimer binding to CTA(T/A)4TAR (or YTA(T/A)4TAG) sequences in the regulatory regions of target genes (1Nurrish S.J.

It is now apparent that these factors play many roles in various tissues and cell types, both during development and after terminal differentiation.

Some MEF2 factors are expressed in immune cells where they control T cell selection and activation and cytokine expression (19Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O.

The vertebrate MEF2 gene products are differentially expressed spatially and temporally within tissues and tissue regions (21Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Subramanian S.V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse embryo, mef2a mRNA expression appears first in the myocardium at day 8.5 post-coitum, 1 day after mef2c mRNA first appears in mesodermal precursors of this tissue (21Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myocardial mef2a expression is maintained thereafter throughout development and after terminal differentiation. mef2a expression also lags slightly behind mef2c in the myotome, appearing first at day 9.5 post-coitum and within all muscle-forming regions of the embryo thereafter (21Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression is also maintained in differentiated skeletal and smooth muscle cells. The order of MEF2 isotype gene expression in the embryo differs from that seen in differentiating cultured myoblasts (4Zhu B. Ramachandran B. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28749-28760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Breitbart R.E. Liang C.S. Smoot L.B. Laheru D.A. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, mef2d is an early marker, followed by mef2a after lineage commitment and mef2c late in differentiation. In the developing and adult brain, mef2a is widely expressed but is most abundant in the thalamus (23Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms controlling temporospatial MEF2A gene expression patterns are not known. mef2a null mice survive to birth, but a large proportion die during the immediate postnatal period (25Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These animals show right ventricular enlargement and reduced density and disorganization of myocardial mitochondria. The fraction of mutant mice that do survive to adulthood also have mitochondrial defects. Because a MEF2-responsive reporter gene was highly active in the myocardium of the mef2a–/– mice, and targeted disruption of mef2c does not give mitochondrial defects, MEF2A may serve a unique role among the MEF2 isotypes in mitochondrial biogenesis. The distinct phenotypes of mef2a–/– and mef2c–/– mice indicate that there are nonredundant functions of the MEF2 isotypes. Some are likely to be due to differential expression. In contrast to extensive work on MEF2/MEF2 regulation at levels of modifications in response to signaling (5Shalizi A.K. Bonni A. Curr. Top Dev.

As an initial step in the analysis of MEF2A transcriptional regulation, we report here the mapping and partial characterization of the highly conserved 5′-regulatory region of the mammalian MEF2A gene. RNA Analyses—Human tissue total RNA was purchased from Clontech and Ambion, and murine tissue and C2C12 cell RNA was isolated by conventional procedures (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Primer extension assays were performed as described (38Yu G.S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using primers hybridizing in human MEF2A exon A1 or exon A2. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends used human heart cDNA and reverse primers that hybridize in MEF2A exon 1 near the initiation codon. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) and radiolabeled cRNA probe syntheses were carried out as described (4Zhu B. Ramachandran B. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28749-28760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MEF2A cRNA templates had fragments specific to A1/C and A2/C exon junctions. Templates for invariant segments of murine mef2a, mef2c, and mef2d were generated using RT-PCR on heart RNA with gene-specific primers. The human MEF2A cRNA probe template was a sequence at the 3′ end of the coding region. Reporter Plasmid Construction—ptk-Luc was described (38Yu G.S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). [MEF2MEF2A]3tk-Luc has three copies of the human MEF2A MEF2 element inserted into ptk-Luc upstream of the HSV tk promoter. The human JUN promoter (39Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR on genomic DNA template, and the amplicon was substituted for the tk promoter fragment of ptk-Luc to give pJUN-Luc. A subcloned RPCI-11C-231N21 BAC clone fragment containing ∼3.6 kb spanning the MEF2A promoter region was identified by hybridization screening. PCR on this template gave promoter 1 and 2 fragment amplicons that were substituted for tk sequence into ptk-Luc to give [L]-, [I]-, and [S]-MEF2Ap1-Luc and [L]-, [I]-, and [S]-MEF2Ap2-Luc, respectively. p1-[m1MEF2]-Luc and p2-[m1MEF2]-Luc were made using PCR mutagenesis.

A C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) was appended to each using PCR to give pCDNA-MEF2(A/B/C/D)FLAG. MEF2A and MEF2D templates were FLAG-tagged constructs (gifts of J. Dilworth). Plasmids containing human MKK6 (40Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) were obtained using RT-PCR on human heart RNA. Amplicons were subcloned into pCDNA3.1 hygro (Invitrogen) to give pCDNA-CnA+, pCDNA-MEK5, and pCDNA-Erk5, respectively. pCDNA-MEK5DD (=MEK5S311D,T315D) and pCDNA-Erk5AF (=Erk5T219A,Y221F) (42Kato Y.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Procedures used were modified from the ChIP-IT kit using enzymatic DNA shearing (Active Motif). Methods are detailed in the supplemental material, as are human MEF2A and mouse mef2a genes and control primers. Results were taken only when validated with both positive and negative antibody and PCR controls. Processing of three independent cross-linked samples gave similar results. Mobility Shift Assays—The various MEF2 α2/β coding region fragments (4Zhu B. Ramachandran B. Gulick T. J. Biol.

In vitro transcription and translation reactions used these plasmid templates with the TnT system (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes as described (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Cultured Cell Transfection—C2C12 cells were maintained and differentiated as described (4Zhu B. Ramachandran B. Gulick T. J. Biol.

Cells were plated in 12-well plates to achieve 25% confluence for transfection using Superfect (Qiagen) the following day. Triplicate wells received 0.5–1.0 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.3 μg of control reporter, and 0.05–0.5 μg of expression vector(s). Wells received identical amounts of reporter and expression vector by using plasmids lacking inserts as necessary. Cells were harvested 16–48 h after transfection for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays. For experiments involving modulation of p38 MAPK or calcineurin activities, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum was used for the final 8–16 h before cell harvest. Luciferase readings were corrected for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity from pSV40βGal, or Renilla luciferase activity from pRL-tk or pRL-SV40 (Promega). SB203580 was used at 1 μm, and cyclosporin A at 100 nm. Amphioxus MEF2 cDNA and Gene Structure Determinations—GenBank™ expressed sequence tag partial cDNA sequences were compared with Joint Genome Institute amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae gene sequences to establish the intron/exon structure of the 5′ end of MEF2 (exons A → C and 1 → 4). Deduced MEF2 protein sequences of both Ciona intestinalis and Takifugu rubripes were then used as queries in TBLASTN to identify additional putative amphioxus MEF2 exons. Precise intron/exon boundaries were established by applying consensus splice site criteria (43Sharp P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 279-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The predicted mRNAs, including splicing variants, extending from the complete 5′-UTR through the termination codon were then established. Reagents and Miscellaneous Procedures—Plasmid segments derived from PCR were verified by dideoxy sequencing (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-MEF2 isotype-specific antibodies were generated using peptide antigens and conventional procedures (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (anti-MEF2, C-21), Upstate (anti-RNA polymerase II, 8WG16), and Sigma (anti-FLAG). PAGE-separated proteins were immunoblotted (IB) using chemiluminescence assays (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). p38 assays used GST-ATF-2 as a phosphorylation substrate (40Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) (Cell Signaling Technology). Calcineurin activity in cell extracts was measured by quantitating release of free phosphate from RII phosphopeptide using a Malachite Green colorimetric assay. SB203580 and cyclosporin A were from Calbiochem. Heterogeneous MEF2A 5′-Untranslated Regions Result from Alternative Splicing—We used 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, PCR, and data base cDNA sequence information to establish human MEF2A 5′-UTR sequences. Detected segments were compared with human chromosome 15q26 genomic sequence to complete the previously described partial MEF2A gene structure (44Suzuki E. Lowry J. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Six exons (A1, A2, and B–E) exist in the ∼65-kb expanse upstream of the sole MEF2A initiation codon located in exon 1 (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). Different 5′-UTRs result from various patterns of alternative splicing (Fig. 1C), with exon A1, C, and 1 sequence comprising the most common among them. The four MEF2 isotypes have highly similar gene structures and alternative splicing patterns among exons containing coding sequences (Fig. 1D) (4Zhu B. Ramachandran B. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28749-28760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This similarity does not extend to 5′-flanking regions, where the genes have different numbers and arrangements of alternative promoters, and different patterns of alternative splicing.6 Murine mef2a and other non-human mammalian MEF2A genes have structures that are similar to that of the human gene according to our in silico analyses. MEF2A cDNA data base entries from these species have 5′-UTR sequences consisting of exons A1, C, and 1 exclusively. However, sequences highly similar to human MEF2A exons A2, B, D, and E along with cognate splice sites are present at analogous locations in these other genes. It is therefore possible, if not likely, that murine mef2a and other mammalian MEF2A mRNAs have alternative 5′-UTRs that are comparable with those of human MEF2A. MEF2A Primary Transcripts Arise from Two Promoters—No human MEF2A cDNAs containing both A1 and A2 sequences were detected, and no obvious splice acceptor is present upstream of exon A2. We confirmed the implication that A1 and A2 are bona fide alternative first exons. RT-PCR with exon A1 forward and exon A2 reverse primers failed to produce an amplicon from various tissue RNA samples. We therefore designated the regions upstream of exons A1 and A2 as alternative promoters 1 (p1) and 2(p2), respectively. Primer extension and RPA were used to determine transcription start sites (TSS) and tissue distributions of MEF2A mRNA containing either exon A1 or A2. Using a primer hybridizing within exon A1, one major product predominated in all human tissue RNA samples examined (Fig. 2, A and B). The cognate TSS (TSS p1) corresponds to the 5′ end of several human expressed sequence tag clones, including some constructed using the “cap-trapper” strategy (45Sugahara Y. Carninci P. Itoh M. Shibata K. Konno H. Endo T. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two additional extension products were seen with brain and testis RNA, the shorter of which (TSS p1′) corresponds to the 5′ end of multiple brain and epithelial cell data base cDNAs. Identification of this product in selected tissues suggests that this represents a true alternative TSS, although it may result from stalled RT as the sequence immediately upstream is G/C-rich. On similar analyses using a primer hybridizing within MEF2A exon A2, one major extension product was seen (Fig. 2, C and D). This corresponds to a site in MEF2A genomic sequence (TSS p2) immediately downstream of a group of GC boxes. Several minor alternative sites were apparent in brain, clustered upstream within 20 bases of this site, and one was also present in other tissues (TSS p2′). The total A2 extension product and the ratio of A2 to A1 product were consistently highest in skeletal muscle, suggesting that promoter 2 may be more active in this tissue. RPA were performed to further examine the tissue distribution of the alternative MEF2A transcripts. Complementary RNA probes derived from cDNAs containing either exons A1 and C or A2 and C were generated, but the A2/C probe was not useful because of extremely high G/C content and a lengthy near-palindromic sequence in exon A2. MEF2A A1/C mRNA was detected in all tissues (data not shown). We conclude from this and the primer extension results that the alternative TATA-less MEF2A promoters, each with a cluster of transcription initiation sites, are not selectively active among the tissues examined. We found no evidence for MEF2A promoters other than p1 and p2.

Here, we have examined the role of endogenous human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) in the regulation of cellular apoptosis. Small inhibitory RNA-mediated silencing of hSPRY2 abolished the anti-apoptotic action of serum in adrenal cortex adenocarcinoma (SW13) cells. Silencing of hSPRY2 decreased serum- or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-elicited activation of AKT and ERK1/2 and reduced the levels of EGF receptor. Silencing of hSPRY2 also inhibited serum-induced activation of p90RSK and decreased phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic protein BAD (BCL2-antagonist of cell death) by p90RSK. Inhibiting both the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways abolished the ability of serum to protect against apoptosis, mimicking the effects of silencing hSPRY2. Serum transactivated the EGF receptor (EGFR), and inhibition of the EGFR by a neutralizing antibody attenuated the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Consistent with the role of EGFR and perhaps other growth factor receptors in the anti-apoptotic actions of serum, the tyrosine kinase binding domain of c-Cbl (Cbl-TKB) protected against down-regulation of the growth factor receptors such as EGFR and preserved the anti-apoptotic actions of serum when hSpry2 was silenced. Additionally, silencing of Spry2 in c-Cbl null cells did not alter the ability of serum to promote cell survival. Moreover, reintroduction of wild type hSPRY2, but not its mutants that do not bind c-Cbl or CIN85 into SW13 cells after endogenous hSPRY2 had been silenced, restored the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Overall, we conclude that endogenous hSPRY2-mediated regulation of apoptosis requires c-Cbl and is manifested by the ability of hSPRY2 to sequester c-Cbl and thereby augment signaling via growth factor receptors.

We have previously shown that hSPRY2, in part, mediates its anti-migratory actions by increasing the amount of soluble protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (20Yigzaw Y. Poppleton H.M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 284-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and decreases growth factor-mediated activation of Rac1 (21Poppleton H.M. Edwin F. Jaggar L. Ray R. Johnson L.R. Patel T.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The ability of hSPRY2 to decrease Rac1 activation also contributes to its anti-migratory, but not the anti-proliferative actions (21Poppleton H.M. Edwin F. Jaggar L. Ray R. Johnson L.R. Patel T.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that hSPRY2 increases phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and the anti-proliferative actions of hSPRY2 require PTEN (18Edwin F. Singh R. Endersby R. Baker S.J. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4816-4822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although a large number of reports have used overexpressed SPRY proteins to study their functions, relatively few studies have examined the role of endogenous SPRY proteins in modulating cellular events. In this context, studies with SPRY2 knock-out mice have shown no obvious phenotypes except impaired hearing due to altered cytoarchitecture of the organ of Corti (22Shim K. Minowada G. Coling D.E. Martin G.R. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and enteric neuronal hyperplasia and esophageal achalasia (23Taketomi T. Yoshiga D.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the role of endogenous SPRY proteins in regulating events at the cellular level remain largely unknown.Importantly, although Sprouty proteins have predominantly been thought of as inhibitors of receptor-tyrosine kinases, they can also positively regulate growth factor actions. Thus, previous studies reported that hSPRY2 can augment the activation of ERK1/2 in response to EGF by decreasing c-Cbl-mediated degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Refs. 24Fang X.

Likewise, by increasing EGFR signaling, hSPRY2 has been shown to facilitate the differentiation of PC12 cells into the neuronal phenotype (26Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4796-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).In this report, by silencing the endogenous hSPRY2 in SW13 cells and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we show that endogenous hSPRY2 is necessary for the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. The knockdown of endogenous hSPRY2 decreased the amount of EGFR and downstream signaling via the AKT and ERK pathways in response to both EGF and serum. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous hSPRY2 decreased serum-mediated activation of RSK, the immediate downstream kinase of ERK1/2, and phosphorylation of its target, proapoptotic protein, BAD. The anti-apoptotic action of serum was mediated by both the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways and was mimicked by the combination of the MEK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. Serum transactivated the EGFR, and inhibition of the EGFR attenuated the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Consistent with a role for the EGFR and perhaps other growth factor receptors in the actions of serum, the tyrosine kinase binding domain of c-Cbl (Cbl-TKB) protected against EGFR down-regulation and preserved the anti-apoptotic actions of serum when hSPRY2 was silenced. Additionally, in c-Cbl null cells, the ability of endogenous Spry2 to modulate the anti-apoptotic actions of serum was obliterated. Moreover, transduction of TAT-HA-hSPRY2, but not the mutant (Y55F) that does not bind Cbl into cells in which endogenous hSPRY2 had been silenced by siRNA, rescued the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Thus, this is the first demonstration that endogenous hSPRY2, by modulating the function of c-Cbl, regulates cellular apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture ConditionsAdrenal cortex adenocarcinoma (SW13) cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were maintained in Leibovitz's (L15) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator in the absence of CO2. The Spry2wt/loxP mice (C57/B6) in which the entire coding sequence (exon 2) was floxed were generated through inGenious Targeting Labs (Stonybrook) using the construct shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from heterozygous Spry2wt/loxP mice were isolated and cultured as described previously (18Edwin F. Singh R. Endersby R. Baker S.J. Patel T.B. J. Biol.

Forty eight hours before experimentation, the Spry2wt/loxP cells were infected with retrovirus to express either GFP or Crerecombinase-GFP fusion protein, and Spry2 expression in these cells was monitored by Western analyses to confirm the Spry2+/+ and Spry2+/– phenotypes. Wild type and c-Cbl–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from Dr. Hamid Band (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) and cultured in minimal essential medium, 10% FBS, 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol.Constructs and Purification of ProteinsWild type TAT-HA-hSPRY2 was constructed as described previously (15Yigzaw Y.

Briefly, 6 μl of transit TKO reagent was mixed thoroughly with 200 μl Opti-MEM and incubated for 12 min at room temperature. To this 2.4 μl of 10 μm hSPRY2 siRNA or mutant hSPRY2 siRNA was added and incubated at room temperature for another 12 min before dropwise addition to the dishes containing 1 ml of regular media. Cells were incubated for 48 h before experimentation.

Cells were serum-starved for 36 h and then exposed to 10% fetal bovine serum for 15 min. When indicated, the MEK inhibitor (UO126, 20 μm) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) was added 15 min before serum treatment. Cells were then treated with or without 20 ng/ml TNF-α plus 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (TNFα/CHX) to induce apoptosis for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Thereafter, DNA fragmentation was measured using the cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (29Deng W. Poppleton H. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Shinozuka Y. Wang D.A.

Absorbance at 405 nm was normalized with the protein concentrations from the corresponding parallel wells in the same experiment. The validity of the DNA fragmentation method was also confirmed by monitoring the cleavage of PARP as an index of apoptosis using the anti-cleaved and total PARP antibodies (Cell Signaling).Activation of c-CblSW13 cells treated with mutant siRNA or siRNA against hSPRY2 were serum-starved and then challenged with EGF (50 nm) or serum (10%).

The c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Cbl antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). Western blots of the immunoprecipitated c-Cbl were performed with anti-Tyr(P)-99 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSSilencing of Endogenous hSPRY2 Attenuates the Anti-apoptotic Actions of SerumBecause we have previously shown that hSPRY2 decreases cell proliferation (15Yigzaw Y.

To investigate the role of endogenous hSPRY2 in regulation of cellular apoptosis, we utilized small inhibitory RNA specific against hSPRY2 (hSPRY2 siRNA) to decrease endogenous expression of hSPRY2 in SW13 cells. As controls, cells were either sham-transfected or transfected with equimolar amounts of mutant siRNA (harboring three mutations in the hSPRY2 siRNA sequence). As compared with the controls (sham or mutant siRNAs), transfection with hSPRY2 siRNA markedly (>80%) decreased the endogenous levels of hSPRY2 (Fig. 1A). We did not observe any gross morphological changes in the cells after knocking down endogenous hSPRY2 amount (not shown). Moreover, as shown in supplemental Fig. S2A, silencing of hSPRY2 in SW13 cells did not alter the amounts of endogenous hSPRY1 and hSPRY4. Although our antibody detected the overexpressed hSPRY3 in SW13 cells, hSPRY3 was not detectable in the lysates of SW13 cells (supplemental Fig. S2B).In apoptosis assays, serum deprivation (without TNF) induced some degree of apoptosis that was reversed by serum addition when endogenous hSPRY2 levels were not manipulated, but this action of serum was obliterated when hSPRY2 was silenced (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the anti-apoptotic actions of serum in the presence of TNF-α were also markedly attenuated when hSPRY2 was silenced (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, identical observations were also made using cleaved PARP as a monitor of cellular apoptosis (Figs. 1, C and D), confirming the validity of the DNA fragmentation method used in Fig. 1B. Notably, although silencing of hSPRY2 decreased the anti-apoptotic actions of serum, EGF- and serum-induced migration of SW13 cells was either enhanced or not affected, respectively. 3F. Edwin and T. B. Patel, unpublished observations. Endogenous hSPRY2 Regulates Serum and EGF-elicited Activation of ERK1/2 and AKTBecause the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways contribute toward cell survival, next we monitored the ability of serum to activate these enzymes when hSPRY2 was silenced. As shown in Fig. 2, panels A–C, siRNA-mediated knockdown of hSPRY2 markedly attenuated the ability of serum to stimulate AKT and ERK1/2. Because hSPRY2 has previously been shown to modulate the signaling via growth factor receptors (25Egan J.E. Hall A.B. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similar to our findings with serum, EGF-elicited activation of ERK1/2 and AKT was also markedly attenuated when hSPRY2 was silenced (Fig. 2, D and E). Moreover, the amount of EGFR was also decreased when hSPRY2 was silenced (Fig. 2, D and E). Interestingly, the transduction of Y55F mutant of TAT-HA-hSPRY2, which is not phosphorylated on Tyr-55 by growth factors (31Fong C.W. Leong H.F. Wong E.S. Lim J. Yusoff P. Guy G.R. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that Tyr-55 phosphorylation of hSPRY2 provides a docking site for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and sequesters c-Cbl so that ubiquitylation and degradation of growth factor receptors such as the EGFR is diminished (25Egan J.E.

Silencing of hSPRY2 or transduction of the dominant negative Y55F mutant of hSPRY2 would produce an opposite effect and decrease the amount of EGFR. Thus, the decrease in EGFR when hSPRY2 is silenced may be explained by the ability of hSPRY2 to bind and sequester c-Cbl and would, therefore, explain the attenuation of ERK1/2 and AKT activation by EGF when hSPRY2 is silenced (discussed further below).FIGURE 2Silencing of endogenous hSPRY2 decreases AKT and ERK1/2 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2077587572,"Oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic cells by the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein directly involves the activation Jak2 tyrosine kinase and the Stat5 transcription factor. Both proteins are normally linked to the interleukin (IL)-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors for growth and survival. Since fibroblastic cells are not targets of BCR-ABL-induced oncogenesis, we determined whether forced expression of the IL-3 receptor would allow oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts known to be resistant to transformation by BCR-ABL. NIH 3T3 cells transduced with the human IL-3 receptor α and β chains were highly susceptible to oncogenic transformation by expression of BCR-ABL. Forced expression of both receptor chains but not either one alone allowed efficient foci formation of NIH 3T3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (triple positive cells), and these cells formed colonies in soft agar, whereas BCR-ABL+ NIH 3T3 cells lacking IL-3 receptor expression did not. Signaling studies indicate that the BCR-ABL/IL-3 receptor+ NIH 3T3 cells utilize the Gab2/PI-3 kinase pathway activated by Jak2, and the Stat5 pathway activated separately by Bcr-Abl, whereas BCR-ABL+ NIH 3T3 cells lacking the IL-3 receptor do not utilize the Jak2 pathway, but still maintain activation of Stat5. The Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (1 μM) and two Jak2 kinase inhibitors strongly inhibited agar colony formation and the activation of Gab2 caused by Jak2. All of these findings indicate that Bcr-Abl oncoprotein requires the IL-3 receptor/Jak2/Stat5 pathways for oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2027318608,"The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major source of climatic disturbance, impacting the dynamics of ecosystems worldwide. Recent models predict that human-generated rises in green-house gas levels will cause an increase in the strength and frequency of El Niño warming events in the next several decades, highlighting the need to understand the potential biological consequences of increased ENSO activity. Studies have focused on the ecological and demographic implications of El Niño in a range of organisms, but there have been few systematic attempts to measure the impact of these processes on genetic diversity in populations. Here, we evaluate whether the 1997–1998 El Niño altered the genetic composition of Galápagos marine iguana populations from eleven islands, some of which experienced mortality rates of up to 90% as a result of El Niño warming. Specifically, we measured the temporal variation in microsatellite allele frequencies and mitochondrial DNA diversity (mtDNA) in samples collected before (1991/1993) and after (2004) the El Niño event. Based on microsatellite data, only one island (Marchena) showed signatures of a genetic bottleneck, where the harmonic mean of the effective population size (Ne) was estimated to be less than 50 individuals during the period between samplings. Substantial decreases in mtDNA variation between time points were observed in populations from just two islands (Marchena and Genovesa). Our results suggests that, for the majority of islands, a single, intense El Niño event did not reduce marine iguana populations to the point where substantial neutral genetic diversity was lost. In the case of Marchena, simultaneous changes to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variation may also be the result of a volcanic eruption on the island in 1991. Therefore, studies that seek to evaluate the genetic impact of El Niño must also consider the confounding or potentially synergistic effect of other environmental and biological forces shaping populations."

The consensus sequence, AAGTT, is the core element of the cis-regulatory element of the β-retinoic acid receptor gene (β-RARE) and is also found in the human PLP promoter. Until now, the molecular details of DNA recognition by MyT1-type zinc fingers have not been addressed. In this work, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to delineate the relative importance of each ZnF in MyT1 for DNA binding. Finger 5 (F5) has the highest affinity for the β-RARE site. We went on to use a combination of NMR and mutagenesis to probe the structural basis for the MyT1-DNA interaction. A data-driven model of the interaction, calculated using HADDOCK (12van Dijk A.D. Bonvin A.M.

This mode of recognition is distinct from that observed for other classes of DNA-binding ZnFs. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of MyT1 Constructs–The original plasmid encoding mouse 6-ZnF myelin transcription factor 1 (mMyT1) was a generous gift of Dr. Lynn Hudson (National Institutes of Health). Ten different constructs of MyT1 were cloned from the original plasmid and mutants were constructed using overlap extension PCR (see Fig. 1). All constructs were overexpressed as fusions with glutathione S-transferase at 25 °C under standard conditions; isotopically labeled F5 was overexpressed using the protocol described in a previous study (15Cai M. Huang Y. Sakaguchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Craigie R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using GSH affinity chromatography, thrombin cleavage, and gel filtration (Superdex-75 in SPR buffer: 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). Protein identities were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and concentrations were determined by absorbance at 215, 225, and 280 nm (16Wolf P. Analyt. Biochem. 1982; 129: 145-155Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fractions were stored at -20 °C until required. β-RARE DNA and Mutant Oligonucleotides–Single-stranded β-RARE DNA (5′-ACCGAAAGTTCAC and 5′-GTGAACTTTCGGT), mutant oligonucleotides and biotinylated DNA for SPR experiments were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, annealed in SPR buffer without dithiothreitol (heated to 95 °C for 5 min, then cooled to room temperature over the course of 1-2 h) and purified using gel filtration (Superdex-75). Concentrations were calculated by absorbance at 260 nm. SPR–All experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 system (Biacore AB) at flow rates of 5-10 μl/min in SPR buffer. Biotinylated DNA (∼10-100 nm) was immobilized on streptavidin-coated Biacore SA chips. MyT1 (1-110 μm) was injected in SPR buffer and binding was monitored. To compare binding affinities for different single- or double-finger constructs in a semi-quantitative manner, equal concentrations of each construct were injected (10 or 20 μm) and the SPR responses were compared. The system was washed with 1 m NaCl (1 min) after each experiment. For kinetics studies (F5 and F7), curves were fitted using the standard 1:1 Langmuir model. In the competition experiments, either F5 (12 μm) or F45 (5 μm) was added to pre-bound DNA in the presence of 2 or 5 molar equivalents of competitor DNA oligonucleotides, respectively. ITC–Protein and DNA samples were dialyzed overnight against the same reservoir of SPR buffer. β-RARE DNA (60-130 μm) was titrated into F5 or F45 (8 μm). Titrations were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 25 °C. For each titration, 25-30 injections of 5-10 μl of titrant were made at 5-min intervals. Data were corrected for heats of dilution from control experiments of DNA into buffer, and analyzed using Origin ITC Analysis software (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA), as described previously (17Simpson R.J.

NMR Spectroscopy–F5 (unlabeled, 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled) was dialyzed into NMR buffer (2.5 mm deuterated MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol or Tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphite) and concentrated in Microsep 1-K cutoff units to 200-700 μm. Standard homonuclear and 15N-separated experiments were acquired at 4 °C on a Bruker Avance 600 and Avance 800 NMR spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. 15N-separated NOESY and two-dimensional NOESY data were used to derive distance constraints. Dihedral restraints were obtained by analysis of the HNHA spectrum (18Edison A.S. Weinhold F. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and stereo-specific assignments were made from short mixing time NOESY (50 ms) and TOCSY (35 ms) data. 15N-HSQC titrations of F5 with β-RARE DNA were carried out in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C. HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCO experiments were recorded for both 15N,13C-F5 alone, and the protein·DNA complex, together with single and double half-filtered NOESY experiments and an HCCH-TOCSY for the complex. Chemical shift changes were calculated as a weighted average of HN,N,Cα, and C′ changes, using to a previously reported equation (19Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol.

Assignments of the DNA alone were obtained from two-dimensional NOESY spectra. NMR data were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker, Karlsruhe) and analyzed with SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California at San Francisco). Structure Calculations–Initial structures of F5 were calculated in DYANA (21Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) from manually assigned unambiguous NOEs and dihedral angle constraints obtained from both 3JNHα coupling constants and the GRIDSEARCH module of DYANA. Zinc-ligating atoms were identified by examination of the initial structures calculated in the absence of zinc. Final calculations were then carried out using ARIA 1.2 (22Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) implemented in CNS 1.1 (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

In the final set of calculations, the 100 lowest energy structures were refined in a 9-Å shell of water using standard ARIA 1.2 water refinement modules (minimization and dynamics steps, for details see Refs 25Linge J.P.

The starting structures for the docking were a B-form model of the double helix DNA fragment (5′-ACCGAAAGTTCAC) constructed with the Nucleic Acid Builder package (29Macke T. Case D.A. Modeling Unusual Nucleic Acid Structures. American Chemical Society, Washington1998Google Scholar) and the 20 lowest energy structures of F5. Based on NMR titration data, disordered sequences consisting of the ten N-terminal and seven C-terminal residues of F5 (and the Zn atom) were excluded from the calculation. Active and passive residues for both the protein and the DNA were chosen based on experimental data and solvent accessibility (>50%) determined by the program MOL-MOL. A 2-Å distance was used to define the ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs). For the DNA fragment, bases 6-9 and 18-20 located within the consensus sequence were selected as “active” based on the chemical shift changes observed upon complex formation. AIRs were defined solely from the unique base atoms of bases 8, 9, 19, and 20 to suitable atoms (i.e. from H toNorOand vice versa) of all active and passive residues of F5, whereas for bases 6, 7, and 18 the whole base was selected because of the lower specificity of these nucleotides (30Kamphuis M.B. Bonvin A.M. Monti M.C. Lemonnier M. Munoz-Gomez A. van den Heuvel R.H. Diaz-Orejas R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The four flanking nucleotides (bases 5, 10, 17, and 21) were chosen as “passive.” For F5 AIRs were defined between all atoms of all active residues (Ile-857, Asn-860, Tyr-861, Ser-863, Arg-865, and Ser-868) and all atoms of all active and passive DNA bases. Passive residues of the protein were defined as the solvent-accessible surface neighbors of active residues (Ser-854 and Ala-862). A total of 18 AIRs resulted from all definitions described above and were used as input in HADDOCK. Additional restraints to maintain base planarity and Watson Crick bonds were introduced for the DNA. During the rigid body energy minimization, 1000 structures were calculated, and the 200 best solutions based on the intermolecular energy were used for the semi-flexible, simulated annealing followed by an explicit water refinement. The solutions were clustered using a cutoff of 3.5-Å r.m.s.d. based on the pair wise backbone r.m.s.d. matrix. The semi-flexible annealing and the water refinement steps of HADDOCK were re-run with the best five structures of the lowest energy clusters (cutoffs 0.9 Å) (30Kamphuis M.B. Bonvin A.M. Monti M.C. Lemonnier M. Munoz-Gomez A. van den Heuvel R.H. Diaz-Orejas R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The final 120 structures were clustered as described above, resulting in a single low energy cluster of 23 structures. The best 10 structures (r.m.s.d. 0.7 Å over backbone atoms) of this cluster were analyzed using standard HADDOCK protocols and were used to represent a model of the complex. The DNA-binding Properties of MyT1 ZnF Combinations–To understand the DNA-binding properties of MyT1 ZnFs, we first expressed and purified polypeptides corresponding to different combinations of the MyT1 ZnFs (Fig. 1, A and B) and tested their ability to bind a 13-bp oligonucleotide containing the β-RARE sequence (5′-ACCGAAAGTTCAC, Fig. 1C)by SPR. Both two-dimensional NMR and circular dichroism melting data confirmed that this oligonucleotide is a well ordered B-form double helix in the SPR buffer (data not shown). The B-form nature of the oligonucleotide was confirmed by analyzing intra- and internucleotide NOE intensities (31Wuthrich, K. (1986) NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, New YorkGoogle Scholar). We first measured the affinity of individual ZnFs for the β-RARE DNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, significant differences in the binding properties were observed between fingers. The data for finger 5 (F5) fitted well to a 1:1 binding isotherm, yielding a KD of 200 μm (see Fig. 2G). Reduction of the salt concentration from 150 to 50 mm increased the binding affinity to 11 μm (Fig. 2H), indicating a significant electrostatic component to the F5-DNA interaction. In comparison the binding of F7 was slightly weaker (KD = 51 μm at 50 mm NaCl) and F3, F4, and F6 bound so weakly that an affinity constant could not be reliably measured. As an alternative (albeit semiquantitative) means of gauging the relative affinities of each ZnF for DNA, we compared the SPR response obtained following the injection of equal amounts of protein onto identically prepared chips (e.g. see inset in Fig. 2A for data on F5 and F7). This approach gives a reliable indication of the relative propensities for binding, provided the protein concentration used is of the order of the dissociation constants (as it was in these experiments). As shown in Fig. 2A, the different ZnFs clearly have different DNA-binding properties in isolation. Overall, F2 and F5 appeared to bind with similar affinities, whereas F3, F4, and F6 bound relatively poorly. F7 exhibits ∼50% of F5 binding using this approach (Fig. 2A and inset), in good agreement with the affinities determined above. Interestingly, the affinities of double finger constructs displayed less variation (Fig. 2B). ITC data revealed that F5 binds to β-RARE with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity of 27 μm (Fig. 2C). Note that these data were recorded under conditions where the so-called “c-value,” the product of the association constant and the receptor (in this case the protein) concentration, was ∼0.3. ITC data are typically recorded with c in the range 10-300, under which conditions the data are sigmoidal in shape. However, it has been rigorously established that accurate KD values can still be determined for weak interactions where c values are as low as 0.01 or less (32Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The binding constant obtained for the F5-DNA interaction agrees well with that obtained by SPR (11 versus 27 μm, see above). A double finger construct containing both F4 and F5 (F45) also binds in a 1:1 fashion, but two orders of magnitude more tightly (KD = 0.27 μm, Fig. 2D). Thus, binding of the β-RARE probe is dominated by a subset of the MyT1 ZnFs (F2 and F5, and probably also F7), but the other fingers can make a significant contribution to binding at a GAAAGTT site. Analysis of ZnF-DNA Interactions–We next sought to examine the specificity of DNA binding by MyT1-type ZnFs in more detail. Preliminary NMR data (not shown) indicated that ZnFs 2 and 4, while folded, existed in solution as multiple species that were in slow exchange on the chemical shift timescale. Additionally, SPR binding curves for the F2-DNA interaction could not be fitted by any available kinetic model. Both of these findings are consistent with oligomerization of the proteins; a conclusion that was subsequently confirmed by multiangle laser light scattering (not shown). We therefore focused on the interaction of F5 with DNA. To determine the importance of each DNA base for the interaction, SPR competition experiments were performed. β-RARE DNA was immobilized and F5 was injected in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of a competitor oligonucleotide (Fig. 2E). This series of competitors was based on wild-type β-RARE, with each base mutated in turn (A to C, G to T, and vice versa). Under these conditions, wild-type β-RARE reduced the SPR signal by ∼80% and all other competition experiments were compared with this value. The mutants A7C, G8T, T9G, and T10G were significantly less effective competitors for F5 binding than the other oligonucleotides (p < 0.01), indicating that the central AGTT sequence is likely to represent the target site for F5. The same experiment was repeated for the double finger construct F45 (Fig. 2F), whereupon three additional positions (GAA) upstream of the central AGTT motif were demonstrated to contribute to F45 binding. Notably, the changes in relative competition at the AGTT motif were significantly larger for F45 compared with F5 because of the different conditions used (which were restricted by the amounts of protein and DNA available and the binding affinities for the different interactions). Structure of F5–Next, we used standard 1H- and 15N-separated NMR experiments to determine the solution conformation of F5. Initial structures calculated in DYANA (21Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) using unambiguous restraint data indicated that Cys-846, Cys-851, His-864, and Cys-870 were the zinc ligands. The structure was then refined in ARIA (22Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 33Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), with the inclusion of restraints to define the zinc geometry (34Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The 20 lowest energy structures from a total of 700 were used to represent the structure of F5 (Fig. 3A, PDB code 2JYD). These structures display good covalent geometry and no restraint violations >0.5Å or 5 ° (Table 1). The structure is well defined, with an r.m.s.d. for backbone atoms of 0.41 Å (residues 845-874), but lacks any elements of repeating secondary structure (i.e. α-helices and β-sheets). Rather, it comprises several irregular loops with a central zinc atom (Fig. 3A). The four zinc-ligating residues, together with Thr-848, Gly-855, Gly-859, and Gly-869, make up a small hydrophobic core. Fig. 3B shows an electrostatic surface representation of F5, revealing a distinct groove on one side and a mixture of positive and negative potential on the opposing surface. A small electrostatic network also appears to exist on one surface of F5, comprising Lys-845, Asp-852, and Arg-872 (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the surface exposed Arg-872 to alanine disrupts the structure of F5, as determined by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (data not shown), consistent with a role for these electrostatic interactions in stabilizing F5.TABLE 1Structure statistics of F5 and F5·DNA complexParameterF5 (# 20)F5:DNA (# 10)A) NMR restraintsDistance restraintsTotal NOE restraints658Total unambiguous NOE restraints640Intra residue355Sequential142Medium range (i - j < 5)64Long range (i - j > 5)79Total ambiguous restraints18AIRs18Dihedral restraintsΦ10ϰ18B) Energy statisticsCNS energies (after water ref., kcal/mol)Etot−1644.2 ± 59.1−1598.3 ± 11.5Ebond11.5 ± 1.510.7 ± 0.5Eangle49.9 ± 5.080.1 ± 1.8Eimproper20.2 ± 4.214.7 ± 1.0Edihed158.5 ± 2.0Evdw−124.1 ± 10.2−360.5 ± 9.5Eelectr−1601.6 ± 60.7−1501.8 ± 9.6r.m.s.d. from idealized geometryBond (Å)0.0048 ± 0.00030.0024 ± 0.0001Angle (°)0.53 ± 0.030.44 ± 0.01C) r.m.s.d. from average structure (amino acids 845-873)Backbone0.410.69Heavy atoms0.790.68D) PROCHECK analysis (amino acids 845-873)Residues in most favored regions (%)66.368.5Residues in additional allowed regions (%)33.731.5Residues in generously allowed regions (%)0.00.0Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.00.0 Open table in a new tab Mapping the MyT1-F5·DNA Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy–To determine how MyT1-type ZnFs recognize DNA, we analyzed chemical shift perturbations following a titration of 15N-F5 with β-RARE. Fig. 4A shows a section of the 15N-HSQC spectrum of F5 during the titration. The selective shift of a subset of resonances, together with the fact that no changes were observed in the spectrum following the addition of more than one molar equivalent of DNA (data not shown), indicates a specific interaction between F5 and DNA. The interaction is an intermediate to fast exchange on the chemical shift timescale, as expected for the formation of a complex with a Kd >10 μm. A summary of chemical shift changes is shown in Fig. 4B, and in Fig. 4C residues that both exhibit significant chemical shift changes and have a solvent accessibility >50% (active residues, see below) are mapped onto a space-filling representation of F5. These residues lie mainly on one face of the structure, suggesting that this surface represents the DNA-binding surface of F5. The surface, which is somewhat concave, comprises a mixture of polar and hydrophobic side chains and bears an overall positive charge (Fig. 3B, left, and Fig. 4C). 15N-HSQC titrations were also carried out using double finger constructs F45 and F56 (data not shown). Chemical shift changes for the F56 construct were dominated by changes in F5, whereas in the case of F45 chemical shift changes were observed for signals in both ZnFs. Unfortunately, intermediate chemical exchange combined with a tendency for the double finger constructs to degrade, precluded the detailed analysis of their interaction with DNA. Analysis of NOESY spectra of the F5·DNA complex also allowed chemical shift changes to be evaluated for protons in the DNA (Fig. 4, D and E). Overall, the largest chemical shift changes were observed for the central AGT portion of the duplex, consistent with the SPR competition experiments. A Model of the F5·DNA Complex–Although the F5·DNA complex was ∼99% populated under the conditions of our NMR experiments ([F5] = [β-RARE] = 1mm), no intermolecular NOEs could be unambiguously identified from either double half-filtered or a combination of two-dimensional [F1,F2] and two-dimensional [F1] 13C,15N-filtered NO"
https://openalex.org/W2067693418,"Checkpoint protein Chk1 has been identified as an Hsp90 client. Treatment with 100 nM geldanamycin (GM) for 24 h markedly reduced the Chk1 amount in Jurkat and ML-1 leukemia cell lines. Because Chk1 plays a central role in G2 checkpoint, we added GM to G2-arrested Jurkat and HL-60 cells pretreated with 50 nM doxorubicin for 24 h. GM slowly released both cell lines from doxorubicin-induced G2 arrest into G1 phase. GM also abrogated ICRF-193-induced decatenation G2 checkpoint in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. Western blot analysis showed that addition of GM attenuates doxorubicin- and ICRF-193-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345. GM, however, failed to abrogate G2 arrest in p53-positive ML-1 cells maybe due to the p21 induction. GM released HeLa cells from doxorubicin-induced G2 arrest but trapped them at M phase. Flow cytometric analysis showed that addition of GM converted doxorubicin-induced necrosis into apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Colony assay indicated that although GM has a weak cytotoxic effect as a single agent, it dramatically intensifies the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and ICRF-193 in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. These results suggest that abrogation of G2 checkpoint by GM may play a central role in sensitizing p53-negative tumor cells to DNA-damaging and decatenation-inhibiting agents."
https://openalex.org/W2090049289,"Background San Francisco has the highest rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the U.S. with recurrent outbreaks among the homeless and marginally housed. It has been shown for syndromic data that when exact geographic coordinates of individual patients are used as the spatial base for outbreak detection, higher detection rates and accuracy are achieved compared to when data are aggregated into administrative regions such as zip codes and census tracts. We examine the effect of varying the spatial resolution in the TB data within the San Francisco homeless population on detection sensitivity, timeliness, and the amount of historical data needed to achieve better performance measures. Methods and Findings We apply a variation of space-time permutation scan statistic to the TB data in which a patient's location is either represented by its exact coordinates or by the centroid of its census tract. We show that the detection sensitivity and timeliness of the method generally improve when exact locations are used to identify real TB outbreaks. When outbreaks are simulated, while the detection timeliness is consistently improved when exact coordinates are used, the detection sensitivity varies depending on the size of the spatial scanning window and the number of tracts in which cases are simulated. Finally, we show that when exact locations are used, smaller amount of historical data is required for training the model. Conclusion Systematic characterization of the spatio-temporal distribution of TB cases can widely benefit real time surveillance and guide public health investigations of TB outbreaks as to what level of spatial resolution results in improved detection sensitivity and timeliness. Trading higher spatial resolution for better performance is ultimately a tradeoff between maintaining patient confidentiality and improving public health when sharing data. Understanding such tradeoffs is critical to managing the complex interplay between public policy and public health. This study is a step forward in this direction."
https://openalex.org/W1984512584,"The cortical representation of the visual field is split along the vertical midline, with the left and the right hemi-fields projecting to separate hemispheres. Connections between the visual areas of the two hemispheres are abundant near the representation of the visual midline. It was suggested that they re-establish the functional continuity of the visual field by controlling the dynamics of the responses in the two hemispheres.To understand if and how the interactions between the two hemispheres participate in processing visual stimuli, the synchronization of responses to identical or different moving gratings in the two hemi-fields were studied in anesthetized ferrets. The responses were recorded by multiple electrodes in the primary visual areas and the synchronization of local field potentials across the electrodes were analyzed with a recent method derived from dynamical system theory. Inactivating the visual areas of one hemisphere modulated the synchronization of the stimulus-driven activity in the other hemisphere. The modulation was stimulus-specific and was consistent with the fine morphology of callosal axons in particular with the spatio-temporal pattern of activity that axonal geometry can generate.These findings describe a new kind of interaction between the cerebral hemispheres and highlight the role of axonal geometry in modulating aspects of cortical dynamics responsible for stimulus detection and/or categorization."
https://openalex.org/W2051975450,"Daily behaviors are strongly dominated by internally generated circadian rhythms, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In mammals, photoentrainment of behaviors to light-dark cycles involves signaling from both intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and classic photoreceptor pathways to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). How classic photoreceptor pathways work with the photosensitive ganglion cells, however, is not fully understood. Although cholecystokinin (CCK) peptide has been shown to be present in a variety of vertebrate retinas, its function at a systems level is also unknown. In the present study we examined a possible role of CCK-A receptors in photoentrainment using CCK-A receptor knockout mice. The lacZ reporter gene within a gene-knockout cassette revealed precise localization of CCK-A receptors in the circadian clock system. We demonstrated that CCK-A receptors were located predominately on glycinergic amacrine cells but were rarely found on SCN neurons. Moreover, Ca(2+) imaging analysis demonstrated that the CCK-A agonist, CCK-8 sulfate (CCK-8s), mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) in amacrine cells but not glutamate-receptive SCN neurons. Furthermore, light pulse-induced mPer1/mPer2 gene expression in SCN, behavioral phase shifts, and the pupillary reflex were significantly reduced in CCK-A receptor knockout mice. These data indicate a novel function of CCK-A receptors in the nonimage-forming photoreception presumably via amacrine cell-mediated signal transduction pathways."

The presence of activated Rac diminished the Bcr/RhoGDIα interaction. Moreover, a Bcr mutant that lacks the ability to promote hydrolysis of Rac-GTP bound to its GAP domain did not bind to RhoGDIα in cell lysates, indicating that binding of RhoGDIα and Rac-GTP to the Bcr GAP domain is mutually exclusive.

Bcr and Abr have a Dbl/pleckstrin homology domain and a C-terminal GAP domain (20Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bcr additionally has an N-terminal domain with serine/threonine kinase activity. Null mutant mice lacking Abr, Bcr, or both have been used to demonstrate that these two proteins are important negative regulators of activated Rac in cells of the innate immune system (22Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vivo, Bcr and Abr also regulate Rac functions in other organs, including the inner ear and cerebellum (23Kaartinen V. Gonzalez-Gomez I. Voncken J.W. Faure E. Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4217-4227PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kaartinen V. Nagy A. Gonzalez-Gomez I. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The regulated Rac activation and deactivation cycle is a key for the proper function of cell motility, inflammatory responses, and endothelial cell barrier function, among others, but the coordination of steps that constitute this process is not precisely known. For example, GAPs such as Bcr and Abr are expected to transiently interact only with GTP-bound Rac, but how Bcr comes into contact with the substrate Rac-GTP or where the product (Rac-GDP) is delivered is not known. A previous study showed that the GAP activity of Bcr toward mature Rac-GTP is blocked in the presence of RhoGDI in vitro, but no exact mechanism was provided (25Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated this mechanism in more detail and report an unanticipated direct binding of RhoGDIα to the GAP domain of Bcr when it is not occupied with Rac-GTP, which prevents further GAP activity from taking place. Cell CultureCOS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All tissue culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (obtained from Monique Stins, The Johns Hopkins University) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 units/ml heparin. Plasmids and AntibodiesWild-type Bcr constructs and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged full-length wild-type Bcr, p190, and p210 have been described previously (22Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J.

Dyn. 2002; 223: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GST-Abr was generated by ligation of a 0.4-kb 5′-BamHI/BstEII fragment with a 3′-BstEII/EcoRI fragment into the pLEF vector digested with BamHI/EcoRI. The human Abr cDNA used to make this construct is of the variant 2 type (NM_001092). The 5′-BamHI site in the 5′-untranslated region was introduced by PCR. The Bcr mutants with point mutations in the GAP domain, Bcr(R1090A) and Bcr(R1090A/N1202A) were cloned into pcDNA3.1/HisA or pcDNA3.1/HisB. Plasmids encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Rac1 and RhoGDIα were obtained from the Missouri University of Science and Technology cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). The mutant forms of Rac1 have been described previously (27Haataja L. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8321-8328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal fragments of RhoGDIα were subcloned from pEGFP-RhoGDIα-NT and pEGFP-RhoGDIα-CT into pcDNA3.1/HisB by digestion with EcoRI/XbaI. We subcloned RhoGDIα into pGEX-4T-1. The wild-type BcrGAP and mutant BcrGAP(R1090A) constructs in pGEX-3X have been described previously (20Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The Xpress-tagged Abr GAP domain was subcloned as an EcoRI fragment from AbrGAP in pGEX-3X (20Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) into EcoRI-digested, phosphatase-treated pcDNA3.1/HisA. Xpress-tagged BcrGAP was constructed by subcloning the insert of BcrGAP in pGEX-3X into pcDNA3.1/HisA digested with BamHI-EcoRI. Anti-Bcr antibodies C20 (against the Bcr C terminus) and N20 (against the Bcr N terminus) and anti-GST antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against Xpress, RhoGDI, and Rac1 were from Invitrogen, Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), and BD Biosciences. The rabbit anti-Abl (CH2) and anti-Bcr (CH13) polyclonal antisera were raised against a v-Abl 1.2-kb HincII-PstI fragment and a 0.691-kb PvuII-PvuII fragment from the GAP domain of Bcr, respectively, as described (28Stam K. Heisterkamp N. Reynolds Jr., F.H. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1955-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Pulldown from Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and ImmunoblottingAll procedures were performed as described previously (29Radziwill G. Erdmann R.A. Margelisch U. Moelling K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4663-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with some modifications. COS-1 cells (4 × 106) were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and grown for 48 h prior to the assay. Transfected cells were lysed in 1× Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and the precleared total cell lysates were then incubated with indicated GST fusion proteins for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, the precleared cell lysates were incubated with antibodies for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, followed by addition of protein G- or A-conjugated agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Purification of Bacterially Expressed ProteinRecombinant GST fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli DH5α as described previously (20Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To remove GST, thrombin cleavage was performed (16 h, 15 units/mg) at 4 °C. Benzamidine-Sepharose 6B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions to remove the thrombin. Purified proteins were then concentrated in 1× Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl) using Centricon filters (Mr cutoff = 10,000; Millipore Corp.). The concentration of purified protein was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and visually estimated by SDS-PAGE. Determination of Rac-GTP Levels and GAP Activity AssayA pulldown assay was performed to identify Rac-GTP levels in vivo by binding to the p21-binding domain (PBD) of Pak1. Rac-GTP levels were measured as described (22Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GAP activity was determined using a RhoGAP assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 100 pmol of GST-BcrGAP fusion proteins was added to an assay mixture containing Rac1 and GTP or together with ≥25 pmol of RhoGDIα protein. After 20 min at 37 °C, developing reagent was added, and phosphate production was measured at 650 nm. In Vitro Affinity Binding AssayThe in vitro binding assay was performed as described previously (31Olabishi O. Mahon G.M. Kostenko E.V. Liu Z. Ozer H.L. Whitehead I. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6250-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Using a 1:1 molar ratio of each protein, bacterially purified GST-BcrGAP (≥100 pmol) and RhoGDIα (≥100 pmol) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Igepal (Nonidet P-40), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Subsequently, 50 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione beads was added, followed by incubation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Igepal (Nonidet P-40) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin; pelleted; and separated by SDS-PAGE. GTP loading of Rac was done as described previously (18Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, ≥25 pmol of Rac1 or V12Rac1 was incubated in 50 μl of GTP loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4.7 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm GTP) for 5 min at 30 °C. Additional proteins in 450 μl of binding buffer were added, and complexes were allowed to form for 2 h in total. To evaluate the effect of V12Rac1 on the Bcr/RhoGDI interaction, BcrGAP and RhoGDI were incubated together for 1 h, after which incubation was continued for an additional 1 h in the presence of added V12Rac1. Bound RhoGDIα was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RhoGDI antibodies. For other experiments, GST-AbrGAP or GST-BcrGAP(R1090A) was also used instead of GST-BcrGAP. Bcr Forms a Complex with RhoGDIα in Mammalian CellsTo investigate the mechanism by which RhoGDI inhibits the GAP activity of Bcr, we cotransfected COS-1 cells with constructs encoding full-length Bcr and RhoGDIα to test whether these proteins interact in vivo. As shown in Fig. 1A, in lysates of such cells, complexes that had been immunoprecipitated with antibodies against RhoGDIα contained Bcr protein, and conversely, RhoGDIα was detected in immunoprecipitates generated with anti-Bcr antibodies. Notably, we were also able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Bcr with RhoGDIα in human endothelial cells, demonstrating that this interaction takes place when these proteins are present at normal concentrations (Fig. 1B). These results show that Bcr can physically and stably interact with RhoGDIα in mammalian cells in vivo. Bcr Binds to RhoGDIα through Its GAP DomainBcr was originally identified as part of a Bcr-Abl fusion protein, which is responsible for the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (32Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 2002; 56: 8536-8540Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two most common types of Bcr-Abl fusion proteins, p190 and p210, differ in the exact Bcr moiety, with p190 including only the domain of Bcr that encodes the serine/threonine kinase. The domain structures of p190, p210, and the highly related Abr protein in relation to that of Bcr is shown in Fig. 2A. To investigate whether RhoGDIα can bind to these three Bcr-related proteins, we cotransfected GST-tagged p190, p210, or Abr with RhoGDIα. As shown in Fig. 2B, neither p190 nor p210 was present in RhoGDIα immunoprecipitates. However, the GST-tagged full-length Abr protein did form a complex with RhoGDI (Fig. 2B). Bcr contains a domain encoding a serine/threonine kinase and its N-terminal oligomerization domain that mediates the formation of complexes with Bcr-Abl, a deregulated tyrosine kinase. RhoGDIα contains multiple serine/threonine residues as well as tyrosine residues, and phosphorylation of these residues is known to be important for its regulation. We therefore considered the possibility that the interaction between Bcr and RhoGDIα leads to phosphorylation of RhoGDIα. We performed immunocomplex kinase assays with precipitated Bcr, Bcr-Abl, or Bcr plus Bcr-Abl in the presence of GST or GST-RhoGDIα. However, although Bcr and Bcr-Abl clearly autophosphorylated under these conditions, no phosphorylation of RhoGDIα was detected (supplemental Fig. 1). As the Bcr-Abl proteins (containing the N-terminal end of Bcr) did not show binding to RhoGDIα, we assayed a Bcr construct including only the C-terminal GAP domain for RhoGDIα binding. As shown in Fig. 3A, the GAP domain was readily co-immunoprecipitated with RhoGDIα, and conversely, immunoprecipitation of the Bcr GAP domain also brought down RhoGDIα. We investigated whether the interaction between these proteins is direct or indirect using an in vitro binding assay with bacterially expressed GST-BcrGAP and RhoGDIα. As shown in Fig. 3B, the GST-BcrGAP fusion protein specifically bound with bacterially expressed RhoGDIα in vitro, showing that this complex can form directly without involvement of other molecules. A similar result was obtained with the Abr GAP domain (Fig. 3C). Bcr Binds to the C-terminal End of RhoGDIα%RhoGDIα consists of two structurally distinct regions. The N-terminal region binds to the switch regions of the small GTPase, whereas the C-terminal region provides a binding site for its isoprenylated tail (3Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Bcr binds to one or both of the domains, an N-terminal fragment including residues 2–67 (Xpress-RhoGDI-NT) and a C-terminal fragment (Xpress-RhoGDI-CT; residues 68–204) were cotransfected with BcrGAP. As shown in Fig. 3D, the C-terminal fragment of RhoGDIα showed a strong interaction with Bcr, whereas the N-terminal fragment of RhoGDIα exhibited no significant binding. Thus, the C-terminal end of RhoGDIα is sufficient to mediate the binding to Bcr. RhoGDIα Inhibits the GAP Activity of Bcr in Vivo and in VitroHancock and Hall (25Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that, in vitro, Bcr is unable to act as a GAP toward prenylated Rac-GTP when RhoGDI is present. They suggested that under their experimental conditions, RhoGDI and fully processed Rac-GTP form a stable complex that precludes GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. To examine this in vivo, we investigated the level of active Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) in COS-1 cells transfected with RhoGDIα and BcrGAP. As shown in Fig. 4A, the levels of activated Rac1 were decreased by transfection of the Bcr GAP domain compared with a vector control. The presence of RhoGDIα significantly blocked its GAP activity in vivo. Hancock and Hall (25Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that when they loaded Rac protein extracted from the aqueous fraction of a cell lysate with GTP, RhoGDI was unable to block BcrGAP-promoted GTP hydrolysis in vitro. Unmodified, bacterially expressed Rac protein shows very weak affinity for RhoGDI (33Newcombe A.R. Stockley R.W. Hunter J.L. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6879-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but lack of prenylation does not impair the binding of Rac to the Bcr GAP domain (34Molnar G. Dagher M.C. Geiszt M. Settleman J. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a bacterially expressed Rac protein and tested BcrGAP activity in the absence or presence of RhoGDI. As shown in Fig. 4B, Bcr was active as a GAP on GTP-loaded, bacterially expressed Rac1 in vitro. However, we found that RhoGDIα specifically inhibited this activity. A similar result was obtained with RhoGDIβ (data not shown). The inhibition of BcrGAP activity was RhoGDI dose-dependent (Fig. 4B). RhoGDIα and Rac1 Share a Common Binding Region in the Bcr GAP DomainBecause both Bcr and RhoGDIα can bind Rac1 (5Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the presence of Rac1 affects the interaction of Bcr with RhoGDIα. We made use of wild-type Rac1 as well as N17Rac1, which is locked in a GDP-bound conformation, and V12Rac1, which is permanently in a GTP-bound conformation. Interestingly, the interaction between BcrGAP and RhoGDIα was decreased in the presence of V12Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) (Fig. 5A). In the presence of N17Rac1 or wild-type Rac1, the interaction of Bcr and RhoGDIα was similar to that of cells transfected only with Bcr and RhoGDIα (Fig. 5A), indicating that Rac in its GDP-bound state neither stimulates nor impedes the BcrGAP-RhoGDIα binding. We have previously described Bcr derivatives that contain point mutations in the GAP domain (22Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Of these, the Bcr(R1090A) mutant (with a mutation in the catalytic Arg residue of the Arg finger region) binds to Rac-GTP but has no GAP activity, whereas the Bcr(R1090A/N1202A) mutant retains partial ability (∼30% of the wild-type) to hydrolyze the GTP bound to Rac (22Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bcr(R1090A) was completely unable to interact with RhoGDIα in cell lysates, whereas Bcr(R1090A/N1202A) bound to RhoGDIα equally well as the wild-type Bcr GAP domain (Fig. 5B). Inhibition of Bcr/RhoGDI Interaction by Bcr/Rac-GTP InteractionThese results suggest that when Bcr is bound to Rac-GTP, the interaction of Bcr with RhoGDIα is inhibited. To examine such interactions in the absence or presence of Rac, we made use of purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 6A, the complex formation between BcrGAP and RhoGDIα was decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon addition of increasing amounts of GTP-loaded Rac1. We also preincubated BcrGAP with RhoGDIα and then added V12Rac1. The amount of RhoGDIα pulled down with BcrGAP was decreased by ∼50% compared with the interaction of BcrGAP with RhoGDIα in the absence of V12Rac1 (Fig. 6B). When BcrGAP was first incubated with V12Rac1 and then RhoGDIα was subsequently added, the amount of RhoGDIα interacting with BcrGAP was even further reduced (Fig. 6B). We also purified bacterially expressed BcrGAP(R1090A) protein. Although this mutant did not bind to RhoGDIα in vivo (Fig. 5B), in vitro (when not bound to Rac-GTP), it was able to form a complex with RhoGDI (Fig. 6C, first lane). The interaction between these two proteins was reduced by addition of Rac-GTP (Fig. 6C, fourth lane). Bcr Does Not Interfere with the Binding of RhoGDIα to Rac-GDPWe next examined whether the binding of Bcr to RhoGDIα affects the interaction of RhoGDIα with Rac-GDP. In COS-1 cell lysates (supplemental Fig. 2), there was no significant change in the binding of RhoGDIα to Rac1 in the presence or absence of Bcr. Because most of the Rac within the cell is in a GDP-bound conformation, this experiment does not support the idea that Bcr inhibits the binding of RhoGDIα to GDP-bound Rac. To further investigate this, we performed a pulldown of purified GST-BcrGAP in the presence of RhoGDIα and Rac-GDP and examined whether any Rac-GDP was present in the complex. As shown in Fig. 6D, GDP-loaded Rac was brought down with the Bcr-RhoGDIα complex. This result suggests that Bcr forms a ternary complex with Rac-GDP via RhoGDIα as schematically depicted in supplemental Fig. 3. Hancock and Hall (25Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that, in vitro, RhoGDI blocks the GAP activity of Bcr toward Rac. Interestingly, this effect was seen only when prenylated Rac isolated from the membrane fraction was used and not with cytoplasmic (presumed unprocessed) Rac. Chuang et al. (18Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that RhoGDI also blocks CDC42HsGAP- and p190RhoGAP-stimulated Rac1-GTP hydrolysis. Hart et al. (8Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) similarly showed that bovine brain GDI inhibits the Cdc42GAP and BcrGAP activities on Cdc42, and this was also reported by Sasaki et al. (9Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for RhoGDI and RhoGAP activities on Rac1. The proposed mechanism for these effects was a competition between RhoGDI and the GAP for the overlapping binding site on Rac1 or Cdc42: RhoGDI has multiple contact points with mature Rac proteins, including the switch I and II regions as well as the isoprenylated C-terminal end (35Lian L.Y. Barsukov I. Golovanov A.P. Hawkins D.I. Badii R. Sze K.H. Keep N.H. Bokoch G.M. Roberts G.C. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 15: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and GAPs also contact the switch I and II regions (36Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). If the model suggested by Hancock and Hall were correct, bacterially expressed (non-prenylated) Rac-GTP would lack affinity for RhoGDI and would be efficiently converted to Rac-GDP by Bcr. In contrast to their results, we found that RhoGDI was able to prevent non-prenylated Rac-GTP conversion to Rac-GDP by the Bcr GAP domain. The discrepancy between their and our results could possibly be explained by the different source of Rac: Hancock and Hall used Rac extracted from the aqueous phase of COS-1 cell lysates, the exact modifications of which are unclear, whereas we used bacterially expressed Rac, which is known to be non-processed. Interestingly, Sasaki et al. (9Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that RhoGDI binds 10 times more weakly to Rac-GTP than to Rac-GDP. Based on this and our own results, we therefore considered an alternative mechanism for the inhibitory effect of RhoGDI on BcrGAP activity. Because we found that RhoGDI can directly bind to the GAP domain of Bcr both in vitro and in vivo, we propose that the interaction serves to physically block the entry of Rac-GTP into the Bcr GAP domain, thus preventing GAP activity. Our combined results strongly support a model in which RhoGDIα can bind only to the Bcr GAP domain when that domain is not occupied by GTP-bound Rac. Based on this, it is possible that one of the functions of the Bcr/RhoGDI interaction is to deliver newly converted Rac-GDP from its binding spot in the Bcr GAP domain to RhoGDI (supplemental Fig. 3). Because the conversion of Rac-GTP to Rac-GDP is expected to significantly diminish the affinity of the GAP domain for Rac, the binding of Rac-GDP to Bcr is expected to be extremely transient and difficult to detect. Indeed, we have not been able to immunoprecipitate Bcr with N17Rac1. 5S.-M. Kweon, Y. J. Cho, J. Groffen, and N. Heisterkamp, unpublished data. However, the finding of a trimolecular complex in vitro consisting of BcrGAP, RhoGDIα, and Rac-GDP supports this model. A second function of the binding of RhoGDIα to the Bcr GAP domain is to inhibit further uptake of Rac-GTP by the Bcr GAP domain. RhoGDIα thus represents the first protein identified that directly regulates the GAP activity of Bcr. A similar mechanism is likely to apply to the regulation of Abr because its GAP domain shares 80% amino acid sequence identity with the Bcr GAP domain, and we showed that it also binds to RhoGDI in cell lysates or as purified protein. We also observed that RhoGDIβ, a RhoGDI that is expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells (4Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 37Guillemot J.C. Kruskal B.A. Adra C.N. Zhu S. Ko J.L. Burch P. Nocka K. Seetoo K. Simons E. Lim B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2722-2731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds to BcrGAP in transfected COS-1 cells. This result suggests that the GAP activity of Bcr and Abr may be regulated in many cell types by RhoGDI proteins. It will be of interest to see whether this mechanism applies to other RhoGAP proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1992657457,"We have previously shown that increased and deregulated estrogen receptor α expression in the mammary gland leads to the development of proliferative disease and cancer. To address the importance of cyclin D1 in ERα-mediated mammary tumorigenesis, we crossed ERα-overexpressing mice with cyclin D1 knockout mice. Mammary gland morphogenesis was completely interrupted in the ERα-overexpressing cyclin D1-deficient triple transgenic mice. In addition to a highly significant reduction in mammary epithelial cell proliferation, cyclin E was upregulated resulting in DNA damage checkpoint activation and apoptosis. This imbalance between proliferative and apoptotic rates in conjunction with remarkable structural defects and cellular disorganization in the terminal end buds interrupted ductal morphogenesis. Interestingly, the structure of the mammary fat pad was fundamentally altered by the consequences of overexpressing ERα in the epithelial cells in the absence of cyclin D1 illustrating how alterations in the epithelial compartment can impact surrounding stromal composition. Transplantation of embryonic ERα-overexpressing and cyclin D1-deficient mammary epithelium into the cleared fat pad of wild-type mice did not rescue the aberrant mammary gland phenotype indicating that it was intrinsic to the mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion, although cyclin D1 is not essential for proliferation of normal mammary epithelial cells, ERα-overexpressing cells are absolutely dependent on cyclin D1 for proliferation. This differential requirement for cyclin D1 in normal vs abnormal mammary epithelial cells supports the application of cyclin D1 inhibitors as therapeutic interventions in ERα-overexpressing breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2012802518,"Background After the first two cases of locally-acquired HIV infection were recognized in Chuuk State, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), a public health response was initiated. The purpose of the response was to assess the need for HIV education and prevention services, to develop recommendations for controlling further spread of HIV in Chuuk, and to initiate some of the prevention measures. Methodology/Principal Findings A public health team conducted a survey and rapid HIV testing among a sample of residents on the outer islands in Chuuk. Local public health officials conducted contact tracing and testing of sex partners of the two locally-acquired cases of HIV infection. A total of 333 persons completed the survey. The majority knew that HIV is transmitted through unprotected sexual contact (81%), injection drug use (61%), or blood transfusion (64%). Sexual activity in the past 12 months was reported among 159 participants, including 90 females and 69 males. Compared to women, men were more likely to have had multiple sex partners, to have been drunk during sex, but less likely to have used a condom in the past 12 months. The two men with locally acquired HIV infection had unprotected anal sex with a third Chuukese man who likely contracted HIV while outside of Chuuk. All 370 persons who received voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing had HIV negative test results. Conclusions/Significance Despite the low HIV seroprevalence, risky sexual behaviors in this small isolated population raise concerns about the potential for rapid spread of HIV. The lack of knowledge about risks, along with stigmatizing attitudes towards persons infected with HIV and high risk sexual behaviors indicate the need for resources to be directed toward HIV prevention in Chuuk and on other Pacific Islands."
https://openalex.org/W1972128301,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 minus strand transfer was measured using a genomic donor-acceptor template system in vitro. Donor RNA D199, having the minimum region required for minus strong stop DNA synthesis, was previously shown to transfer with 35% efficiency to an acceptor RNA representing the 3′ repeat region. Donor D520, having an additional 321-nucleotide segment extending into gag, transferred at 75% efficiency. In this study each transfer step was analyzed to account for the difference. Measurement of terminal transfer indicated that the 3′ terminus of the cDNA generated using D520 is more accessible for transfer than that of D199. Nevertheless, acceptor competition experiments demonstrated that D520 has a greater preference for invasion-driven versus terminal transfer than D199. Competition mapping showed that the base of the transactivation response element is the primary invasion site for D520, important for efficient acceptor invasion. Acceptors complementary to the invasion and terminal transfer sites, but not the region between, allowed assessment of the significance of hybrid propagation by branch migration. These bipartite acceptors showed that with D520, invasion raises the local concentration of the acceptor for efficient terminal transfer by a proximity effect. However, with D199, invasion is relatively inefficient, and the cDNA 3′ terminus is not very accessible. For most transfers that occurred, the acceptor accessed the cDNA 3′ end by branch migration. Results suggest that both proximity and branch migration mechanisms contribute to transfers, with the proportion determined by donor-cDNA structure. D520 transfers better because it has greater accessibility for both invasion and terminus transfer.

Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). Reverse transcription, in which the genomic RNA is turned into a double-stranded DNA, is catalyzed by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT). RT possesses DNA polymerase activity that synthesizes DNA using either DNA or RNA as a template. RT also has RNase H activity, which cleaves the RNA within a DNA-RNA hybrid (3Baltimore D. Nature. 1970; 226: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 4Temin H.M. Mizutani S. Nature. 1970; 226: 1211-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). In HIV-1, reverse transcription is initiated by a tRNALys-3 primer annealed to the primer binding site (PBS). Synthesis to the 5′ end of the genome generates a minus strand strong stop DNA. RT-associated RNase H activity cleaves the copied region simultaneously. A 97-nt direct repeat (R) sequence is present at both ends of the genome, and allows the minus strand strong stop DNA to transfer from the 5′ end to the 3′ end of the genome via sequence complementarity. This step is termed minus strand strong stop transfer (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase.

Minus strand transfer involves shifting of the cDNA being synthesized from the initial RNA template, or donor, to the homologous region on another RNA template, or acceptor, and then continuing synthesis (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 49-83Google Scholar, 2Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). Two possible mechanisms were proposed. In the first, the strand would shift through a terminal transfer pathway (5Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The polymerase and RNase H active sites on the RT are separated spatially by a distance equivalent to 18 nucleotides on the template RNA (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X.

Consequently, when cDNA synthesis on the donor RNA is complete, the 3′ end of the cDNA is still annealed to the short segment of RNA. A slower RNase H function, called secondary cleavage, cuts this segment into fragments small enough to dissociate from the cDNA (8DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A.

The cDNA 3′ terminus would then transfer to the acceptor RNA (5Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Instead, influenced by secondary structure, RT would pause synthesis 50–100 nucleotides from the donor 5′ end. There RT RNase H activity would clear a small gap that allows the acceptor RNA to invade and anneal to the cDNA (17Purohit V. Balakrishnan M. Kim B. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40534-40543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the RT continues extension of the cDNA, the acceptor-cDNA hybrid would propagate, displacing donor RNA oligomers remaining from RT RNase H cleavage. Eventually, the 3′ end of the cDNA would switch from donor to acceptor in a region favorable for transfer completion (14Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The acceptor invasion is proposed to be triggered by RT pausing at one or two strong pause sites on the donor, leading to a clustering of cuts (18Gao L. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The R homology region is important for minus strand transfer, which has been shown to occur in vitro through either a terminal transfer pathway when the homology between donor and acceptor was short or through the more efficient invasiondriven pathway when homology was long (6Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P.

However, results in vivo suggest that the length of homology is not the only requirement for efficient transfer. Deletion or mutational studies demonstrated that strong stop transfer in viral replication could occur with only a portion of the R region (23Lobel L.I. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ramsey C.A. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4114-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Klaver B. Berkhout B.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8324-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The R region in mouse mammary tumor virus is only 12 nucleotides long, suggesting an efficient terminal transfer pathway (29Coffin J.M. Fields B.N. Virology. Ravon Press, New York1990: 1437-1500Google Scholar). The complex effect of R region on transfer was revealed by additional studies in vitro. Levin and co-workers (30Heilman-Miller S.L. Wu T. Levin J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44154-44165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported that truncating the R region of the acceptor actually led to efficient transfer. The explanation was that removal of secondary structures facilitated transfer. In some cases, the local secondary structure rather than the overall conformation of acceptor is more of a determinant of minus strand transfer efficiency (31Wu T. Heilman-Miller S.L. Levin J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3974-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Considered together, the results suggest the length, structure, and sequence of the R region are all important factors in the transfer reaction. Besides RT, the nucleocapsid protein (NC) is another important component of the viral replication system (32Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 33Cristofari G. Darlix J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 80: 217-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). NC is a nucleic acid chaperone. It coats the RNA genome and delivers it into the assembling virion (35Gorelick R.J. Chabot D.J.

Virol. 1990; 64: 3207-3211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In minus strand transfer, NC transiently destabilizes the secondary structure of substrates, alleviating RT pausing and facilitating the annealing of complementary regions between cDNA and acceptor (37Guo J. Wu T. Anderson J. Kane B.F. Johnson D.G. Gorelick R.J. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8980-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 38Guo J. Wu T. Kane B.F. Johnson D.G.

As a result, the transfer reaction is greatly stimulated by NC (32Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 33Cristofari G. Darlix J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Berkhout and co-workers (46Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 47Ooms M. Verhoef K. Southern E. Huthoff H. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have examined the folding of the HIV-1 5′-untranslated region. Two alternative structures, branched multiple-hairpin and long-distance interaction were proposed by comparing the properties of RNAs sharing the same R homology. The proportion of each structure is influenced by sequences outside of R (46Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 47Ooms M. Verhoef K. Southern E. Huthoff H. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Presumably, each structure produces different patterns of RT pausing and RNase H cleavage, which could influence transfer. For the acceptor template, secondary structure predictions by mFold (48Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 11-43Google Scholar, 49Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar) indicated the R region of the acceptor could form altered structures as varied lengths of U3 were attached, leading to different transfer efficiencies. This result suggests the structure and stability of the R region of the acceptor could also be influenced by regions outside of those directly involved in the base pairing associated with the long-transfer (30Heilman-Miller S.L. Wu T. Levin J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44154-44165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription in HIV-1 is initiated by a tRNALys-3 primer. Marquet and co-workers (50Brule F. Bec G. Keith G. Le Grice S.F. Roques B.P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a long-distance interaction between the anticodon stem of tRNALys-3 and a conserved nonanucleotide motif located in the U3 region greatly promoted minus strand transfer. This is another way that sequences outside of the region required for synthesis could be significant determinants of transfer. We initially analyzed minus strand transfer in vitro using two donor templates. Donor RNA D199 was a 199-nt segment extending from the primer binding site to the 5′ end of the genome; donor D520 was identical to D199 with an additional 321-nt segment extending into gag. They both shared 97 nt of homology with the acceptor A97h. Significantly, at 200% NC coating, the transfer efficiency of D520 with A97h was ∼75%, 2-fold greater than the ∼35% observed with D199. We found that both systems performed at least some transfer through an invasion-driven pathway. We attributed more effective transfer with D520 to the transient folding of the donor template during synthesis and its effect on the pausing of RT, which in turn determines the RNase H cleavage that creates the invasion site (16Song M. Balakrishnan M. Chen Y. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24227-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the current study, to understand why D520 promoted more efficient transfer than D199, we dissected and analyzed each step involved in the transfer reaction.

Transfer AssayThe PBS DNA primer (5′-GTC CCT GTT CGG GCG CCA-3′) was radiolabeled at the 5′ end as described previously for primer extension assays (16Song M. Balakrishnan M. Chen Y. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24227-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Primer was heat-annealed to donor RNA by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. Acceptor templates were then added and incubated with 200% NC (100% NC = 7 nt/NC) at 37 °C for 5 min. In the transfer assays with only one acceptor, which was either A97h, A19h, A97h(30A), or A97h(30R), the ratio of donor:acceptor:primer was 1:3:1.5. In the competition transfer assay with both A97h and dA19h (Fig. 3), the ratio of donor:A97h:dA19h:primer was 1:3:3:1.5. In the transfer assay to map the invasion site via competition between A97h and one of the truncated DNA acceptors, which was either dA19h, dA26h, dA35h, dA45h, dA59h, dA70h, or dA80h (Fig. 4), the ratio of donor:A97h:truncated DNA acceptor:primer was 1:3:9: 1.5. RT was preincubated with substrates at 37 °C for 5 min before the initiation of reactions by MgCl2 and dNTPs. Transfer reactions were carried out in a final volume of 12.5 μl. The final reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm dNTPs. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped at appropriate time points by adding 1 volume of termination dye (10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide (v/v), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). Products were then resolved by polyacrylamide-urea gels and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software (Version 2.1). Sizes of DNA products were estimated using a 10-bp DNA ladder. Quantifications in Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7 refer to data taken at the latest time point.FIGURE 4Mapping the invasion site. A, schematic of the donor and acceptor templates used. Seven truncated DNA acceptor templates dA19h, dA26h, dA35h, dA45h, dA59h, dA70h, and dA80h, respectively, share 19, 26, 35, 45, 59, 70, and 80 nt of homology with both of the donor templates. They all have the same 11-nt random sequence 5′ of the R region.B, a representative gel showing transfer reactions when both A97h and each of the truncated acceptors were added simultaneously to the reaction. Transfer reactions were sampled at 10, 20, and 30 min. Transfer product generated by A97h (TP-219), by truncated DNA acceptors (TP-210), donor extension product (DE), and self-priming product (SP) are indicated. Lane L, 10-bp DNA ladder. Control reaction (C) is the transfer reaction with only A97h. Schematic of the 5′ end of the donor RNA indicating the region of homology with each truncated acceptor is shown to the right of the gels. C, quantitation of transfer efficiency. Transfer efficiency with A97h (black) and truncated acceptors (gray) was plotted for D520 and D199. Control reaction (C) is the transfer reaction with only A97h. Transfer efficiency for A97h was calculated as 100% × (TP-219)/(DE + TP-219 + TP-210 + SP). Transfer efficiency for truncated DNA acceptors was calculated as 100% × (TP-210)/(DE + TP-219 + TP-210 + SP). Values were averaged from a minimum of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Analysis of transfer reactions with two-homology acceptors. A, schematic of the experimental design. Two-homology acceptors A97h(30A) and A97h(30R) were generated by replacing the 40-nt region between the invasion site (position +59 to +97) and 19-nt terminal transfer site (positions +1 to +19) in A97h with either a segment of 30A residues or 30 nt of random sequence (patterned line). Transfer products including the 30 nt of base substitution are indicated as TP-209, and transfer products without are labeled as TP-219.

https://openalex.org/W1978268933,"The present study describes and documents self-assembly of geometric triangular chiral hexagon crystal like complex organizations (GTCHC) in human pathological tissues.The authors have found this architectural geometric expression at macroscopic and microscopic levels mainly in cancer processes. This study is based essentially on macroscopic and histopathologic analyses of 3000 surgical specimens: 2600 inflammatory lesions and 400 malignant tumours. Geometric complexes identified photographically at macroscopic level were located in the gross surgical specimen, and these areas were carefully dissected. Samples were taken to carry out histologic analysis. Based on the hypothesis of a collision genesis mechanism and because it is difficult to carry out an appropriate methodological observation in biological systems, the authors designed a model base on other dynamic systems to obtain indirect information in which a strong white flash wave light discharge, generated by an electronic device, hits over the lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal pattern. In their experimental model, the authors were able to reproduce and to predict polarity, chirality, helicoid geometry, triangular and hexagonal clusters through electromagnetic sequential collisions. They determined that similar events among constituents of extracelular matrix which drive and produce piezoelectric activity are responsible for the genesis of GTCHC complexes in pathological tissues. This research suggests that molecular crystals represented by triangular chiral hexagons derived from a collision-attraction event against collagen type I fibrils emerge at microscopic and macroscopic scales presenting a lateral assembly of each side of hypertrophy helicoid fibers, that represent energy flow in cooperative hierarchically chiral electromagnetic interaction in pathological tissues and arises as a geometry of the equilibrium in perturbed biological systems. Further interdisciplinary studies must be carried out to reproduce, manipulate and amplify their activity and probably use them as a base to develop new therapeutic strategies in cancer."
