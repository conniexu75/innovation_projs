https://openalex.org/W2026959088,"Aerial infrared-sensor surveys of Kilauea volcano have depicted the areal extent and the relative intensity of abnormal thermal features in the caldera area of the volcano and along its associated rift zones. Many of these anomalies show correlation with visible steaming and reflect convective transfer of heat to the surface from subterranean sources. Structural details of the volcano, some not evident from surface observation, are also delineated by their thermal abnormalities. Several changes were observed in the patterns of infrared emission during the period of study; two such changes show correlation in location with subsequent eruptions, but the cause-and-effect relationship is uncertain."

https://openalex.org/W2050904255,"New spectrometric techniques for the multidimensional counting of gamma rays permit the direct measurement of twelve radionuclides collected on air filters. Observed concentrations of Be(7), Na(22), Mn(54), Co(60), Y(88), Zr(95)-Nb(25), Ru(166), Sb(124), Sb(125), Cs(134), Cs(137), and Ce(144) during the past 2(1/2) years help to explain the origin and fallout rates of the trace radionuclides in air."

https://openalex.org/W2091508397,"A Czechoslovakian tektite or moldavite shows clear, indirect evidence of aerodynamic ablation. This large tektite has the shape of a teartdrop, with a strongly convex, deeply corroded, but clearly identifiable front and a planoconvex,- relatively . smooth, posterior surface. In spite of much erosion and corrosion, demarcation of the posterior and the anterior part of the specimen (the keel) is clearly preserved locally. This specimen provides the first tangible evidence that moldavites entered the atmosphere cold, probably at a velocity exceeding 5 kilometers per second; the restult was selective heating of the anterior face and perhaps ablation during the second melting. This provides evidence of the extraterrestial origin of moldavites."
