However, it has been proposed that they could potentially be outperformed by a nuclear clock, which employs a nuclear transition instead of the atomic shell transitions used so far. By today there is only one nuclear state known which could serve for a nuclear clock using currently available technology, which is the isomeric first excited state in $^{229}$Th. Here we report the direct detection of this nuclear state, which is a further confirmation of the isomer's existence and lays the foundation for precise studies of the isomer's decay parameters. Based on this direct detection the isomeric energy is constrained to lie between 6.3 and 18.3 eV, and the half-life is found to be longer than 60 s for $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th$^{2+}$. More precise determinations appear in reach and will pave the way for the development of a nuclear frequency standard."
https://openalex.org/W2104922910,"We address two main challenges facing systems neuroscience today: understanding the nature and function of cortical feedback between sensory areas and of correlated variability. Starting from the old idea of perception as probabilistic inference, we show how to use knowledge of the psychophysical task to make testable predictions for the influence of feedback signals on early sensory representations. Applying our framework to a two-alternative forced choice task paradigm, we can explain multiple empirical findings that have been hard to account for by the traditional feedforward model of sensory processing, including the task dependence of neural response correlations and the diverging time courses of choice probabilities and psychophysical kernels. Our model makes new predictions and characterizes a component of correlated variability that represents task-related information rather than performance-degrading noise. It demonstrates a normative way to integrate sensory and cognitive components into physiologically testable models of perceptual decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2345513470,"Fatal Ebola virus disease is characterized by a high proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing the inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, correlating with high virus load; individuals who survive the infection exhibit lower expression of these inhibitory molecules and generate Ebola-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that dysregulation of the T cell response is a key component of Ebola virus disease pathophysiology. César Muñoz-Fontela and colleagues have tracked the T cell response in individuals infected with Ebola virus in Guinea. Following patients from the time of their admission at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Guinea until their discharge or death, the authors identify an immune signature that is characteristic of fatal Ebola virus disease. In fatal infection, a high proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressed the inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, correlating with high virus load. By contrast, individuals who survived the infection showed lower expression of these inhibitory molecules, suggesting that dysregulation of the T cell response is a key component of Ebola virus disease pathophysiology. Despite the magnitude of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, there is still a fundamental lack of knowledge about the pathophysiology of EVD1. In particular, very little is known about human immune responses to Ebola virus2,3. Here we evaluate the physiology of the human T cell immune response in EVD patients at the time of admission to the Ebola Treatment Center in Guinea, and longitudinally until discharge or death. Through the use of multiparametric flow cytometry established by the European Mobile Laboratory in the field, we identify an immune signature that is unique in EVD fatalities. Fatal EVD was characterized by a high percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing the inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, which correlated with elevated inflammatory markers and high virus load. Conversely, surviving individuals showed significantly lower expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 as well as lower inflammation, despite comparable overall T cell activation. Concomitant with virus clearance, survivors mounted a robust Ebola-virus-specific T cell response. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of the T cell response is a key component of EVD pathophysiology."

The neural computations underlying the selection of a particular behavior, such as escape or approach, require flexibility to balance potential costs and benefits for survival. For example, avoiding novel visual objects reduces predation risk but negatively affects foraging success. Zebrafish larvae approach small, moving objects (“prey”) and avoid large, looming objects (“predators”). We found that this binary classification of objects by size is strongly influenced by feeding state. Hunger shifts behavioral decisions from avoidance to approach and recruits additional prey-responsive neurons in the tectum, the main visual processing center. Both behavior and tectal function are modulated by signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and the serotonergic system.

Our study has revealed a neuroendocrine mechanism that modulates the perception of food and the willingness to take risks in foraging decisions. Animals constantly face choices influencing their well-being and survival. Decision making has emerged as a central theme in neuroeconomics and neuroethology (Kristan, 2008Kristan Jr., W.B. Neuronal decision-making circuits.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R928-R932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Pearson et al., 2014Pearson J.M. Watson K.K. Platt M.L. Decision making: the neuroethological turn.Neuron. 2014; 82: 950-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The notion that animals base their decisions solely on the absolute values of the alternatives has been challenged by concepts originally derived from behavioral economics (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979Kahneman D. Tversky A. Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk.Econometrica. 1979; 47: 263-291Crossref Google Scholar, Symmonds et al., 2010Symmonds M. Emmanuel J.J. Drew M.E. Batterham R.L. Dolan R.J. Metabolic state alters economic decision making under risk in humans.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For example, in order to survive, animals need to escape from threats and move toward food sources. Clearly, escape versus approach decisions need to be flexible and to consider the costs and benefits of their outcome. This is because, in complex environments, animals often face a trade-off between acquiring resources and becoming a resource for others (Lima and Dill, 1990Lima S.L. Dill L.M. Behavioral decisions made under the risk of predation: a review and prospectus.Can. J. Zool. 1990; 68: 619-640Crossref Scopus (6063) Google Scholar). A hungry animal may, therefore, increase its predation risk to avoid starvation. Studies in invertebrates showed that hunger is capable of modulating the processing of sensory inputs and simple behaviors, such as odor- and taste-dependent approaches toward food sources (Bargmann, 2012Bargmann C.I.

Kristan Jr., W.B. Contextual modulation of behavioral choice.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the neural circuits mediating the effects of appetitive states on sensorimotor decision making are still not completely understood. Moreover, the impact of this type of modulation on other sensory modalities, such as vision, and more complex behaviors in vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neural mechanism underlying behavioral responses to ambiguous visual stimuli using the zebrafish, a versatile vertebrate model organism amenable to genetic manipulations and optical probing (Baier and Scott, 2009Baier H. Scott E.K. Genetic and optical targeting of neural circuits and behavior--zebrafish in the spotlight.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our behavioral assay measures the decision of zebrafish larvae to avoid or approach moving objects of various sizes. In a previous study, we established that this decision is biased by stimulus size (Barker and Baier, 2015Barker A.J. Baier H. Sensorimotor decision making in the zebrafish tectum.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2804-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Small black circles, drifting in the visual field below the fish, elicited mostly prey-capture swims, while large black circles reliably evoked escapes. Thus, the pursuit of small but potentially ambiguous stimuli serves as a proxy measure of risk-prone behavior. We now show that this behavior is strongly affected by feeding state. Hungry animals pursued small objects more often than fed fish and escaped less often from larger ones. We further demonstrate, with optical imaging, that starvation results in an expanded representation of small, prey-like objects in the tectum, the homolog of the mammalian superior colliculus. We found that the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and the serotonergic system mediate the effects of hunger on behavior and tectal activity. Our results reveal a modulatory mechanism by which feeding state influences the visual perception of food and the willingness to take risks in foraging decisions. Food items are generally smaller than predators. Therefore, size categorization is an efficient way for an animal to make a quick decision to either pursue or avoid an unknown object (Ewert, 1970Ewert J.-P. Neural mechanisms of prey-catching and avoidance behavior in the toad (Bufo bufo L.).Brain Behav. Evol. 1970; 3: 36-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We used a size-discrimination assay to test the effects of feeding state on visually driven approach versus avoidance decision making in zebrafish larvae (Barker and Baier, 2015Barker A.J. Baier H. Sensorimotor decision making in the zebrafish tectum.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2804-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We used two different metrics to analyze interactions between fish and visual stimuli. The valence index measures the tendency of animals to either approach (positive valence) or avoid (negative valence) visual stimuli, without considering neutral interactions (see formula in Figure 1). When the valence index is zero, larvae pursue or avoid circles with a 50% probability. The activity index, by taking in consideration also neutral interactions, measures the probability of a fish to react to a visual stimulus, with either an approach or avoidance (see formula in Figure 1). Consistent with the earlier study, small circles mainly elicited approaches, often including pursuits, while large circles evoked escapes, consisting of rapid turns away from the stimulus (Movies S1 and S2). Zebrafish embryos use their yolk as an energy reservoir. However, this is depleted by 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), and larvae have to actively search for food to survive (Kimmel et al., 1995Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish.Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8749) Google Scholar). We supplied one group of larvae with food, starting at 6 dpf, while another group was not fed (Figures 1B and 1C). We measured the pH and osmolarity of the medium to rule out alterations of its chemico-physical properties by the addition of food (Table S1). Notably, we found that starved larvae performed more pursuits and fewer escapes in the presence of small circles at 7 dpf, compared to fed controls (Figure 1D). They were also less likely than fed fish to escape from circles of intermediate size (Figure 1E). We interpreted these results as a starvation-driven reduction of aversive behavior. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which, in teleost fish, is called the HPI axis, is a neuroendocrine pathway regulating defensive behaviors in response to threats (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009Ulrich-Lai Y.M. Herman J.P. Neural regulation of endocrine and autonomic stress responses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Its anatomical and molecular features are highly conserved among vertebrates (Alderman and Bernier, 2009Alderman S.L. Bernier N.J. Ontogeny of the corticotropin-releasing factor system in zebrafish.Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2009; 164: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Löhr and Hammerschmidt, 2011Löhr H. Hammerschmidt M. Zebrafish in endocrine systems: recent advances and implications for human disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2011; 73: 183-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), including the peptides corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the glucocorticoid cortisol (Figure 2A). Binding of cortisol to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) mediates negative feedback on CRH and ACTH production (Ziv et al., 2013Ziv L. Muto A. Schoonheim P.J. Meijsing S.H. Strasser D. Ingraham H.A. Schaaf M.J.M. Yamamoto K.R. Baier H. An affective disorder in zebrafish with mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor.Mol. Psychiatry. 2013; 18: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the reduction of aversive behavior in starved zebrafish could be mediated by reduced activity of the HPI axis induced by lack of food intake. For this reason, we measured the amount of cortisol in starved and fed larvae. Remarkably, we observed a strong reduction of cortisol levels in starved animals, compared to satiated ones (Figure 2B). This result argues that HPI axis activity is inversely correlated with the animal’s energy needs. In order to test the link between HPI axis activation and regulation of visual behavior, we took advantage of a mutant with elevated HPI axis activity. In grs357/s357 homozygous mutants (Ziv et al., 2013Ziv L. Muto A. Schoonheim P.J. Meijsing S.H. Strasser D. Ingraham H.A. Schaaf M.J.M. Yamamoto K.R. Baier H. An affective disorder in zebrafish with mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor.Mol. Psychiatry. 2013; 18: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), a missense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the GR abolishes transcriptional activity of this protein and, consequently, eliminates the cortisol-mediated negative feedback on the HPI axis (Figure 2A). As a consequence, grs357/s357 homozygous fish show a chronically elevated HPI axis, including higher concentrations of CRH, ACTH, and cortisol (Griffiths et al., 2012Griffiths B.B. Schoonheim P.J. Ziv L. Voelker L. Baier H. Gahtan E. A zebrafish model of glucocorticoid resistance shows serotonergic modulation of the stress response.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Ziv et al., 2013Ziv L. Muto A. Schoonheim P.J. Meijsing S.H. Strasser D. Ingraham H.A. Schaaf M.J.M. Yamamoto K.R. Baier H. An affective disorder in zebrafish with mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor.Mol. Psychiatry. 2013; 18: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As predicted, increasing the activity of the HPI axis mimicked the effect of feeding on behavioral performance in the size-discrimination assay. Mutant larvae assigned a more negative valence to small visual stimuli, pursuing them less or avoiding them more than control starved animals (Figures 2C and 2D; Tables S2A and S2B). Moreover, the effect of food intake on behavior performance was occluded in mutant fish (Figures 2C and 2D), suggesting that the HPI axis regulates behavioral choice downstream of, and not parallel to, metabolic signals. Since the HPA axis is a well-known regulator of the serotonergic system (Fox and Lowry, 2013Fox J.H. Lowry C.A. Corticotropin-releasing factor-related peptides, serotonergic systems, and emotional behavior.Front. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that serotonin could modulate behavioral choice. First, we measured the activity of serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus, a known target of the HPI axis (Fox and Lowry, 2013Fox J.H. Lowry C.A. Corticotropin-releasing factor-related peptides, serotonergic systems, and emotional behavior.Front. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), of fed and starved 7 dpf tph2:Gal4ff, UAS:GFP larvae, in which serotonergic neurons are labeled with GFP (Yokogawa et al., 2012Yokogawa T. Hannan M.C. Burgess H.A. The dorsal raphe modulates sensory responsiveness during arousal in zebrafish.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 15205-15215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We used immunofluorescence detection of phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (pERK) as a time-averaged readout of neuronal activity (Figures 3A–3C). ERK is phosphorylated following neuronal depolarization (Rosen et al., 1994Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Membrane depolarization and calcium influx stimulate MEK and MAP kinase via activation of Ras.Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), and the amount of pERK in a neuron is positively correlated with neuronal activity (Randlett et al., 2015Randlett O. Wee C.L. Naumann E.A. Nnaemeka O. Schoppik D. Fitzgerald J.E. Portugues R. Lacoste A.M.B. Riegler C. Engert F. Schier A.F. Whole-brain activity mapping onto a zebrafish brain atlas.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the cell bodies of raphe serotonergic neurons contained higher amounts of pERK in starved than fed larvae (Figure 3D), suggesting that hunger increases the activity of these neurons. To test whether serotonin could modulate behavioral choice downstream of satiety signals, we analyzed the behavior of larvae treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Increasing serotonergic transmission in fed fish, by applying 1.5 μM fluoxetine for 4 to 5 hr, was sufficient to abolish the effect of food intake on behavioral performance (Figures 3E and 3F; Tables S2C and S2D). In a complementary set of experiments, we ablated serotonergic neurons with the enzyme nitroreductase (NTR) in tph2:Gal4ff, UAS:ntr-mCherry fish. NTR converts the innocuous drug metronidazole (MTZ) to its toxic form, killing the cells expressing the enzyme (Pisharath et al., 2007Pisharath H. Rhee J.M. Swanson M.A. Leach S.D. Parsons M.J. Targeted ablation of beta cells in the embryonic zebrafish pancreas using E. coli nitroreductase.Mech. Dev. 2007; 124: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Hungry larvae lacking serotonergic neurons behaved similarly to fed fish, assigning more negative valence to small visual stimuli, compared to hungry controls with an intact serotonergic system (Figure 3G). Ablation of serotonergic neurons did not alter the behavior of fed animals (Figure S1A), showing that the effects of the two manipulations were not additive and suggesting that satiety signals and serotonergic transmission are components of the same modulatory pathway. We did not observe differences in avoidance performance for circles of intermediate size (Figures 3H and S1B), possibly due to the involvement of some of the ablated serotonergic neurons in regulating general responsiveness of fish to visual stimuli. Together, these results suggest that the serotonergic system acts downstream of metabolic signals to modulate behavioral choice. Next, we investigated the impact of feeding state on neural circuits processing sensory stimuli. We focused our attention on the tectum, the main visual area in the fish brain (Nevin et al., 2010Nevin L.M. Robles E. Baier H. Scott E.K. Focusing on optic tectum circuitry through the lens of genetics.BMC Biol. 2010; 8: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, the tectum is required for hunting behavior (Gahtan et al., 2005Gahtan E. Tanger P. Baier H. Visual prey capture in larval zebrafish is controlled by identified reticulospinal neurons downstream of the tectum.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9294-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and avoidance of looming visual stimuli (Temizer et al., 2015Temizer I. Donovan J.C. Baier H. Semmelhack J.L. A visual pathway for looming-evoked escape in larval zebrafish.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 1823-1834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is anatomically subdivided into a neuropil region, containing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and neurites of periventricular neurons (PVNs), as well as a periventricular layer (PVL), containing the cell bodies of PVNs (Figure 4A). We used two-photon calcium imaging to analyze the effect of feeding state on the size selectivity of PVNs in the tectum of 7 dpf elavl3:Gal4, UAS:GCaMP5 fish, expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5 in the majority of neurons (Figures 4A and 4B). By showing moving black circles to the fish, we observed that tectal PVNs were tuned to a variety of visual stimulus sizes (Figure 4C), confirming previous studies (Barker and Baier, 2015Barker A.J. Baier H. Sensorimotor decision making in the zebrafish tectum.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2804-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Niell and Smith, 2005Niell C.M.

Biol. 2014; 24: 2376-2385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In order to derive a metric to describe the tuning of each PVN to different stimulus sizes, we determined the weighted mean response (WMR) angle by calculating the weighted sums of visual stimulus sizes to which Ca2+ responses were non-zero, with weights corresponding to the relative ΔF/F values for each response (Figure 4D; Experimental Procedures). In this way, we could plot the size tuning of the entire tectal PVN population in the form of a cumulative distribution (Figure 4E). Remarkably, feeding state strongly influenced the visual size response properties of tectal neurons. The PVN population response of starved larvae was significantly shifted toward small, prey-like, visual stimuli, compared to the response of fed fish (Figure 4E). Control experiments showed that food odor alone was not responsible for the altered neural responses (Figure 4F). Next, we tested whether hunger modulates neuronal activity in the tectum presynaptically at the level of RGC axons or postsynaptically on PVNs. Pixel-wise analysis of calcium signals in the tectal neuropil of 7 dpf Isl2b:Gal4, UAS:GCaMP6s larvae did not reveal macroscopic changes in the activity of RGC presynaptic terminals (Figures 5A–5C; Figure S2). These data demonstrate that hunger can have a strong impact on visual processing of food-related cues in the tectal circuitry downstream of RGCs. The elavl3:Gal4 driver line includes in its expression pattern most neurons regardless of function, morphology, or transmitter identity. To gain more insight into the tectal network components regulated by feeding state, we analyzed the activity of genetically labeled neuron subtypes. First, we used 7 dpf gad1b:Gal4, UAS:GCaMP6s larvae to monitor the visual response properties of GABAergic cells (Figure 6A). We found that starvation induced a shift of GABAergic responses toward small, prey-like, visual stimuli (Figure 6B), suggesting that activity of GABAergic neurons is modulated by hunger. We asked whether other types of tectal neurons were also modulated by feeding state. The gene-trap line Gal4mpn354 drives expression of Gal4 in a small subpopulation of non-stratified PVNs, most of which are glutamatergic (Barker and Baier, 2015Barker A.J. Baier H. Sensorimotor decision making in the zebrafish tectum.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2804-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Figure 6C). Previous work strongly suggested that the activity of these neurons enhances approach behavior toward small visual stimuli (Barker and Baier, 2015Barker A.J. Baier H. Sensorimotor decision making in the zebrafish tectum.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2804-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We found that starvation increased the number of Gal4mpn354 PVNs tuned to small visual stimuli (Figures 6D and S3), suggesting that this subpopulation may be involved in adapting visual processing of prey-like cues and behavioral choice to the fish’s energy needs. We did not detect any effect of feeding state on a subpopulation of PVNs labeled in the enhancer-trap line Gal4s1038t (Figures 6E and 6F). Interestingly, previous work had shown that these neurons were not involved in behavioral choice when fish were presented with small visual stimuli (Barker and Baier, 2015Barker A.J. Baier H. Sensorimotor decision making in the zebrafish tectum.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2804-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point to a modulatory effect of hunger on tectal GABAergic neurons and, in addition, show that a genetically defined population of neurons regulating approach behavior is also under control of metabolic signals. To test whether feeding state modulates processing of small visual stimuli in the tectum and behavioral choice through shared mechanisms, we first analyzed visual size response properties of PVNs in elavl3:Gal4, UAS:GCaMP5, grs357/s357 and control elavl3:Gal4, UAS:GCaMP5, gr+/+ larvae. Similarly to fed larvae, and consistent with their behavioral phenotype, grs357/s357 fish showed a shift of the PVN population response toward larger visual stimuli (Figure 7A). Next, encouraged by the observation that the tectal neuropil is densely innervated by serotonergic neurites (Yokogawa et al., 2012Yokogawa T. Hannan M.C. Burgess H.A. The dorsal raphe modulates sensory responsiveness during arousal in zebrafish.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 15205-15215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Figures 7B–7D), we investigated whether serotonin could alter size representation in the tectum. We found that indeed, in a manner similar to its effect on behavior, the application of 1.5 μM fluoxetine abolished the effect of food intake on PVN responses (Figure 7E). These results suggest that reduced HPI axis activity and enhanced serotonergic transmission promote the starvation-induced shift of PVN responses toward small visual stimuli. Hunger may change the population responses of tectal neurons in three ways: (1) tuning of individual neurons could change from large to small size preference, (2) additional neurons tuned to small sizes might be activated, or (3) neurons normally responsive to large sizes might be suppressed. We designed an experiment to distinguish between these possibilities, taking advantage of the fact that fluoxetine induces a starvation-like population response shift in the tectum of fed larvae. We first imaged visual responses of PVNs in fed 7 dpf elavl3:Gal4, UAS:GCaMP5 larvae. We then applied 1.5 μM fluoxetine (or only fish water as a control) and recorded the activity of the same neurons again 3.5–4 hr later (Figures 8A and 8B ). We found that some neurons were active during both imaging sessions (“persistent”). However other neurons were active only before (“lost”) or after (“gained”) drug application (Figures 8A–8C). While the percentages of persistent neurons were similar in fluoxetine-treated fish and controls, the relative amounts of lost and gained neurons differed (Figure 8C). In control fish, there was a larger number of lost PVNs. In contrast, in fluoxetine-treated larvae, there were more gained PVNs. While the loss of active neurons in control larvae may be the consequence of stress caused by prolonged restraint of the fish in agarose, the presence of newly responsive neurons after fluoxetine application points to the activation of new populations of neurons that were silent in untreated, fed animals. Next, we investigated whether the “gained” population contained a larger proportion of cells responsive to small visual stimuli compared to the “lost” population. This was, indeed, the case (Figure 8D), suggesting a net gain of neurons tuned to small stimuli. Control larvae showed the opposite, although not statistically significant, trend. We also found that fluoxetine did not change the tuning properties of persistent neurons (Figures 8E and S4). These data suggest a model in which serotonin mediates the effects of starvation on tectal function by activating PVNs tuned to small stimuli, with no significant alterations of size tuning in individual neurons. We found that food-deprived zebrafish larvae displayed a stronger preference for small and intermediately sized stimuli, representing potentially edible items, than fed animals. These results cannot be interpreted as a simple decrease in interest of a fed larva for food-like items or a shift of the size preference since, in these cases, we should have observed an overall decrease of activity in response to small stimuli. The altered (more negative) values of the valence index point instead to a shift in behavioral choice, from escape to approach, in hungry animals. We interpret these findings in the framework of risk taking and decision making; feeding state appears to control the propensity to take risks in foraging-related decisions. On the other hand, we observed a decrease of behavioral responses when starved larvae encountered medium-sized (10°) circles (reduced avoidance, as revealed by a lower activity index and unchanged valence index in Figures 1D and 1E). This difference likely highlights the presence of multiple behavioral components that are modulated by feeding state. 10° circles are too large to be considered as food (Semmelhack et al., 2014Semmelhack J.L.

A dedicated visual pathway for prey detection in larval zebrafish.eLife. 2014; 3: e04878Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and may be at the threshold of what is considered as a potential threat. These results may, therefore, indicate that hunger reduces predator vigilance, since escapes are energetically costly (Bednekoff, 2007Bednekoff P.A. Allocation of foraging efforts when danger varies over time.in: Stephens D.W. Brown J.S. Ydenberg R.C. Foraging. The University of Chicago Press, 2007: 305-329Google Scholar). These two types of modulation are likely evolutionary adaptations allowing fine-tuning of the animal’s foraging strategy in response to a variable supply of food resources in the environment. We showed that starvation decreases aversive behavior by inhibiting the HPI axis. Fed fish have higher levels of cortisol, and a genetic mutation enhancing HPI axis activity is sufficient to mimic the effect of food intake on behavioral choice. Our results are compatible with studies in rodents showing that both rewarding and aversive stimuli are able to activate the HPA axis (Koolhaas et al., 2011Koolhaas J.M. Bartolomucci A.

Despite extensive research, the speed and mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis have remained controversial. Here, we establish low-noise time-resolved membrane capacitance measurements that allow monitoring changes in surface membrane area elicited by single action potentials and stronger stimuli with high-temporal resolution at physiological temperature in individual bona-fide mature central synapses. We show that single action potentials trigger very rapid endocytosis, retrieving presynaptic membrane with a time constant of 470 ms. This fast endocytosis is independent of clathrin but mediated by dynamin and actin. In contrast, stronger stimuli evoke a slower mode of endocytosis that is clathrin, dynamin, and actin dependent. Furthermore, the speed of endocytosis is highly temperature dependent with a Q10 of ∼3.5. These results demonstrate that distinct molecular modes of endocytosis with markedly different kinetics operate at central synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2346475996,"Conservationists often have difficulty obtaining financial and social support for protected areas that do not demonstrate their benefits for society. Therefore, ecosystem services have gained importance in conservation science in the last decade, as these services provide further justification for appropriate management and conservation of natural systems. We used InVEST software and a set of GIS procedures to quantify, spatialize and evaluated the overlap between ecosystem services—carbon stock and sediment retention—and a biodiversity proxy–habitat quality. In addition, we proposed a method that serves as an initial approach of a priority areas selection process. The method considers the synergism between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Our study region is the Iron Quadrangle, an important Brazilian mining province and a conservation priority area located in the interface of two biodiversity hotspots, the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. The resultant priority area for the maintenance of the highest values of ecosystem services and habitat quality was about 13% of the study area. Among those priority areas, 30% are already within established strictly protected areas, and 12% are in sustainable use protected areas. Following the transparent and highly replicable method we proposed in this study, conservation planners can better determine which areas fulfill multiple goals and can locate the trade-offs in the landscape. We also gave a step towards the improvement of the habitat quality model with a topography parameter. In areas of very rugged topography, we have to consider geomorfometric barriers for anthropogenic impacts and for species movement and we must think beyond the linear distances. Moreover, we used a model that considers the tree mortality caused by edge effects in the estimation of carbon stock. We found low spatial congruence among the modeled services, mostly because of the pattern of sediment retention distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2346324644,"The evolutionary success of beetles and numerous other terrestrial insects is generally attributed to co-radiation with flowering plants but most studies have focused on herbivorous or pollinating insects. Non-herbivores represent a significant proportion of beetle diversity yet potential factors that influence their diversification have been largely unexamined. In the present study, we examine the factors driving diversification within the Scarabaeidae, a speciose beetle family with a range of both herbivorous and non-herbivorous ecologies. In particular, it has been long debated whether the key event in the evolution of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) was an adaptation to feeding on dinosaur or mammalian dung. Here we present molecular evidence to show that the origin of dung beetles occurred in the middle of the Cretaceous, likely in association with dinosaur dung, but more surprisingly the timing is consistent with the rise of the angiosperms. We hypothesize that the switch in dinosaur diet to incorporate more nutritious and less fibrous angiosperm foliage provided a palatable dung source that ultimately created a new niche for diversification. Given the well-accepted mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, we examine a potential co-extinction of dung beetles due to the loss of an important evolutionary resource, i.e., dinosaur dung. The biogeography of dung beetles is also examined to explore the previously proposed “out of Africa” hypothesis. Given the inferred age of Scarabaeinae as originating in the Lower Cretaceous, the major radiation of dung feeders prior to the Cenomanian, and the early divergence of both African and Gondwanan lineages, we hypothesise that that faunal exchange between Africa and Gondwanaland occurred during the earliest evolution of the Scarabaeinae. Therefore we propose that both Gondwanan vicariance and dispersal of African lineages is responsible for present day distribution of scarabaeine dung beetles and provide examples."
https://openalex.org/W2341869960,"We present a model for neural circuit mechanisms underlying hippocampal memory. Central to this model are nonlinear interactions between anatomically and functionally segregated inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal cells in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1. We study the consequences of such interactions using model neurons in which somatic burst-firing and synaptic plasticity are controlled by conjunctive processing of these separately integrated input pathways. We find that nonlinear dendritic input processing enhances the model's capacity to store and retrieve large numbers of similar memories. During memory encoding, CA3 stores heavily decorrelated engrams to prevent interference between similar memories, while CA1 pairs these engrams with information-rich memory representations that will later provide meaningful output signals during memory recall. While maintaining mathematical tractability, this model brings theoretical study of memory operations closer to the hippocampal circuit's anatomical and physiological properties, thus providing a framework for future experimental and theoretical study of hippocampal function."

Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat within the HD gene, encoding an expanded stretch of polyglutamines in the Huntingtin (HTT) protein (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research GroupA novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington’s disease chromosomes.Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7052) Google Scholar).

Additionally, small ubiquitin modifier protein (SUMO) modification itself can function as a secondary signal affecting ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome (UPS) (Praefcke et al., 2012Praefcke G.J. Hofmann K. Dohmen R.J. SUMO playing tag with ubiquitin.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SUMOylation is the covalent attachment of SUMO to target proteins. Although a transient modification, SUMOylation has long-lasting effects, including the regulation of subcellular localization, protein stability and clearance, chromatin remodeling, and interaction properties of modified proteins (Cubeñas-Potts and Matunis, 2013Cubeñas-Potts C. Matunis M.J. SUMO: a multifaceted modifier of chromatin structure and function.Dev.

The SUMO pathway: emerging mechanisms that shape specificity, conjugation and recognition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Four different forms, SUMO-1 through SUMO-4, exist. The SUMOylation pathway involves a cascade of enzymes, with an E1-activating enzyme (SAE1/UBA2), an E2-conjugating enzyme (UBC9), and multiple E3-ligating enzymes (protein inhibitors of activated STAT [PIAS], PC2, MMS21, and RanBP2), which provide substrate specificity. The diversity of SUMO substrates is governed by a relatively small number of SUMO E3 ligases. SUMO modification can occur on the same lysine residue as ubiquitination with extensive crosstalk in regulating cellular protein clearance. More recently, the importance of the SUMO modification system in brain has emerged, given the number of neurotransmitters and receptors that are regulated by SUMOylation (Sen and Snyder, 2010Sen N. Snyder S.H. Protein modifications involved in neurotransmitter and gasotransmitter signaling.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Further, SUMO proteins are implicated in a growing number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyglutamine repeat diseases, and transient cerebral ischemia, as well as HD (Hickey et al., 2008Hickey M.A. Kosmalska A.

We previously showed that SUMO-1/-2-modified proteins accumulate in an insoluble protein fraction from human HD postmortem striatum and that SUMO isoforms can regulate the formation and accumulation of this insoluble HTT species in cells (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G.

Both wild-type HTT and mHTT are SUMO-1 and -2 modified within the amino terminal 17 amino acids and at downstream sites within the full-length protein (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G. Gareau J.R.

Modulation of the SUMO network in vivo to investigate functional consequences in HD-related systems can be either through SUMO itself, which would be anticipated to have an overly broad impact and potentially deleterious effects, or through more selective means, such as regulation of a relevant SUMO E3 ligase. Five major PIAS isoforms are expressed in mammals and can act as adaptor proteins that bridge the SUMO-conjugated E2 enzyme and the substrate in the SUMOylation cascade as well as act as ligases. The PIAS proteins themselves were characterized originally by their ability to regulate transcription, immune responses, and cytokine signaling (Liu and Shuai, 2008Liu B. Shuai K.

Cell. 2009; 35: 731-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that PIAS1 can selectively enhance HTT modification by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 and regulate the formation of insoluble high-molecular-weight (HMW) HTT species, suggesting that PIAS1 might influence pathogenesis in HD. Further, genetic reduction of the single dPIAS in mHTT-expressing Drosophila is protective (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G. Gareau J.R. Ochaba J. Song W. Raskó T. Reverter D. Lee J. Monteys A.M. Pallos J. Mee L. et al.SUMO-2 and PIAS1 modulate insoluble mutant huntingtin protein accumulation.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 362-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given the ability of PIAS1 to enhance SUMO modification of HTT and regulate mHTT accumulation in cell models, we hypothesized that reduction of PIAS1 in HD striata might confer neuroprotection. Using viral delivery of a mouse PIAS1-targeting artificial microRNA (miRNA) to the HD-modeled R6/2 mouse striatum, which shows progressive accumulation of HMW mHTT protein, PIAS1 reduction significantly prevented HD-associated phenotypes and accumulation of insoluble mHTT. Strikingly, PIAS1 ameliorated disease-associated increases in apparent microglial activation and dysregulation of relevant proinflammatory cytokines. Conversely PIAS1 overexpression exacerbated disease phenotypes and the accumulation/aggregation profile. These results suggest that PIAS1 may link protein homeostasis, neuroinflammation, and disease symptomatology by modulating the formation of toxic forms of accumulated mHTT. To investigate the relationship between mHTT accumulation and functional outcomes and determine whether PIAS1 contributes to this network in vivo, we used acute instrastriatal knockdown or overexpression of PIAS1 in an mHTT-expressing mouse model. PIAS1 protein is expressed in most tissues including brain; therefore we confined knockdown to the brain. Our studies utilized R6/2 transgenic mice based on their relatively rapid progression, the formation of detergent-insoluble aggregated species of HTT that increase with disease progression, and inflammatory responses that are reminiscent of symptomatic human HD (Chang et al., 2015Chang K.H.

These mice express the first exon of human HTT (CAG repeat of ∼125), and they show reproducible and rapidly progressing motor and metabolic symptoms at 6 weeks of age and eventually develop tremors, lack of coordination, excessive weight loss, and early death (∼12 weeks) (Mangiarini et al., 1996Mangiarini L.

A series of mouse PIAS1-directed artificial miRNAs was tested and miPIAS1.3 was selected based on optimal knockdown in NIH 3T3 cells (Figures S1A and S1B, related to Figure 1). Striata of mice were bilaterally injected with rAAV2/1miPIAS1.3-CMVeGFP (miPIAS1.3) or rAAV2/1-mU6miSAFE-CMVeGFP (miSAFE) (mismatch control) for knockdown studies and rAAV2/2-CMVPIAS1 (PIAS1) or rAAV2/2-CMVeGFP (eGFP) (viral control) for overexpression studies at 5 weeks of age. For knockdown studies, mice were sacrificed at 10 weeks. PIAS1 overexpression mice were sacrificed at 9 weeks due to the declining health of mice.

PIAS1 protein levels were evaluated to determine whether modulation was achieved in treated mice following viral injections. We previously showed that PIAS1 is primarily in the detergent-insoluble fraction, similar to HMW HTT and modified proteins (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G. Gareau J.R. Ochaba J. Song W. Raskó T.

The detergent-soluble fraction contains mainly cytoplasmic proteins, such as GAPDH, monomeric forms of HTT (including the R6/2 mHTT fragment encoding human transgene), endogenous mouse full-length HTT, and soluble oligomeric species of HTT, which do not fully resolve on standard PAGE gels (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G.

Huntingtons Dis. 2012; 1: 119-132Google Scholar; Figure S2, related to Figure 3). In contrast, the detergent-insoluble fraction contains primarily nuclear proteins, including Histone H3 (Figure S2, related to Figure 3), HMW HTT species (likely multimers or potentially insoluble oligomers and fibrils), and accumulated forms of SUMO- and ubiquitin-modified proteins. Levels of PIAS1, primarily a nuclear protein, were monitored in striatal tissues from 10-week-old R6/2 and non-transgenic (NT) mice. In the soluble fraction, PIAS1 levels were slightly higher in NT animals by western analysis (Figure S3A, related to Figure 1); however, PIAS1 protein levels were significantly elevated in the insoluble, nuclear fraction from R6/2 mice (Figure S3A, related to Figure 1). In miPIAS1.3-treated R6/2 mice, insoluble PIAS1 levels in the striatum were markedly reduced, as indicated by decreased protein expression at 5 weeks post-injection relative to miSAFE-treated R6/2 mice (Figure 1C). While there was a significant decrease in levels of soluble PIAS1 in NT mice with miPIAS1.3 injection, there was little to no impact on soluble PIAS1 levels in R6/2 mice (Figure S3B, related to Figure 1). Given the already high levels of PIAS1 in R6/2 mice, miPIAS1.3 miRNA produced a relatively greater apparent degree of knockdown compared to NT mice. As a control for off-target viral effects, we found that, apart from eGFP expression, vehicle-treated (formulation buffer 18) mice did not differ biochemically nor behaviorally from miSAFE-treated mice (Figures S4A–S4C, related to Figure 2). Given the relatively low levels of insoluble PIAS1 in NT mice, miPIAS1.3 miRNA produced a relatively smaller apparent degree of knockdown compared to R6/2 mice; therefore, no statistically significant decrease in PIAS1 levels was detected following miPIAS1.3 treatment in NT mice (Figure 1C). However, knockdown was observed in RNA from both R6/2 and NT mouse striata (Figure S5, related to Figure 1). For overexpression studies, virus-expressing PIAS1 bilaterally injected into R6/2 mouse striata resulted in a significant increase in insoluble PIAS1 levels 4 weeks post-injection (Figure 1D); a significant reduction in soluble PIAS1 levels was found in NT mice, but not in R6/2 mice (Figure S3B, related to Figure 1). R6/2 mice show progressive weight loss, abnormal hind limb posture/splayed limbs when held by the tail (clasping) (Mangiarini et al., 1996Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A.

Bull. 2007; 72: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether altering PIAS1 levels in vivo had an effect on these R6/2 phenotypes, we injected rAAV that either knocked down or overexpressed PIAS1 into the striatum of 5-week-old mice and then monitored their body weight and ability to perform a series of behavioral tasks (Figure 2A). R6/2 mice begin losing weight and show a decline in behavioral tests at 6 weeks (Mangiarini et al., 1996Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Exon 1 of the HD gene with an expanded CAG repeat is sufficient to cause a progressive neurological phenotype in transgenic mice.Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar) and our results were consistent with those findings. No treatment effect on weight was observed for either PIAS1 knockdown or overexpression (Figures S6A and S6B, related to Figure 2). Reduction of endogenous levels of PIAS1 in R6/2 mice caused a significant improvement in Rotarod performance compared to miSAFE-injected mice at 7 weeks (Figure 2B), but deficits reappeared at 9 weeks (Figure S7, related to Figure 2). In the pole test task there was no effect observed with miPIAS-treated R6/2 mice at 6 weeks; however, by 8 weeks of age, they exhibited a complete rescue in deficits observed compared to miSAFE-treated R6/2 mice that was comparable to NT mice (Figure 2C). When grip strength was measured, R6/2 mice injected with miPIAS1.3 had no treatment effect at 6.5 weeks, but they had a significant and almost complete rescue effect by 8 weeks compared to miSAFE-treated R6/2 mice (Figure 2D). Finally, miPIAS1.3 delayed the onset of clasping in R6/2 mice relative to miSAFE-treated R6/2 mice (Figure 2E), which persisted up to the 9-week end point. CAG repeat length variability did not account for the behavioral improvement, as repeat lengths assessed in a subset of animals (tail and striatal tissue) were within a tight range of 122–132 CAGs across animals with variation between individual animal tail samples and striatal tissue within one to two CAG repeats. Next we injected the striatum of NT and R6/2 mice with AAV expressing either eGFP (as the control) or PIAS1 and performed complementary behavioral analyses as above. At 7 weeks, R6/2 mice overexpressing PIAS1 were not significantly different in Rotarod performance when compared to eGFP-injected R6/2 controls (Figure 2F). R6/2 mice overexpressing PIAS1 demonstrated significantly impaired pole test descending times compared with eGFP-treated R6/2 mice as early as 6 weeks of age (Figure 2G, descending time), with deficits disappearing at 8 weeks. For grip strength, R6/2 mice overexpressing PIAS1 were significantly weaker than eGFP-injected mice at 8 weeks for grip strength task (Figure 2H). PIAS1 exacerbated the onset of clasping in R6/2 mice relative to eGFP-treated mice (Figure 2I). To determine whether PIAS1 modulation altered longevity in R6/2 mice, we evaluated survival in a small cohort (n = 5 for each condition) and found that PIAS1 knockdown significantly increased survival when compared to control, whereas PIAS1 overexpression HD mice had no significant effect (Figure S8A, related to Figure 2). Observational screens were performed weekly to rapidly assess general health, body weight, posture, appearance of the fur, neurological reflexes, home cage activity levels, and reactions to handling as designated by a multi-component Irwin Assessment Scale (Irwin, 1968Irwin S. Comprehensive observational assessment: Ia. A systematic, quantitative procedure for assessing the behavioral and physiologic state of the mouse.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1968; 13: 222-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Of these parameters, modulation of PIAS1 appeared to show an effect on three physiological assessments as follows: spontaneous activity, piloerection, and gait. Specifically, PIAS1 knockdown delayed the onset of abnormal spontaneous activity (Figure S8B, related to Figure 2), piloerection (Figure S8C, related to Figure 2), and gait impairments (Figure S8D, related to Figure 2), relative to miSAFE and PIAS1 overexpression-treated R6/2 mice. PIAS1 overexpression mice also exhibited earlier onset of abnormal physiological characteristics, such as abnormal piloerection and gait impairments (Figures S8B and S8C, related to Figure 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PIAS1 knockdown significantly improves neurological phenotypes of R6/2 mice and that this effect is selective, given exacerbation of some phenotypes following PIAS1 overexpression. Interestingly, there were no significant differences across the battery of behavior assessments when comparing treatment effects on NT mice for either PIAS1 miRNA or cDNA delivery, supporting a selective role for PIAS1 in the disease setting. Given that HMW mHTT species and SUMO-1- and -2/-3-modified proteins accumulate in HD brain and that PIAS1 regulates accumulation of mHTT and SUMO-modified proteins in cells (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G. Gareau J.R. Ochaba J. Song W. Raskó T. Reverter D. Lee J. Monteys A.M. Pallos J. Mee L. et al.SUMO-2 and PIAS1 modulate insoluble mutant huntingtin protein accumulation.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 362-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we investigated the impact of PIAS1 modulation on insoluble mHTT accumulation and protein homeostasis in vivo. The detergent-insoluble fraction of R6/2 striatum plus and minus PIAS1 knockdown (mPIAS1.3 treatment) was analyzed for the presence of insoluble accumulated mHTT. Similar to our previous findings in cells, PIAS1 knockdown decreased insoluble HTT accumulation by ∼60% in R6/2 mouse striatum (Figures 3A and 3B ) compared to R6/2 treated with control virus (miSAFE). Further, this reduction in mHTT accumulation was due to PIAS1 knockdown and not to a decrease in mHTT transgene expression, as no differences in soluble mHTT transgene expression or HTT mRNA expression by RT-PCR between miPIAS1.3-treated mice compared to miSAFE-treated mice were observed (Figure S5, related to Figure 3). We previously showed PIAS1 could modulate levels of SUMO-modified proteins in cells (O’Rourke et al., 2013O’Rourke J.G. Gareau J.R. Ochaba J. Song W. Raskó T. Reverter D. Lee J. Monteys A.M.

The physical and chemical properties of biochars varied significantly based on the pyrolysis temperatures. Analysis of the data revealed that the aromaticity, polarity, specific surface area, pH, and ash content of the biochars increased gradually with the increase in pyrolysis temperature, while the cation exchange capacity, and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen contents decreased. The adsorption kinetics of CR and MB were described by pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Both of Langmuir and Temkin model could be employed to describe the adsorption behaviors of CR and MB by these biochars. The biochars generated at higher pyrolysis temperature displayed higher CR adsorption capacities and lower MB adsorption capacities than those compared with the biochars generated at lower pyrolysis temperatures. The biochar generated at the higher pyrolytic temperature displayed the higher ability to adsorb CR owing to its promoted aromaticity, and the cation exchange is the key factor that positively affects adsorption of MB."
https://openalex.org/W2346121524,"Introduction Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is becoming a popular method for optical biopsy of digestive mucosa for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Computer aided diagnosis of CLE images, using image processing and fractal analysis can be used to quantify the histological structures in the CLE generated images. The aim of this study is to develop an automatic diagnosis algorithm of colorectal cancer (CRC), based on fractal analysis and neural network modeling of the CLE-generated colon mucosa images. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed a series of 1035 artifact-free endomicroscopy images, obtained during CLE examinations from normal mucosa (356 images) and tumor regions (679 images). The images were processed using a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) medical imaging system in order to obtain an automatic diagnosis. The CAD application includes image reading and processing functions, a module for fractal analysis, grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) computation module, and a feature identification module based on the Marching Squares and linear interpolation methods. A two-layer neural network was trained to automatically interpret the imaging data and diagnose the pathological samples based on the fractal dimension and the characteristic features of the biological tissues. Results Normal colon mucosa is characterized by regular polyhedral crypt structures whereas malignant colon mucosa is characterized by irregular and interrupted crypts, which can be diagnosed by CAD. For this purpose, seven geometric parameters were defined for each image: fractal dimension, lacunarity, contrast correlation, energy, homogeneity, and feature number. Of the seven parameters only contrast, homogeneity and feature number were significantly different between normal and cancer samples. Next, a two-layer feed forward neural network was used to train and automatically diagnose the malignant samples, based on the seven parameters tested. The neural network operations were cross-entropy with the results: training: 0.53, validation: 1.17, testing: 1.17, and percent error, resulting: training: 16.14, validation: 17.42, testing: 15.48. The diagnosis accuracy error was 15.5%. Conclusions Computed aided diagnosis via fractal analysis of glandular structures can complement the traditional histological and minimally invasive imaging methods. A larger dataset from colorectal and other pathologies should be used to further validate the diagnostic power of the method."
https://openalex.org/W2345996515,"Introduction Chronic exposure to stress has been shown to impact a wide range of health-related outcomes in older adults. Despite extensive animal literature revealing deleterious effects of biological markers of stress on the dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampus, links between hippocampal subfields and psychological stress have not been studied in humans. This study examined the relationship between perceived stress and hippocampal subfield volumes among racially/ethnically diverse older adults. Methods and Materials Between July 2011 and March 2014, 116 nondemented participants were consecutively drawn from the Einstein Aging Study, an ongoing community-based sample of individuals over the age of 70 residing in Bronx, New York. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, and underwent 3.0 T MRI. FreeSurfer was used to derive total hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfield volumes (CA1, CA2/CA3, CA4/Dentate Gyrus (CA4/DG), and subiculum), entorhinal cortex volume, whole brain volume, and total intracranial volume. Results Linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of perceived stress were associated with smaller total hippocampal volume (β = -0.20, t = -2.40, p = 0.02), smaller CA2/CA3 volumes (β = -0.18, t = -2.24, p = 0.03) and smaller CA4/DG volumes (β = -0.19, t = -2.28, p = 0.03) after controlling for total intracranial volume, age, gender, and race. These findings remained unchanged after removal of individuals with clinically significant symptoms of depression. Discussion Our findings provide evidence of a relationship between a direct indicator of psychological stress and specific hippocampal subfield volumes in elderly individuals. These results highlight the importance of clinical screening for chronic stress in otherwise healthy older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2347064349,"Previous studies have suggested a positive link between serum uric acid (UA) and bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we re-examined the association between UA and BMD and further explored whether this was mediated by skeletal muscle mass in a general Chinese population.This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 3079 (963 men and 2116 women) Chinese adults aged 40-75 years. Face-to-face interviews and laboratory analyses were performed to determine serum UA and various covariates. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess the BMD and appendicular skeletal muscle mass. The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI = ASM/Height(2), kg/m(2)) for the total limbs, arms, and legs was then calculated.The serum UA was graded and, in general, was significantly and positively associated with the BMD and muscle mass, after adjustment for multiple covariates in the total sample. Compared with participants in lowest quartile of UA, those participants in highest quartile showed a 2.3%(whole body), 4.1%(lumbar spine), 2.4%(total hip), and 2.0% (femoral neck) greater BMDs. The mean SMIs in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile increased by 2.7% (total), 2.5% (arm), 2.7% (leg) respectively. In addition, path analysis suggested that the favorable association between UA and BMD might be mediated by increasing SMI.The elevated serum UA was associated with a higher BMD and a greater muscle mass in a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population and the UA-BMD association was partly mediated by muscle mass."
https://openalex.org/W2345491277,"Increasing evidence showed that abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are common event in the pathophysiology of many vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. Among the underlying mechanisms, oxidative stress is one of the principal contributors to the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Oxidative stress occurs as a result of persistent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recently, the protective effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) against oxidative stress/ROS in other cell types provide new insights to inhibit the suggests that PPARγ may regulate VSMCs function. However, it remains unclear whether activation of PPARγ can attenuate oxidative stress and further inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of PPARγ on inhibiting VSMC oxidative stress and the capability of proliferation and migration, and the potential role of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in oxidative stress. It was found that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) induced VSMC proliferation and migration as well as ROS production; PPARγ inhibited PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation, migration and oxidative stress; PPARγ activation upregulated UCP2 expression in VSMCs; PPARγ inhibited PDGF-BB-induced ROS in VSMCs by upregulating UCP2 expression; PPARγ ameliorated injury-induced oxidative stress and intimal hyperplasia (IH) in UCP2-dependent manner. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that activation of PPARγ can attenuate ROS and VSMC proliferation and migration by upregulating UCP2 expression, and thus inhibit IH following carotid injury. These findings suggest PPARγ may represent a prospective target for the prevention and treatment of IH-associated vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2345678859,"Unintentional injury is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and mortality due to injury has risen over the past decade. The social determinants behind these rising trends have not been well documented. This study examines the relationship between county-level poverty and unintentional injury mortality in the United States from 1999-2012. Complete annual compressed mortality and population data for 1999-2012 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics and linked with census yearly county poverty measures. The outcomes examined were unintentional injury fatalities, overall and by six specific mechanisms: motor vehicle collisions, falls, accidental discharge of firearms, drowning, exposure to smoke or fire, and unintentional poisoning. Age-adjusted mortality rates and time trends for county poverty categories were calculated, and multivariate negative binomial regression was used to determine changes over time in both the relative risk of living in high poverty concentration areas and the population attributable fraction. Age-adjusted mortality rates for counties with > 20% poverty were 66% higher mortality in 1999 compared with counties with < 5% poverty (45.25 vs. 27.24 per 100,000; 95% CI for rate difference 15.57,20.46), and that gap widened in 2012 to 79% (44.54 vs. 24.93; 95% CI for rate difference 17.13,22.09). The relative risk of living in the highest poverty counties has increased for all injury mechanisms with the exception of accidental discharge of firearms. The population attributable fraction for all unintentional injuries rose from 0.22 (95% CI 0.13,0.30) in 1999 to 0.35 (95% CI 0.22,0.45) in 2012. This is the first study that uses comprehensive mortality data to document the associations between county poverty and injury mortality rates for the entire US population over a 14 year period. This study suggests that injury reduction interventions should focus on areas of high or increasing poverty."
https://openalex.org/W2346424797,"Reports from state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the annual number of reported human vibriosis cases in New England has increased in the past decade. Concurrently, there has been a shift in both the spatial distribution and seasonal detection of Vibrio spp. throughout the region based on limited monitoring data. To determine environmental factors that may underlie these emerging conditions, this study focuses on a long-term database of Vibrio parahaemolyticus concentrations in oyster samples generated from data collected from the Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire over a period of seven consecutive years. Oyster samples from two distinct sites were analyzed for V. parahaemolyticus abundance, noting significant relationships with various biotic and abiotic factors measured during the same period of study. We developed a predictive modeling tool capable of estimating the likelihood of V. parahaemolyticus presence in coastal New Hampshire oysters. Results show that the inclusion of chlorophyll a concentration to an empirical model otherwise employing only temperature and salinity variables, offers improved predictive capability for modeling the likelihood of V. parahaemolyticus in the Great Bay Estuary."
https://openalex.org/W2345921427,"Objectives The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with postoperative delirium in patients undergoing urological surgery. Methods We prospectively evaluated pre- and postoperative risk factors for postoperative delirium in consecutive 215 patients who received urological surgery between August 2013 and November 2014. Preoperative factors included patient demographics, comorbidities, and frailty assessment. Frailty was measured by handgrip strength, fatigue scale of depression, fall risk assessment, and gait speed (the timed Get-up and Go test). Postoperative factors included types of anesthesia, surgical procedure, renal function and serum albumin decline, blood loss, surgery time, highest body temperature, and complications. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess pre- and postoperative predictors for the development of postoperative delirium. Results Median age of this cohort was 67 years. Ten patients (4.7%) experienced postoperative delirium. These patients were significantly older, had weak handgrip strength, a higher fall risk assessment score, slow gait speed, and greater renal function decline compared with patients without delirium. Multivariate analysis revealed slow gait speed (>13.0 s) and rapid renal function decline (>30%) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium. Conclusions Slow gait speed and rapid renal function decline after urological surgery are significant factors for postoperative delirium. These data will be helpful for perioperative patient management. This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN: R000018809."
https://openalex.org/W2347015317,"Women with specific adverse pregnancy outcomes in their first pregnancy may be receptive to inter-pregnancy weight management guidance aimed at preventing these complications reoccurring in subsequent pregnancies. Thus the association between inter-pregnancy weight change and the risk of recurrent pregnancy complications at the second pregnancy was investigated in a retrospective cohort study of 24,520 women with their first-ever and second consecutive deliveries in Aberdeen using logistic regression. Compared with women who were weight stable, weight loss (>2BMI units) between pregnancies was associated with an increased risk of recurrent small for gestational age (SGA) birth and elective Cesarean-section, and was protective against recurrent pre-eclampsia, placental oversize and large for gestational age (LGA) birth. Conversely weight gain (>2BMI units) between pregnancies increased the risk of recurrent gestational hypertension, placental oversize and LGA birth and was protective against recurrent low placental weight and SGA birth. The relationships between weight gain, and placental and birth weight extremes were evident only in women with a healthy weight at first pregnancy (BMI<25units), while that between weight gain and the increased risk of recurrent gestational hypertension was largely independent of first pregnancy BMI. No relationship was detected between inter-pregnancy weight change and the risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm delivery, labour induction, instrumental delivery, emergency Cesarean-section or postpartum hemorrhage. Therefor inter-pregnancy weight change impacts the risk of recurrent hypertensive disorders, SGA and LGA birth and women with a prior history of these specific conditions may benefit from targeted nutritional advice to either lose or gain weight after their first pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2346922416,"A new salamandroid salamander, Qinglongtriton gangouensis (gen. et sp. nov.), is named and described based on 46 fossil specimens of juveniles and adults collected from the Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) Tiaojishan Formation cropping out in Hebei Province, China. The new salamander displays several ontogenetically and taxonomically significant features, most prominently the presence of a toothed palatine, toothed coronoid, and a unique pattern of the hyobranchium in adults. Comparative study of the new salamander with previously known fossil and extant salamandroids sheds new light on the early evolution of the Salamandroidea, the most species-diverse clade in the Urodela. Cladistic analysis places the new salamander as the sister taxon to Beiyanerpeton, and the two taxa together form the basalmost clade within the Salamandroidea. Along with recently reported Beiyanerpeton from the same geological formation in the neighboring Liaoning Province, the discovery of Qinglongtriton indicates that morphological disparity had been underway for the salamandroid clade by early Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) time."
https://openalex.org/W2346788295,"Stereotypies are abnormal repetitive behaviour patterns that are highly prevalent in laboratory mice and are thought to reflect impaired welfare. Thus, they are associated with impaired behavioural inhibition and may also reflect negative affective states. However, in mice the relationship between stereotypies and behavioural inhibition is inconclusive, and reliable measures of affective valence are lacking. Here we used an exploration based task to assess cognitive bias as a measure of affective valence and a two-choice guessing task to assess recurrent perseveration as a measure of impaired behavioural inhibition to test mice with different forms and expression levels of stereotypic behaviour. We trained 44 CD-1 and 40 C57BL/6 female mice to discriminate between positively and negatively cued arms in a radial maze and tested their responses to previously inaccessible ambiguous arms. In CD-1 mice (i) mice with higher stereotypy levels displayed a negative cognitive bias and this was influenced by the form of stereotypy performed, (ii) negative cognitive bias was evident in back-flipping mice, and (iii) no such effect was found in mice displaying bar-mouthing or cage-top twirling. In C57BL/6 mice neither route-tracing nor bar-mouthing was associated with cognitive bias, indicating that in this strain these stereotypies may not reflect negative affective states. Conversely, while we found no relation of stereotypy to recurrent perseveration in CD-1 mice, C57BL/6 mice with higher levels of route-tracing, but not bar-mouthing, made more repetitive responses in the guessing task. Our findings confirm previous research indicating that the implications of stereotypies for animal welfare may strongly depend on the species and strain of animal as well as on the form and expression level of the stereotypy. Furthermore, they indicate that variation in stereotypic behaviour may represent an important source of variation in many animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2341768874,"The mechanisms that constrain memory formation are of special interest because they provide insights into the brain’s memory management systems and potential avenues for correcting cognitive disorders. RNAi knockdown in the Drosophila mushroom body neurons (MBn) of a newly discovered memory suppressor gene, Solute Carrier DmSLC22A, a member of the organic cation transporter family, enhances olfactory memory expression, while overexpression inhibits it. The protein localizes to the dendrites of the MBn, surrounding the presynaptic terminals of cholinergic afferent fibers from projection neurons (Pn). Cell-based expression assays show that this plasma membrane protein transports cholinergic compounds with the highest affinity among several in vitro substrates. Feeding flies choline or inhibiting acetylcholinesterase in Pn enhances memory, an effect blocked by overexpression of the transporter in the MBn. The data argue that DmSLC22A is a memory suppressor protein that limits memory formation by helping to terminate cholinergic neurotransmission at the Pn:MBn synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2346901422,"The hippocampus is critical for the storage of new autobiographical experiences as memories. Following an initial encoding stage in the hippocampus, memories undergo a process of systems-level consolidation, which leads to greater stability through time and an increased reliance on neocortical areas for retrieval. The extent to which the retrieval of these consolidated memories still requires the hippocampus is unclear, as both spared and severely degraded remote memory recall have been reported following post-training hippocampal lesions. One difficulty in definitively addressing the role of the hippocampus in remote memory retrieval is the precision with which the entire volume of the hippocampal region can be inactivated. To address this issue, we used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), a chemical-genetic tool capable of highly specific neuronal manipulation over large volumes of brain tissue. We find that remote (>7 weeks after acquisition), but not recent (1–2 days after acquisition) contextual fear memories can be recalled after injection of the DREADD agonist (CNO) in animals expressing the inhibitory DREADD in the entire hippocampus. Our data demonstrate a time-dependent role of the hippocampus in memory retrieval, supporting the standard model of systems consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2346242299,"GRP78, a member of the ER stress protein family, can relocate to the surface of cancer cells, playing key roles in promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. GRP78 consists of two major functional domains: the ATPase and protein/peptide-binding domains. The protein/peptide-binding domain of cell-surface GRP78 has served as a novel functional receptor for delivering cytotoxic agents (e.g., a apoptosis-inducing peptide or taxol) across the cell membrane. Here, we report our study on the ATPase domain of GRP78 (GRP78ATPase), whose potential as a transmembrane delivery system of cytotoxic agents (e.g., ATP-based nucleotide triphosphate analogs) remains unexploited. As the binding of ligands (ATP analogs) to a receptor (GRP78ATPase) is a pre-requisite for internalization, we determined the binding affinities and modes of GRP78ATPase for ADP, ATP and several ATP analogs using surface plasmon resonance and x-ray crystallography. The tested ATP analogs contain one of the following modifications: the nitrogen at the adenine ring 7-position to a carbon atom (7-deazaATP), the oxygen at the β-γ bridge position to a carbon atom (AMPPCP), or the removal of the 2'-OH group (2'-deoxyATP). We found that 7-deazaATP displays an affinity and a binding mode that resemble those of ATP regardless of magnesium ion (Mg++) concentration, suggesting that GRP78 is tolerant to modifications at the 7-position. By comparison, AMPPCP's binding affinity was lower than ATP and Mg++-dependent, as the removal of Mg++ nearly abolished binding to GRP78ATPase. The AMPPCP-Mg++ structure showed evidence for the critical role of Mg++ in AMPPCP binding affinity, suggesting that while GRP78 is sensitive to modifications at the β-γ bridge position, these can be tolerated in the presence of Mg++. Furthermore, 2'-deoxyATP's binding affinity was significantly lower than those for all other nucleotides tested, even in the presence of Mg++. The 2'-deoxyATP structure showed the conformation of the bound nucleotide flipped out of the active site, explaining the low affinity binding to GRP78 and suggesting that the 2'-OH group is essential for the high affinity binding to GRP78. Together, our results demonstrate that GRP78ATPase possesses nucleotide specificity more relaxed than previously anticipated and can tolerate certain modifications to the nucleobase 7-position and, to a lesser extent, the β-γ bridging atom, thereby providing a possible atomic mechanism underlying the transmembrane transport of the ATP analogs."
https://openalex.org/W2346563030,"Abnormalities in the histo- and ultrastructure of the amniote eggshell are often related to diverse factors, such as ambient stress during egg formation, pathologies altering the physiology of the egg-laying females, or evolutionarily selected modifications of the eggshell structure that vary the physical properties of the egg, for example increasing its strength so as to avoid fracture during incubation. When dealing with fossil materials, all the above hypotheses are plausible, but a detailed taphonomical study has to be performed to rule out the possibility that secondary processes of recrystallization have occurred during fossilization. Traditional analyses, such as optical microscopy inspection and cathodoluminescence, have proven not to be enough to understand the taphonomic story of some eggshells. Recently, electron backscatter diffraction has been used, in combination with other techniques, to better understand the alteration of fossil eggshells. Here we present a combined study using scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence and electron backscatter diffraction of eggshell fragments assigned to Megaloolithus cf. siruguei from the Upper Cretaceous outcrops of the Cameros Basin. We focus our study on the presence of secondary shell units that mimic most aspects of the ultrastructure of the eggshell mammillae, but grow far from the inner surface of the eggshell. We call these structures extra-spherulites, describe their crystal structure and demonstrate their secondary origin. Our study has important implications for the interpretation of secondary shell units as biological or pathological structures. Thus, electron backscatter diffraction complements other microscope techniques as a useful tool for understanding taphonomical alterations in fossil eggshells."

We found (i) that the effects of attaching more weight to longer-term than to momentary happiness and of extending the memory for past happiness are both stronger in an environment where food is scarce; (ii) that in such an environment ""relative consumption,"" in which the agent's well-being is negatively affected by that of its neighbors, is more detrimental to survival when food is scarce; and (iii) that having a positive outlook, under which agents' longer-term happiness is increased by positive events more than it is decreased by negative ones, is generally advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W2347164159,"To investigate the association between priapism in men with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and hemorheological and hemolytical parameters.Fifty-eight men with SCA (median age: 38 years) were included; 28 who had experienced priapism at least once during their life (priapism group) and 30 who never experienced this complication (control group). Twenty-two patients were treated with hydroxycarbamide, 11 in each group. All patients were at steady state at the time of inclusion. Hematological and biochemical parameters were obtained through routine procedures. The Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer was used to measure red blood cell (RBC) deformability at 30 Pa (ektacytometry) and RBC aggregation properties (laser backscatter versus time). Blood viscosity was measured at a shear rate of 225 s-1 using a cone/plate viscometer. A principal component analysis was performed on 4 hemolytic markers (i.e., lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), total bilirubin (BIL) levels and reticulocyte (RET) percentage) to calculate a hemolytic index.Compared to the control group, patients with priapism exhibited higher ASAT (p = 0.01), LDH (p = 0.03), RET (p = 0.03) levels and hemolytic indices (p = 0.02). Higher RBC aggregates strength (p = 0.01) and lower RBC deformability (p = 0.005) were observed in patients with priapism compared to controls. After removing the hydroxycarbamide-treated patients, RBC deformability (p = 0.01) and RBC aggregate strength (p = 0.03) were still different between the two groups, and patients with priapism exhibited significantly higher hemolytic indices (p = 0.01) than controls.Our results confirm that priapism in SCA is associated with higher hemolytic rates and show for the first time that this complication is also associated with higher RBC aggregate strength and lower RBC deformability."
https://openalex.org/W2346523577,"Aberrant expression of cadherins and catenins plays pivotal roles in ovarian cancer development and progression. Plakoglobin (PG, γ-catenin) is a paralog of β-catenin with dual adhesive and signaling functions. While β-catenin has known oncogenic function, PG generally acts as a tumor/metastasis suppressor. We recently showed that PG interacted with p53 and that its growth/metastasis inhibitory function may be mediated by this interaction. Very little is known about the role of PG in ovarian cancer. Here, we investigated the in vitro tumor/metastasis suppressor effects of PG in ovarian cancer cell lines with mutant p53 expression and different cadherin profiles. We showed that the N-cadherin expressing and E-cadherin and PG deficient ES-2 cells were highly migratory and invasive, whereas OV-90 cells that express E-cadherin, PG and very little/no N-cadherin were not. Exogenous expression of PG or E-cadherin or N-cadherin knockdown in ES-2 cells (ES-2-E-cad, ES-2-PG and ES-2-shN-cad) significantly reduced their migration and invasion. Also, PG expression or N-cadherin knockdown significantly decreased ES-2 cells growth. Furthermore, PG interacted with both cadherins and with wild type and mutant p53 in normal ovarian and ES-2-PG cell lines, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2346537289,"Population monitoring is crucial for wildlife management and conservation. In the last few decades, wildlife researchers have increasingly applied bioacoustics tools to obtain information on several essential ecological parameters, such as distribution and abundance. One such application involves wolves (Canis lupus). These canids respond to simulated howls by emitting group vocalizations known as chorus howls. These responses to simulated howls reveal the presence of wolf litters during the breeding period and are therefore often used to determine the status of wolf populations. However, the acoustic structure of chorus howls is complex and discriminating the presence of pups in a chorus is sometimes difficult, even for experienced observers. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of analyses of the acoustic energy distribution in chorus howls to identify the presence of pups in a chorus. We analysed 110 Iberian wolf chorus howls with known pack composition and found that the acoustic energy distribution is concentrated at higher frequencies when there are pups vocalizing. We built predictive models using acoustic energy distribution features to determine the presence of pups in a chorus, concluding that the acoustic energy distribution in chorus howls can be used to determine the presence of wolf pups in a pack. The method we outline here is objective, accurate, easily implemented, and independent of the observer's experience. These advantages are especially relevant in the case of broad scale surveys or when many observers are involved. Furthermore, the analysis of the acoustic energy distribution can be implemented for monitoring other social canids that emit chorus howls such as jackals or coyotes, provides an easy way to obtain information on ecological parameters such as reproductive success, and could be useful to study other group vocalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2345842520,"The cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), is a key regulator of neuroinflammation linked to numerous neurodegenerative conditions and diseases. The present study used transgenic rats that overexpress a murine TNFα gene, under the control of its own promoter, to investigate the impact of chronically elevated TNFα on hippocampal synaptic function. Neuronal viability and cognitive recovery in TNFα Tg rats were also determined following an ischemic insult arising from reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Basal CA3-CA1 synaptic strength, recorded in acute brain slices, was not significantly different between eight-week-old TNFα Tg rats and non-Tg rats. In contrast, slices from TNFα Tg rats showed significantly greater levels of long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to 100 Hz stimulation, suggesting that synaptic networks may be hyperexcitable in the context of elevated TNFα. Cognitive and motor deficits (assessed on the Morris Water Maze and Rotarod task, respectively) were present in TNFα Tg rats in the absence of significant differences in the loss of cortical and hippocampal neurons. TNF overexpression exacerbated MCAO-dependent deficits on the rotarod, but ameliorated cortical neuron loss in response to MCAO."
https://openalex.org/W2345765067,"Major efforts for malaria prevention programs have gone into scaling up ownership and use of insecticidal mosquito nets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where the malaria burden is high. Socioeconomic inequities in access to long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are reduced with free distributions of nets. However, the relationship between social factors and retention of nets after a free distribution has been less studied, particularly using a longitudinal approach. Our research aimed to estimate the ownership and use of LLINs, and examine the determinants of LLIN retention, within an Indigenous Batwa population after a free LLIN distribution. Two LLINs were given free of charge to each Batwa household in Kanungu District, Uganda in November 2012. Surveyors collected data on LLIN ownership and use through six cross-sectional surveys pre- and post-distribution. Household retention, within household access, and individual use of LLINs were assessed over an 18-month period. Socioeconomic determinants of household retention of LLINs post-distribution were modelled longitudinally using logistic regression with random effects. Direct house-to-house distribution of free LLINs did not result in sustainable increases in the ownership and use of LLINs. Three months post-distribution, only 73% of households owned at least one LLIN and this period also saw the greatest reduction in ownership compared to other study periods. Eighteen-months post distribution, only a third of households still owned a LLIN. Self-reported age-specific use of LLINs was generally higher for children under five, declined for children aged 6-12, and was highest for older adults aged over 35. In the model, household wealth was a significant predictor of LLIN retention, controlling for time and other variables. This research highlights on-going socioeconomic inequities in access to malaria prevention measures among the Batwa in southwestern Uganda, even after free distribution of LLINs, and provides critical information to inform local malaria programs on possible intervention entry-points to increase access and use among this marginalized population."
https://openalex.org/W2345550147,"Rotaviruses (RV) are important causes of diarrhea in animals, especially in domestic animals. Of the 9 RV species, rotavirus A, B, and C (RVA, RVB, and RVC, respectively) had been established as important causes of diarrhea in pigs. The Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory receives swine stool samples from North America to determine the etiologic agents of disease. Between November 2009 and October 2011, 7,508 samples from pigs with diarrhea were submitted to determine if enteric pathogens, including RV, were present in the samples. All samples were tested for RVA, RVB, and RVC by real time RT-PCR. The majority of the samples (82%) were positive for RVA, RVB, and/or RVC. To better understand the risk factors associated with RV infections in swine diagnostic samples, three-level mixed-effects logistic regression models (3L-MLMs) were used to estimate associations among RV species, age, and geographical variability within the major swine production regions in North America. The conditional odds ratios (cORs) for RVA and RVB detection were lower for 1–3 day old pigs when compared to any other age group. However, the cOR of RVC detection in 1–3 day old pigs was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than pigs in the 4–20 days old and >55 day old age groups. Furthermore, pigs in the 21–55 day old age group had statistically higher cORs of RV co-detection compared to 1–3 day old pigs (p < 0.001). The 3L-MLMs indicated that RV status was more similar within states than among states or within each region. Our results indicated that 3L-MLMs are a powerful and adaptable tool to handle and analyze large-hierarchical datasets. In addition, our results indicated that, overall, swine RV epidemiology is complex, and RV species are associated with different age groups and vary by regions in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2346279656,"Background The high frequency of mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene in diffuse gliomas indicates its importance in the process of gliomagenesis. These mutations result in loss of the normal function and acquisition of the neomorphic activity converting α-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate. This potential oncometabolite may induce the epigenetic changes, resulting in the deregulated expression of numerous genes, including those related to the differentiation process or cell survivability. Methods Neural stem cells were derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells following embryoid body formation. Neural stem cells transduced with mutant IDH1R132H, empty vector, non-transduced and overexpressing IDH1WT controls were differentiated into astrocytes and neurons in culture. The neuronal and astrocytic differentiation was determined by morphology and expression of lineage specific markers (MAP2, Synapsin I and GFAP) as determined by real-time PCR and immunocytochemical staining. Apoptosis was evaluated by real-time observation of Caspase-3 activation and measurement of PARP cleavage by Western Blot. Results Compared with control groups, cells expressing IDH1R132H retained an undifferentiated state and lacked morphological changes following stimulated differentiation. The significant inhibitory effect of IDH1R132H on neuronal and astrocytic differentiation was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining for markers of neural stem cells. Additionally, real-time PCR indicated suppressed expression of lineage markers. High percentage of apoptotic cells was detected within IDH1R132H-positive neural stem cells population and their derivatives, if compared to normal neural stem cells and their derivatives. The analysis of PARP and Caspase-3 activity confirmed apoptosis sensitivity in mutant protein-expressing neural cells. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that expression of IDH1R132H increases apoptosis susceptibility of neural stem cells and their derivatives. Robust apoptosis causes differentiation deficiency of IDH1R132H-expressing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2346455816,"Objectives Follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) is a circulating glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular diseases and inflammation-related disorders. We have shown that Fstl1 acts as an anti-inflammatory factor that protects against ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Here we examined whether plasma level of Fstl1 associates with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in apparently healthy Japanese men. Methods and Results Plasma Fstl1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Circulating Fstl1 concentrations positively correlated with levels of fasting immune-reactive insulin (FIRI), high-sensitive CRP (hsCRP) and derivatives of reactive oxidative metabolites (dROMs), an indicator of oxidative stress. The levels of hsCRP positively associated with Fstl1, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, FIRI and dROMs levels. dROMs levels positively associated with Fstl1, Hemoglobin A1c and hsCRP levels. Multiple regression analysis with confounding factors revealed that Fstl1 levels, together with BMI and FIRI, correlated with hsCRP and that Fstl1 levels correlated with dROMs. Conclusion Our observations indicate that measurement of plasma Fstl1 levels can be valuable for assessment of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2345703087,"By using adhesion, geckos can move through incredibly challenging habitats. However, continually changing terrain may necessitate modulation of the adhesive apparatus in order to maximize its effectiveness over a range of challenges. Behaviorally modulating how the adhesive system is applied can occur by altering the alignment of the foot relative to the long axis of the body and/or the angles between the digits (interdigital angle). Given the directionality of the adhesive system, geckos likely vary the application of the system via these mechanisms as they run. We quantified 3D movements (using high-speed video) of the day gecko, Phelsuma madagascariensis, running on a range of ecologically relevant inclines (0°, 45°, 90°) and perch diameters (1.5 cm, 10 cm and broad). We measured the instantaneous sum of interdigital angles and foot alignment relative to the body, as well as other kinematic variables, throughout each stride and across treatments. Modulation of foot alignment at 45° and 90° was similar between the forelimb and hind limb, but differed at 0°, suggesting that P. madagascariensis is able to exert an adhesive force using multiple strategies. Both the sum of interdigital angles and alignment in the fore- and hind foot were modulated. Differences in modulation between the limbs are likely related to the underlying morphology. The modulation of interdigital angle and foot alignment suggests that aspects other than the mechanism of adhesion, such as joint morphology, are important for arboreal movement in geckos. Our study of foot usage in arboreal locomotion reveals patterns that may be widespread across pad-bearing lizards. In addition to understanding the constraints exerted by the adhesive apparatus, we highlight how biomechanical traits may respond to the evolution of novel adaptations and morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W2346067077,"Gene Essentiality Analysis based on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA-based GEA) is a promising tool for the identification of novel metabolic therapeutic targets in cancer. The reconstruction of cancer-specific metabolic networks, typically based on gene expression data, constitutes a sensible step in this approach. However, to our knowledge, no extensive assessment on the influence of the reconstruction process on the obtained results has been carried out to date.In this article, we aim to study context-specific networks and their FBA-based GEA results for the identification of cancer-specific metabolic essential genes. To that end, we used gene expression datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), evaluating the results obtained in 174 cancer cell lines. In order to more clearly observe the effect of cancer-specific expression data, we did the same analysis using randomly generated expression patterns. Our computational analysis showed some essential genes that are fairly common in the reconstructions derived from both gene expression and randomly generated data. However, though of limited size, we also found a subset of essential genes that are very rare in the randomly generated networks, while recurrent in the sample derived networks, and, thus, would presumably constitute relevant drug targets for further analysis. In addition, we compare the in-silico results to high-throughput gene silencing experiments from Project Achilles with conflicting results, which leads us to raise several questions, particularly the strong influence of the selected biomass reaction on the obtained results. Notwithstanding, using previous literature in cancer research, we evaluated the most relevant of our targets in three different cancer cell lines, two derived from Gliobastoma Multiforme and one from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, finding that some of the predictions are in the right track."
https://openalex.org/W2346117701,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) have previously been suggested to be potential biomarkers for chronic stress induced exhaustion. The knowledge about VEGF has increased during the last decades and supports the contention that VEGF plays an important role in stress and depression. There is scarce knowledge on the possible relationship of EGF and MCP-1 in chronic stress and depression. This study further examines the role of VEGF, EGF and MCP-1 in women with chronic stress induced exhaustion and healthy women during a follow-up period of two years. Methods and Findings Blood samples were collected from 105 women with chronic stress induced exhaustion on at least 50% sick leave for at least three months, at inclusion (T0), after 12 months (T12) and after 24 months (T24). Blood samples were collected at inclusion (T0) in 116 physically and psychiatrically healthy women. The plasma levels of VEGF, EGF and MCP-1 were analyzed using Biochip Array Technology. Women with chronic stress induced exhaustion had significantly higher plasma levels of VEGF and EGF compared to healthy women at baseline, T12 and at T24. There was no significant difference in plasma levels of MCP-1. Plasma levels of VEGF and EGF decreased significantly in women with chronic stress induced exhaustion during the two years follow-up. Conclusions The replicated findings of elevated levels of VEGF and EGF in women with chronic stress induced exhaustion and decreasing plasma levels of VEGF and EGF during the two years follow-up add important knowledge to the pathophysiology of chronic stress induced exhaustion."
https://openalex.org/W2345383973,"To evaluate the pleiotropic effects to statins, we analyze the qualitative and quantitative retinal changes in hypercholesterolemic rabbits after a low-dosage statin treatment. For this purpose, New Zealand rabbits were split into three groups: control (G0; n = 10), fed a standard diet; hypercholesterolemic (G1; n = 8), fed a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months; and statins (G2; n = 8), fed a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months, together with the administration of statin (pravastatin or fluvastatin sodium) at a dose of 2 mg / kg / day each diet. The retinas were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (glial fibrillary acidic protein). The retinal thickness of nuclear and plexiform layers were quantified in semi-thin sections. The results revealed that the low-statin-treated rabbits in comparison with the hypercholesterolemic group showed: i) a more preserved structure in all retinal layers; ii) a significant reduction in retinal thickness; iii) a decrease in cell death in the nuclear-and ganglion-cell layers; iv) a reduction of hydropic degeneration in the plexiform and nerve-fiber layers; v) a preservation of astrocytes and of the retinal area occupied by them; and vi) a better-preserved retinal vascular structure. Our findings indicate that low doses of statins can prevent retinal degeneration, acting on retinal macroglia, neurons and retinal vessels, despite that hypercholesterolemia remained unchanged. Thus, the pleiotropic effects of the statins may help safeguard the retinal ultrastructure."

https://openalex.org/W2345405019,"Computer interaction via visually guided hand or finger movements is a ubiquitous part of daily computer usage in work or gaming. Surprisingly, however, little is known about the performance effects of using virtual limb representations versus simpler cursors. In this study 26 healthy right-handed adults performed cued index finger flexion-extension movements towards an on-screen target while wearing a data glove. They received each of four different types of real-time visual feedback: a simple circular cursor, a point light pattern indicating finger joint positions, a cartoon hand and a fully shaded virtual hand. We found that participants initiated the movements faster when receiving feedback in the form of a hand than when receiving circular cursor or point light feedback. This overall difference was robust for three out of four hand versus circle pairwise comparisons. The faster movement initiation for hand feedback was accompanied by a larger movement amplitude and a larger movement error. We suggest that the observed effect may be related to priming of hand information during action perception and execution affecting motor planning and execution. The results may have applications in the use of body representations in virtual reality applications."

However, in contrast to coach-driven organized sport, little is known about the interpersonal processes driving development in this context. The present study was an exploratory descriptive analysis of the interactive peer behaviors occurring in an informal sport play setting and their relationship to athlete psychological characteristics. Thirty young athletes (<25 years old, Mage = 19.84) participating in informal mixed-age volleyball, soccer, and basketball sessions at a community recreation center were observed and their interactive behavior coded. Participants also completed questionnaire measures of psychological characteristics (competence, confidence, character). Descriptive analyses examined the interaction patterns of young athletes in these contexts. Multiple regression analyses were then conducted to examine the relationships between peer interactive behavior and athlete psychological characteristics. Results point to the social nature of participation in informal sport play contexts and the critical relationship between athlete competence and peer interaction tendencies. This study presents an initial exploration of peer interactive behavior in informal, mixed-age sport play contexts, but continued future research is needed to better understand the developmental processes and implications of participation in these important contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2346898879,"Redox cofactors of NADH/NADPH participate in many cellular metabolic pathways for facilitating the electron transfer from one molecule to another in redox reactions. Transhydrogenase plays an important role in linking catabolism and anabolism, regulating the ratio of NADH/NADPH in cells. The cytoplasmic transhydrogenases could be useful to engineer synthetic biochemical pathways for the production of high-value chemicals and biofuels.A transhydrogenase activity was discovered for a FMN-bound diaphorase (DI) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus under anaerobic conditions. The DI-catalyzed hydride exchange were monitored and characterized between a NAD(P)H and a thio-modified NAD+ analogue. This new function of DI was demonstrated to transfer a hydride from NADPH to NAD+ that was consumed by NAD-specific lactate dehydrogenase and malic dehydrogenase.We discover a novel transhydrogenase activity of a FMN-DI by stabilizing the reduced state of FMNH2 under anaerobic conditions. FMN-DI was demonstrated to catalyze the hydride transfer between NADPH and NAD+. In the future, it may be possible to incorporate this FMN-DI into synthetic enzymatic pathways for balancing NADH generation and NADPH consumption for anaerobic production of biofuels and biochemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2345888234,"Background Integrated care pathways (ICP) in stroke management are increasingly being implemented to improve outcomes of acute stroke patients. We evaluated the effect of implementing a 72 hour stroke care bundle on early outcomes among patients admitted within seven days post stroke to the national referral hospital in Uganda. Methods In a one year non-randomised controlled study, 127 stroke patients who had ‘usual care’ (control group) were compared to 127 stroke patients who received selected elements from an ICP (intervention group). Patients were consecutively enrolled (controls first, intervention group second) into each group over 5 month periods and followed to 30-days post stroke. Incidence outcomes (mortality and functional ability) were compared using chi square test and adjusted for potential confounders. Kaplan Meier survival estimates and log rank test for comparison were used for time to death analysis for all strokes and by stroke severity categories. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, median survival time and median length of hospital stay. Results Mortality within 7 days was higher in the intervention group compared to controls (RR 13.1, 95% CI 3.3–52.9). There was no difference in 30-day mortality between the two groups (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.5–2.6). There was better 30-day survival in patients with severe stroke in the intervention group compared to controls (P = 0.018). The median survival time was 30 days (IQR 29–30 days) in the control group and 30 days (IQR 7–30 days) in the intervention group. In the intervention group, 41patients (32.3%) died in hospital compared to 23 (18.1%) in controls (P < 0.001). The median length of hospital stay was 8 days (IQR 5–12 days) in the controls and 4 days (IQR 2–7 days) in the intervention group. There was no difference in functional outcomes between the groups (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4–2.2). Conclusions While implementing elements of a stroke-focused ICP in a Ugandan national referral hospital appeared to have little overall benefit in mortality and functioning, patients with severe stroke may benefit on selected outcomes. More research is needed to better understand how and when stroke protocols should be implemented in sub-Saharan African settings.

https://openalex.org/W2346260108,"At the acute stage following unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL), rats, mice or guinea pigs exhibit a complex motor syndrome combining circling (HSCC lesion) and rolling (utricular lesion). At the chronic stage, they only display circling, because proprioceptive information related to the plane of support substitutes the missing utricular information to control posture in the frontal plane. Circling is also observed following unilateral lesion of the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons by 6- hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA rats) and systemic injection of apomorphine (APO rats). The resemblance of behavior induced by unilateral vestibular and dopaminergic lesions at the chronic stage can be interpreted in two ways. One hypothesis is that the dopaminergic system exerts three-dimensional control over motricity, as the vestibular system does. If this hypothesis is correct, then a unilateral lesion of the nigro-striatal pathway should induce three-dimensional motor deficits, i.e., circling and at least some sort of barrel rolling at the acute stage of the lesion. Then, compensation could also take place very rapidly based on proprioception, which would explain the prevalence of circling. In addition, barrel rolling should reappear when the rodent is placed in water, as it occurs in UL vertebrates. Alternatively, the dopaminergic network, together with neurons processing the horizontal canal information, could control the homeostasis of posture and locomotion specifically in one and only one plane of space, i.e. the plane related to the basis of support. In that case, barrel rolling should never occur, whether at the acute or chronic stage on firm ground or in water. Moreover, circling should have the same characteristics following both types of lesions. Clearly, 6-OHDA and APO-rats never exhibited barrel rolling at the acute stage. They circled at the acute stage of the lesion and continued to do so three weeks later, including in water. In contrast, UL-rats, exhibited both circling and barrel rolling at the acute stage, and then only circled on the ground. Furthermore, barrel rolling instantaneously reappeared in water in UL rats, which was not the case in 6-OHDA and APO-rats. That is, the lesion of the dopaminergic system on one side did not compromise trim in the pitch and roll planes, even when proprioceptive information related to the basis of support was lacking as in water. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that dopamine does not exert three-dimensional control of the motor system but regulates postural control in one particular plane of space, the one related to the basis of support. In contrast, as previously shown, the vestibular system exerts three-dimensional control on posture. That is, we show here for the first time a relationship between a given neuromodulator and the spatial organization of motor control."

https://openalex.org/W2346221343,"Background The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy and feasibility of left ventricular systolic function determined by four-dimensional echocardiography (4DE). Methods Latex balloons were sewn into the left ventricle (LV) of 20 freshly harvested pig hearts which were then passively driven by a pulsatile pump apparatus. Global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), global area strain (GAS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) derived from 4DEand two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE)-derived LVEF were quantified at different stroke volumes (SV) 30–70 ml and correlated with sonomicrometry data. Results In all comparisons, GLS, GCS, GAS, 2DE-LVEF, and 4DE-LVEF demonstrated strong correlations with sonomicrometry data (r = 0.77, r = 0.89, r = 0.79, r = 0.93, r = 0.96, all P <0.001). Bland-Altman analyses showed slight overestimations of echo-derived GLS, GCS, 2DE-LVEF and 3DE-LVEF over sonomicrometry values (bias = 2.88, bias = 3.99, bias = 3.37, bias = 2.78, respectively). Furthermore, there is better agreement between GCS, 4D LVEF and sonomicrometry values compared with GLS and 2D LVEF. Conclusion Four-dimensional echocardiography accurately assesses LV function. GCS derived by 4DE is a potential alternative parameter to quantify LV systolic function."
https://openalex.org/W2346080366,"Duffy binding protein region II (DBPII) is a promising vaccine candidate against vivax malaria. However, polymorphisms of DBPII are the major obstacle to designing a successful vaccine. Here, we examined whether anti-DBPII antibodies from individual P. vivax exposures provide strain-transcending immunity and whether their presence is associated with DBPII haplotypes found in patients with acute P. vivax. The ability of antibodies to inhibit DBL-TH-erythrocyte binding was tested by COS7 erythrocyte binding inhibition assay. Seven samples of high responders (HR) were identified from screening anti-DBPII levels. HR no.3 and HR no.6 highly inhibited all DBL-TH binding to erythrocytes, by >80%. Antibodies from these two patients' plasma had the potential to be broadly inhibitory against DBL-TH1, -TH2, -TH6, -TH7, -TH8 and -TH9 haplotypes when plasma was serially diluted from 1:500 to 1:2000. To further examine the association of DBPII haplotypes and the ability of antibodies to broadly inhibit DBL-TH variants, the individual samples underwent sequencing analysis and the inhibitory function of the anti-DBPII antibodies was tested. The patterns of DBPII polymorphisms in acute patients were classified into two groups, DBPII Sal I (55%) and DBL-TH variants (45%). Plasma from Sal I and DBPII-TH patients who had the highest inhibition against Sal I or DBL-TH4 and -TH5 was serially diluted from 1:500 to 1:2000 and their inhibitory capacity was tested against a panel of DBL-TH haplotypes. Results provided evidence of both strain-transcending inhibition as well as strain-specific inhibition by antibodies that blocked erythrocyte binding against some DBL-TH variants and against homologous alleles. This study demonstrated broad inhibition by anti-DBPII antibodies against DBL-TH haplotypes in natural P. vivax exposed individuals. The identification of conserved epitopes among DBL-TH may have implications for vaccine development of a DBPII-based vaccine against diverse P. vivax infections."

RokB (Sco6115) has originally been identified in a DNA-affinity capturing approach as a possible regulator of the heterologously expressed novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512. Interestingly, both, the rokB deletion mutants as well as its overexpressing mutants showed significantly reduced novobiocin production in the host strain S.coelicolor M512. We identified the DNA-binding site for RokB in the promoter region of the novobiocin biosynthetic genes novH-novW. It overlaps with the novH start codon which may explain the reduction of novobiocin production caused by overexpression of rokB. Bioinformatic screening coupled with surface plasmon resonance based interaction studies resulted in the discovery of five RokB binding sites within the genome of S. coelicolor. Using the genomic binding sites, a consensus motif for RokB was calculated, which differs slightly from previously determined binding motifs for ROK-family regulators. The annotations of the possible members of the so defined RokB regulon gave hints that RokB might be involved in amino acid metabolism and transport. This hypothesis was supported by feeding experiments with casamino acids and L-tyrosine, which could also explain the reduced novobiocin production in the deletion mutants."

Previously, factor VIII deficient mouse models were reported to have a normal life span without spontaneous bleeds. However, the bleeding frequency and survival in these animals has not been thoroughly evaluated. Objective To investigate the survival and lethal bleeding frequency in two strains of E-16 hemophilia A mice. Methods We prospectively studied factor VIII deficient hemizygous affected males (n = 83) and homozygous affected females (n = 55) for survival and bleeding frequency. Animals were evaluated for presence and location of bleeds as potential cause of death. Results and Conclusions Hemophilia A mice had a median survival of 254 days, which is significantly shortened compared to wild type controls (p < 0.0001). In addition, the hemophilia A mice experienced hemorrhage in several tissues. This previously-underappreciated shortened survival in the hemophilia A murine model provides new outcomes for investigation of therapeutics and also reflects the shortened lifespan of patients if left untreated."
