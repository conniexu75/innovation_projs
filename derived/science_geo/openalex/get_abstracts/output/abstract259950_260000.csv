https://openalex.org/W2058468006,"Photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently, and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres, where long term energy storage is initiated. The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke 'hopping' of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy 'wire' connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses-even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path."

Here we report that lack of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis leads to a compromised response to DNA damage. Deficiency in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation metabolism induces profound cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, particularly in cells deficient for the protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). At the biochemical level, we examined the significance of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis on the regulation of early DNA damage-induced signaling cascade initiated by ATM. Using potent PARP inhibitors and PARP-1 knock-out cells, we demonstrate a functional interplay between ATM and poly(ADP-ribose) that is important for the phosphorylation of p53, SMC1, and H2AX. For the first time, we demonstrate a functional and physical interaction between the major DSB signaling kinase, ATM and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP-1, a key enzyme of chromatin remodeling. This study suggests that poly(ADP-ribose) might serve as a DNA damage sensory molecule that is critical for early DNA damage signaling.

Double-strand breaks (DSB) 5The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; MRN, Mre11/Rad50/NBS1; SMC1, structural maintenance of chromosomes 1; IR, ionizing radiation; MNNG, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PARG, poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; ATR, A-T and RAD-3-related; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; A-T, ataxia-telangiectasia; Gy, Gray; GST, glutathione S-transferase. are potentially the most cytotoxic form of DNA damage in human cells because they lead to genomic rearrangements, cancer predisposition, and perhaps cell death if unrepaired or repaired incorrectly (1.O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Consequently, the DNA damage response involves parallel modulation of redundant signaling pathways leading to lesion detection, processing, and repair. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a DNA damage-responding kinase that is rapidly activated after the induction of DSB (2.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Within minutes of DNA damage induction, ATM is recruited and activated in the vicinity of DSBs, where it induces the phosphorylation of a number of proteins required for DNA damage response and repair, including proteins of MRN (Mre11/Rad50/NBS1) complex, p53, SMC1 and histone variant H2AX (3.Lavin M.F. Birrell G. Chen P. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gueven N. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms of how ATM is activated and regulates its downstream effectors are not fully understood. Although ATM activation is mainly associated with DSB formation as part of the damage detection mechanism following ionizing radiation (IR), several studies indicate that the signaling kinase ATM is also activated in response to the environmental carcinogen N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (4.Adamson A.W.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are also constitutive factors of the DNA damage surveillance network, acting through a DNA break sensor function (7.Bouchard V.J. Rouleau M. Poirier G.G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation also plays an early role in DSB signaling and repair pathways (8.Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S.

PARP-1 and PARP-2 are highly activated upon binding to DNA strand interruptions and synthesize, within seconds, large amounts of the negatively charged polymer of ADP-ribose (PAR) on several nuclear proteins including themselves, histones, topoisomerase I, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (12.Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The immediate activation of PARP-1 by DNA breaks and the resulting PAR build-up, which appears minutes after DNA damage induction, are among the earliest cell responses to DNA damage (13.Schultz N.

After initial recruitment of PARP-1 to DNA lesions, hyperpoly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 dissociates from the DNA template (16.Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), leading to relaxation of chromatin structure (17.Poirier G.G. de Murcia G. Jongstra-Bilen J. Niedergang C. Mandel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Althaus F.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple reports show that PARP inhibitors increase the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and IR (19.Calabrese C.R. Almassy R. Barton S. Batey M.A. Calvert A.H. Canan-Koch S.

This is manifested by a delay in the progression through the S phase and accumulation of cells in G2/M (22.Noel G. Godon C. Fernet M. Giocanti N. Megnin-Chanet F. Favaudon V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23.Jacobson E.L. Meadows R. Measel J. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although viable, both PARP-1 and PARP-2 knock-out mice display an acute sensitivity to IR and alkylating agents (24.Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 25.Menissier de Murcia J. Ricoul M. Tartier L. Niedergang C. Huber A. Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Sabatier L. Chambon P. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). PARP-1/PARP-2 double knock-out mice die at early stages of embryogenesis, demonstrating the crucial functions of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA damage signaling and the existence of functional redundancy between these two PARPs (25.Menissier de Murcia J. Ricoul M. Tartier L. Niedergang C. Huber A. Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Sabatier L. Chambon P. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PARP-1/ATM double mutant mice are defective for both repair and signaling of DNA damage, leading to embryonic lethality because of their dramatic sensitivity to DNA damage (26.Menisser-de Murcia J. Mark M. Wendling O. Wynshaw-Boris A. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1828-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27.Huber A. Bai P. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. DNA Repair. (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, the notion that PAR mediates key events in cell cycle regulation such as mitotic spindle control through PAR binding interaction (28.Fang Y. Liu T. Wang X. Yang Y.M. Deng H. Kunicki J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Lu L. Dai W. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3598-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29.Chang P. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Nat.

Nature. 2004; 432: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) stimulated our interest on the possible role of PAR-binding proteins in early DNA damage response and specifically the interplay between the signaling kinase ATM and PAR molecules. A number of proteins involved in DNA damage signaling contain modular domains that mediate specific protein-protein interactions. Consequently, a PAR-binding domain has been found in a number of proteins involved in DNA damage response pathways such as p53, p21, XRCC1, Ku70, topoisomerase I, and DNA ligase IIIα (31.El-Khamisy S.F. Masutani M. Suzuki H. Caldecott K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5526-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 32.Leppard J.B. Dong Z. Mackey Z.B. Tomkinson A.E. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, despite major advances primarily by biochemical and genetic studies, the precise role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the immediate DNA damage signaling remains to be elucidated. The finding that ATM is activated, at least in vitro, by PAR molecules (35.Goodarzi A.A. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair. (Amst.). 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) raises the issue as to whether PAR influences the phosphorylation cascade initiated by the ATM protein kinase. In this study, we determined how PAR synthesis modulated the early DNA damage signaling response. We show that impaired PAR synthesis in cells treated with the PARP inhibitors is associated with delayed phosphorylation of p53, H2AX, and SMC1 after DNA damage caused by treatment with both MNNG and IR. The decreased phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 and delayed phosphorylation of SMC1 and histone H2AX were also confirmed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from PARP-1-/- mice. In addition, we demonstrate that PAR interacts physically with ATM, that this interaction is mediated by PAR-binding domains and that it has functional consequences. Cell Lines−The human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) (ATCC CCL-185) were maintained in Ham’s F12K medium with 2 mm glutamine containing 15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). SV40-transformed normal skin fibroblasts (GM00637), and A-T fibroblasts (GM09607) as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PARP-1+/+ (F20) and PARP-1-/- (A1) mice (36.Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Alternatively, the EBV-immortalized normal lymphoblastoid cells (C3ABR) and A-T lymphoblastoid cells (GM03189) were used and maintained in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Antibodies−We exposed control and A-T cells to genotoxic agents (MNNG and IR) and collected whole cell extracts at the indicated time points as described (37.Pandita T.K. Lieberman H.B. Lim D.S. Dhar S. Zheng W. Taya Y. Kastan M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We performed precipitation of endogenous PARP-1 with an anti-PARP-1 monoclonal antibody (F1–23). Cells were resuspended in 25 mm NaPO4 buffer pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors Complete™ (Roche Applied Science) and kept on ice for 20 min. NaPO4 and NaCl concentration were then adjusted to 175 mm (150 μl/ml) and 0.3 m (30 μl/ml), respectively, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with 30 strokes with the tight-fitting pestle. A suspension of magnetic protein G beads (Invitrogen) was washed twice with binding buffer (175 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0 containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) prior to immunoprecipitation. Cleared lysate was diluted to 1:2 (v/v) with binding buffer without NaCl, mixed with the antibody-coated beads, and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 90–120 min. The beads were washed with the binding buffer. The beads containing the immunoprecipitated samples were collected, resuspended in 250 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiled 5 min at 100 °C. Whole cell extracts (10 μg) or immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies directed against PAR (96–10 antisera), PARP-1 (clone C2–10), p53 protein, p53 phospho-S15, SMC1 phospho-S957, SMC1 (Cell Signaling), H2AX phospho-S139 (Upstate), and β-actin (Calbiochem). Immunoblots were developed using the Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration (Pierce) to allow quantitative analysis. Purification of GST-ATM Fragments and in Vitro Pull-down Assays−For in vitro PAR binding characterization, we prepared a series of GST-ATM constructs as described (38.Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Hobson K. Taya Y. Gabrielli B. Chan D. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For the GST pull-down, glutathione-Sepharose beads (80 μl) were washed with lysis buffer and then resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer containing either purified GST-tagged ATM domains (1 μg) or GST protein alone. For each condition, PARP-1 (1 μg), 32P-modified PARP-1 (100 nm), PARG (1 unit), or PAR (100 nm) were added to the reaction mixture. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with constant mixing, the beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The beads were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiled 5 min at 100 °C. After separation by SDS-PAGE, bound material was detected by autoradiography, immunoblotting with anti-PARP-1 (clone C2–10) or Coomassie Blue staining. Nitrocellulose PAR Binding Assay−Synthetic peptides or purified proteins were loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.1 μm pore size) using a dot blot manifold system. Membranes were incubated with 32P-labeled automodified PARP-1 or 32P-labeled purified PAR prepared as described (39.Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), washed extensively, and subjected to autoradiography. BioPorter-mediated Delivery of Peptides into Cells−Wild-type and mutant ATM N-terminal PAR-binding peptides were delivered into cells using the BioPorter reagent (Sigma) (40.Sawada M. Hayes P. Matsuyama S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41.Zelphati O. Wang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Felgner P.L. Corbeil J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35103-35110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Purified peptides were diluted to the desired concentration in PBS. The diluted peptide solution (2.5 μg of total) was added to the dried BioPorter reagent and allowed to sit at room temperature for 5 min followed by gentle mixing. The suspensions were mixed with 250 μl of serum-free medium and were then added to cells (∼60–80% confluency) cultured in 6-well cell culture plates for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Cultures were subsequently used for experiments. Cytotoxicity Studies−Cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium and plated out at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well cell culture plates. Cells were exposed for 1 h to a range of concentrations of the PARP inhibitor PJ-34 (Axxora) or a range of MNNG concentrations in growth medium. After treatment, fresh media with or without PJ-34 was added, and plates were incubated for 4–5 days at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator until untreated control cells reached ∼2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell viability (triplicate wells for each drug concentration) was determined by adding 0.1 ml of 0.4% Trypan blue to a 0.5-ml cell suspension (42.Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20486-20493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Viable cells were counted, and viabilities were expressed as the number of cells in drug-treated wells relative to cells in control wells (% of control). Immunofluorescence and Microscopy Analysis−A549 or GM00637 cells were fixed at the indicated time points following treatment with DNA-damaging agents (MNNG or IR). PAR synthesis was detected with the rabbit anti-PAR 96–10 antibody. Nuclear foci of DNA damage were visualized using anti-H2AX pS139 monoclonal antibody (Upstate). Cells were observed using a Zeiss microscope (Axioplan IIM) equipped with a CoolSnapHQ cooled CCD camera. The measurement of fluorescence intensity and colocalization was performed using MetaMorph 6.0 (Universal Imaging) software. Composite figures of collected images were assembled in Adobe Photoshop. Confocal Microscopy and Quantification of γ-H2AX Foci−To detect MNNG-induced γ-H2AX foci, PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1-/- MEF grown on coverslips were fixed at various time points after MNNG exposure and stained with anti-H2AX pS139 monoclonal antibody. Cells labeled as described above were placed on a Nikon inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope and images were captured using the LaserSharp software. The number of γ-H2AX foci per cell were manually counted in three separate fields (at least 50 cells/fields). Cells were classified into four different categories according to the number of γ-H2AX foci per cell (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, or more than 30 foci per cell). Cell Cycle Analysis−Cell cycle distribution after PJ-34 and MNNG treatments was determined by flow cytometry analysis using propidium iodine staining for DNA content. Cell death was characterized by the number of cells with fragmented DNA (sub-G1 population). Loss of PAR Synthesis Sensitizes Normal Cells to DNA-damaging Agents−Genetic disorders that cause deficiency in DNA damage signaling proteins are characterized by an increased sensitivity to a variety of DNA-damaging agents. Cells derived from patients with Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) illustrate perfectly this paradigm showing a defective response to DNA damage (43.Shiloh Y. Trends in Biochemical Sciences. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that disruption of PAR synthesis causes an increase in sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (21.Plummer E.R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that deficiency in PAR metabolism is linked to a defect in DNA damage signaling. Thus, to determine whether the effects of PARP inhibition impacts on the ATM signaling network, we compared the sensitivity to DNA alkylating agents in normal ATM-proficient lymphoblasts and in A-T patient cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, normal cells exposed for one hour to both MNNG and PARP inhibitors exhibit survival rates similar to A-T cells treated with MNNG alone, suggesting that the absence of PAR synthesis decreases the ability of normal cells to respond adequately to DNA damage to an extent similar to that observed in A-T cells. We next evaluated whether PJ-34 exhibits inhibitor-specific toxicity in the absence of treatment with exogenous cytotoxic drugs using survival as readout (Fig. 1B). We observed a relatively low toxicity in normal ATM-proficient cells when low doses of PJ-34 were added to growth medium (Fig. 1B). However, A-T cells are acutely sensitive to treatment with the same low doses of PJ-34 (Fig. 1B). This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that deficiency in DNA damage signaling proteins induces sensitivity to PARP inhibition (10.McCabe N. Turner N.C. Lord C.J. Kluzek K. Bialkowska A. Swift S. Giavara S. O'Connor M.J. Tutt A.N. Zdzienicka M.Z. Smith G.C.M. Ashworth A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8109-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 26.Menisser-de Murcia J. Mark M. Wendling O. Wynshaw-Boris A. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1828-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We also established that the hypersensitivity of A-T cells to the suppression of PARP-1 function is due to the activation of apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S1). This is illustrated by the increased sub-G1 population (supplemental Fig. S1B) and the appearance of the specific PARP-1 cleavage product (supplemental Fig. S1C). Together, these results clearly show that disruption of PARP function by chemical inhibition in normal cells leads to the suppression of an important signaling event of the DNA damage response that is comparable to the cell survival defect observed in cells lacking ATM. MNNG Induces ATM-dependent Substrate Phosphorylation That Is Altered in the Absence of PAR Synthesis−The DNA damage-responsive kinase ATM is best known for its activation following IR (2.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Besides, ATM has also been proven to be the main kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 during MNNG-induced DNA damage (4.Adamson A.W. Kim W.J. Shangary S. Baskaran R.

In addition, it was shown that NBS1, SMC1, and p53 were phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner at high doses of MNNG-induced DNA strand breaks, while ATR responds to the formation of DNA adducts and stalled replication induced by UV radiation (4.Adamson A.W.

We have analyzed this specific phosphorylation of p53 using a large panel of normal ATM-proficient and A-T cell lines. All ATM-proficient cells show induction of p53 phosphorylation 1 h after MNNG treatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, negligible signal was detected in both A-T cell lines exposed to the same treatment (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these findings confirm that high MNNG doses activate the ATM kinase, which allow the direct and rapid phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 (4.Adamson A.W. Kim W.J. Shangary S.

Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used MNNG to activate both ATM protein kinase and PAR formation to establish the relationship between ATM and PARP-1. We hypothesized that PAR molecules might influence ATM function, either by promoting its kinase activity or by providing access to its downstream substrates. Recent studies have demonstrated that ATM kinase activity is significantly enhanced by PAR (35.Goodarzi A.A. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair. (Amst.). 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation occurs with kinetics similar to that of ATM activation during initial steps of the DNA damage signaling (27.Huber A. Bai P. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. DNA Repair. (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), it is therefore conceivable that PAR could trigger ATM phosphorylation of a subset of its targets within the first hour after DNA breaks formation. To understand the mechanism of PARP-1 activation in response to MNNG, we first determined the time-course of PARP activation in normal and A-T cells as well as in PARP-inhibited cells exposed to 50 μm MNNG (Fig. 2B). Exposure of both normal and A-T cells to MNNG results in an immediate synthesis of PAR that peaks at 30 min post-treatment, and rapidly decreases after 1 h, demonstrating how fast the PAR-dependent response can be (Fig. 2, B and C). However, in cells exposed to a 5 μm dose of PJ-34, we observed a striking inhibition (98.5%) of PAR synthesis following MNNG exposure (Fig. 2, B and C). Having observed that DNA damage-dependent PAR synthesis follows rapid kinetics in both normal and A-T cells, we next examined the ATM-dependent response within the same time frame following treatment with both MNNG and PJ-34. We performed biochemical analysis on the well-established ATM substrates p53, SMC1, and H2AX using phosphospecific antibodies. Importantly, cells treated with both MNNG and PJ-34 present a 5-fold decrease of p53 phosphorylation at 30 min and 1 h post-treatment (Fig. 2B-C). Pretreatment of the cells with PJ-34 significantly reduced the MNNG-induced phosphorylation of SMC1 on serine 957 throughout the treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). Next we used an ATM-deficient cell line to determine whether the phosphorylation cascade induced by MNNG is dependent of the protein kinase ATM. Although these cells demonstrate normal level of PAR synthesis following MNNG exposure, they exhibit a defective phosphorylation of ATM-dependent substrates p53, SMC1 and H2AX (Fig. 2, B and C). Besides, no phosphorylation of p53 and SMC1 was observed in the ATM-deficient cells when PAR synthesis peaks (>1 h). This indicates that PAR could not signal directly to other members of the PI3K kinase family such as ATR and DNA-PK. Importantly, we found that treatment of A-T lymphoblasts with MNNG greatly attenuated the phosphorylation of p53 and SMC1 in initial time points, which demonstrated that the protein kinase ATM is responsible phosphorylation of these effectors following MNNG exposure. Together these results suggest that the absence of PAR modulates the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of numerous downstream effectors including p53 and SMC1 immediately after MNNG exposure. Similar effects were also observed with another PARP inhibitor, DPQ (supplemental Fig. S2). In these cells, over 90% of the PAR synthesis was inhibited 1 h after treatment (data not shown) and the MNNG-induced phosphorylation of p53 is about 60% of that measured when PAR is fully synthesized (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that the reduced phosphorylation of p53 is due to the absence of PAR rather than a PJ-34 specific effect. The ability of γ-H2AX to form nuclear foci upon DNA damage has long been recognized as a sensitive marker of DSB formation (44.Takahashi A. Ohnishi T.

https://openalex.org/W2079197003,"RNA can act as a template for DNA synthesis in the reverse transcription of retroviruses and retrotransposons and in the elongation of telomeres. Despite its abundance in the nucleus, there has been no evidence for a direct role of RNA as a template in the repair of any chromosomal DNA lesions, including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired in most organisms by homologous recombination or by non-homologous end joining. An indirect role for RNA in DNA repair, following reverse transcription and formation of a complementary DNA, has been observed in the non-homologous joining of DSB ends. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which homologous recombination is efficient, RNA was shown to mediate recombination, but only indirectly through a cDNA intermediate generated by the reverse transcriptase function of Ty retrotransposons in Ty particles in the cytoplasm. Although pairing between duplex DNA and single-strand (ss)RNA can occur in vitro and in vivo, direct homologous exchange of genetic information between RNA and DNA molecules has not been observed. We show here that RNA can serve as a template for DNA synthesis during repair of a chromosomal DSB in yeast. The repair was accomplished with RNA oligonucleotides complementary to the broken ends. This and the observation that even yeast replicative DNA polymerases such as alpha and delta can copy short RNA template tracts in vitro demonstrate that RNA can transfer genetic information in vivo through direct homologous interaction with chromosomal DNA."

The number and activity of efflux pumps and outer membrane proteins that constitute porins play major roles in the definition of intrinsic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria that is altered under antibiotic exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the genetic regulation of porins and efflux pumps of Escherichia coli during prolonged exposure to increasing concentrations of tetracycline and demonstrate, with the aid of quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction methodology and western blot detection, the sequence order of genetic expression of regulatory genes, their relationship to each other, and the ensuing increased activity of genes that code for transporter proteins of efflux pumps and down-regulation of porin expression. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that, in addition to the transcriptional regulation of genes coding for membrane proteins, the post-translational regulation of proteins involved in the permeability of Gram-negative bacteria also plays a major role in the physiological adaptation to antibiotic exposure. A model is presented that summarizes events during the physiological adaptation of E. coli to tetracycline exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2058881180,"Insights into the conformational passage of a polypeptide chain across its free energy landscape have come from the judicious combination of experimental studies and computer simulations. Even though some unfolded and partially folded proteins are now known to possess biological function or to be involved in aggregation phenomena associated with disease states, experimentally derived atomic-level information on these structures remains sparse as a result of conformational heterogeneity and dynamics. Here we present a technique that can provide such information. Using a 'Trp-cage' miniprotein known as TC5b (ref. 5), we report photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization NMR pulse-labelling experiments that involve rapid in situ protein refolding. These experiments allow dipolar cross-relaxation with hyperpolarized aromatic side chain nuclei in the unfolded state to be identified and quantified in the resulting folded-state spectrum. We find that there is residual structure due to hydrophobic collapse in the unfolded state of this small protein, with strong inter-residue contacts between side chains that are relatively distant from one another in the native state. Prior structuring, even with the formation of non-native rather than native contacts, may be a feature associated with fast folding events in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2128638548,"Microparticles (MPs) are small fragments generated from the plasma membrane after cell stimulation. Among the candidate proteins harbored by MPs, we recently showed that sonic hedgehog (Shh) is present in MPs generated from activated/apoptotic human T lymphocytes [Martínez et al., Blood (2006) vol. 108, 3012-3020]. We show here that Shh carried by MPs induces nitric oxide (NO) release from endothelial cells, triggers changes in the expression and phosphorylation of enzymes related to the NO pathway, and decreases production of reactive oxygen species. When PI3-kinase and ERK signaling were specifically inhibited, the effects of MPs were reversed. In vivo injection of MPs in mice was also able to improve endothelial function by increasing NO release, and it reversed endothelial dysfunction after ischemia/reperfusion. Silencing the effects of Shh with cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of Shh, or siRNA, an inhibitor of the Shh receptor Patched, strongly reduced production of NO elicited by MPs. Taken together, we propose that the biological message carried by MPs harboring Shh may represent a new therapeutic approach against endothelial dysfunction during acute severe endothelial injury."
https://openalex.org/W2096997195,"Reorganization of the endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton and cell adhesive complexes provides a structural basis for increased vascular permeability implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including asthma, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We have recently described the barrier-protective effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on the human pulmonary EC. In the present study, we explored the involvement of Rac-GTPase and Rac-specific nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 in the mechanisms of EC barrier protection by HGF. HGF protected EC monolayers from thrombin-induced hyperpermeability, disruption of intercellular junctions, and formation of stress fibers and paracellular gaps by inhibiting thrombin-induced activation of Rho GTPase, Rho association with nucleotide exchange factor p115-RhoGEF, and myosin light chain phosphorylation, which was opposed by stimulation of Rac-dependent signaling. The pharmacological Rac inhibitor or silencing RNA (siRNA) based depletion of either Rac or Tiam1 significantly attenuated HGF-induced peripheral translocation of Rac effector cortactin, cortical actin ring formation, and EC barrier enhancement. Moreover, Tiam1 knockdown using the siRNA approach, attenuated the protective effect of HGF against thrombin-induced activation of Rho signaling, monolayer disruption, and EC hyperpermeability. This study demonstrates the Tiam1/Rac-dependent mechanism of HGF-induced EC barrier protection and provides novel mechanistic insights into regulation of EC permeability via dynamic interactions between Rho- and Tiam1/Rac-mediated pathways."

Because appearance of tau-aggregate bearing lesions correlates with both cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, it has been hypothesized that tau aggregation may be directly toxic to cells that harbor them. Testing this hypothesis in cell culture has been complicated by the resistance of full-length tau isoforms to aggregation over experimentally tractable time periods. To overcome this limitation, a small-molecule agonist of the tau aggregation reaction, Congo red, was used to drive aggregation within HEK-293 cells expressing full-length tau isoform htau40. Formation of detergent-insoluble aggregates was both time and agonist concentration dependent. At 10 μm Congo red, detergent-insoluble aggregates appeared with pseudo-first order kinetics and a half-life of approximately 5 days. By 7 days in culture, total tau levels increased 2-fold, with ∼30% of total tau converted into detergent-insoluble aggregates. Agonist addition also led to rapid losses in the tubulin binding activity of tau, although tau was not hyperphosphorylated as judged by occupancy of phosphorylation sites Ser396/Ser404. Tau aggregation was associated with decreased viability as detected by ToPro-3 uptake. The results, which establish a new approach for analysis of tau aggregation in cells independent of tau hyperphosphorylation, suggest that conformational changes associated with aggregation are incompatible with microtubule binding, and that toxicity associated with intracellular tau aggregation is not acute but develops over a period of days.

Tau aggregates appear as filaments, within which a portion of each tau molecule adopts β-sheet conformation. As in other filamentous aggregates, the resultant β-sheets stack in parallel, with each sheet orthogonal to the axis of the growing tau filament (2.Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Neurofibrillary lesion formation is accompanied by 4–8-fold increases in total brain tau levels (3.Khatoon S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4.Khatoon S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because expression of total tau does not change at the mRNA level in AD (5.Hyman B.T. Augustinack J.C. Ingelsson M. Biochim. Biophys.

Brain Res. 1999; 831: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), disease-associated increases in tau levels may derive from post-translational events (e.g. fibrillization) that selectively decrease tau turnover (7.Keck S. Nitsch R. Grune T. Ullrich O. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Tau fibrillization correlates spatially and temporally with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline (8.Arriagada P.V. Growdon J.H. Hedley-Whyte E.T. Hyman B.T.

Three general hypotheses have been put forward to rationalize a direct relationship between tau fibrillization and disease. The first argues that tau aggregates and other misconformers are directly toxic to cells that harbor them. For example, tau aggregates are capable of inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (7.Keck S. Nitsch R. Grune T. Ullrich O. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this system, which plays important roles in cell homeostasis, has been proposed to be a source of cellular stress (14.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 15.Bennett E.J. Bence N.F. Jayakumar R. Kopito R.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The second argues that sequestration of tau from microtubules destabilizes the cytoskeleton leading to a loss-of-function toxicity (16.Alonso A.C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Although loss of tau is well tolerated over both long (17.Harada A. Oguchi K. Okabe S. Kuno J. Terada S. Ohshima T.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8660-8673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) time periods, simultaneous loss of both tau and other microtubule-associated proteins may lead to more severe phenotypes (20.DiTella M.C. Feiguin F. Carri N. Kosik K.S. Caceres A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third hypothesis is that tau modified post-translationally (e.g. by hyperphosphorylation or truncation) may be directly toxic to cells (21.Park S.Y. Ferreira A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5365-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22.Shimura H. Schwartz D. Gygi S.P. Kosik K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4869-4876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, aggregation could be protective for cells by sequestering toxic species. Resolving the role of tau fibrillization in disease is important for assessing the potential of tau-directed therapies. However, directly testing the above hypotheses in biological models has been complicated by the resistance of full-length tau isoforms to spontaneous aggregation over experimentally tractable time periods (23.Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The problem has been overcome by high level tau overexpression alone (24.Andorfer C. Acker C.M. Kress Y. Hof P.R. Duff K. Davies P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5446-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 25.Wittmann C.W. Wszolek M.F. Shulman J.M. Salvaterra P.M. Lewis J.

Kotilinek L. Ingelsson M. Guimaraes A. DeTure M. Ramsden M. McGowan E. Forster C. Yue M. Orne J. Janus C. Mariash A. Kuskowski M. Hyman B. Hutton M. Ashe K.H. Science. 2005; 309: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Conditions that drive aggregation-promoting post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation (27.Sato S. Tatebayashi Y. Akagi T. Chui D.H. Murayama M. Miyasaka T. Planel E. Tanemura K. Sun X. Hashikawa T. Yoshioka K. Ishiguro K. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42060-42065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)) also have been successful. But the efficiency of fibrillization is frequently low, whereas mere overexpression of normal tau in neurons results in a toxic phenotype (28.Terwel D. Lasrado R. Snauwaert J. Vandeweert E. Van Haesendonck C. Borghgraef P. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3963-3973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because levels of normal tau protein do not increase in AD (4.Khatoon S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the significance of overexpression-mediated toxicity found in transgenic systems has been ambiguous. Recently we found that the kinetic barrier to full-length tau fibrillization can be overcome by small-molecule ligands that bind β-sheet structures such as CR (Congo red), thiazin red, and thioflavin S (23.Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ability of CR to populate amyloidgenic protein conformations (29.Kim Y.S. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Stevens F.J. Carpenter J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10842-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) suggests that these agents drive aggregation by thermodynamic linkage of their binding reaction with the tau self-association reaction (linkage refers to the influence of ligand binding on other equilibria including aggregation reactions and phase transitions (30.Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage: Functional Chemistry of Biological Macromolecules. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990Google Scholar)). As a result, fibrillization agonists facilitate the study of full-length tau fibrillization in the absence of post-translational modifications, mutations, or macromolecular inducers such as heparin (23.Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we extend this approach to cell culture as a means of examining the role of full-length tau fibrillization on acute toxicity.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 36.Necula M. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Images were viewed in a Phillips CM 12 transmission electron microscope operated at 65 kV, and captured on film at 22,000-fold magnification. Five fields were imaged per sample. All filaments in each image were counted and average total length adsorbed per field (Γf) was calculated ± S.D. Cell Culture−HEK-293 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), whereas an HEK-293-derived cell line stably expressing human htau40 (stable tau cells) was prepared as described previously (37.Li G. Yin H. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15938-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A stable tetracycline-inducible htau40 cell line (inducible tau cells) was prepared in Trex-293 cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions and the same plasmid construct used to create stable tau cells. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (37 °C with 5% CO2). Stable tau cells were grown under selection with 0.5 mg/ml G418, whereas inducible tau cells were grown in 5 μg/ml blasticidin and 0.4 μg/ml zeocin. Tau expression was induced in these cells with tetracycline (1 μg/ml). To assay the effect of CR on tau aggregation and cell viability, all cells were plated and cultured for 24 h, treated with varying concentrations of CR, and harvested after 1–14 days of treatment. CR was refreshed with each change of media. Isolation of Soluble and Insoluble Tau−The solubility of cell-derived tau protein was assayed under microtubule-destabilizing conditions. CR-treated tau cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3NO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× complete protease inhibitors), subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles (38.Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Bruce J. Richter-Landsberg C. Zhang B. Hong M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4093-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min to induce the disassembly of microtubules. Nuclei were removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resultant extracts were centrifuged (100,000 × g for 1 h) at 4 °C. The resultant pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, then resuspended in lysis buffer (1/3, v/v, relative to the total volume of supernatant). Equal volumes of pellet and supernatant fractions were boiled and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. Aliquots of in vitro aggregation reactions were processed similarly after centrifugation, except that pellets were washed with PBS before being resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Immunoelectron Microscopy−Tau aggregates were isolated from CR-treated tau cells by a modification of the procedure used to isolate authentic PHF (39.Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in ice-cold buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.8 m NaCl, 10% sucrose and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4), and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. Supernatant fractions (S1) were saved, whereas pellet fractions (P1) were re-homogenized in buffer H and separated into S2 and P2 fractions by centrifugation (20 min at 20,000 × g). Supernatant fractions S1 and S2 were combined and incubated with 1% Sarkosyl for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. After centrifugation of the mixture (1 h at 100,000 × g), the resultant pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Aliquots were absorbed onto Formvar/carbon-coated grids and incubated with the Tau12 monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with 0.1% gelatin, grids were incubated with the 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min, and viewed by electron microscopy as described above. Tubulin Assays−To assess tubulin binding activity of tau aggregates prepared in vitro, His6-htau40 (1 μm) treated with CR (10 μm) for various lengths of time was incubated with 1 mg/ml purified tubulin at 37 °C for 30 min in binding buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP) in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody for 2 h after which protein G-agarose beads (40 μl of 25% (w/v) slurry) were added and incubation continued for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min), washed three times with lysis buffer, and finally subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. For these experiments, input tubulin was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. To assay the influence of aggregation on the ability of tau to bind endogenous tubulin, lysates (100 μg) were prepared from CR-treated or non-treated stable tau cells as described above, after which tubulin was immunoprecipitated with anti-α-tubulin antibody and protein G-agarose as described above. For these experiments, levels of endogenous tubulin cell lysates were estimated by immunoblot analysis with anti-α-tubulin antibody. To assay tubulin polymerization, 1 mg/ml tubulin was incubated (37 °C) in binding buffer containing 10% glycerol with or without 10 μm CR. The time course of polymerization was followed as classically described (40.Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar), except that absorbance was measured at 380 nm (instead of 350 nm) to minimize the absorbance contribution from CR. Immunoblot Analysis−Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (37.Li G. Yin H. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15938-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified with a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated laser densitometer. Cell Death Assay−Inducible tau cells grown in the presence or absence of 10 μm CR and tetracycline inducer for up to 4 days were isolated by trypsinization, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, dispensed in triplicate into 96-well black-walled flat bottom plates (Costar) at initial seeding densities of ≤100,000 cells/well, and incubated with ToPro-3 (5 μm for 30 min), a fluorescent DNA-intercalating dye taken up by dead but not live cells (41.Lee-MacAry A.E. Ross E.L. Davies D. Laylor R. Honeychurch J. Glennie M.J. Snary D. Wilkinson R.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 252: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42.Wilkinson R.W. Lee-MacAry A.E. Davies D. Snary D. Ross E.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 258: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ToPro-3 uptake was then measured directly in a FlexStation plate reader (λem = 640 nm; λex = 670 nm) relative to a cell-free blank reaction. Immunocytochemistry−Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 24 h, then grown in the presence or absence of 10 μm CR for up to 4 days. Cells were then harvested at various time points, chilled on ice for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with methanol at -20 °C. Following PBS washes, cells were sequentially labeled with primary monoclonal antibodies Tau5 (1:200) and MAB1864 (1:200) and secondary antibodies Alexa 546-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) and/or Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:400) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. When present, ToPro-3 was incubated at 5 μm for 1.5 h. Coverslips were then mounted with Vectashield and visualized with a Leica TCS SL laser-scanning confocal system operated at wavelengths optimized for simultaneous detection of Alexa 546 (λex = 546 nm; λem = 555–620) and Cy5 (λex = 633 nm; λem = 650–750) or ToPro-3 (λex = 640 nm; λem = 650–750 nm) in the presence of tau-bound CR (λex = 488 nm; λem = 500–535). Analytical Methods−Aggregation progress curves were modeled as a monomolecular growth scheme assuming pseudo-first order kinetics. Filament growth was fit to the function,y=y0+y∞(1-e(-kappt))(Eq.1) where y, y0, and y∞ correspond to filament length or mass at time t, at time 0, and at infinite time, respectively, and kapp is the apparent first-order rate constant. For in vitro reactions, y0 was always set equal to zero. Consistent with this model, time-dependent loss of soluble tau was fit to a simple exponential decay function,m=m0e(-kappt)(Eq.2) where m and m0 correspond to soluble tau mass at time t and time 0, respectively, and kapp is the apparent first-order decay rate constant. Concentration-response curves were fit to log normal distributions as described previously (23.Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All linear and non-linear regression fits are reported ± S.E. of the estimate. The probability that an observed difference in the mean of replicates was statistically significant was determined by Student’s t test. CR Induces Tau Fibrillization in Vitro−Certain aromatic heterocytes including thiazin red, thioflavin S, and CR are capable of inducing tau fibrillization in vitro (23.Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, however, only CR entered HEK-293 cells over a period of days on the basis of color uptake (data not shown). Therefore, CR was used as tau fibrillization inducer in all subsequent experiments. To establish the concentration optimum for tau fibrillization in vitro, varying concentrations of CR were incubated (37 °C for up to 96 h) with 1 μm His6-htau40 and assayed for fibrillization using quantitative transmission electron microscopy. No filaments were formed in the absence of CR under these conditions (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the presence of CR-induced filaments that grew as twisted ribbons with maximum widths of 19 ± 4 nm (n = 50), minimum widths of 8 ± 2 nm (n = 50), and half-periodicity of 114 ± 16 nm (n = 32) (Fig. 1B). CR concentration dependence was biphasic, and the data could be fit to a log-normal concentration effect profile to yield an estimate of optimum potency at 19.9 ± 0.5 μm CR (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that CR was ∼6-fold more potent than thiazin red as a tau fibrillization inducer (23.Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5862-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and established an optimum CR concentration range of 10–20 μm. The time course of CR-mediated aggregation (1 μm His6-htau40) was estimated at 10 μm CR. At these reactant concentrations, fibrillization proceeded without a perceptible lag and yielded well resolved filaments for the first 48 h. After that time, however, filaments formed tangled masses that were impossible to quantify by transmission electron microscopy methods (Fig. 1C). When the first 48 h of reaction was modeled as a first-order approach to plateau using the monomolecular equation (Equation 1), kapp, the first-order rate constant for growth of the filament population was 0.28 ± 0.03 h-1. Together these data demonstrate that fibrillization of micromolar concentrations of full-length tau protein can be rapidly induced by 10 μm CR under near physiological conditions. To test the solubility of CR-induced tau filaments in vitro, aliquots from tau assembly mixtures used for the transmission electron microscopy study were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and separated into supernatant and pellet fractions. Tau protein was then detected by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody, Tau5, that binds a continuous, nonphosphorylated epitope common to all human tau species (35.Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The results showed that tau gradually shifted from the soluble to the pellet fraction over time in the presence of CR (Fig. 2, A and B). The rate of loss of soluble tau was well fit by an exponential decay, consistent with the first-order aggregation model (Fig. 2C). The apparent first-order rate constant for loss of soluble tau, kapp, was 0.10 ± 0.02 h-1. This value was not statistically different from the kapp determined from appearance of tau in the pellet fraction (0.12 ± 0.07 h-1), but was significantly lower than kapp determined from length measurements (Fig. 1). These results indicate that sedimentation is a less sensitive assay method than electron microscopy (e.g. it fails to capture short filaments), or that length and mass share a complex relationship (e.g. because of heterogeneous nucleation occurring along the length of filaments). Overall, however, sedimentation was an adequate method for estimating tau aggregation kinetics in the presence of CR and one that was applicable to cellular models. Congo Red Induces Tau Aggregation in Cell Culture−To determine whether CR could induce tau aggregation in cell culture, HEK-293 cells stably overexpressing the longest human tau isoform (stable tau cells) were incubated with varying concentrations of CR for 7 days. HEK-293 cells were chosen for this experiment because they tolerate high-level tau overexpression (5.3 ± 0.6 pg/cell, n = 4 determinations, data not shown) without serious toxicity (Ref. 37.Li G.

ADAR1 and ADAR2 form respective homodimers, and this association is essential for their enzymatic activities. In this investigation, we set out experiments aiming to determine whether formation of the homodimer complex is mediated by an amino acid interface made through protein-protein interactions of two monomers or via binding of the two subunits to a dsRNA substrate. Point mutations were created in the dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) that abolished all RNA binding, as tested for two classes of ADAR ligands, long and short dsRNA. The mutant ADAR dimer complexes were intact, as demonstrated by their ability to co-purify in a sequential affinity-tagged purification and also by their elution at the dimeric fraction position on a size fractionation column. Our results demonstrated ADAR dimerization independent of their binding to dsRNA, establishing the importance of protein-protein interactions for dimer formation. As expected, these mutant ADARs could no longer perform their catalytic function due to the loss in substrate binding. Surprisingly, a chimeric dimer consisting of one RNA binding mutant monomer and a wild type partner still abolished its ability to bind and edit its substrate, indicating that ADAR dimers require two subunits with functional dsRBDs for binding to a dsRNA substrate and then for editing activity to occur.

ADARs are also present in invertebrates, such as a single Drosophila member (dADAR) that is similar to the mammalian ADAR2 (30.Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), as well as two less conserved Caenorhabditis elegans members (c.e.ADR1 and c.e.ADR2) (22.Kim U. Wang Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The common structural features shared by mammalian ADARs include dsRBDs repeated two or three times that are located in the N-terminal region and the C-terminal deaminase domain that provide the catalytic action (22.Kim U.

Evidence suggests that dsRBDs consisting of 65–70 amino acids provide general binding with little sequence selectivity, although the number and distance between dsRBDs may provide some specificity for its substrates and recognize distinct structural determinants within dsRNA (27.Lai F.

Two reported dsRBD structures for Xenopus laevis RNA-binding protein A (Xlrbpa) and the Drosophila Staufen protein interacting with dsRNA reveal that the domain makes important contacts across the major groove of a dsRNA helix (36.Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 37.Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These dsRBD contacts span 16 base pairs of dsRNA and interact with the phosphate oxygen backbone and not specific nucleotides (36.Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C.

A common structural theme of these domains appears to be the interaction of a cluster of lysines in a KKXXK motif (X is any amino acid), and mutagenesis of these residues reduces binding to dsRNA (36.Ryter J.M.

Likewise, ADARs contain this KKXXK motif in their dsRBDs, and deletions or site-directed mutagenesis also indicates that they are important for function (33.Stefl R. Xu M. Skrisovska L. Emeson R.B.

More recently, the NMR structures of the two dsRBDs of ADAR2 modeled with dsRNA verify the magnitude to which these lysines are significant (33.Stefl R. Xu M. Skrisovska L. Emeson R.B. Allain F.H. Structure. 2006; 14: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that ADARs act as a dimer in mammals and flies (40.Gallo A. Keegan L.P.

In vitro, mammalian ADAR1 and ADAR2 form homodimers, which is required for A → I editing activity (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is proposed that this dimer interaction allows for the proper formation of active site alignment to deaminate the adenosine moiety (40.Gallo A. Keegan L.P. Ring G.M.

Currently, it is not known whether the interplay between the monomers act cooperatively with respect to their dsRBDs. By use of fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, an examination of ADAR dimerization revealed that the N-terminal dsRBDs are providing much of the interface for the monomer subunits to interact in mammalian cells (43.Chilibeck K.A.

Although several publications by our group and others on the mammalian ADARs point to dimerization that is independent of RNA binding (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M.

RNA. 2006; 12: 1350-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some studies on human ADAR2 suggest that the protein exists only as a monomeric form (32.Macbeth M.R. Schubert H.L.

RNA. 2004; 10: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These discrepancies may result from a difference in species and techniques used. In summary, it remains to be established whether formation of the dimer complex is mediated by an amino acid interface made through protein-protein interactions of two monomers or via binding of the two subunits to a dsRNA substrate. In this present study, we have addressed the question by creating mutations for ADAR1 and ADAR2 within the dsRBDs that result in the total loss of all binding for long and short dsRNA. These dsRNA binding-deficient ADARs nevertheless dimerize identically to their wild type counterparts, revealing that ADAR dimerization is not mediated by dsRNA. Furthermore, our data indicate that two monomers with functional dsRBDs are required by a dimer for dsRNA binding and A → I editing activities. Plasmid Construction−Wild type plasmids pBac-F-ADAR1, pBac-H-ADAR1, pBac-F-ADAR2, and pBac-H-ADAR2, corresponding to the human genes (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M.

The full-length ADAR1 (p150) and the ADAR2a splicing isoform (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Mutations were created in each of the three dsRBDs of ADAR1 and in each of the two dsRBDs of ADAR2 separately by PCR and then combined through cloning (Fig. 1A). This introduced mutations in the lysines of the KKXXK motif to generate EAXXA at these amino acid locations (Fig. 1B). The mutations in ADAR1 that were introduced at dsRBD1 were K554E, K555A, and K558A; at dsRBD2, K665E, K666A, and K669A; and at dsRBD3, K777E, K778A, and K781A. Mutations created in the first dsRBD of ADAR2 included K127E, K128A, and K131A, and those in the second dsRBD consisted of K281E, K282A, and K285A. PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides creating specific nucleotide changes for silent DNA restriction sites and amino acid mutations are in bold, with the newly created silent endonuclease sites underlined. The mutagenic oligonucleotides for ADAR1 used in this study are A1-EAA1s (+BglI), 5′-GCTGAAGCTGGAAGCGAGGCCGTGGCGGCGCAGGATGCAGCTATGAAAGC-3′; A1-EAA2s (+ApaLI), 5′-CCAGTGTGAGTGCACCCAGCGAGGCAGTGGCAGCGCAGATGGCCGCAGAGG-3′; and A1-EAA3s (+BglI), 5′-CGTCTGCGCACACAGCGAGGCCCAAGGGGCGCAGGAAGCAGCAGATGC-3′.

ADAR Expression, Purification, and Detection−The resulting expression constructs pBac-F-ADAR1(EAA1,2,3), pBac-H-ADAR1(EAA1,2,3), pBac-F-ADAR2(EAA1,2), and pBac-H-ADAR2(EAA1,2) contain a FLAG or His6 tag, respectively. Briefly, Sf9 insect cells were individually infected or co-infected with two ADAR recombinant baculoviruses (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The extracted proteins were either purified with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-agarose gel (Sigma) column or, for the His6-containing proteins, with a TALON metal resin (BD Biosciences) column. Proteins expressed as a co-infection of FLAG and His6 epitope-tagged ADARs were sequentially purified with both affinity columns, beginning in either direction. If necessary, the final eluted proteins were concentrated using Centriplus spin columns (Millipore). The yield of eluted proteins was determined by Western blotting analysis. The primary monoclonal antibodies used in this study are anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-His6 (BD Biosciences), mAb15.8.6 (anti-ADAR1), and mAb1.3.1 (anti-ADAR2) (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T.

Functional Assays−Filter binding assays were carried out in triplicate using the recombinant ADAR proteins and a synthetic long c-Myc dsRNA (583 base pairs) labeled with [α-32P]ATP (29.Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The amount of dsRNA substrate ranged from 0.1 to 6.4 nm. For the base modification assay of the A → I editing activity, the recombinant protein was tested also with the c-Myc dsRNA (38.Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17098-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was conducted using a 19-base-pair enhanced green fluorescent protein short interfering RNA as the short dsRNA substrate, as described previously (18.Yang W. Wang Q. Howell K.L. Lee J.T. Cho D.S. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3946-3953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Column Chromatography−Purified protein (1 ug) was injected into a 500-μl loop and applied to a Superose 12 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The molecular weight of ADAR proteins was ascertained by comparison to known molecular mass standards obtained from Sigma. The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000 (void), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). The peak position of each protein standard was determined by optical absorption at 280 nm. The peak position for ADAR1 and ADAR2 was confirmed by Western blotting analysis of the fractions. Mutating the KKXXK Motif Lysines in the dsRBDs Abolishes Binding to Long dsRNA−The co-structures of a dsRBD protein bound to dsRNA revealed the importance of several lysines in a KKXXK motif for making crucial contacts across the major groove of dsRNA (36.Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 37.Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our goal was to generate point mutations for ADAR1 and ADAR2 in the KKXXK motif of each dsRBD to create a protein that would no longer bind dsRNA (Fig. 1A) and then investigate its dimerization aspects. For the Staufen protein, conversion of these KKXXK amino acid residues to EAXXA results in a dramatic loss of dsRNA binding in vivo (37.Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These mutations have been shown not to alter the protein folding as assayed by various structural methods (37.Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To this end, we created substitutions in ADAR1 and ADAR2 for each KKXXK motif converting it to EAXXA. The KKXXK mutation to EAXXA will be referred to as “EAA” throughout the text for the glutamate, alanine, and alanine substitution introduced (Fig. 1B). Our new FLAG-tagged ADAR (EAA) mutants were purified, and Western blotting analysis confirmed production of the full-length proteins. ADAR1 (EAA) and ADAR2 (EAA) were examined for their ability to bind long dsRNA by using a 585-base-pair c-Myc dsRNA (29.Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As anticipated, these dsRBD mutant ADARs were deficient in dsRNA binding as compared with the wild type forms of the protein (Fig. 2A). This demonstrated the importance of the KKXXK motif in dsRNA binding for ADAR. As expected, our ADAR1 (EAA) and ADAR2 (EAA) mutants that abolished binding to dsRNA completely lacked RNA editing activity as tested on a long synthetic c-Myc dsRNA substrate (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3dsRBD mutant ADARs completely lack the A → I modification activity. The A → I conversion of c-Myc dsRNA (20 fmol) was monitored with increasing amounts of purified recombinant ADAR1 (WT and EAA) (right panel, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 ng) and ADAR2 (WT and EAA) (left panel, 5, 10, 20, and 40 ng) proteins. Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction products were deproteinized, digested with P1 nuclease, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. pA, 5′-AMP; pI, 5′-IMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) dsRBD Mutant ADARs Are Unable to Bind Short dsRNA−One outstanding question on ADAR dimerization was whether this association was truly RNA binding-independent. Previously, RNases were utilized to show that dimerization was RNA binding-independent in vitro (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and subsequently in vivo (43.Chilibeck K.A. Wu T. Liang C. Schellenberg M.J. Gesner E.M. Lynch J.M. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16530-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, uncertainties still remained with the RNase treatment as to whether short dsRNA duplexes could have been protected by the ADAR protein and consequently lead to the two monomers becoming associated. We therefore needed to determine that the ADAR (EAA) mutants could not bind these types of substrate. Short dsRNA duplexes, such as short interfering RNAs, are bound with very high affinity by ADAR (18.Yang W. Wang Q. Howell K.L. Lee J.T. Cho D.S. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3946-3953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using a 19-base-pair short interfering RNA duplex shows that the wild type proteins are able to bind this ligand, whereas ADAR1 (EAA) and ADAR2 (EAA) mutants are incapable of binding (Fig. 2B). These results rule out the possibility of short dsRNA duplexes bringing the two subunits together for dimer formation. Dimerization of dsRNA Binding-defective ADARs−Having demonstrated the incapability of ADAR (EAA) mutants for the binding to long and short dsRNA, we investigated their dimerization by sequential co-purification of differentially epitope-tagged ADAR proteins as employed previously (42.Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-tagged versions of ADAR1 (EAA) and ADAR2 (EAA) were produced to differentiate it from the FLAG-tagged partner. Co-infection of two separate baculoviruses in insect cells resulted in co-expression of FLAG (denoted as F)- and His (denoted as H)-tagged subunits of ADAR1 or ADAR2. First, the ADAR recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on the M2 anti-FLAG mAb column and then on the TALON metal resin column for the His6 tag purification. Each chromatography step was monitored by Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG- or anti-His6-specific antibody, which indicated that an F/H dimeric complex was retrieved from the second column (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12). Both ADAR1 (EAA) and ADAR2 (EAA) were purified as oligomeric complexes containing both FLAG- and His-tagged protein (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 10 for ADAR1 and lanes 6 and 12 for ADAR2). The reversed purification sequence was also performed to confirm the results of our co-purification scheme (data not shown). These dsRBD mutant ADARs that lack dsRNA binding but are capable of homodimerization just like their wild type counterparts suggest that ADAR dimerization is independent of its binding to dsRNA. In our dimerization model, we hypothesized that mostly all ADAR protein is in an oligomeric form. This would make the major three combinations of monomer subunit for dimer formation to be F/F, F/H, and H/H in a relative ratio of 1:2:1 but would not necessarily exclude the possibility that a small fraction of monomeric protein exists. We quantitated each step of the affinity column chromatography by Western blot and calibration with known ADAR amounts that were used as loading controls. From the material that bound on the first affinity column (FLAG M2 Ab), 80–90% of the FLAG-tagged subunit was eluted from this resin, whereas a substantial amount of the His-tagged subunit was washed away; however, 30–45% still remained (Table 1, see column titled “FLAG column elution”). Upon collecting, pooling, and loading the complete FLAG eluate (containing F/F- and F/H-tagged dimers) onto the TALON column for His6 purification, we then quantitated again each tagged subunit. The His-tagged protein completely bound and eluted from the TALON resin, whereas the FLAG protein was partially washed away (Table 1, see column titled “His column elution”). Presumably, the protein that was displaced off of the second column represents F/F homodimers of ADAR1 and ADAR2, respectively. We anticipated, according to our expected statistical distribution"

Instead, the most notable effect seen when this interaction domain is absent is loss of the ability of ATM to induce apoptosis.

The functional interaction between the MRE11 complex and ATM has been proposed to require a conserved C-terminal domain of NBS1 for recruitment of ATM to sites of DNA damage4,5. Human Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) cells and those derived from multiple mouse models of NBS express a hypomorphic NBS1 allele that exhibits impaired ATM activity despite having an intact C-terminal domain3,6,7,8,9,10,11. This indicates that the NBS1 C terminus is not sufficient for ATM function. We derived Nbs1ΔC/ΔC mice in which the C-terminal ATM interaction domain is deleted. Nbs1ΔC/ΔC cells exhibit intra-S-phase checkpoint defects, but are otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type cells with respect to other checkpoint functions, ionizing radiation sensitivity and chromosome stability. However, multiple tissues of Nbs1ΔC/ΔC mice showed a severe apoptotic defect, comparable to that of ATM- or CHK2-deficient animals. Analysis of p53 transcriptional targets and ATM substrates showed that, in contrast to the phenotype of Chk2-/- mice, NBS1ΔC does not impair the induction of proapoptotic genes. Instead, the defects observed in Nbs1ΔC/ΔC result from impaired phosphorylation of ATM targets including SMC1 and the proapoptotic factor, BID."

Rev. 2005; 49: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that EphB-ephrinB binding regulates the function of excitatory synapses and synaptic plasticity by initiating forward signaling cascades that regulate phosphorylation of Src kinases and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) activity (5.Palmer A. Klein R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1429-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 7.Ghosh A. Science. 2002; 295: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9.Yamaguchi Y. Pasquale E.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The cytosolic region of EphB receptors contains a tyrosine kinase domain (10.Ellis C. Kasmi F. Ganju P. Walls E. Panayotou G. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1727-1736PubMed Google Scholar) and a highly conserved sequence motif that is a major site for autophosphorylation by the EphB tyrosine kinase. This EphB motif interacts with Src-homology domain-containing factors, including Ras GTPase-activating proteins and Src kinases (4.Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that mechanisms by which adhesive and signaling interactions between EphB2 receptor and ephrinB2 ligands are terminated include endocytosis of the cell surface EphB-ephrinB complexes and cleavage of the ectodomain of ephrinB ligands (11.Zimmer M. Palmer A. Kohler J. Klein R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12.Marston D.J. Dickinson S. Nobes C.D. Nat.

These processes reduce contact between the receptor and ligand-expressing cells and convert the initial cell-cell adhesion into a repulsion mediated by Rac signaling and actin polymerization. Ligand-induced endocytic vesicles internalized in the EphB-expressing cells contain EphB-ephrinB complexes and surrounding membranes deriving from both cells, but the fate of the internalized protein complex is not clear (11.Zimmer M. Palmer A. Kohler J. Klein R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12.Marston D.J. Dickinson S. Nobes C.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Like other substrates of the metalloproteinase (MP)/γ-secretase system (14.Marambaud P. Robakis N.K. Genes Brain Behav. 2005; 4: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), EphB receptors are cell surface proteins containing an extensive extracellular (ectodomain) region, a transmembrane sequence, and a cytoplasmic domain. We thus asked whether a MP/γ-secretase system participates in the processing of EphB2 receptor and its internalized complexes. Here we present evidence that two distinct pathways, one stimulated by calcium influx and the other by ephrinB2 ligands, regulate proteolytic processing of EphB2 receptor and its complexes. Both pathways involve a cleavage within the extracellular domain and processing of the remaining membrane bound fragment by the presenilin1 (PS1)-dependent γ-secretase system. Only ephrinB ligands, however, stimulate ubiquitination of EphB2 receptor.

The sequence encoding a FLAG tag was inserted at the end of the EphB2 cDNA, and the resulting FLAG-EphB2 sequence was subcloned into the NotI sites of pQCXIP (Clontech).

Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting−Cell lysates for Western blotting (WB) were prepared in SDS lysis buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). Lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation as described (15.Georgakopoulos A. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Cui W. Li H.C. Schutte M. Gordon R. Holstein G.R. Martinelli G. Mehta P. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For separation of EphB2/CTF1 and EphB2/CTF2, 12% Protean II XL SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) were used. EphB2 fragments CTF1 and CTF2 were purified for sequencing from EphB2-transfected HEK293T cultures in the absence of ephrinB ligand. EphB2 Is Cleaved by PS1-dependent γ-Secretase−To investigate whether EphB2 receptor is processed by the γ-secretase system, we used WB to probe embryonic brain extract from PS1 null (PS1–/–) and WT (PS1+/+) mice. Antibodies against the cytoplasmic sequence of EphB2 receptor detected a peptide of an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (designated EphB2/CTF1) in the brains of PS1–/– but not in the brains of PS1+/+ mice (Fig. 1A). The immunoreactivity and apparent molecular mass of this peptide suggest that it is derived from EphB2 receptor and may contain all of its cytoplasmic and transmembrane sequences. Accumulation of EphB2/CTF1 in PS1 null mice suggests that this peptide is metabolized by the PS1-dependent γ-secretase system and may be produced following cleavage of the extracellular region of EphB receptor similar to a number of type I transmembrane proteins (14.Marambaud P. Robakis N.K. Genes Brain Behav. 2005; 4: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A peptide similar to brain EphB2/CTF1 accumulates in EphB2 receptor-transfected PS1–/–, but not in PS1+/+, cells (Fig. 1B), further confirming the identity of EphB2/CTF1 and its degradation by the PS-γ-secretase system. To detect the fragment expected from the γ-secretase cleavage of EphB2/CTF1 (termed EphB2/CTF2), we employed the in vitro γ-secretase assay (17.Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell. 2003; 114: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 21.Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using membranes from EphB2-transfected PS1–/– and PS1+/+ fibroblasts. As expected, EphB2/CTF2 is produced in membranes from PS1+/+ but not from PS1–/– cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4), and its production is sensitive to γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (Fig. 1C, lane 5). Proteasomal inhibitor LC prevents degradation of γ-secretase-produced cytosolic peptides and is used for their in vivo detection (18.Georgakopoulos A. Litterst C. Ghersi E. Baki L. Xu C. Serban G. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1242-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22.Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49976-49981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because LC was toxic to our fibroblasts, we used HEK293T cells overexpressing EphB2 receptor to detect intracellular EphB2/CTF2 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). Production of this peptide is inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitors with a concomitant accumulation of its precursor EphB2/CTF1 (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Conditioned media from overnight cultures contain a polypeptide of ∼90 kDa (termed EphB2/NTF) recognized by antibodies specific to extracellular EphB2 receptor (Fig. 1E). The apparent molecular mass of this peptide suggests it contains most of extracellular EphB2 receptor and may be the counterpart of EphB2/CTF1. Together, our data show that similar to other type I transmembrane receptors, EphB2 is cleaved within the ectodomain sequence to produce EphB2/NTF that is released to the medium and cellular EphB2/CTF1 that is further metabolized by the PS1-γ-secretase system to produce EphB2/CTF2 (Fig. 2A). Determination of the Processing Sites of EphB2 Receptor−EphB2/CTF1 and EphB2/CTF2 were affinity-purified from HEK293T cells overexpressing EphB2 receptor (Fig. 1D). Edman sequencing of EphB2/CTF1 through 10 cycles showed the following major sequence: SIKEKLPLIV. This is a unique sequence that corresponds to mouse EphB2 residues 544–553. These data show that the ectodomain cleavage site of EphB2 receptor is located seven amino acids upstream of its predicted transmembrane sequence (Fig. 2A). Thus, the 50-kDa EphB2/CTF1 is produced by a cleavage within the ectodomain region of EphB2 receptor after residue 543 (Fig. 2A, MP site) and contains the 451 C-terminal residues of EphB2 receptor, including all transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequence (Fig. 2A). Mass spectrometric analysis of lysine-C digests of EphB2/CTF2 (48.3 kDa) yielded peptide AIVCNRRGFERADSEYTDK (m/z 2287.00, +0.07). This is a unique sequence corresponding to mouse EphB2 receptor residues 570–588 located at the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of the receptor. The mass spectrometric analysis of EphB2/CTF2 yielded additional peptides all derived from the cytoplasmic sequence of EphB2 receptor (not shown). These results show that the γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of EphB2 receptor takes place between residues 569 and 570, three amino acids upstream of the C-terminal end of the predicted transmembrane sequence (Fig. 2A). This cleavage produces peptide EphB2/CTF2 containing the 425 C-terminal amino acids of EphB2 receptor (Fig. 2A). The close proximity of this cleavage site to the membrane/cytosol interface indicates it is analogous to the γ-secretase-catalyzed epsilon (ε)-cleavage sites observed in many PS-γ-secretase substrates (23.Robakis N.K. Marambaud P. Thiel G. Transcription Factors in the Nervous System. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, Germany2006: 399-461Google Scholar). PS1 Familial Alzheimer Disease Mutants Inhibit the γ-Secretase Cleavage of EphB2/CTF1−Recent evidence shows that PS1 FAD mutations may inhibit the PS1-dependent ε-cleavage of many substrates suggesting that FAD mutations cause a loss of cleavage function at this site (17.Marambaud P.

Fig. 2B shows that several PS1 FAD mutants, including P117L, ΔE9, A260V, P264L, and E280G as well as the γ-secretase dominant negative PS1 mutant D257A (25.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), are impaired in their ability to stimulate production of EphB2/CTF2 compared with WT PS1. PS1 FAD mutants A246E and M146L, however, showed no inhibition in their ability to increase EphB2/CTF2. These data show that certain PS1 FAD mutations interfere with the ability of PS1 to mediate cleavage of EphB2/CTF1 at the ε-site. Calcium Influx and Ligand Binding Stimulate Distinct Processing of EphB2 Receptor−Calcium influx stimulates a MP/γ-secretase processing of transmembrane proteins (26.Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 27.Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 28.Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of calcium influx on the processing of EphB2, cell cultures expressing this receptor were treated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin as described (26.Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in the rapid decrease of full-length EphB2 and in a concomitant increase of both cellular EphB2/CTF1 and medium EphB2/NTF (Fig. 3, left panel), suggesting that extracellular EphB2 is rapidly released to the conditioned media following cleavage of cell surface receptor. The half-life of EphB2 in the presence of ionomycin was <10 min, and by 15 min most receptor was degraded (Fig. 3, lanes 1–5). To further explore the physiological significance of the EphB2 processing, we asked whether it is regulated by ligand-receptor interactions. To this end, we treated our cultures with a clustered ephrinB2-Fc construct containing the extracellular domain of ephrinB2 ligand fused to Fc portion of IgG. This construct binds to and activates the EphB2 receptor mimicking the ligand effects (19.Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Following 2 h of treatment, the levels of cellular full-length receptor decreased while EphB2/CTF1 increased suggesting that ephrinB ligand stimulates the extracellular cleavage of EphB2. By 4 h of ligand treatment, most EphB2 receptor had been degraded. Examination of the conditioned medium, however, failed to show any increase in EphB2/NTF, the extracellular counterpart of EphB2/CTF1 (Fig. 3, right panel, lanes 6–10). Furthermore, examination of cell extract from ligand-treated cultures failed to detect any cell-associated EphB2/NTF (data not shown) suggesting that EphB2/NTF produced in response to ligand binding is rapidly degraded. Together, these data show that ephrinB ligands as well as calcium influx induce processing of EphB2 receptor, but the kinetics of EphB2 decrease and the appearance of degradation products differ significantly between the two conditions suggesting that these two factors stimulate distinct processing pathways. Distinct Enzymes Cleave Extracellular EphB2 in Response to Calcium Influx or Ligand Treatment−Cleavage within the ectodomain sequence of a number of cell surface transmembrane proteins, including cadherins, APP, and Notch1, is often catalyzed by enzymes sensitive to the broad spectrum MP inhibitor GM6001. In addition, the ectodomain of APP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE), an aspartyl protease sensitive to peptide inhibitor ZVLL (29.Abbenante G. Kovacs D.M. Leung D.L. Craik D.J. Tanzi R.E. Fairlie D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A (left panels) shows that GM6001 inhibits the ionomycin-stimulated metabolism of EphB2 and the production of both cell-associated EphB2/CTF1 and released EphB2/NTF suggesting that GM6001 blocks a MP cleavage of EphB2 ectodomain. GM6001, however, has no effect on the ligand-stimulated metabolism of EphB2 receptor (Fig. 4A, right panels). In contrast, peptide ZVLL inhibits the ligand-stimulated metabolism of EphB2 and the appearance of EphB2/CTF1 (Fig. 4B, right panels), but it has no effect on the ionomycin-stimulated metabolism of EphB2 and production of EphB2/CTF1 (Fig. 4B, left panels). Because ZVLL is not specific to BACE (29.Abbenante G. Kovacs D.M. Leung D.L. Craik D.J. Tanzi R.E. Fairlie D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we probed two additional BACE inhibitors, including Statin and the cell-permeable BACE inhibitor IV (30.Stachel S.J. Coburn C.A. Steele T.G. Jones K.G. Loutzenhiser E.F. Gregro A.R. Rajapakse H.A. Lai M.T. Crouthamel M.C. Xu M. Tugusheva K. Lineberger J.E. Pietrak B.L. Espeseth A.S. Shi X.P. Chen-Dodson E. Holloway M.K. Munshi S. Simon A.J. Kuo L. Vacca J.P. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 6447-6450Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). None of these was able to inhibit the ligand-induced processing of EphB2 (data not shown), suggesting that the activity responsible for the ligand-induced processing of EphB2 may differ from BACE. Together, these results show that, depending on the inducing agent, cleavage of the extracellular region of EphB2 involves two distinct activities, one sensitive to MP inhibitor GM 6001 and one sensitive to peptide inhibitor ZVLL. Because EphB2 interacts closely with NMDAR and regulates its activity (31.Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we asked whether calcium influx through NMDAR affects EphB2 processing. Fig. 4C (left panels) shows that treatment of rat embryo primary neuronal cultures (see “Experimental Procedures”) with NMDA, an agonist of NMDAR, increased production of EphB2/CTF1, and this increase was augmented by γ-secretase inhibitors (lanes 1–3). NMDA-induced production of EphB2/CTF1 was inhibited by the specific NMDAR antagonist d(–)-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) and by GM6001 indicating that stimulation of NMDAR induces a MP-like cleavage of EphB2 receptor (Fig. 4C, left panels, lanes 4–7). Treatment of primary neurons with ephrinB ligand results in the degradation of EphB2 and in the accumulation of EphB2/CTF1 in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 4C, right panels, lanes 1–3). As expected, this degradation was blocked by ZVLL (Fig. 4C, right panels, lane 4). Absence of EphB2/CTF1 accumulation upon ligand treatment may be due to rapid degradation of this peptide in primary neurons by γ-secretase. Other CTF1 fragments, including brain N-cadherin CTF1, also fail to accumulate due to γ-secretase activity (17.Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell. 2003; 114: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Together, our data show that stimulation of NMDAR induces a MP/γ-secretase processing of EphB2 receptor. In contrast, the ephrinB ligand-induced processing of this receptor is insensitive to MP inhibitors, but it is sensitive to ZVLL and to inhibitors of γ-secretase. Interestingly, the site of the ectodomain cleavage of EphB2 has the same relationship to the transmembrane region of EphB2 as the ectodomain cleavage site of E-cadherin to its transmembrane region. Both cleavage sites are located seven residues upstream of the putative outer face of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A and Ref. 26.Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Because the cadherin cleavage is mediated by ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) (27.Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), we used the potent ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X to examine whether this protease is involved in this cleavage. Fig. 4D shows that, at 50 nm, this inhibitor blocks the ionomycin-induced cleavage of EphB2 receptor"

Assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), 2The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; IMS, intermembrane space; IM, inner membrane. 2The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; IMS, intermembrane space; IM, inner membrane. the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a sophisticated, multistep process that involves a number of auxiliary proteins (1Khalimonchuk O. Rodel G. Mitochondrion. 2005; 5: 363-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Cobine P.A. Pierrel F. Winge D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 3Fontanesi F. Soto I.C. Horn D. Barrientos A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1129-C1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins have a specific role, such as heme A biosynthesis or translation of mitochondrial-encoded subunits. Other assembly proteins act as chaperones or facilitators of the assembly process. Among them are a series of copper-binding proteins implicated in the assembly of the two copper centers of CcO. Copper metallation of CcO occurs within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) and is mediated by metallochaperone proteins. Cox17 is a key copper donor to two accessory proteins, Sco1 and Cox11, to form the CuA and CuB copper centers in the mature CcO complex (4Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sco1 and Cox11 are each integral membrane proteins with C-terminal globular domains protruding into the IMS (5Khalimonchuk O. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The globular domain of Sco1 possesses a thioredoxin fold consisting of a central four-stranded β sheet covered with flanking helices (6Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Cioffi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 11: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two notable features of Sco proteins are a conserved pair of cysteinyl residues within a CXXXC motif and a conserved histidyl residue that forms a Cu(I) binding site. Mutations of the Cys or His residues abrogate Cu(I) binding and lead to a nonfunctional CcO complex and respiratory-deficient cells (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, the in vivo function of Sco1 correlates with Cu(I) binding. The globular domain of Cox11 adopts an immunoglobulin-like β fold. Three conserved Cys residues are candidate ligands for the Cu(I) ion. Mutation of these Cys residues attenuates Cu(I) binding as well as CcO function (10Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, like Sco1, the residues in Cox11 important for Cu(I)-binding correlate with in vivo function, suggesting that Cu(I) binding is important in Cox11 function. These observations are consistent with the postulate that Cu(I) ions donated to Sco1 and Cox11 via Cox17 are subsequently transferred to Cox2 and Cox1 for assembly of the CuA and CuB sites, respectively. The function of both Sco1 and Cox11 was predicted to be solely attributable to formation of CcO copper centers (11Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although recombinant Sco1 is isolated with bound Cu(I) ions in copper-supplemented bacterial cultures, attempts to crystallize the Cu(I)-Sco1 complex failed in a number of laboratories (7Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15202-15211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Abajian C.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structure of the Cu(I)-Sco1 complex was subsequently achieved by NMR spectroscopy (13Banci L. Bertini I. Calderone V. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Mangani S. Marinelli M. Palumma P. Wang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8595-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The inability to crystallize Sco1 with a bound Cu(I) led some investigators to speculate that Sco1 might function in CcO assembly independent of Cu(I) binding (7Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15202-15211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Ye Q. Imriskova-Sosova I. Hill B.C. Zia Z. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structural resemblance of Sco1 to peroxiredoxins and thioredoxins raised the possibility that Sco proteins may function as a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain the CuA site cysteines in the reduced state ready for metallation (14Chinenov Y.V. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Sco1 was suggested to function as a redox switch, in which oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) induces release of the Cu(II) ion, thereby permitting the two thiolates to participate in a peroxidase reaction. In support of a redox role for Sco1, sco1Δ yeast cells were observed to be sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (7Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15202-15211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, cox11Δ cells, but not cox17Δ or cox4Δ cells, are also peroxide-sensitive (15Pungartnik C. Kern M.F. Brendel M. Henriques J.A.P. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Banting G.S. Glerum D.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The apparent selective peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells suggested that Sco1 and Cox11 have a mitochondrial function independent of copper metallation. To elucidate the mechanism of the peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells, we surveyed a wide array of yeast mutants and isolated genetic suppressors. We show that the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells arises from a pro-oxidant Cox1 assembly intermediate involving Cox1 and heme A. We demonstrate that both Sco1 and Cox11 have protein chaperone roles in stabilizing Cox1 and Cox2 chains in addition to their copper transfer functions. These studies on hydrogen peroxide sensitivity in CcO assembly shed further insight into the assembly process. Strains and Growth Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. S. cerevisiae cells were grown in YP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) with either 2% glucose, raffinose, galactose, lactate, or glycerol as a carbon source or synthetic minimal medium supplemented with respective amino acids and 2% glucose or glycerol. For cloning and plasmid amplification, Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used. The culture medium used was as described (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Mantiatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids and Constructs—For all manipulations with DNA fragments and plasmids, standard procedures were used (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Mantiatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed as described (18Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying either the COX11 gene or its mutated forms (COX11-C111A, COX11-C208A, COX11-C210A) (10Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were used for complementation tests. Similarly, plasmids that carry the SCO1 gene or its mutated versions (SCO1-C148A, SCO1-C152A, SCO1-C181A, SCO1-C216A) were used (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We also used the Sco1/Cox11 chimera, consisting of the N-terminal part of Cox11, including the transmembrane helix, fused with the C-terminal moiety of Sco1 (19Carr H.S. Maxfield A.B. Horng Y.-C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22664-22669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for complementation tests. The human SCO1 open reading frame was PCR-amplified from templates described previously (20Horng Y.-C. Leary S.C. Cobine P.A. Young F.B.J. George G.N. Shoubridge E.A. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34113-34122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and cloned into pRS426 vector under the MET25 promoter (21Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). For overexpression of COX15, the open reading frame was subcloned into pRS426 under the MET25 promoter. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment of Yeast Cells—Cells of the respective strains or transformants were grown in full or selective liquid medium containing 2% glucose, at 30 °C. When cells reached midexponential growth, hydrogen peroxide was added to a final concentration of 0.5, 1, or 6 mm. After a 2-h incubation at 30 °C, cells were serially diluted and plated onto YPD plates. Heme synthesis was inhibited with 0.5 mm succinyl acetone (Sigma) for a 3-h period prior to the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen Peroxide Sensitivity Suppressor Screen—A high copy genomic library constructed using the total DNA isolated from S. cerevisiae with five times genome coverage was used to screen for high copy suppressors of peroxide sensitivity of cox11 null mutant. Each transformant was individually cultured in 96-well plates. Grown cells were treated as described above and stamped onto a YPD plate. Obtained colonies were analyzed and run through a second round of screening to exclude the false positives. Ten thousand transformants were analyzed. Retrieved AFG1 open reading frame was amplified from the total genomic DNA of wild-type BY4741 strain with the addition of a single Myc tag at the 3′-end and cloned into pRS426 vector under control of the MET25 promoter. Mitochondrial Localization Studies—Mitochondria were isolated as described (22Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CcO activities were determined as described (23Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. Taanman J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Alkaline extraction of proteins was performed as described (24Fijiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) using 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 10.5 or 11.5. Isolated mitochondria were treated with proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and analyzed as described (25Khalimonchuk O. Ott M. Funes S. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Herrmann J.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Assessment of Carbonylation Levels—Cells of the respective strains were grown overnight at 30 °C to middle exponential phase. Each culture was split into halves; one was treated with H2O2 as described above, and the second half served as a control. Carbonylation levels were assessed using the OxyBlot™ protein oxidation detection kit (Serologicals Corp., Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer's manual. In Vivo Labeling of Yeast Cells—Cells of the respective strains or transformants were grown and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide as described (26Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for 30 min. Following the labeling, cells were incubated at 37 °C, and samples were collected at time points 0, 10, 30, and 60 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Densitometric analysis was performed using Image J 1.35 software (available on the World Wide Web at image.bio.methods.free.fr/ijdoshell.html). As shown previously, yeast cells lacking Sco1 or Cox11 are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (15Pungartnik C. Kern M.F. Brendel M. Henriques J.A.P. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Banting G.S. Glerum D.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide for 2 h at 30 °C prior to plating out the cultures on rich growth medium in the absence of peroxide. Both mutants are growth-compromised in a pretreatment with 1 or 6 mm hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, A and B). The mutants are not sensitive to paraquat (16Banting G.S. Glerum D.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Cox11 are slightly, but reproducibly, more sensitive to peroxide than cells lacking Sco1 (Fig. 1, A and C). The peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells is manifest only in cells harvested in log phase, since stationary cultures are largely resistant to 6 mm hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). To establish that the peroxide sensitivity arose from the deletion of either SCO1 or COX11, transformants of the null strains with the wild-type gene were tested for hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. SCO1 transformants of sco1Δ cells and COX11 transformants of cox11Δ cells were insensitive to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, Sco1 mutants with substitutions of the two Cu(I)-binding Cys residues, Cys148 and Cys152, were also effective in suppressing the peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ cells (Fig. 1A). Likewise, Cox11 mutants with substitutions of three Cu(I)-binding Cys residues also were effective in suppressing the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells (Fig. 1A). Whereas cells harboring these mutant alleles of Sco1 and Cox11 are peroxide-resistant, the cells remain respiratory-deficient, since CcO assembly is impaired. The suppression of sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells is protein-specific. High copy SCO1 cannot suppress the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells, and overexpression of COX11 fails to suppress the peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ cells (Fig. 1B). However, a Sco1/Cox11 chimera consisting of the Sco1 N-terminal segment, including the transmembrane domain fused to the C-terminal globular domain of Cox11, was a weak suppressor of the peroxide sensitivity of both sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Human SCO1 fails to complement the respiratory defect of yeast sco1Δ cells, yet human SCO1 does reverse the peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that peroxide resistance requires one aspect of the Sco1 and Cox11 proteins but not the copper binding aspect. To uncover the source of the peroxide sensitivity in CcO assembly mutants, we screened a variety of additional CcO mutants for peroxide sensitivity. Cells lacking Cox1 are respiratory-deficient but resistant to 6 mm peroxide (Figs. 1C and 2). Cells lacking Cox2 or Cox3 are resistant to 1 mm peroxide but show sensitivity at 6 mm (Figs. 1C and 2). Cells lacking the translational activator Pet309 or Pet111 required for Cox1 and Cox2 translation, respectively, are resistant to hydrogen peroxide. Cells lacking Cox10, which functions in heme A formation, are resistant to peroxide, but cells lacking the Cox20 chaperone for Cox2 proteolytic maturation are partially sensitive to exposure to hydrogen peroxide (Figs. 1C and 2). One scenario is that cells lacking Cox20, Cox11, or Sco1 accumulate a transient intermediate in CcO assembly that may confer hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. Studies were undertaken to determine whether the pro-oxidant contains a CcO mitochondrial-encoded subunit. The peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ, cox11Δ, and cox20Δ cells is partially reversed by preincubation of those cultures with chloramphenicol for 10 min prior to exposure to peroxide (Fig. 3A). The presence of chloramphenicol inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. Chloramphenicol failed to suppress the peroxide sensitivity of ctt1Δ cells lacking the cytosolic Ctt1 catalase. In addition, the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells is abrogated by conversion of cox11Δ cells to a rho– state (Fig. 3B). Cox1 is implicated as a component of the pro-oxidant, since cells lacking Cox2 or Cox3 are partially sensitive, whereas cells lacking Cox1 are peroxide-resistant (Figs. 1C and 2). To substantiate the role of Cox1 in the peroxide sensitivity, COX14 was deleted, creating the cox11Δcox14Δ double null strain. Cells lacking Cox14 hyperaccumulate nascent Cox1 chains (27Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells lacking both Cox11 and Cox14 are hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide, showing growth impairment with 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3C). The role of Cox1 was substantiated by the demonstration that the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells is attenuated by disruption of the Cox1 translational activator Pet309. The cox11Δpet309Δ double mutant was peroxide-resistant, consistent with Cox1 being a component of the prooxidant (Fig. 3D). The observed peroxide sensitivity may arise with the generation of a pro-oxidant or the disruption of a redox system. One candidate prooxidant would be the heme A3 moiety in Cox1. Heme A3 has an open coordination site that may yield peroxidase activity. Heme A is probably inserted into Cox1 prior to the addition of Cox2 in the assembly pathway (28Williams S.L. Valnot I. Rustin P. Taanman J.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The structure of Cox1 has an open channel from the IMS side of the IM, where heme A insertion may occur (Fig. 4A). The peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells may arise from the transient accumulation of a heme A-Cox1 intermediate (Fig. 4C, 1). The solvent accessibility of this putative intermediate may enable the heme to catalyze formation of the hydroxyl radical pro-oxidant. Residual heme A is observed in cells lacking Cox11 or Sco1 (29Barros M.H. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If a heme A-Cox1 intermediate is the pro-oxidant, the observed peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells should be reversed if heme A formation is blocked and exacerbated if heme A production is increased. The inhibition of heme synthesis in cox11Δ cells by the addition of 0.5 mm succinyl acetone abrogated the sensitivity to 1 mm hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, overexpression of COX15, which is known to significantly increase the levels of heme A in CcO assembly mutants (30Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9997-10002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), exacerbated the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ and sco1Δ cells (Fig. 5B). A growth defect was observed with 0.5 mm H2O2 in the overexpressor cells. Overexpression of COX15 also induced mild sensitivity in wild-type cells to 0.5 mm H2O2 but curiously no sensitivity in shy1Δ cells. The lack of peroxide sensitivity in shy1Δ cells is consistent with a defect in heme A3 insertion in these cells. Rhodobacter cells lacking ShyI are compromised in heme A3 insertion (31Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17652-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The accumulation of a heme A-Cox1 pro-oxidant intermediate in cox11Δ cells may result in generalized reactive oxygen damage. Wild-type and cox11Δ cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mm H2O2 for 2 h at 30°C for isolation of mitochondria. The accumulation of carbonylated proteins was assessed by immunoblotting after dinitrophenyl hydrazone derivatization. cox11Δ cells showed nearly 2-fold enhancement in carbonylation, consistent with enhanced reactive oxygen sensitivity (Fig. 6). Multicopy suppressors of the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells were isolated. Null cells transformed with a high copy DNA library were screened for clones able to propagate in 6 mm hydrogen peroxide. Two plasmid-borne suppressors were isolated (Fig. 7A). Overexpression of STR2 or AFG1 was found to suppress the peroxide sensitivity but not the respiratory deficiency of both sco1Δ and cox11Δ cells (Fig. 7B). Str2 is a cystathionine γ-synthase that converts cysteine into cystathionine (32Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A C-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion of Str2 was reported to localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus (33Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). Afg1 is a putative mitochondrial ATPase (34Lee Y.-J. Wickner R.B. Yeast. 1992; 8: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). STR2 but not AFG1 was found to strongly suppress the peroxide sensitivity of ccp1Δ cells lacking cytochrome c peroxidase localized to the IMS. Neither gene suppressed the peroxide sensitivity of cells lacking the cytosolic Ctt1 catalase (Fig. 7C). Str2 may have a general role in protecting mitochondria from peroxide stress. Overexpression of Afg1 was also found to suppress the peroxide sensitivity of cox20Δ cells, suggesting that it has some specificity to the peroxide sensitivity of CcO assembly mutants. Since Afg1 was selective in its suppression of mutants in the CcO assembly pathway, we chose to restrict our focus to Afg1. Cells lacking Afg1 showed a modest growth impairment on glycerol medium at 37 °C, and both CcO and the bc1 complex activities are reduced (supplemental Fig. 1). A Myc-tagged Afg1 fusion was found to localize within the mitochondrion and be membrane-associated (Fig. 8). The fusion protein was insensitive to proteinase K in whole mitochondria and mitoplasts, suggesting that the protein faces the matrix side of the IM. Afg1 resembles the mitochondrial iAAA (Yme1) and mAAA (Yta10/Yta12) proteases but lacks the characteristic zinc protease domain (supplemental Fig. 2). The ATPase domain of Afg1 is important for its ability to suppress cox11Δ cells (data not shown). To address whether Afg1 functions in degradation of Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3, cox11Δ cells in the presence or absence of AFG1 were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide, permitting only labeling of the mitochondrial translation products. The presence of AFG1 did not alter the 35S incorporation into Cox1, Cox2, or Cox3 during the pulse phase of the reaction (Fig. 9A), but AFG1 did accentuate the diminution in labeled Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3 during the chase (Fig. 9, B–D). AFG1 had no effect on the turnover of Cob in the bc1 complex (Fig. 9E) or Var1 (data not shown). Thus, although Afg1 lacks a zinc protease domain, it facilitates the degradation of Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3 in cox11Δ cells. This observation was consistent with the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells arising from a Cox1 intermediate. A subset of mutants that impair assembly of cytochrome c oxidase show a marked sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in logarithmically growing cells (15Pungartnik C. Kern M.F. Brendel M. Henriques J.A.P. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Banting G.S. Glerum D.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The peroxide sensitivity is disconnected from the respiratory capacity of cells, since cells lacking the mitochondrial genome are resistant to hydrogen peroxide. The mutants exhibiting the peroxide sensitivity appear to generate a transient and low abundant pro-oxidant assembly intermediate consisting of Cox1. Cells lacking Cox1 or its translational activator Pet309 are peroxide-resistant, but cells stalled in CcO assembly due to an inability to generate the CuB site in Cox1 (cox11Δ mutant), an inability to fold or mature Cox2 (cox20Δ and sco1Δ mutants), or an absence of Cox2 or Cox3 result in varying levels of peroxide sensitivity. Since the peroxide sensitivity of cox11Δ cells is suppressed by the depletion of Cox1 (pet309Δ mutant) or inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, nascent Cox1 chains appear to be deleterious with respect to hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. We postulate that the transient accumulation of unassembled Cox1 results in peroxide sensitivity. Importantly, these studies on hydrogen peroxide sensitivity in CcO assembly shed insight into the assembly process. Residual levels of unassembled Cox1 exist in CcO mutant yeast strains (35Horan S. Bourges I. Taanman J.-W. Meunier B. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), including cox11Δ cells (27Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The pro-oxidant is probably a heme A-Cox1 complex. Cells unable to form heme A are peroxide-resistant (cox10Δ cells or cells treated with succinyl acetone), and cells overexpressing COX15 are hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide. The lack of peroxide sensitivity in shy1Δ cells overexpressing Cox15 is consistent with a reported role of ShyI in heme A insertion. Rhodobacter cells lacking ShyI are compromised in heme A3 insertion (31Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17652-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Heme A3 is the likely pro-oxidant in Cox1, since only heme A3 has an open coordination site. Thus, shy1Δ cells would be peroxide-resistant if yeast ShyI also functions in heme A3 insertion, and that is what we observe. The candidate heme A3-Cox1 unassembled pro-oxidant intermediate is probably so transient in nature that visualizing it biochemically would be nearly impossible. Its existence is largely corroborated by genetic evidence. Heme A insertion occurs in Cox1 prior to the addition of Cox2. An open channel exists in Cox1 through which heme A is probably inserted from the IMS side of the IM (Fig. 4A). The channel is sterically blocked upon the insertion of Cox2 (Fig. 4B). The globular domain of Cox2 packs onto Cox1, occluding the accessible channel. CuB site formation in Cox1 occurs either in synchrony or sequentially with heme A insertion. Assembly of the CuB site is precluded in cox11Δ cells, and these cells are peroxide-sensitive. We propose that the globular domain of Cox11 projecting into the IMS is able to transiently occlude the Cox1 channel, thereby yielding peroxide resistance (Fig. 4C). This putative Cox11-Cox1 complex is expected to mediate Cu(I) transfer to the Cox1 CuB site through ligand exchange reactions. However, the ability of Cox11 to mediate peroxide resistance is unrelated to the ability of Cox11 to bind Cu(I). Cox11 may bind and stabilize Cox1 through transient interactions involving both the C-terminal globular domain and its transmembrane domain. We show presently that the Cox11 transmembrane domain is important for the ability of Cox11 to efficiently confer peroxide resistance. A transient interaction of Cox11 with Cox1 may stabilize a conformer of Cox1 that has less solvent accessibility to the heme A3. Peroxide sensitivity arising from a transient accumulation of heme A3-Cox1 is consistent with the observed peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ, cox20Δ, and cox2Δ cells. The lack of Sco1 or Cox20 may destabilize Cox2 sufficiently that it fails to stably interact with Cox1, leading to peroxide sensitivity (Fig. 4C). Whereas the lack of Cox2 may be expected to result in accumulation of the pro-oxidant Cox1 intermediate, only modest peroxide sensitivity is observed in cox2Δ cells, and pet111Δ cells are peroxide-resistant. Cells containing mutant alleles of COX2 with mutations in the 5′-untranslated region showed the expected diminution in Cox2 nascent chains but also reduced Cox1 nascent chains (36Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Likewise, cells lacking Pet111 show the expected loss of Cox2 translation and also diminution in Cox1 translation (37Poutre C.G. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1987; 115: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that pet111Δ cells have attenuated Cox1 translation (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of Pet111 results in a diminution in translation of Cox1 (38Fiori A. Perez-Martinez X. Fox T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1689-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that translational activators function in a balanced manner. Thus, the limited peroxide sensitivity observed in cox2Δ and pet111Δ cells probably arises from reduced levels of the Cox1 intermediate. Growth susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide may be a useful assay to assess Cox1 translation under certain conditions when CcO assembly is stalled from defects arising at the IM/IMS interface. Insertion of Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3 in the IM requires the translocation of polypeptide segments across the IM by the translocases, OxaI and Cox18 (39Souza R.L. Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Tzagoloff A. Nobrega F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14898-14902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 41Saracco S.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 113: 1122-1131Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lack of sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide observed in oxa1Δ and cox18Δ strains suggests that both translocases are important for Cox1 insertion. Both translocases are well established to function on Cox2, but if Cox2 were their only substrate, the clear prediction is that the null mutants would accumulate the pro-oxidant Cox1 intermediate and become peroxide-sensitive. Recently, a truncated Cox1 polypeptide was reported to form in cells lacking Mss51 (42Zambrano A. Fontanesi F. Solans A. Leite de Oliveira R. Fox T.D. Tzagoloff A. Barrientos A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This novel 15-kDa polypeptide mp15 is not the pro-oxidant Cox1 intermediate discussed presently, since the mp15 polypeptide also forms in shy1Δ and cox17Δ cells that are resistant to hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). The peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ cells is suppressed by either wild-type Sco1, mutant Sco1 lacking the ability to bind Cu(I), or human Sco1. Neither the copper-binding mutants nor human Sco1 is competent to restore respiration to sco1Δ cells, but they are able to suppress the peroxide sensitivity, again highlighting the disconnection between respiration and peroxide sensitivity. The transmembrane domain of Sco1 is important for peroxide resistance. Like Cox11, Sco1 may have a protein chaperone role in the assembly of CcO. The suppression of peroxide sensitivity of sco1Δ cells by mutant Sco1 may arise from a stabilizing effect of Sco1 on Cox2 in occluding the putative solvent channel in Cox1. No redox function has been confirmed in Sco proteins. Sco proteins in prokaryotes can have a function independent of CuA site formation, since a number of bacterial species lacking CuA CcO proteins have Sco homologs. Neisseria contain a Sco protein that is not essential for maturation of the cbb3 oxidase (43Seib K.L. Jennings M.P. McEwan A.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neisseria cells lacking this Sco protein are sensitive to paraquat (43Seib K.L. Jennings M.P. McEwan A.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If the deletion strain accumulates a heme B intermediate of the cbb3 oxidase, a similar mechanism may confer oxidative stress. The mitochondrial Afg1 ATPase was found to be an efficient suppressor of the peroxide sensitivity of CcO assembly mutants. Afg1 was an inefficient suppressor of the peroxide sensitivity of ccp1Δ and unable to suppress ctt1Δ cells, suggesting some specificity. Although Afg1 lacks the zinc protease domain of the AAA proteases of the mitochondria (Yme1 and Yta10/Yta12), it does mediate the degradation of unassembled Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3 polypeptides in cox11Δ cells. Afg1 localizes to the IM and may collaborate with a protease(s) for the extrusion and degradation of unassembled subunits. The mp15 Cox1 truncate is degraded by the Yta10/Yta12 protease (42Zambrano A. Fontanesi F. Solans A. Leite de Oliveira R. Fox T.D. Tzagoloff A. Barrientos A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that Yta10/Yta12 may mediate the degradation stimulated by Afg1. Afg1 is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein with a robust human homolog (supplemental Fig. 2). The similarity of Afg1 with the Cdc48 (p97) suggests that Afg1 forms a homohexameric ring (44Elsasser S. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 45Halawani D. Latterich M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 713-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Yeast Cdc48 functions as an unfolding chaperone for the degradation of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins by the proteasome. The mammalian p97 stimulates the degradation of polytopic membrane proteins through extraction of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (46Carlson E.J. Pitonzo D. Skach W.R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4557-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, Afg1 may function in the extraction of mitochondrial IM proteins, including Cox1, and subsequent presentation to a protease(s). Cdc48 interacts with a number of adapter proteins that modulate its function. Afg1 may also interact with adapter proteins as well as the actual protease. Future studies will attempt to identify interacting partners of Afg1. Download .pdf (.92 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2102512620,"Background Stress influences many aspects of animal behaviour and is a major factor driving populations to adapt to changing living conditions, such as during domestication. Stress can affect offspring through non-genetic mechanisms, but recent research indicates that inherited epigenetic modifications of the genome could possibly also be involved. Methodology/Principal Findings Red junglefowl (RJF, ancestors of modern chickens) and domesticated White Leghorn (WL) chickens were raised in a stressful environment (unpredictable light-dark rhythm) and control animals in similar pens, but on a 12/12 h light-dark rhythm. WL in both treatments had poorer spatial learning ability than RJF, and in both populations, stress caused a reduced ability to solve a spatial learning task. Offspring of stressed WL, but not RJF, raised without parental contact, had a reduced spatial learning ability compared to offspring of non-stressed animals in a similar test as that used for their parents. Offspring of stressed WL were also more competitive and grew faster than offspring of non-stressed parents. Using a whole-genome cDNA microarray, we found that in WL, the same changes in hypothalamic gene expression profile caused by stress in the parents were also found in the offspring. In offspring of stressed WL, at least 31 genes were up- or down-regulated in the hypothalamus and pituitary compared to offspring of non-stressed parents. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that, in WL the gene expression response to stress, as well as some behavioural stress responses, were transmitted across generations. The ability to transmit epigenetic information and behaviour modifications between generations may therefore have been favoured by domestication. The mechanisms involved remain to be investigated; epigenetic modifications could either have been inherited or acquired de novo in the specific egg environment. In both cases, this would offer a novel explanation to rapid evolutionary adaptation of a population."

Another cytochrome P450, CYP2A6, is also present in human lung, but at much lower levels. Although these two enzymes are 93.5% identical, CYP2A13 metabolizes NNK with much lower Km values than does CYP2A6. To investigate the structural differences between these two enzymes the structure of CYP2A13 was determined to 2.35Å by x-ray crystallography and compared with structures of CYP2A6. As expected, the overall CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 structures are very similar with an average root mean square deviation of 0.5Å for the Cα atoms. Like CYP2A6, the CYP2A13 active site cavity is small and highly hydrophobic with a cluster of Phe residues composing the active site roof. Active site residue Asn297 is positioned to hydrogen bond with an adventitious ligand, identified as indole. Amino acid differences between CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 at positions 117, 300, 301, and 208 relate to different orientations of the ligand plane in the two protein structures and may underlie the significant variations observed in binding and catalysis of many CYP2A ligands. In addition, docking studies suggest that residues 365 and 366 may also contribute to differences in NNK metabolism. The human lung cytochrome P450 2A13 (CYP2A13) activates the nicotine-derived procarcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) into DNA-altering compounds that cause lung cancer.

In addition, docking studies suggest that residues 365 and 366 may also contribute to differences in NNK metabolism. The two functional members of the human P450 2A gene family, CYP2A6 and CYP2A13, differ in only 32 of their 494 amino acids (supplementary Fig. 1). Both metabolize substrates including coumarin, nicotine, and the nicotine-derived procarcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), 2The abbreviation used is: NNK, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. the most abundant and potent lung carcinogen in tobacco. Additionally, CYP2A enzymes are reported to metabolize the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 (1He X.Y. Tang L. Wang S.L. Cai Q.S. Wang J.S. Hong J.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2665-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Pelkonen P. Lang M.A. Negishi M. Wild C.P. Juvonen R.O. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both NNK and aflatoxin B1 require activation to generate the reactive intermediates that form DNA adducts and ultimately result in carcinogenicity. Several key findings indicate that 2A13, rather than 2A6, plays an important role in in situ metabolism of NNK in the human respiratory tract. First, substantial amounts of CYP2A13 mRNA are generated in the respiratory tract, especially the nasal mucosa, trachea, and lung (3Su T. Bao Z. Zhang Q.Y. Smith T.J. Hong J.Y. Ding X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5074-5079PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, several studies reported either significantly lower CYP2A6 mRNA levels in respiratory tract tissues (3Su T. Bao Z. Zhang Q.Y. Smith T.J. Hong J.Y. Ding X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5074-5079PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mace K. Bowman E.D. Vautravers P. Shields P.G. Harris C.C. Pfeifer A.M. Eur. J.

Boobis A. Anttila S. Arch. Toxicol. Suppl. 1998; 20: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently a CYP2A13-specific antibody was used to confirm the presence of CYP2A13 protein in the epithelia of bronchus and trachea (7Zhu L.R. Thomas P.E. Lu G. Reuhl K.R. Yang G.Y. Wang L.D. Wang S.L. Yang C.S. He X.Y. Hong J.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, although CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 act on common substrates, rates of metabolism can differ significantly. Studies with recombinant enzymes have demonstrated that CYP2A13 is 30-215 times more efficient at activating NNK into its carcinogenic metabolites than CYP2A6 (3Su T. Bao Z. Zhang Q.Y. Smith T.J. Hong J.Y. Ding X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5074-5079PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jalas J.R. Ding X. Murphy S.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9He X.Y. Shen J. Ding X. Lu A.Y. Hong J.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although cytochromes P450 2E1, 2D6, and 3A4 have also been shown to metabolize NNK in vitro, their Km values are much higher than Km values for the 2A enzymes (10Patten C.J. Smith T.J. Murphy S.E. Wang M.H. Lee J. Tynes R.E. Koch P. Yang C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, a substantial reduction in lung adenocarcinoma has been associated with a genetic polymorphism of CYP2A13 (11Wang H. Tan W. Hao B. Miao X. Zhou G. He F. Lin D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8057-8061PubMed Google Scholar) that is reported to cause a 2-3-fold reduction of catalytic efficiency for NNK (12Zhang X. Su T. Zhang Q.Y. Gu J. Caggana M. Li H. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of NNK by CYP2A13 in the lung may be a potent determinant for lung adenocarcinoma in smokers, which is the leading cause of cancer death. CYP2A13 is also known to preferentially activate a number of other xenobiotics. CYP2A13 is more than four times more active than CYP2A6 in the metabolism of hexamethylphosphoramide, N,N-dimethylaniline, and 2′-methoxyacetophenone (3Su T. Bao Z. Zhang Q.Y. Smith T.J. Hong J.Y. Ding X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5074-5079PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report demonstrated CYP2A13 metabolic activation of aflatoxin B1 into both aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin M1 8,9-epoxides, whereas CYP2A6 produced neither carcinogenic metabolite (1He X.Y. Tang L. Wang S.L. Cai Q.S. Wang J.S. Hong J.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2665-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To better define the structural features of CYP2A enzymes that determine their substrate metabolism, and to specifically investigate the structural differences between human CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 enzymes, we have determined a structure of human CYP2A13 by x-ray crystallography. Careful comparison of the CYP2A13 active site with previously determined structures of CYP2A6 (13Yano J.K. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) allows identification of a set of amino acid residues that are likely to modulate the observed differences in human CYP2A function. Protein Design, Expression, and Purification—The cDNA for CYP2A13 was a gift from Dr. X. Ding (Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY). The full-length gene was altered to yield protein (2A13dH) that lacks the N-terminal transmembrane sequence (Δ2-23), has several charged residues substituted at the modified N terminus (24WRQRKSR30 to 24AKKTSSK30) and has four histidine residues added at the C terminus (supplementary Fig. 1). This altered gene was inserted into the pKK233-2 plasmid (GE Healthcare). 2A13dH was then expressed in Escherichia coli TOPP-3 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with an induction time of 48 h as described (14Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but without the addition of imidazole. E. coli cells were harvested and disrupted as described (15Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After centrifugation to pellet cell debris, 4.8 mm Cymal-5 detergent (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) and 0.3 m NaCl were added to the supernatant, followed by ultracentrifugation at 80,000 × g for 60 min. The solubilized CYP2A13 lysate was applied to Ni2+-agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which was subsequently washed with the loading buffer. The resin was washed first with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 4.8 mm Cymal-5) and then with the same buffer including 6 mm histidine. CYP2A13 was eluted using 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer with NaCl reduced to 100 mm, and supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 40 mm histidine. The purest P450-containing fractions were pooled, diluted 10 times with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 4.8 mm Cymal-5, and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose CL-6B column. This column was washed with the previous buffer omitting the detergent. Purified CYP2A13 was eluted using the same buffer with potassium phosphate increased to 50 mm and including 500 mm NaCl. Purified protein was concentrated using centrifugal ultrafiltration. Protein Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion equilibration. A 50 mg/ml solution of purified protein in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.066 mm n-tridecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside was equilibrated against 0.3 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.15 m sodium HEPES, pH 7.2, and 25% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether at 20 °C. Plate-like crystals that grew in 10 days were immersed in mother liquor supplemented with 30% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. A single native data set was collected on beamline 11-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford, CA). Data were recorded in two passes, a high resolution pass (180°, 1° oscillations, 10-s exposures) and a low resolution pass (90°, 1° oscillations, 2-s exposures) using an ADSC Q315 detector. The data to 2.35 Å were integrated and processed using the programs Mosflm and Scala (16CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Statistics are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab The 2A13dH structure was solved by molecular replacement using the 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole complex of cytochrome P450 2B4 (Protein Data Bank 1SUO) as a search model and Phaser (17McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). The space group is P2, a very rare space group for proteins, but this assignment was based on the presence of 0k0 reflections with k odd. In addition, molecular replacement calculations gave the highest log likelihood (1443) for a solution with six molecules in the asymmetric unit that packed well without space for additional molecules. The initial experimental electron density map reinforced the space group assignment and the molecular replacement solution. The model was refined using CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Gross-Kunsleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 64: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was followed by iterative rounds of positional and isotropic B-factor minimization with constrained NCS. Xtalview (19McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was used for model building into σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc electron density maps. During the last several iterations of refinement, NCS was constrained with decreasing weights, as validated by decreases in Rfree. The final model contains residues 31-494, heme, indole, and 591 water molecules. The crystallographic R-factor is 21.8 and the Rfree is 27.6. Residues in most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot include 86.8% of the structure, with 12.2% in additionally allowed regions, 0.8% in generously allowed regions, and 0.2% in disallowed regions. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 2P85). Docking of NNK—Ligand structures were sketched and protonated in SYBYL 3SYBYL 7.2, Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO. and were then structurally optimized using the Tripos Force Field (21Clark M. Cramer III, R.D. Opdenbosch N.V. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2834) Google Scholar) (Gasteiger-Marsili electrostatics (22Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 26: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3627) Google Scholar) with an 8.0-Å nonbonding interaction cutoff; default convergence thresholds). The receptor structures were prepared from crystallographic coordinates of CYP2A6 (13Yano J.K. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and CYP2A13 (reported herein) by protonating the structures and adding Gasteiger-Marsili charges in SYBYL, and aligning the two according to conserved backbone residues. The coumarin ligand in the CYP2A6 structure was then transposed into the CYP2A13 receptor, and the three crystallographic waters with close contacts to the transposed coumarin were deleted. Both CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 were then conditioned in the presence of bound coumarin via short (1 ps; 300 K; Tripos Force Field) molecular dynamics simulations. The coumarin ligands were then removed from the receptor. Coumarin was then redocked into these two receptors for validation purposes via the FlexX program (23Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) taking into explicit consideration all receptor residues within 8.0 Å of the ligand (including the heme and remaining crystallographic waters, but neglecting the co-crystallized ligand) and using Gasteiger-Marsili charges for both ligand and receptor. Generation of docked conformers or poses was accomplished via the ligand fragment search and reassembly algorithm implemented in FlexX. The Asn297 side chain amide was specified as a critical H-bond acceptor site. No other preconditions were set on the ligand position or orientation. Among the 30 ligand docked conformers requested per ligand, 15 of the coumarin structures bound to CYP2A6 were in close qualitative agreement with the crystallographically determined position (root mean squared deviation <1.2 Å), with the carbonyl oxygen forming a hydrogen bond with the Asn297 side chain and the ring oxygen point up away from the heme. In the remaining 15 structures, the above H-bond was preserved, however, the ring oxygen was found to point down toward the heme. The same docking methodology was then applied to NNK binding to CYP2A6 and CYP2A13. X-ray Structure Determination and Overview—To better understand the differences between CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 ligand binding and metabolism, the structure of CYP2A13 was determined by x-ray crystallography. Truncated and His-tagged cytochrome P450 2A13dH crystallized in the P2 space group with six molecules in the asymmetric unit. The initial experimental maps were easily interpreted for most of the protein and the model refined using iterative model adjustment and refinement. Statistics for data collection and refinement are shown in Table 1. The CYP2A13 structure follows the typical fold for mammalian cytochromes and is composed of 20 α-helices and 4 β-sheets enclosing the heme prosthetic group (Fig. 1), with no apparent open channels. The six molecules in the asymmetric unit are very similar (average Cα root mean square deviation 0.4 Å). The overall CYP2A13 structure is very similar to that of the closely related human liver cytochrome P450 2A6 (Fig. 1). The root mean square deviation for Cα atoms in CYP2A13 versus CYP2A6 (PDB 1Z10) is 0.5 Å, only slightly higher than the differences among the six different CYP2A13 molecules in the asymmetric unit or the four CYP2A6 molecules present in that asymmetric unit. Four of the six CYP2A13 molecules have the same packing as the four molecules in the CYP2A6 asymmetric unit. The secondary structure units are essentially identical between the two CYP2A enzymes (supplementary Fig. 1). Active Site—The CYP2A13 active site is very hydrophobic and tightly packed. The cavity is small and planar, complementing the size and shape of many CYP2A substrates. The planar active site is oriented edge-on to the heme group. The active site of CYP2A13 is 307 Å3, some 15-20% larger that that of the CYP2A6 structures and proportioned differently as a result of individual amino acid differences lining the cavity (Fig. 2). The two CYP2A enzymes have the smallest active sites of the human cytochromes P450 whose structures have been determined. Amino acids lining the CYP2A13 active site include Phe107, Phe111, Ala117, Phe118, Phe209, Leu296, Asn297, Phe300, Ala301, Glu304, Thr305, Met365, Leu366, Leu370, and Phe480. Notably, six of the amino acids lining the active site are phenylalanine residues: Phe107, Phe111, Phe118, Phe209, Phe300, and Phe480 (Fig. 2). These phenylalanines cluster to form the “roof” of the active site. This cluster is even larger than the phenylalanine cluster in CYP2A6, as Ile300 in CYP2A6 is Phe300 in CYP2A13. The aromatic side chains substantially fill the active site and provide multiple opportunities for parallel-displaced π-π stacking and edge-to-face interactions with aromatic ligands and with each other to stabilize the tertiary protein structure.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5054-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutation at positions 209 or 481 substantially altered steroid hydroxylase activity in mouse 2A enzymes. Although Phe209 interacts directly with substrates in the active site cavity, residue 481 does not line the CYP2A13 active site. However, in CYP2A13, the side chain of Ala481 projects directly toward Phe209. In the CYP2A4 and CYP2A5 studies, mutation at 481 likely altered the packing of Phe209 and/or the adjacent Phe480, both of which do line the active site cavity, to alter metabolism indirectly. Although no exogenous ligands were added to the purified CYP2A13, initial experimental maps indicated the presence of a ligand in the active sites of all six molecules of the asymmetric unit. During refinement, subsequent electron density maps reinforced the presence of this strong planar density. The modest resolution of the x-ray diffraction experiment did not allow identification of the bound molecule in the crystals. However, we have independently determined that the ligand is indole. CYP2A6 is one of several cytochromes P450 reported to metabolize indole into various indigoid pigments (25Gillam E.M. Notley L.M. Cai H. De Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In fact, when human CYP2A6 and the natural redox partner are overexpressed in E. coli, the bacterial cultures turn blue as a result of indigoid production from indole normally present in the E. coli cells. Likewise, when CYP2A13 is expressed in E. coli, the cultures also generate indigoid pigments, likely by accepting electrons from an endogenous E. coli reductase. We suspected that indole co-purified with the protein and constituted the ligand in the active site. First, early in the purification when large amounts of indigoid pigments are still present, UV-visible spectra indicate Soret peaks at both 393 and 418 nm, indicating a mixture of CYP2A13 molecules, some with a ligand and some with water in the active site, respectively. The spectrum of the purified protein has an absorbance maximum at 418 nm, with only a slight shoulder toward 393 nm, but indole does not cause a significant shift in the Soret at concentrations less than 40-fold over the CYP2A13 protein concentration. Second, the overall size, shape, and planarity of the bicyclic indole ring system correlate well with the observed electron density in the active site (Fig. 3). Third, CYP2A13 purified for crystallization reacts with p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde to yield a product with an absorbance at 625 nm, indicative of the presence of indole and/or certain indole metabolites (26Turner J.M. Biochem. J. 1961; 78: 790-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Finally, we were able to extract the 625 nm p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde product from purified CYP2A13 protein and identify it as a complex with unsubstituted indole by mass spectrometry. On the basis of these results, we have modeled the electron density in the present CYP2A13 structure as indole. This strongly planar indole density in the CYP2A13 structure appears to adopt two alternate orientations in the active site. For most molecules, the predominant orientation overlaps the location of the coumarin molecule in CYP2A6 and similarly forms a direct hydrogen bond to Asn297 (indole position A, Fig. 3A). However, one of the active sites has very strong density supporting a second orientation of indole with the benzene ring in the same location, but with the fused pyrrole ring more perpendicular to the heme plane. In this orientation indole also binds to Asn297, this time via a bridging water molecule (indole position B, Fig. 3B). In addition to the electron density, this second orientation is also supported by molecular dynamics simulations at 100 K that indicate the bridging arrangement is a stable one. Subsequent refinement of the occupancies of both ligands in each active site indicated that all active sites likely contain a mixture of indole in orientations A and B ranging from 60/40 to 40/60 (Fig. 3C). Dual ligand orientations have been observed previously in a complex of CYP2C5 with 4-methyl-N-methyl-N-(2-phenyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzene-sulfonamide (27Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Marques-Soares C. Dansette P.M. Mansuy D. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6370-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In both the CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 structures, Asn297 is the only polar residue in the active site and this amino acid likely plays a key role in ligand orientation. Asn297 is stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network including a water molecule and the backbone of residues in the loop between helices B′ and C in CYP2A13 as well as CYP2A6. Asparagine is highly conserved at position 297 in CYP2A enzymes from many different organisms, but not in other subfamilies of human cytochromes P450. Thus, this hydrogen bond interaction may be a hallmark of CYP2A enzyme interactions with their ligands and responsible for orientation of many CYP2A ligands in the active site. Although the indole in CYP2A13 binds in nearly the same location as coumarin in CYP2A6 with respect to the heme and Asn297, the plane of coumarin and indole differ by ∼30°. When viewed end-on from opposite Asn297, coumarin is oriented along a northwest/southeast axis, whereas both of the CYP2A13 indole ligands are oriented along a northeast/south-west axis (Fig. 4). Structural proximity implicates four amino acid residues in orientation of the ligand plane. In CYP2A6, Ile300 projects into the active site cavity from the northeast, limiting space available to the ligand in this quadrant. In CYP2A13, residue 300 is phenylalanine, but the larger side chain is torsioned away from the ligand, resulting in more space in the north-east quadrant of the CYP2A13 active site. Rotation of the aromatic ring away from the active site is likely permitted because of a “second shell” residue difference between CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 at the C-terminal end of the F helix. Located directly above Phe300 in the active site, the reduction in size from Ile208 in CYP2A6 to Ser208 in CYP2A13 both provides space for the aromatic ring torsion in CYP2A13 and repositions the aromatic ring of Phe209. The CYP2A13 S208I mutation has been shown to significantly decrease NNK metabolism to both metabolites (9He X.Y. Shen J. Ding X. Lu A.Y. Hong J.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting it might also be key in orienting other ligands. The identity of the residue at position 209 is key for determining metabolism with coumarin, steroids, and aflatoxin B1 in mouse CYP2A enzymes (2Pelkonen P. Lang M.A. Negishi M. Wild C.P. Juvonen R.O. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Iwasaki M. Lindberg R.L. Juvonen R.O. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Uno T. Mitchell E. Aida K. Lambert M.H. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3193-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At the base of the active site near the heme, residues 301 and 117 also act in concert to control the ligand orientation. In CYP2A13, the Ala301 side chain methyl occupies space that is available to ligands in CYP2A6, which has glycine at this position. On the opposite side of the active site, residue 117 is an alanine in CYP2A13 and occupies less space than the corresponding valine at this position in CYP2A6. Although there has been little exploration of the role of residue 301 in CYP2A enzymes, mutation at position 117 has been demonstrated to substantially impact the catalytic efficiency of CYP2A13 for coumarin (30He X.Y. Shen J. Hu W.Y. Ding X. Lu A.Y. Hong J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), NNK (9He X.Y. Shen J. Ding X. Lu A.Y. Hong J.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and aflatoxin B1 (1He X.Y. Tang L. Wang S.L. Cai Q.S. Wang J.S. Hong J.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2665-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For coumarin and NNK the effects are primarily reflected in changes in Vmax rather than Km, suggesting orientation of the ligand may be related to catalysis rather than ligand affinity. Additionally, variants at this position are responsible for significant differences in coumarin hydroxylation in mouse 2A enzymes (31Lindberg R.L. Juvonen R. Negishi M. Pharmacogenetics. 1992; 2: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additional active site differences between CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 occur at positions 365 and 366. These residues, along with Thr305, are located at the end of the active site opposite Asn297. In CYP2A6, the side chains of Thr305 and Ile366 approach each other to close off the end of the active site, with Val365 just behind and shielded from the active site cavity. In CYP2A13, the larger methionine at 365 extends much closer toward the ligand and the flanking residues Thr305 and Leu366 are farther separated. As a result, the terminal atoms of Met365 make up part of the active site wall. Although these residues are more distant from the indole ligand in this structure, they are likely to play a role in orienting slightly larger ligands. The identity of the side chain at position 365 in mouse CYP2A4 and CYP2A5 has a role in metabolism of coumarin, testosterone, and aflatoxin B1 (2Pelkonen P. Lang M.A. Negishi M. Wild C.P. Juvonen R.O. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Lindberg R.L. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Thus, both structure and function studies support the idea that a combination of residues at positions 117, 208, 300, 301, 365, and possibly 366 modulate ligand binding and metabolism in CYP2A enzymes. Analysis of these residues in different CYP2A enzymes may help understand phenacetin metabolism. CYP2A13 has recently been reported (33Fukami T. Nakajima M. Sakai H. Katoh M. Yokoi T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to metabolize phenacetin, normally a CYP1A2 marker substrate, more efficiently than CYP1A2 itself. Rabbit CYP2A10 and CYP2A11 also have this capacity, but CYP2A6 does not. Comparison of the active site residues at key positions where CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 differ (Table 2) suggests that in 2A enzymes residues Ser208, Phe300, Ala301, and Met365 are compatible with phenacetin metabolism.TABLE 2Comparison of key active site residues in 2A enzymesCYP1172083003013653662A6ValIleIleGlyValIle2A10ValSerPheAlaMetIle2A11AlaSerPheAlaMetIle2A13AlaSerPheAlaMetLeu Open table in a new tab Heme Binding—CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 also differ in two of the residues responsible for interaction with the heme. In CYP2A6, Ser369 hydrogen bonds through its side chain hydroxyl group to the A ring propionate. Hydrogen bonding residues are generally conserved at this position in microsomal CYPs. CYP2A13, however, has a glycine at this position and is thus incapable of the hydrogen binding interaction. In the place of the serine side chain, CYP2A13 has a water molecule ideally positioned to replace this interaction. The water molecule is stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds to both the backbone amine and carbonyl of residue 370. The residue at position 372 also interacts with the A ring propionate and differs between the two CYP2A proteins. This residue is histidine in 70% of the family 1 and 2 cytochromes P450, including CYP2A13. The imidazole ring of His372 hydrogen bonds to the terminal propionate oxygens. In CYP2A6 and the remaining 30% of the family 1 and 2 enzymes, this residue is an arginine. In CYP2A6, the Nϵ of Arg372 takes the place of the imidazole nitrogen. From the structures, it appears that the two arrangements might be equivalent. Three site-directed mutagenesis studies, however, indicate that this residue is functionally important. The CYP2A13 mutation H372R disrupts the ability of the enzyme to form either of the carcinogenic aflatoxin 8,9-epoxide metabolites and substantially increased formation of the detoxification products aflatoxin P1 (1He X.Y. Tang L. Wang S.L. Cai Q.S. Wang J.S. Hong J.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2665-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In metabolism of NNK, the H372R mutation obliterates the ability to form the keto alcohol metabolite, and reduces the kcat for formation of the keto aldehyde by almost 130-fold compared with the CYP2A13 wild type enzyme (9He X.Y. Shen J. Ding X. Lu A.Y. Hong J.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), essentially converting the metabolite profile for NNK to that of CYP2A6. Additionally, CYP2A13 H372R has an 8-fold increase in the kcat for coumarin to near 2A6 levels, whereas introduction of the R372H mutation in CYP2A6 reduces its coumarin kcat 5-fold to ∼2A13 levels (30He X.Y. Shen J. Hu W.Y. Ding X. Lu A.Y. Hong J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Docking of NNK into the Active Site—Of all human cytochrome P450s, the human lung-specific CYP2A13 has been reported as the most effective activator of nicotine-derived NNK. 2A13 activates NNK at both the methyl and methylene positions to form DNA pyridyloxobutylating and methylating intermediates that are ultimately detected as a keto alcohol and a keto aldehyde, respectively (32Lindberg R.L. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 33Fukami T. Nakajima M. Sakai H. Katoh M. Yokoi T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Wang S.L. He X.Y. Shen J. Wang J.S. Hong J.Y. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 94: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CYP2A6 is much less efficient at NNK activation (Table 3). When NNK was docked into the CYP2A6 structure, all 30 docked conformers predicted a hydrogen bond between the NNK carbonyl oxygen and the Asn297 side chain and resulted in an orientation with the pyridine ring too close to the heme iron to permit close approach by either the methylene and methyl carbons (no approaches closer than 7.0 and 5.5 Å, respectively, Fig. 5A). This orientation is incompatible with generation of either carcinogenic metabolite. In contrast, when NNK was docked into the CYP2A13 structure, NNK generally oriented with the pyridine ring oriented away from the heme iron (26/30 docked conformers) with its nitrogen hydrogen bonded to Asn297. Nineteen of these docked conformers placed the methyl carbon nearest to the heme iron (as close as 3.9 Å, Fig. 5B). Another seven of the docked conformers placed the methylene carbon nearest to the heme iron (as close as 4.9 Å, Fig. 5C). These orientations are suitable for hydroxylation by the activated oxygen intermediate into the keto alcohol and keto aldehyde metabolites observed experimentally. In the remaining four CYP2A13 docked conformers the nitroso oxygen hydrogen bonded to Asn297 and the pyridine ring was pointed toward the heme, similar to that observed in all of the CYP2A6 conformers. The energies of all CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 docking conformers were similar. Thus, subtle differences in the structures modify ligand orientation in docking experiments to correctly predict the metabolites observed (Table 3). In particular, residues at positions 366 and 365 differ between CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 and have very different interactions with NNK in CYP2A6 compared with CYP2A13. The combination and positioning of Met365-Leu366 in CYP2A13 creates a slight additional space adjacent to these residues that is not available adjacent to Val365-Ile366 in CYP2A6 (Fig. 2). When NNK is positioned for methyl hydroxylation in CYP2A13, the terminal nitrosamine functional group occupies this small pocket (Fig. 5B). Rotation about the C-C bond adjacent to the nitrosamine would then yield the orientation of NNK suitable for methylene hydroxylation (Fig. 5C). Neither of these two orientations appears to be available to NNK in CYP2A6, potentially due to the replacement of Met365-Leu366 with Val365-Ile366.TABLE 3Comparison of CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 kinetic parameters and docking orientationsNNK α-methyl hydroxylationNNK α-methylene hydroxylationKmaRef. 3.VmaxaRef. 3.Vmax/KmaRef. 3.No. compatible docking conformersKmaRef. 3.VmaxaRef. 3.Vmax/KmaRef. 3.No. compatible docking conformersμmμmCYP2A6141.00.40.0030/30118.01.00.0080/30CYP2A1313.11.20.0919/3011.34.10.367/30a Ref. 3Su T.

Open table in a new tab Because lung cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death (37American Cancer Society Office, A. C. S. N. H. Cancer Facts and Figures. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA2007Google Scholar), understanding in situ activation of nicotine-derived NNK into carcinogens by CYP2A13 is an important goal. Comparison of the human CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 structures reveals several common features that may be hallmarks of CYP2A enzymes: 1) a relatively small, planar active site; 2) numerous active site phenylalanine residues for π-π interactions with aromatic ligands; and 3) Asn297 oriented for hydrogen bonding with ligands. Differences between the two structures indicate that residues 117, 208, 300, and 301 act in concert to define the plane of ligands in the active site. Residue differences at positions 365 and/or 366 are also likely determinants of ligand binding and catalysis, especially for NNK, whereas the structure suggests residues at 369 and 372 might be more directly involved in heme binding. Most of the remaining differences between CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 are located outside the active site either in the N-terminal transmembrane region or on the surface of the protein. Mutagenesis results support the effects of residues at 117, 208, and 365, whereas the roles of residues at positions 297, 300, and 301 should be further explored by mutagenesis and functional studies."

The Bcl-2 family proteins can be divided into three major subgroups (1Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, typically share four conserved motifs termed Bcl-2 homology (BH) 3The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; Dp5/HRK, death protein 5/haraki; Bim, Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death; FasL, Fas ligand; CGN, cerebellar granule neuron; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DIV, days in vitro; MOI, multiplicity of infection; NGF, nerve growth factor; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; PI, propidium iodide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. domains and inhibit mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Multidomain proapoptotic proteins, the second subgroup, such as Bax, Bak, and Bok, typically have three BH domains but promote cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The third, and the most structurally diverse subgroup, is the BH3-only proteins, including Dp5/HRK (death protein 5/harakiri), Bim (Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death), Bid, Bad, Puma, and Noxa, which share the BH3 domain. The BH3-only proteins are critical initiators of apoptosis. Upon challenge, BH3-only proteins translocate to mitochondria and promote the chromec release by neutralizing the antiapoptotic action of Bcl-2 family members. BH3-only proteins are stringently regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels during apoptosis, such as Dp5, Bim, and Puma, depending on the cell type and apoptotic stimulus (2Imaizumi K.

In rodents, the expression of Dp5 is largely restricted to and is developmentally regulated in the nervous system (2Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 7Kanazawa K. Imaizumi K. Mori T. Honma Y. Tojo M. Tanno Y. Yokoya S. Niwa S. Tohyama M. Takagi T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). dp5 is highly homologous to the human gene harakiri (HRK) cloned by a two-hybrid screen with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (3Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As well as being induced in NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons, the induction of dp5 is also observed in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) deprived of potassium, cortical neurons exposed to toxic concentrations of amyloid-β protein, retinal ganglion cells of axotomized rat retinas, and axotomized postnatal mouse motoneurons. Overexpression of Dp5 in sympathetic neurons or CGNs induces apoptosis in a Bax-dependent manner, and this effect can be attenuated by co-expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Deletion of dp5 delays sympathetic neuron apoptosis triggered by NGF withdrawal and rescues motoneurons from axotomy-induced apoptosis. These studies suggest that Dp5 plays a critical role in neuronal apoptosis. Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that JNK is involved in dp5 up-regulation during neuronal injury or apoptosis. In sympathetic neurons deprived of NGF (8Harris C.A.

Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), dp5 is induced in a manner that is clearly JNK-dependent. Although JNK has been shown to be involved in dp5 up-regulation, the mechanism of how JNK regulates dp5 expression is not clarified. In the present study, we used recombinant adenoviruses that express a dominant negative form of c-Jun (FLAG-Δ169) to identify the potential targets of c-Jun in neuronal apoptosis. We showed that c-Jun mediates the induction of dp5, but not that of fas ligand (fasL) and bim during potassium deprivation-induced apoptosis in CGNs. In addition, we identified an ATF site located at -116 to -109 of the dp5 promoter that was required for its activation. Furthermore, a gel shift assay showed that a specific complex containing c-Jun and ATF2 recognized this site, and the association of c-Jun/ATF2 complex was significantly increased in potassium-deprived CGNs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that c-Jun was able to bind to this site in vivo. Finally, knockdown of Dp5 protects CGNs from apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that dp5 is a c-Jun target gene and required for apoptosis induced by potassium deprivation in CGNs.

Briefly, cells cultured for 7 days (DIV7) in medium containing 25 K+S were switched into serum-free medium containing 25 or 5 mm KCl (25 K or 5 K) in the presence or absence of the inhibitors SP600125 (Calbiochem) or CEP11004 (a kind gift from Cephalon Inc.). Cells that did not receive inhibitors received Me2SO as a control. The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1%. Western Blotting—Western blotting analysis was performed as described in detail previously (11Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein lysates prepared from neurons were separated by a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), JNK, phospho-c-Jun (Ser73) (Cell Signaling Technology; diluted 1:1000), and c-Jun (610327; BD Biosciences Pharmingen; diluted 1:1000) and monoclonal antibodies to FLAG or tubulin (Sigma; both diluted 1:10,000) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Q-PCR—Total RNA was extracted and isolated from CGNs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA by using SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) as primers. Q-PCR was performed in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system using ABI Sybr Green PCR mixture as described by the manufacturer. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5-10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 1 min of annealing (annealing temperature adapted for the specific primer set used), and 1 min of extension at 72 °C. Fluorescence data were collected during the annealing stage of amplification. Specificity of the amplification was verified by melt curve analysis. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using identical threshold values for all experiments. β-Actin was used as control and for normalization. Relative RNA expression was calculated using the formula ratio = 2(Ctref -Cttarget). Data shown represent the mean and S.E. of three separate experiments. The following primer pairs were used: c-jun forward (5′-TGGGCACATCACCACTACAC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGTTGCTGAGGTTGGCGTA-3′); dp5 forward (5′-AGACCCAGCCCGGACCGAGCAA-3′) and reverse (5′-ATAGCACTGAGGTGGCTATC-3′); bim forward (5′-CTACCAGATCCCCACTTTTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCCCTCCTCGTGTAAGTCTC-3′); fasL forward (5′-CCACCTCCATCACCACTACC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTGGGGTTGGCTATTTG-3′); β-actin forward (5′-CAACTGGGACGATATGGAGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TCTCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCAG-3′). Reporter Construction and Luciferase Assays—A fragment spanning from -1568 to +81 relative to the transcription start site of rat dp5 genomic sequence was produced by PCR with the forward primer 5′-CCATCTAGCTAGCTAGCATCTATTA-3′ and the common reverse primer 5′-AGCGTCGCCGCAACC-3′. This fragment was fused to the promoterless firefly luciferase gene of pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to generate a dp5 (-1568/+81)-luc. A series of reporter constructs with the same 3′-end but different 5′-ends were also constructed by PCR using dp5 (-1568/+81)-luc as the template and the common reverse primer as mentioned above. Forward primers are as follows: 5′-ATCTTTTCTTATAACAGCCGAA-3′ for dp5 (-356/+81)-luc; 5′-GAGCCTCCCGCAGCC-3′ for dp5 (-270/+81)-luc; 5′-CGGGCCGGATGATGTAA-3′ for dp5 (-125/+81)-luc; and 5′-CCCCCTCCACCATGTGACACTT-3′ for dp5 (-85/+81)-luc. The mutated ATF site (TTACATCA to GGACATCG) (13Ueno Y. Kume N. Miyamoto S. Morimoto M. Kataoka H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Moriwaki H. Minami M. Hashimoto N. Kita T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was introduced into dp5 (-1568/+81)-luc by overlap extension PCR. First, two DNA fragments with a 19-bp overlap (GAGGGGGGGACATCGTCCG) containing the mutated ATF site were synthesized by PCR using dp5 (-1568/+81)-luc as template with forward primer 5′-GATAGGTACCCCATCTAGCTAGCTAGCATCTATTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGGGGGGGACATCGTCCG-3′ and with forward primer 5′-CGGACGATGTCCCCCCCTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGATCTAGCGTCGCCGCAACC-3′. The full length of the -1568 to +81 fragment of dp5 promoter containing the mutated ATF site was obtained by mixing the two DNA fragments produced from the first-step PCR as template in the second PCR with the outermost primers. The second PCR was carried out at 94 °C for 1 min and then 25 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. All PCR products were subcloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. The sequence encoding FLAG-Δ169 was amplified from the Ad-FLAG-Δ169 by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3 between XhoI and HindIII following the ATG and 8-amino acid FLAG epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys). Specific primers are as follows: forward, 5′-ATTACTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TATAAAGCTTTTAAAACGTTTGCAACTGCT-3′. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. CGNs were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described previously (11Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell.

Plasmids transfected contained 2 μg of various reporter plasmids, 9 μg of expression plasmids or pcDNA3-based vectors, and 100 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, pCMV-RL (Promega). Neurons were kept in conditioned medium after transfection for 12 h and then switched to the serum-free medium containing 25 or 5 mm KCl for 12 h. The levels of firefly luciferase activity were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, as we reported previously (12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y.

Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DIV5 neurons were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-FLAG-Δ169 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for 36 h. To test the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, CGNs were infected at DIV5 with 100 MOI of Ad-FLAG-Δ169, the cells were fixed 36 h after infection and stained with FLAG antibody and with the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) (5 μg/ml) to visualize nuclear morphology. Fluorescent images were captured by using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described in detail previously (15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotide probes spanning the ATF binding site (forward, 5′-AGCTCGGATGATGTAACCCCGATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATCGGGGTTACATCATCCGAGCT-3′), as well as those bearing mutated ATF site (forward, 5′-AGCTCGGACGATGTCCCCCCGATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATCGGGGGGACATCGTCCGAGCT-3′) were annealed and labeled with γ-32P (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. 32P-Labeled probes were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear proteins in a 20-μl DNA binding reaction buffer. For supershift, 1 μg of c-Jun antibody (catalog number sc-1694x; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or 1 μg ATF2 antibody (catalog number sc-187x; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was preincubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 1 h. DNA protein complexes were resolved by 4% polyacrylamide gel and exposed to photography. ChIP Assay—ChIP was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 4.5 × 107 cerebellar granule neurons were used in each treatment. 4 h after they were switched to the serum-free medium containing 25 or 5 mm KCl, neurons were cross-linked by the addition of 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and were terminated with glycine (final concentration of 0.125 m). Neurons were harvested and incubated in 600 μl of SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors for 10 min on ice. Chromatins were sonicated to yield fragments of about 0.5 kb in length. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). After it was precleared with protein G-agarose, 5% of the supernatant was saved as input DNA. 2 μg of rabbit c-Jun antibody (catalog number sc-1694x; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit normal IgG (Sigma) was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After wash, immune complexes were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 200 mm NaCl). A part of the captured immunocomplex was subjected to Western blotting with another mouse c-Jun antibody (610327; BD Biosciences Pharmingen) to detect whether captured chromatins contained c-Jun. Cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight. RNA was degraded with RNase A for 30 min, and protein was degraded with proteinase K for 2 h. DNA was purified using the EZChIP polypropylene spin column and subjected to PCR amplification using the primers spanning the ATF site on the dp5 promoter (forward, 5′-AGGGTTAAAAGTTACCTCTCGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCCCAAGTTTCGCTCTGC-3′; c-jun promoter spanning the TRE-jun2 site (forward, 5′-CTAGACAGCCAAACCAAGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTCACGGGATGAGGTAAT-3′). RNA Interference—The BS/U6 vector was kindly provided by Dr. Cress W. Douglas (University of South Florida College of Medicine) (16Ma Y. Cress W.D. Haura E.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure the specificity, multiplicity controls were employed (17Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Two Dp5 small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), shdp5a and shdp5b, targeting the 19-nucleotide AGAGAAACGGGATGTCATT (938-956) or GACGGAGCGTGATTTCTAA (1386-1404) in the 3′-untranslated region of dp5 mRNA (NCBI accession number NM_057130) were designed (18Kalinec G.M. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Urrutia R. Esteban-Cruciani N. Chen S. Kalinec F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16019-16024Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The targeted regions showed no significant homology with any other genes by BLAST searches. The shRNA expression cassettes containing sense loop (TTCAAGAGA)-antisense termination signal T6 were inserted downstream of the U6 promoter. For ectopic Dp5 expression, the intact coding sequence of dp5 with its 3′-untranslated region containing the shRNA targeting sites was amplified from the genome of Sprague-Dawley rats and inserted into pCMV3×FLAG (Sigma). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. To knock down the expression of FLAG-dp5, 0.5 μg of FLAG-dp5 and 5 μg of shdp5a or shdp5b were co-transfected into 293A cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were harvested and processed for Western blotting with FLAG antibody to detect the expression of FLAG-dp5 protein. DIV5 CGNs were transfected with BS/U6 vector, shdp5a, or shdp5b together with pCMV-EGFP by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (11Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). EGFP was used to mark the transfected cells. 48 h after transfection, neurons were switched to medium containing 25 or 5 mm KCl for 12 h. Neurons were stained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize nuclear morphology and propidium iodide (PI) to detect membrane damage. Apoptosis was quantified by scoring the percentage of EGFP-positive neuron population with pyknotic nuclei or with PI-positive cells. Unbiased counting cells (>600 for each group) were scored blindly without knowledge of their previous treatment. JNK Mediates the Up-regulation of dp5 during Apoptosis Induced by Potassium Deprivation in CGNs—To determine whether potassium deprivation evokes the activation of JNK/c-Jun in CGNs, DIV7 neurons maintained in 25 K+S were switched to 25 K or 5 K medium for various durations of time (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h), and then processed for Western blotting with antibodies against phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun. Consistent with previous studies (12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), potassium deprivation led to an increase in the level of phospho-JNK starting at 0.5 h without detectable changes in total JNK level (Fig. 1A). As observed in Fig. 1A and consistent with previous results (12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), potassium deprivation also resulted in a significant increase in levels of c-Jun phosphorylation starting at 0.5 h and lasting for up to 4 h, which paralleled the increase in level of JNK phosphorylation. c-Jun is a autoregulated immediate early gene, and our results clearly showed that the c-Jun protein level is significantly increased at 0.5 h. These results suggested that JNK and c-Jun are activated in the early period of apoptosis induced by potassium deprivation, as we reported previously (12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test whether the observed potassium deprivation-evoked increase of JNK/c-Jun activity was accompanied by the induction of dp5, a time course experiment was carried out in which dp5 mRNA levels were measured through Q-PCR analysis at different times (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h). The dp5 mRNA increased significantly, starting at ∼1 h after the time point (0.5 h) at which JNK/c-Jun activation was detected after potassium deprivation (Fig. 1B). To clarify whether JNK activity is required for dp5 up-regulation, we first used a JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (12Shi L. Gong S. Yuan Z. Ma C. Liu Y. Wang C. Li W. Pi R. Huang S. Chen R. Han Y. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). Treatment of CGNs with SP600125 inhibited the induction of dp5 mRNA by ∼62% (Fig. 1C). As a further test of specificity, SP600125 was replaced by CEP11004, a mixed lineage kinase inhibitor that inhibits the JNK pathway but not JNK itself. Treatment with CEP11004 led to an over 65% reduction of dp5 mRNA (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that JNK is involved in dp5 up-regulation. The incomplete inhibition of dp5 induction by SP600125 or CEP11004 was not due to their inefficiency to inhibit JNK, because the induction of c-jun mRNA, a result of JNK activation, was completely inhibited in both inhibitor-treated cultures (Fig. 1C). Consistent with a previous study (8Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results indicate that JNK partially mediates the up-regulation of dp5 by potassium deprivation in CGNs. Dominant Negative c-Jun, FLAG-Δ169, Attenuates the Up-regulation of dp5—The facts that c-Jun, a downstream transcription factor of JNK, was activated after potassium deprivation (12Shi L. Gong S.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) preceding the up-regulation of dp5 and that inhibition of the JNK/c-Jun pathway attenuated dp5 induction (Fig. 1B) raise the possibility that the activation of c-Jun is required for the up-regulation of dp5. To identify the c-Jun-dependent events in the neuronal apoptosis and investigate whether c-Jun is involved in dp5 up-regulation, we used the recombinant adenoviruses expressing FLAG-Δ169 (Ad-FLAG-Δ169) (12Shi L.

Without the transactivation domain, it prevents endogenous c-Jun complex from activating target genes by exhausting functional c-Jun and occupying c-Jun binding sites. To verify that FLAG-Δ169 encoded by the adenoviruses was expressed in infected CGNs, the cells were fixed 36 h after infection and stained with FLAG antibody and with the DNA dye Hoechst 33258 to visualize nuclear morphology. Fig. 2A showed representative immunofluorescence pictures of neurons infected with Ad-FLAG-Δ169 at an MOI of 100, and ∼70-80% of the CGNs were found to express FLAG-Δ169. c-Jun is a nuclear protein, and FLAG-Δ169 was also localized exclusively in the nucleus. We also detected the expression of Ad-Δ169 by Western blotting with FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). In order to test whether c-Jun mediates the induction of dp5 mRNA by potassium deprivation observed here, the CGNs were infected at DIV5 with 100 MOI of Ad-FLAG-Δ169 or Ad-GFP and then were maintained in 25 K+S for 36 h. The infected neurons were switched to medium containing 25 or 5 mm KCl for 4 h. RNA was isolated, and Q-PCR experiments were performed using primers specific for c-jun, dp5, bim, fasL, or β-actin. Potassium deprivation led to a significant increase in c-jun, dp5, bim, and fasL mRNA level in cells infected with Ad-GFP. It is well characterized that c-jun is an autoregulated gene, its protein c-Jun binds to the TRE-jun1 and TRE-jun2 sites on its own promoter to promote its expression (23Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T.

High expression is dependent on the locus control region (LCR) and coincides with more frequent LCR-gene contacts. These contacts are established in the context of an active chromatin hub (ACH), a spatial chromatin configuration in which the LCR, together with other regulatory sequences, loops toward the active β-globin-like genes. Here, we used recently established I/11 cells as a model system that faithfully recapitulates the in vivo erythroid differentiation program to study the molecular events that accompany and underlie ACH formation. Upon I/11 cell induction, histone modifications changed, the ACH was formed, and the β-globin-like genes were transcribed at rates similar to those observed in vivo. The establishment of frequent LCR-gene contacts coincided with a more efficient loading of polymerase onto the β-globin promoter. Binding of the transcription factors GATA-1 and EKLF to the locus, although previously shown to be required, was not sufficient for ACH formation. Moreover, we used knock-out mice to show that the erythroid transcription factor p45 NF-E2, which has been implicated in β-globin gene regulation, is dispensable for β-globin ACH formation.

The mammalian β-globin gene loci serve as a model system for studying developmental gene regulation. The murine β-globin locus contains four β-like globin genes that are arranged on the DNA in the order of their developmental expression. Expression of the β-like globin genes is restricted to the erythroid lineage. In erythroid progenitor cells, they are expressed at basal transcription levels, comparable with that of most other genes. However, at later stages of erythroid maturation they are expressed at exceptionally high levels. This high transcription rate is dependent on the β-globin locus control region (LCR) 2The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; 3C, chromosome conformation capture; ACH, active chromatin hub; CH, chromatin hub; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HSs, hypersensitive sites; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; RT, reverse transcriptase; E, embryonic day (e.g. E12.5); EKLF, erythroid Kruppel-like factor.2The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; 3C, chromosome conformation capture; ACH, active chromatin hub; CH, chromatin hub; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HSs, hypersensitive sites; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; RT, reverse transcriptase; E, embryonic day (e.g. E12.5); EKLF, erythroid Kruppel-like factor.

This technique involves quantitative PCR analysis of formaldehyde cross-links made between selected DNA fragments as a measure of their interaction frequency. 3C technology revealed that high expression of the β-globin genes at later stages of differentiation coincides with the formation of an active chromatin hub (ACH), a spatial configuration of the locus in which the LCR, together with additional HSs upstream and downstream of the locus, loops toward the active β-like globin genes (2.Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). At early stages of erythroid differentiation a smaller chromatin hub (CH), is present. It is composed of contacts between the outer HSs of the locus and part of the LCR but does not contain the genes (3.Palstra R.J. Tolhuis B. Splinter E. Nijmeijer R. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The β-globin genes switch interaction with the ACH in relation to their transcriptional activity during development. The embryonic genes contact the LCR in embryonic blood, whereas the adult genes do so in fetal liver and adult bone marrow (3.Palstra R.J. Tolhuis B. Splinter E. Nijmeijer R. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, ACH formation was proposed to be crucial for the high expression rates of the β-globin genes: spatial clustering of cis-regulatory DNA elements ensures a high local concentration of transcription factors, required for efficient gene transcription (4.de Laat W.

Although this is likely true for LCR-gene contacts, the functional significance of the outer HSs participating in the hub is still unclear. Deletion of these sites, or depletion of the transcription factor CTCF, which abrogates interactions with the outer HSs, has no measurable effect on β-globin gene expression (5.Bender M.A. Byron R. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Bulger M. Groudine M. Blood. 2006; 108: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6.Splinter E. Heath H. Kooren J. Palstra R.J. Klous P. Grosveld F.

Little is known about the molecular events that are involved in the establishment of contacts between the LCR and the genes as the locus proceeds from a CH to an ACH during erythroid differentiation.Mice containing a targeted deletion of the β-globin LCR have provided insight into LCR-independent modifications of the locus (1.Epner E. Reik A. Cimbora D. Telling A. Bender M.A. Fiering S. Enver T. Martin D.I. Kennedy M. Keller G. Groudine M. Mol.

Although none of the β-globin genes express beyond basal levels in these mice, they appear to have similar chromatin properties as their wild-type counterparts that express 25-100-fold more efficiently. Thus, the promoters are hypersensitive, contain highly acetylated histones, and bind both basal transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein and tissue-specific transcription factors such as NF-E2 and GATA-1, albeit at slightly reduced efficiency (7.Bender M.A. Bulger M.

RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) binding to the β-major promoter was reduced only 2-fold in the absence of the LCR, whereas a more dramatic reduction (5-fold) in binding was observed at the third exon of β-major, leading to the conclusion that the LCR primarily acts by enhancing the transition from initiation to elongation (9.Sawado T. Halow J. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).GATA-1, EKLF, and NF-E2 are the best characterized tissue-specific transcription factors involved in β-globin gene transcription. All three factors bind to elements in the β-globin LCR and to promoters of the β-globin genes (11.Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Bresnick E.H.

GATA-1 is essential for the development of the erythroid lineage in mice (15.Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), and restoration of GATA-1 activity in a GATA-1-null cell line leads to β-globin gene activation (16.Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). EKLF is essential for adult β-globin gene expression in mice (17.Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A.

Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). EKLF and GATA-1 both function in β-globin ACH formation; frequent contacts between the LCR and the genes are lacking in their absence (10.Vakoc C.R. Letting D.L. Gheldof N. Sawado T.

NF-E2 is composed of a ubiquitously expressed subunit, MafK (or p18 NF-E2), and an erythroid-specific transactivator subunit, p45 NF-E2 (20.Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). NF-E2 binds most prominently to HS2 in the LCR but also to an element just downstream of the adult β-globin gene promoter (11.Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Bresnick E.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kang S.H. Vieira K. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on studies using a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell line lacking the p45 subunit, NF-E2 is thought to be essential for β-globin gene transcription and to mediate the hyperacetylation of histones and the deposition of RNAP II at the β-globin gene promoters (21.Lu S.J.

However, mice lacking the erythroid-specific subunit p45 show normal erythropoiesis and express the β-globin genes at slightly reduced levels compared with wild type (25.Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The current view is that p45 NF-E2 is crucial in certain cultured erythroid cell systems but has redundant factors in vivo. However, mice lacking both p45 NF-E2 and the related factors Nrf-2 or Nrf-3 did not show an erythroid phenotype beyond that seen with loss of p45 NF-E2 alone (26.Martin F. van Deursen J.M.

It is unknown whether NF-E2 functions in β-globin ACH formation.Here we analyzed the role of erythroid-specific transcription factors and characterize the molecular events that accompany activation of high β-globin gene expression rates at the late stages of erythroid differentiation. Careful analyses of recently established I/11 erythroid cells show that they provide a good model system for these studies, where upon maturation, β-globin gene expression increases to reach the high transcription levels observed in vivo. Increased transcription coincides with stabilized LCR-gene contacts and a more efficient loading of RNAP II onto the β-globin gene promoters. GATA-1 and EKLF bind their target sites in the β-globin locus prior to ACH formation, showing that although required, the mere binding of these factors is not sufficient for the establishment of frequent LCR-gene contacts. Similarly, NF-E2 already binds to the locus in erythroid progenitor cells prior to ACH formation. We used p45 knock-out mice to investigate the role of NF-E2 in β-globin gene regulation and demonstrate that although β-globin gene expression is slightly reduced in the absence of this factor, the β-globin ACH is formed normally. Thus, unlike GATA-1 and EKLF, NF-E2 is dispensable for long-range LCR-gene contacts in the β-globin locus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulturing I/11 Cells and Primary Fetal Liver Cells−To generate primary fetal liver cells, livers were isolated from B6 E12.5 embryos, resuspended by repeated pipetting and applied through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Next, primary E12.5 liver cells were cultured as described previously for I/11 cells (29.Dolznig H. Boulme F. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3651-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In short, cells were cultured in serum-free stem cell medium (StemPro-34 SFM, Invitrogen) containing 0.5 units/ml erythropoietin (a kind gift from Ortho Biotech), 100 ng/ml stem cell factor, and 1 μm dexamethasone. Proliferating cells were expanded and kept at a density between 1.5 × 106 and 4 × 106 cells/ml. To induce differentiation, proliferating cells were washed twice with Hanks’ balanced salt solution and seeded at 2-3 × 106 cells/ml in differentiation medium containing 5 units/ml erythropoietin and 1 mg/ml transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich). During differentiation, cells were kept at densities of 2-6 × 106 cells/ml. Differentiation status was monitored by measuring cellular size distribution using an electronic cell counter (CASY-1, Schärfe-System). Differentiated cells were harvested when size distribution ranged between 6 and 7 μm, which typically took 24-32 h for primary fetal liver cells and 40-48 h for I/11 cells.Analysis of Gene Expression−Total RNA was isolated from ∼1 × 106 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1.5 μg of RNA was treated for 1 h with DNAse I (Invitrogen) to remove genomic DNA contamination. cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using either 500 ng of oligo(dT)12-18 or 200 ng of random hexamers as primers. Quantification of transcripts was performed on Opticon II real-time PCR machines (MJ Research) using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green (Sigma-Aldrich). The following PCR program was used: 2 min at 94 °C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 15 s at 75 °C (during which measurements were taken) followed by a 10-min chain extension. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Expression levels were normalized to levels measured for control genes (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 (Rnh1), and 18S).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)−ChIP analysis was performed as described in the Upstate protocol (www.upstate.com), except that cells were cross-linked using 2% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Real-time quantification of precipitated DNA sequences (with typical fragment sizes between 300 and 600 bp) was performed on Opticon II PCR machines (MJ Research) using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green (Sigma-Aldrich) under the following cycling conditions: 2 min at 94 °C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 15 s at 72 °C and 15 s at 75 °C (during which measurements were taken). Enrichment was calculated relative to a control gene, and all values were normalized to input measurements. The following antibodies were used: anti-RNAP II (N-20; sc-899), anti-GATA-1 (N-6; sc-265), anti-p45 NF-E2 C-term. (C-19; sc-291), anti-p45 NF-E2 N-term (H-230; sc-22827), anti-MafK (C-16; sc-477), and anti-Nrf-2 (H-300; sc-13032) (all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-acetyl histone H3 (catalog No. 06-599, from Upstate); anti-dimethyl histone H3 K9/K27 (ab7312) and anti-histone H3 (ab1791) (from Abcam). Anti-EKLF (5-V) was kindly provided by J. Philipsen, and anti-Bach1 antiserum (A1-5) was kindly provided by K. Igarashi (31.Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Data were normalized to input, and enrichment was measured over control gene (necdin or amylase, giving identical results).3C Analysis−3C analysis using HindIII as restriction enzyme was performed essentially as described (32.Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Real-time quantification of ligation products was performed on Opticon II PCR machines (MJ Research) using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) and double-dye oligonucleotides (5′-FAM and 3′-TAMRA) as probes. The following PCR program was used: 2 min at 94 °C, 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C and 90 s at 60 °C. Primer and probe sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Data were normalized to interaction frequencies measured in the XPB (xeroderma pigmentosum type B) locus to account for differences in quality and quantity of DNA templates.RESULTSI/11 Cells as a Model System for Studying LCR-mediated β-Globin Gene Expression−Primary erythroid cells isolated directly from mouse fetal liver can be both expanded in vitro and induced to undergo synchronous differentiation to fully mature, enucleated erythrocytes (33.Dolznig H. Kolbus A. Leberbauer C. Schmidt U. Deiner E.M. Mull-ner E.W. Beug H. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 105: 323-344PubMed Google Scholar). We found that they express the adult β-major gene at basal levels when brought into culture under conditions that enrich for progenitor cells (Fig. 1B). Differentiation of these cells in vitro resulted in an increase in steady-state β-globin messenger RNA levels to amounts similar to that observed in vivo (Fig. 1B). Differentiation was accompanied by an increase in RNAP II-binding to the promoter and third exon of the β-major gene (Fig. 1C) and an increase in interaction frequency between the LCR (HS2) and the β-major gene (Fig. 1D), as determined by an improved 3C strategy that uses Taqman probes for a more quantitative analysis of interaction frequencies (6.Splinter E. Heath H. Kooren J. Palstra R.J. Klous P. Grosveld F. Galjart N. de Laat W. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). However, primary progenitor cells often differentiate spontaneously, which precludes the collection of large homogeneous cell populations required for large-scale ChIP and 3C (34.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar) experiments. We therefore compared I/11 erythroid progenitors (29.Dolznig H. Boulme F. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with these primary erythroid cells with respect to β-globin gene expression characteristics during erythroid differentiation. I/11 cells are erythroid progenitor cells established from fetal livers of p53-/- mice. The cells can be expanded indefinitely in vitro, and upon exposure to physiologically relevant stimuli such as erythropoietin, they undergo terminal differentiation into enucleated erythrocytes in a synchronized manner (29.Dolznig H. Boulme F. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30.von Lindern M. Deiner E.M. Dolznig H. Parren-Van Amelsvoort M. Hayman M.J. Mullner E.W. Beug H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3651-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of β-globin gene expression showed that differentiation of I/11 cells was accompanied by an ∼20-fold increase in steady-state levels of β-major transcripts, reaching levels comparable with those observed in vivo (Fig. 2A). Also, RNAP II-binding to the promoter and third exon of the β-major gene increased and reached levels equal to those observed in vivo (Fig. 2B). Finally, more frequent LCR-gene contacts were observed upon differentiation of I/11 cells (Fig. 2C) (3.Palstra R.J. Tolhuis B. Splinter E. Nijmeijer R. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that seen in primary erythroid cells (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we conclude that I/11 cells faithfully recapitulate the later stages of erythroid differentiation not only morphologically (29.Dolznig H. Boulme F. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but also with respect to the transcriptional profile of the β-globin genes. Moreover, we note that non-induced proliferating I/11 progenitor cells express the β-globin genes at levels comparable with the basal β-globin gene expression levels observed in transgenic mice lacking the LCR (1.Epner E. Reik A. Cimbora D. Telling A. Bender M.A. Fiering S. Enver T. Martin D.I. Kennedy M. Keller G. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Non-induced cells also lack the frequent β-globin LCR-gene contacts observed in induced I/11 cells, suggesting that proliferating I/11 progenitor cells represent a stage of erythroid differentiation where transcription of the β-globin-like genes is mostly LCR-independent. Indeed, when I/11 cells were analyzed at different time intervals after induction of differentiation, increased expression rates of β-major, as measured by the amount of nascent transcripts (Fig. 2D), coincided well with increased HS2/β-major interaction frequencies (Fig. 2E), supporting the idea that the LCR regulates transcription by contacting the gene. We therefore conclude that I/11 cells are a good model system to study the molecular mechanisms behind LCR-mediated activation of high β-globin gene expression levels.FIGURE 2I/11 cells as a model system to study LCR-mediated β-globin gene expression.

Acetylation of histone H3 (AcH3) is a mark for active chromatin. The murine β-globin locus is characterized by high levels of erythroid-specific AcH3 at the cis-regulatory sites present in the LCR and at the promoters of the active genes (35.Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Christensen H.M. Im H. Nuzzi P.A. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14494-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 36.Schubeler D. Groudine M. Bender M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11432-11437Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that in non-induced I/11 cells, histones at the HSs of the LCR and the promoter of the active β-major gene, but not at the inactive βh1 gene, were already hyperacetylated. In differentiated I/11 cells, H3 acetylation levels increased maximally 3.5-fold at sites within the LCR and less than 2-fold at the β-major promoter (Fig. 3A). The observation that histone H3 at the β-major promoter is already hyperacetylated prior to ACH formation is in agreement with the fact that promoter hyperacetylation occurs also in the absence of the LCR (8.Schubeler D. Francastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). The data show that a strong increase in β-major transcription activity that takes place upon erythroid differentiation is accompanied by a small increase in the levels of H3 acetylation at the promoter; we therefore investigated whether local abundance of a repressive histone modification also changes upon I/11 differentiation. Using an antibody that recognizes both dimethylated lysine 9 and 27 of histone H3 (2MeH3K9/K27), we found that non-induced I/11 cells already contained low levels of 2MeH3K9/K27 at the HSs of the LCR, which did not change substantially when cells underwent differentiation (Fig. 3B). Levels at the β-major promoter were also low prior to induction but dropped even further (2-fold) upon cellular differentiation, whereas 2MeH3K9/K27 levels at the inactive βh1 promoter were high throughout differentiation. Using an antibody against the C-terminal part of histone H3, we found high amounts of H3 at the inactive βh1 promoter and low amounts of H3 at the regulatory sites of the LCR and the β-major promoter (Fig. 3C), in agreement with their low nucleosome density and hypersensitivity for nuclease digestion. Histone H3 abundance at the sites remained largely the same during differentiation, showing that our ChIP results obtained with antibodies against acetylated and methylated H3 truly reflect differentiation-dependent changes in histone H3 modifications. We conclude that the transition from basal to highly activated β-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation is accompanied by an increased ratio of positive versus negative chromatin modifications at the β-major promoter and the HSs of the LCR.FIGURE 3Differentiation of I/11 cells is accompanied by an increased ratio of positive versus negative chromatin modifications at the LCR and β-major promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2059182483,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune blistering disease, characterized by the loss of cell-cell adhesion between epidermal keratinocytes and the presence of autoantibody against desmoglein 3 (Dsg3), which provides adhesive integrity to desmosomes between adjacent keratinocytes. We have previously shown that PV-IgG purified from patients depletes desmosomes of Dsg3. However, PV-IgG contains not only antibodies against a variety of different epitopes of Dsg3 but also against other unknown antigens. Therefore, we examined whether the Dsg3-depleting activity of PV-IgG is generated specifically by anti-Dsg3 activity in a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line (DJM-1) and normal human keratinocytes by using four different pathogenic and nonpathogenic monoclonal antibodies against Dsg3. We demonstrate that these monoclonal antibodies deplete cells and desmosomes of Dsg3, as PV-IgG does. Individual monoclonal anti-Dsg3 antibodies display characteristic limits to their Dsg3-depleting activity, which correlates with their pathogenic activities. In combination, these antibodies exert a cumulative or synergistic effect, which may explain the potent Dsg3-depleting capability of PV-IgG, which is polyclonal. Finally, although Dsg3-depletion activity correlated with AK-monoclonal antibody pathogenicity in mouse models, the residual level of Dsg3, when below ∼50%, does not correlate with the adhesive strength index in the present study. This may suggest that although the Dsg3 depletion is not indicative for adhesive strength, the level of Dsg3 can be used as a read-out of pathogenic changes within the cell and that the Dsg3 depletion from desmosomes plays an important role in skin fragility or susceptibility to blister formation in PV patients."

Here, we investigated the role of HDAC in the expression of type II collagen, a marker of differentiated chondrocytes. We found that HDAC activity in primary articular chondrocytes decreases during dedifferentiation induced by serial monolayer culture and that the activity recovered during redifferentiation induced by three-dimensional culture in a cell pellet. Inhibition of HDAC with trichostatin A or PXD101 was sufficient to block type II collagen expression in primary culture chondrocytes. HDAC inhibition also blocked the redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes by suppressing the synthesis and accumulation of type II collagen. HDAC inhibition promoted the expression of Wnt-5a, which is known to inhibit type II collagen expression, and knockdown of Wnt-5a blocked the ability of HDAC inhibitors to suppress type II collagen expression. In addition, the induction of Wnt-5a expression by HDAC inhibitors was associated with acetylation of the Wnt-5a promoter.

Taken together, our results suggest that HDAC promotes type II collagen expression by suppressing the transcription of Wnt-5a. Differentiation of uncommitted mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes is initiated by the proliferation and recruitment of chondrogenic mesenchymal cells into condensations. These precartilage condensations develop into cartilage nodules containing differentiated chondrocytes. Chondrogenesis can be mimicked by micromass culture of mesenchymal cells in vitro. Differentiated chondrocytes are characterized by the ability to synthesize cartilage-specific extracellular matrix molecules including type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycans, which are necessary for normal cartilage development (1Sandell L.J. Adler P. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D731-D742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2DeLise A.M. Fischer L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The activity of cartilage-specific matrix molecule synthesis by the differentiated chondrocytes is unstable and rapidly lost in response to certain environmental changes. For instance, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TSA, trichostatin A; P, passage; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TSA, trichostatin A; P, passage; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; siRNA, small interfering RNA.-1β cause the loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotypes (dedifferentiation) by halting the synthesis of cartilage-specific matrix molecules (3Ghosh P.

Acta. 1990; 1052: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte dedifferentiation is also induced by serial monolayer culture and is accompanied by a gradual shift in the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan to type I and III collagen and versican, respectively (5Benya P.D. Padilla S.R. Nimni M.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

Dedifferentiated chondrocytes redifferentiate in three-dimensional culture in an alginate gel or cell pellet (6Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J.

Cell Res. 1994; 212: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Although maintenance of a differentiated chondrocyte phenotype is important for cartilage homeostasis, the detailed mechanisms of the differentiation and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes remain largely unknown. Because chondrocyte differentiation/dedifferentiation is regulated by various soluble factors including growth factors and cytokines, we hypothesized that histone deacetylase (HDAC) may regulate the differentiation status of chondrocytes. HDAC modulates the growth and differentiation of various cell types by governing chromatin structure and repressing the activity of specific transcription factors (8Wade P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 9McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The major function of HDAC is to remove acetyl groups from histones, which causes the condensation of the chromatin structure. For example, HDAC can reverse the acetylation of histone H3 on Lys9 and Lys14 and histone H4 on Lys8 and Lys12, which are associated with transcriptional activation (10Ogryzko V.V. Schilts R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). Chromatin condensation inhibits the access of transcription factors to the promoter regions of specific target genes and ultimately leads to transcriptional repression. The specific roles of various HDAC family members have been investigated by gene deletion experiments. For instance, knock-out of HDAC4 in mice causes premature ossification of developing bones due to an early onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy (11Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N.

Also, HDAC1 is required for the normal formation of the craniofacial cartilage of zebrafish (13Pillai R. Coverdale L.E. Dubey G. Martin C.C. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 231: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among the growth factors, leukemia/lymphoma-related factor is known to interact with HDAC1, inhibiting the expression of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein gene and the differentiation of chondrocytes (14Liu C.J. Prazak L. Fajardo M. Yu S. Tyagi N. Di Cesare P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47081-47091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC4 and 5 are required for the inhibition of Runx2 by transforming growth factor β and are involved in osteoblast differentiation (15Kang J.S. Alliston T. Delston R. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibiting HDAC suppresses the enhancement of chondrogenesis by inhibitors of retinoic acid receptor-mediated signaling in primary cultures of mouse limb mesenchyme (16Weston A.D. Chandraratna R.A. Torchia J. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The above findings suggest that HDAC regulates the differentiated phenotypes of chondrocytes by promoting the expression of cartilage-specific matrix molecules, but the evidence so far is indirect. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the role of HDAC in the expression of type II collagen by primary cultures of chondrocytes. We report that HDAC activity is required for the expression of type II collagen, a marker of differentiated chondrocytes. We also show evidence that HDAC acts by blocking the expression of Wnt-5a. Cell Culture—Mesenchymal cells were derived from the distal tips of E11.5 mouse embryo limb buds. The cells were suspended at a density of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Chondrogenesis was induced by placing the cells in 15-μl drops in culture dishes and incubating for 5 day (17Oh C.-D. Chang S.-H. Yoon Y.-M. Lee S.-J. Lee Y.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5613-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Articular chondrocytes were isolated from the knee cartilage of 2-3-week-old New Zealand White rabbits (6Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, cartilage slices were digested enzymatically in 0.2% collagenase type II, and individual cells were grown in complete DMEM. To induce dedifferentiation, passage (P) 0 chondrocytes were serially subcultured up to P4 by plating cells each time at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2. Redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes was induced by three-dimensional culture in a cell pellet as described previously (6Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, a suspension (1 ml) of dedifferentiated cells (2 × 105 cells) in complete DMEM was sedimented by brief centrifugation. Cell pellets were incubated up to 6 day to cause redifferentiation. The differentiation status of chondrocytes was determined by examining the expression of type II collagen. Cartilage explants were obtained from rabbit knee joints by cutting them into 32-mm3 pieces and then culturing the explants for 72 h in complete DMEM with or without 0.3 μM trichostatin A (TSA) with daily changes of the culture medium. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswoods, TX) and reverse-transcribed with ImProm-II™ reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). The PCR primers and conditions are summarized in Table 1. The qRT-PCR was performed using an iCycler™ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa Bio). All qRT-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate, and the amplification signal from the target gene was normalized by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal in the same reaction.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers and PCR conditionsGenePrimer sequencesSizeATaAT, annealing temperature.OriginbOrigin, primers are designed from known sequence of indicated species.bp°CCollagen-IIScS, sense primer.5′-GAC CCC ATG CAG TAC ATG CG-3′37062RabbitAsdAs, antisense primer.5′-AGC CGC CAT TGA TGG TCT CC-3′Collagen-IIS5′-GGG TCT CCT GCC TCC TCC TGC TC-3′20454MouseAs5′-TCC TTT CTG CCC CTT TGG CCC TAA TTT TCG GG-3′Collagen-XIS5′-TTTCCTCCATCCCATCTG-3′39656HumanAs5′-GGACTCCCTGGAACTAAG-3′Chondromodulin-IS5′-ACAGTGACCAAGCAGAGCATC-3′50456MouseAs5′-GCGGCATCCTTGGTAATTG-3′HDAC-1S5′-TTACTACTACGACGGGGATGTTG-3′33058HumanAs5′-GCGATGTCCGTCTGCTGCTTAT-3′HDAC-3S5′-CGGGTGCTCTACATTGATATCGACATCCAC-3′390NDeND, not detected under various conditions.MouseAs5′-TACCAGGAGAGGGATATTGAAACTCTTGAC-3′HDAC-6S5′-CGGTAATGGAACTCAGCACA-3′33956HumanAs5′-AGGTGGGTGAGGTGGGCATAAC-3′HDAC-7aS5′-GGACAAGAGCAAGCGAAGT-3′438NDHumanAs5′-CCGTGCTCGCTGTCATTG-3′HDAC-11S5′-TGCACACGAGGCGCTATCTTA-3′35652HumanAs5′-GAAGTCTCGCTCATGCCCA-3′Wnt-5aS5′-ACGCTAAGGGTTCCTATGAGA-3′47660HumanAs5′-CATAGCAGCACCAGTGAAACT-3′β-CateninS5′-GAAAATCCAGCGTGGACAATGGCTACTC-3′54256HumanAs5′-ACCATAACTGCAGCCTTATTAACC-3′PlakoglobinS5′-CTTCCGGCTCAACACCAT-3′38056HumanAs5′-GGCACATCGCTGGAGTACA-3′c-JunS5′-ATGGAGTCCCAGGAGCGGATCAA-3′25156HumanAs5′-GTTTGCAACTGCTGCGTTAG-3′p21S5′-CCGTGGACAGTGAGCAGTTG-3′58756MouseAs5′-TGGGCACTTCAGGGTTTTCT-3′MMP-13S5′-TGATGGACCTTCTGGTCTTCTGGC-3′57355MouseAs5′-CATCCACATGGTTGGGAAGTTCTG-3′GAPDHS5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3′29962RabbitAs5′-CACAATGCCGAAGTGGTCGT-3′GAPDHS5′-TCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC-3′45050MouseAs5′-TGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCAC-3′Wnt-5a (A)S5′-AGTCCCTGGAAGCAGACG-3′64562Mouse~ChIPfChIP, primers are designed for ChIP assay.As5′-CTTCTTCATGGCGAGGG-3′Wnt-5a (B)S5′-AGTCCCTGGAAGCAGACG-3′44962Mouse~ChIPAs5′-AGGAGTTGGTATAGCGTGGA-3′β-actinS5′-GGCCAGCGTTTGCCTTTTATGGTAATAAT-3′16762Mouse~ChIPAs5′-CGAACTATCAAGACACAAAAGAAGGCTATA-3′MMP-13S5′-CATTTCCCTCAGATTCTGCCA-3′13162Mouse~ChIPAs5′-GGGAGTCCAGCTCAACAAGAAG-3′p21S5′-AGAGACATGGAGGAAGGTGGGA-3′22962Mouse~ChIPAs5′-GACCACACTAATGGCTACCTGC-3′a AT, annealing temperature.b Origin, primers are designed from known sequence of indicated species.c S, sense primer.d As, antisense primer.e ND, not detected under various conditions.f ChIP, primers are designed for ChIP assay. Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Rabbit articular chondrocytes cultured on coverslips were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized and blocked for 30 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with an antibody (10 μg/ml) against type II collagen (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), followed by rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Immunohistochemistry—Cartilage explants and chondrocyte pellets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h at 4 °C, dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm sections as described previously (18Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The sections were stained using the LSAB2 system-horseradish peroxidase kit (Dako Co., Carpinteria, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, sections on slides were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies against type II collagen (Chemicon International Inc.) or acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by biotinylated link reagent, and finally streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase reagent for 10 min. Immunoreactive proteins were then visualized with the 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate-chromogen solution. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-conjugated riboprobes for type II collagen and Wnt-5a were synthesized using digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (Roche Diagnostics) as described by Ryu and Chun (19Ryu J.-H. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22039-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment of rabbit type II collagen was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGG TCT CCT GCC TCC TCC TGC TC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTC CAT CTC TGC CAC GGG GT-3′ (antisense), and the PCR product was inserted into the pSPT-18 vector. For Wnt-5a, the full-length cDNA encoding rabbit Wnt-5a was cut with PstI and SacI, and the product was inserted into the pSPT-18 vector. The cloned pSPT-18 plasmids containing type II collagen or the Wnt-5a fragment were linearized with EcoRI or HindIII and transcribed with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases (Roche Diagnostics), respectively. The resulting transcripts were used to synthesize digoxigenin-conjugated antisense and sense riboprobes. For hybridization, sections of cartilage explants were treated with 0.2 n HCl for 10 min and then permeabilized with 20 μg/ml protease K for 10 min at 37 °C. After acetylation with 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min, the sections were incubated with hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 4 × SSC, 10 μM dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) containing denatured sense or antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. After hybridization overnight at 42 °C, the sections were washed, and nonspecifically bound riboprobes were eliminated by digestion with RNase. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-digoxigenin antibody, and hybridization signals were visualized with a solution of 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-iodolyl-phosphate (Roche Diagnostics). Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell lysates were prepared as described previously (6Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with antibodies against type II collagen, acetylated histone H4 (K8; Upstate Biotechnology) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Pharmingen). The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). HDAC Activity Assay—HDAC activity was determined using nuclear extracts, which were prepared by homogenizing chondrocytes in lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Following addition of 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, the cells were incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected and used for the HDAC activity assay. HDAC activity was determined fluorimetrically using a Fluor de Lys HDAC assay system (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 10 μg of nuclear extract (20Myzak M.C. Karplus P.A. Chung F.-L. Dashwood R.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5767-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Transfection of Expression Vectors—The mammalian expression vectors for human HDAC-1, -6, and -11 (pCNS-hHDAC-1, pCMV-SPORT6-hHDAC-6, and pCMV-SPORT6-hHDAC-11) were obtained from Korea Bioinformation Center (Daejun, Korea). Empty and expression vectors were transfected into P1 chondrocytes using Metafectene™ (Biontex, Planegg, Germany) through the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were maintained in complete DMEM for 48 h and used for further analyses (19Ryu J.-H. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22039-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Preparation of Wnt-5a-conditioned Media—Wnt-5a-producing mouse fibroblast L929 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Conditioned medium was collected from Wnt-5a-producing L929 cells after 36 h in serum-free DMEM. The conditioned medium was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration in an Amicon stirred cell (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with a YM-10 membrane (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff) as described by Ryu and Chun (19Ryu J.-H. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22039-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Wnt-5a by siRNA—A 21-mer siRNA for Wnt-5a was designed based on the coding sequence of rabbit Wnt-5a (GenBank™ accession number DQ388600). The following siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Samchully Pharm (Daejeon, Korea): 5′-UAA UGC CUU UGG CCG UAU UTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAU ACG GCC AAA GCC AUU ATT-3′ (antisense). After heating the siRNA oligonucleotides for 2 min at 90 °C to denature secondary structures within single strands, the sense and antisense strands were allowed to anneal at 30 °C for 1 h. Chondrocytes were then transfected with the siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using a commercial ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) and chondrocytes differentiated from mesenchymal cells. Mouse mesenchymal cells derived from the distal tips of E11.5 mouse embryo limb buds were maintained as a micromass culture to induce chondrogenic differentiation in the absence or presence of 20 nm TSA or 200 nm PXD101. The cells at day 5 were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, suspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated at 25% amplitude for five 10-s cycles using a Digital Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT), with cooling on ice for 1 min between each cycle. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology). After preclearing with anti-rabbit IgG and 40 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, chromatin was incubated with 3 μg anti-acetylhistone H4 antibody or control IgG in a total volume of 2 ml for 12 h at 4°C. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. After extensive washing, the pellets were treated with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3), and the eluted fraction was mixed with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and heated for 4 h at 65 °C. DNA was purified by phenol extraction and used as a template for PCR. The PCR primers for the ChIP assay were designed to correspond to the promoter regions of Wnt-5a, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, p21, and β-actin (Table 1). HDAC Activity in Chondrocytes Depends on the Differentiation Status—To investigate the role of HDAC in the maintenance of differentiated chondrocyte phenotypes, we first examined HDAC activities during the dedifferentiation and redifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. Primary chondrocytes were serially subcultured as a monolayer to induce their dedifferentiation. Dedifferentiation was confirmed by a decrease in type II collagen expression (Fig. 1A). HDAC activity was decreased in a similar pattern as type II collagen expression during subculture-induced dedifferentiation (Fig. 1B). The decrease in HDAC activity by dedifferentiation was reversed during the redifferentiation of chondrocytes (Fig. 1D) caused by three-dimensional culture in a cell pellet (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that HDAC activity in chondrocytes is connected to the differentiation status. Inhibition of HDAC Activity Blocks Type II Collagen Expression in Articular Chondrocyte—To determine whether HDAC activity is associated with maintenance of differentiated phenotypes in chondrocytes, we examined the role of HDAC in type II collagen expression, a marker of differentiated chondrocytes. For this purpose, we used two HDAC inhibitors, TSA (21Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PXD101 (22Plumb J.A. Finn P.W. Williams R.J. Bandara M.J. Romero M.R. Watkins C.J. La Thangue N.B. Brown R. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). Both inhibitors have a broad spectrum of activity against class I, II, and IV HDACs, with little specificity for individual HDAC isoforms (23Monneret C. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 40: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Both TSA and PXD101 induced the time- and dose-dependent hyperacetylation of histone H4 in chondrocytes (Fig. 2A and 2C). A fluorimetric HDAC activity assay revealed that these two HDAC inhibitors effectively inhibited HDAC activity (Fig. 2, B and D) without significantly affecting cell viability or proliferation (Fig. 2E). Inhibition of HDAC by TSA or PXD101 dramatically reduced the number of type II collagen-expressing chondrocytes, as determined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3C). The inhibitory effects of TSA or PXD101 on type II collagen expression were dose- and time-dependent as determined by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to the inhibitory effects of HDAC inhibitors on type II collagen expression, TSA (Fig. 3D) and PXD101 (data not shown) did not affect expression of other chondrogenic molecules such as type XI collagen (24Eyre D.R. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2004; 427: S118-S122Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and chondromodulin-I (25Suzuki F. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Expression of plakoglobin, a known HDAC target gene (26Shim J.S. Kim D.H. Kwon H.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was increased by HDAC inhibition, whereas β-catenin and c-Jun were detected as negative controls. The results, therefore, indicate that regulation of type II collagen expression by HDAC is specific in chondrocytes. We also examined the effects of the HDAC inhibitors in cartilage explants, which more accurately reflect in vivo conditions. As in primary chondrocytes, TSA (Fig. 4A) and PXD101 (data not shown) suppressed type II collagen expression and induced the hyperacetylation of histone H4 in cartilage explants. Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC by TSA (Fig. 4, B and C) or PXD101 (data not shown) blocked both the expression and accumulation of type II collagen during redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes in three-dimensional culture. Collectively, these results indicate that HDAC activity is required for type II collagen expression in chondrocytes.FIGURE 4HDAC inhibition suppresses type II collagen expression in cartilage explants and inhibits the redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. A, cartilage explants were untreated (control) or treated with 0.3 μM TSA for 72 h. The level of the type II collagen transcript was detected by in situ hybridization. Acetylated histone H4 was detected by immunohistochemistry using a Dako LSAB-horseradish peroxidase system. B and C, chondrocytes were subcultured up to P2 as a monolayer (m). Dedifferentiated P2 cells were cultured three-dimensionally in cell pellets (p) for 3 or 6 day in the absence or presence of 0.3 μM TSA. The level of type II collagen expression was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting (B). The accumulation of type II collagen and acetylation of histone H4 in the three-dimensional culture were detected by immunohistochemistry (C). The data represent typical results from four independent experiments. Coll, collagen; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined which isoform(s) of HDAC is involved in the regulation of type II collagen expression. As shown in Fig. 5A and 5B, the decrease and recovery of HDAC activity during dedifferentiation and redifferentiation, respectively, did not accompany significant changes in the expression of HDAC-1, -6, or -11. We could not detect HDAC-3 and -7a in rabbit articular chondrocytes (data not shown). In addition, overexpression of HDAC-1, -6, or -11 in dedifferentiating P1 chondrocytes did not modulate type II collagen expression (Fig. 5C), suggesting that these HDAC isoforms are not associated with type II collagen expression. Participation of Wnt-5a in the Regulation of Type II Collagen Expression by HDAC—Because the inhibition of HDAC promotes gene transcription by inhibiting chromatin condensation, it is unlikely that the collagen gene is a direct target gene of HDAC. Indeed, we previously found that expression of type II collagen in chondrocytes is suppressed by IL-1β via the up-regulation of Wnt-5a (19Ryu J.-H. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2030510935,"Pooled mutant competition assays have shown that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis MT2282 gene (Rv2224c, annotated as encoding a proteinase) is required for bacterial survival in mice. To understand the mechanism of this requirement, we conducted a genetic and biochemical study of the MT2282 gene and its product. MT2282 encodes a member of the microbial esterase/lipase family with active site consensus sequences of G-X-S-X-G, and we have concluded that the MT2282 protein is, in fact, a cell wall-associated carboxylesterase rather than a proteinase, as initially annotated. The MT2282 gene product preferentially hydrolyzes ester bonds of substrates with intermediate carbon chain length. Purified MT2282 is a monomer with enzymatic catalysis properties that fit in the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. Esterase activity was inhibited by paraoxon and dichlorvos. Replacement of Ser215, Asp450, and His477 by Ala in the consensus motifs completely abolishes esterase activity, suggesting that Ser215-Asp450-His477 forms a catalytic triad with Ser215 as an active site residue. To evaluate the role of the MT2282 in pathogenesis, the gene was deleted from the M. tuberculosis genome. BALB/c mouse aerosol infections showed reduced colony-forming unit loads in lungs and spleens and less lung pathology for the ΔMT2282 mutant. High dose intravenous infection of mice with the mutant resulted in a significantly delayed time to death compared with the wild type or complemented mutant. These results indicate that MT2282 encodes a cell wall-associated carboxylesterase, which is required for full virulence of M. tuberculosis. We propose that MT2282 (Rv2224c) and its adjacent paralogous gene MT2281 (Rv2223c) be named caeA and caeB respectively, for carboxylesterase A and B.

Tuberculosis, one of the leading human infectious diseases claiming about 1.7 million deaths annually, is difficult to control because of human immunodeficiency virus/tuberculosis co-infection and emergence of virtually untreatable extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Clearly, new drugs and effective vaccines are urgently needed, which creates a strategic demand for better understanding of the genetic basis for the virulence and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. The M. tuberculosis genome sequence and annotation has provided an invaluable blueprint of the genomic organization and gene functionality for this slowly growing pathogen (1Cole S.T. Brosch R.

However, annotation is unable to predict gene function with complete accuracy due to divergent evolution of protein motifs. Recent advances in genetic approaches such as transposon mutagenesis and DNA microarray techniques has facilitated initial functional screening of essential genes for in vitro and in vivo growth in a high throughput manner (2Sassetti C.M.

Mycobacterial genes that are involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, cell division chromosomal partitioning, and secretion are more likely to be required for survival in the mouse (5Sassetti C.M.

Immun. 2005; 73: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For example, mutation of six of the mycobacterial membrane protein mmpL family genes severely compromises the ability of the respective mutants to multiply in mouse lungs (6Lamichhane G. Tyagi S. Bishai W.R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis escapes host defense mechanisms by inhibiting and evading the host immune system (7Pai R.K.

However, the underlying genetic expression and molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Virulence genes refer to those genes that are required for disease in the host, but not necessarily essential for in vitro growth. The MT2282 gene of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 (or Rv2224c of H37Rv) was identified as a putative virulence gene by high throughput techniques (5Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 6Lamichhane G. Tyagi S. Bishai W.R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is annotated as a putative proteinase (TIGR-CMR) or a probable exported protease (TuberculList). Interestingly, isogenic M. tuberculosis mutants with an insertionally inactivated MT2282 gene were attenuated in pooled mutant competition studies in mouse lungs and spleens (5Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 6Lamichhane G. Tyagi S. Bishai W.R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This gene was also preferentially expressed in human macrophages (13Dubnau E. Fontan P. Manganelli R. Soares-Appel S. Smith I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Under nutrient starvation, MT2282 was significantly up-regulated during 4-96 h after the onset of starvation (14Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the virulence role of MT2282 in the mouse infection model. We demonstrated that the MT2282 protein is membrane-associated and possesses carboxylesterase activity. The functional annotation of proteinase appears incorrect because no proteinase activity was found. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—M. tuberculosis CDC1551 (15Valway S.E. Sanchez M.P.

Immun. 2005; 73: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 used for mycobacterial phage propagation was cultured in 7H9 or 7H10 medium, and incubated at 30 °C when temperature-sensitive phage was recovered. Escherichia coli strains (DH5α for cloning, BL21 for expression, and HB101 for in vitro packaging) used in this study were cultured in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 °C with shaking. Hygromycin B was added to the media at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for M. tuberculosis deletion mutants or 200 μg/ml for E. coli. Kanamycin was added to the media with a final concentration of 20 μg/ml for M. tuberculosis-complemented mutants or 50 μg/ml for E. coli. Gene Deletion, Complementation, and Characterization—A specialized phage transduction approach was used to generate the MT2282 deletion mutant (16Bardarov S. Bardarov Jr., S. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Sambandamurthy V. Larsen M. Tufariello J. Chan J. Hatfull G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The complementation vector was constructed by PCR amplification of a 2-kb DNA fragment containing MT2282 and its native promoter into the EcoRI site of the mycobacterial integrating vector pMH94 (17Lee M.H.

To characterize the deletion and complementation, genomic DNA from wild type (WT), ΔMT2282, and COM was isolated, restricted with XhoI, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotted onto nylon membranes by standard capillary transfer. The DNA templates were hybridized with PCR-generated, digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled gene probes, detected with an anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and developed with CSPD 3The abbreviations used are: CSPD, disodium 3-[4-methoxyspiro {1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3,3,13,7]decan}-4-yl]phenyl phosphate; (Fast Garnet) GBC, (4′-amino-2,3-dimethylazobenzene O-aminoazotoluene); CFU, colony-forming unit; WT, wild type. substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Primers used for generating probes included MT2282-specific gya-F and moi-R, hygromycin-specific hyg4-F and hyg4-R, and kanamycin-specific kanf-1 and kanr-1 (see Table 1).TABLE 1Primer sequences used in this studyPrimerSequencegya-F5′-GGACGCGTTCAACAACTATG-3′moi-R5′-ACTTCCCGTAGCTCATGAAC-3′hyg4-F5′-AGGTCTTCCCGGAACTGCTG-3′hyg4-R5′-TCCTCGAACACCTCGAAGTC-3′kanf-15′-GGCCGCGATTAAATTCCAAC-3′kanr-15′-TTCAACAGGCCAGCCATTAC-3′EX-25′-TCGTGAATTCGAGCCGAAGCTGGGCCAGCC-3′EXP-35′-CTTCCTCGAGCTAGCACTTGGCGCCGCTGG-3′SER15′-CCTGGGCTACGCGTACGGCAC-3′SER25′-GTGCCGTACGCGTAGCCCAGG-3′Asp-F5′-CACCACCCATGCCCCGGCGACG-3′Asp-R5′-CGTCGCCGGGGCATGGGTGGTG-3′H477-15′-GACGGAACCCAGGCCACGGTGGTATTC-3′H477-25′-GAATACCACCGTGGCCTGGGTTCCGTC-3′ Open table in a new tab MT2282 Expression, Purification, and Localization—The MT2282 gene, without its signal sequence, was PCR-cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the glutathione S-transferase-tagged expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using primers EX-2 and EXP-3 (see Table 1) to yield the expression vector pSL115. To solubilize the recombinant fusion proteins that accumulate as inclusion bodies, a mildly denaturing/refolding kit was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The fusion proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel chromatography, and the glutathione S-transferase tag was cleaved off with PreScission™ protease following the on-column cleavage protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Protein levels were quantified using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Rabbit anti-MT2282 polyclonal antibodies were generated using purified MT2282 as an immunogen according to a standard protocol (Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc.). To detect MT2282 in the culture medium, 7H9 culture supernatants were concentrated 20-fold with an Amicon ultra-centrifugal device (Millipore) before immunoblotting. M. tuberculosis cells were fractionated into cell envelope and cytosol by bead beating and centrifugation. Briefly, M. tuberculosis cell pellets were washed once and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in an O-ring tube with glass beads. After bead beating two times for 30 s each with maximum revolutions/min then centrifuging for 5 min at 13,000 revolutions/min, the upper cytosol phase was removed and passed through a 0.22-micron filter. The pellet containing the cell envelope and beads was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 2,500 revolutions/min for 2 min. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the middle phase containing the cell envelope fraction was collected. Standard protocols were followed for protein SDS-PAGE and semidry transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006: 10.8.4-10.8.7Google Scholar). Immunohybridization and detection was carried out according to a standard ECL protocol (Amersham Biosciences) using purified polyclonal rabbit anti-MT2282 IgG as the primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate as the secondary antibody. Carboxylesterase Activity of MT2282—Carboxylesterase activity of MT2282 was determined by observing the conversion of α-naphthyl acetate, α-naphthyl propionate, and α-naphthyl butyrate to α-naphthol according to Lanz and Williams (20Lanz W.W. Williams P.P. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each reaction mixture contained 0.1 ml of protein (0.5 mg/ml) and 1.5 ml of substrate (0.42 mm), 0.5 ml of Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.0 (0.2 m), and 0.4 ml of distilled water. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 39 °C (20Lanz W.W. Williams P.P. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the reaction, 0.5 ml of 10% lauryl sulfate (Sigma) solution containing 2.5 mg of fast garnet GBC (Sigma) was added. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min for color development. Absorbance at 560 nm was measured and the yield of α-naphthol extrapolated from a standard curve (linear from 0 to 50 μm) constructed with α-naphthol (Sigma). Catalytic activity of MT2282 was also tested on the fluorogenic substrates 4-methlumbelliferyl butyrate (5 μm, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0), 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate (5 μm, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0), and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (50 μm, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0). 145 μl of substrate was mixed with 4.5 μl of MT2282 (2 mg/ml) in an Eppendorf tube, and 100 μl was then pipetted into the assay wells of a 96-well plate (Costar 3694). The plate was read by the fluorometer (ICN Titertek Fluoroskan II) at room temperature with an excitation of 355 nm and an emission of 460 nm. Readings were recorded for 2 h at 3-min intervals. Initial rates were calculated and reported. To test carboxylesterase inhibitors, paraoxon, dichlorvos, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and sodium fluoride stock solutions were prepared using the manufacturer-recommended diluents (Sigma-Aldrich). 4-Methylumbelliferyl butyrate was used as substrate at 250 μm in 0.1 m Tris pH 8.0. Each inhibitor solution was added to the substrate to make final concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm. 100 μl of these mixtures were used as negative controls. The percentage of inhibition was determined as the ratio of the initial rate of inhibition divided by the normal rate. To characterize the active site serine and the catalytic triad, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was conducted to mutate Ser215, Asp450, and His477 to Ala215, Ala450, and Ala477, respectively, using primer pairs SER1 and SER2, Asp-F and Asp-R, and H477-1 and H477-2 (Table 1) and the plasmid pSL115. Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. Aerosol Infection—Female, 6-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were aerosol-infected as described previously (21Nuermberger E.L. Yoshimatsu T. Tyagi S. Williams K. Rosenthal I. O'Brien R.J. Vernon A.A. Chaisson R.E. Bishai W.R. Grosset J.H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 1131-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Colony-forming units (CFUs) present in lungs and spleens were counted at the indicated time points (see Fig. 8). At days 14 and 42, the lungs were fixed for histological examination with hematoxylin and eosin and acid-fast bacilli staining. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Time to Death—Groups of BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks old, female; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were infected with 0.2 ml of M. tuberculosis by intravenous injection via the lateral tail vein. Fresh cultures grown to early log phase were used. The inoculum was 1.5 × 06 CFUs for WT (n = 13), 1.76 × 106 CFUs for ΔMT2282 (n = 13), and 1.66 × 106 CFUs for COM (n = 12). Five mice of each group were sacrificed at day 1 for CFU load determination in the lungs. The death of the mice was recorded, and the mice were weighed weekly. A logrank test was applied to compare the survival curves. Generation and Characterization of an MT2282 Deletion Strain and Complemented Mutant—The MT2282 gene was deleted from the genome by the phage transduction and single step selection approach, yielding the deletion mutant (ΔMT2282). Fifteen base pairs at the 5′ and 64 base pairs at the 3′ of the gene remained (Fig. 1A). A single copy of MT2282 with its promoter was introduced into ΔMT2282 using the integrating vector pMH94 and kanamycin selection to give the complemented deletion mutant (Fig. 1A, COM). Phenotypically, ΔMT2282 was resistant to hygromycin but susceptible to kanamycin. COM was resistant to both hygromycin and kanamycin, whereas WT M. tuberculosis CDC1551 was susceptible to both antibiotics. Genotypically, Southern blotting demonstrated deletion of MT2282 in ΔMT2282 and confirmed its presence in COM and WT strains (Fig. 1B). Although ΔMT2282 and COM contained the hygromycin resistance gene, only COM retained the kanamycin resistance marker (Fig. 1B). Localization of the MT2282 Protein—Cloning of MT2282 into the expression vector pGEX-6P-1 was validated by DNA sequencing. A glutathione S-transferase-MT2282 fusion protein was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3). Approximately 99% of the protein remained as an insoluble inclusion body; therefore, a mild denaturation/refolding procedure was applied to achieve a maximum yield. Affinity purification of recombinant MT2282 yielded a protein that was soluble and 96% pure based upon Coomassie-stained PAGE analysis. The affinity-purified MT2282 protein was shown to be a monomer and had an apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa as extrapolated from migration on 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5% native PAGE (Fig. 2). A polyclonal rabbit MT2282 antiserum was raised using the purified recombinant protein. Control experiments showed that the anti-MT2282 protein A-purified polyclonal antibody reacted with a single band in M. tuberculosis whole cell lysates, indicating a high degree of specificity. Western blotting showed that a specific band was clearly present only in cell lysates from the WT and COM strains but not in the ΔMT2282 cell lysate (Fig. 3A), confirming the deletion. Because SignalP3.0 predicted a signal peptide sequence at the N terminus of MT2282, a WT culture supernatant was concentrated and tested for secreted MT2282. MT2282 immunoreactivity was also absent from the culture supernatant, indicating that the protein was not secreted (Fig. 3A). When whole cells were disrupted by bead beating and fractionated into cytosol and the envelope, MT2282 immunoreactivity was found only in the envelope of the WT and COM strains with <1% in the cytosol (Fig. 3B). A motif scan predicts that, at the N terminus of MT2282, an undecapeptide (amino acids 8-18, LAAVALV-LVGC) may serve as a prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. The prediction of a lipoprotein that is associated with the membrane is in agreement with our subcellular localization data (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Western blotting. Immunoblotting and hybridization using rabbit anti-MT2282 polyclonal antibodies (primary) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit-conjugated antibody (secondary) demonstrate that MT2282 is not secreted into the culture medium (A) but is retained in the cell envelope (B). In A, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants were concentrated 20-fold. Cell lysates were obtained by boiling mycobacterial cells in Laemmli sample buffer. In B, the cell envelope and cytosol fractions were obtained by bead beating and centrifugation. ∼0.5% of the cell envelop and 2% of the cytosol fractions were applied to the Western blot and yielded roughly a total protein ratio of 1:1.5 of cell envelop over cytosol as assessed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MT2282 Does Not Possess Proteinase Activity as Annotated—Sequence analysis by Pfam suggests MT2282 is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily (E = 4.2-70). This superfamily contains a typical tertiary fold, but family members lack obvious primary sequence similarity or substrate specificity (22Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 23Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The MT2282 protein is annotated as a putative proteinase or a probable exported protease. Using soluble, affinity-purified recombinant MT2282, we tested the protein for a variety of proteolytic activities. Purified MT2282 lacked activity when tested with either the proteinase substrate Hide Powder Azure (Calbiochem) or with the serine proteinase substrate bis-(N-CBZ-l-arginine amide)-rhodamine 110,dihydrochloride (BZAR, Biotium) (Fig. 4). Protein modeling led to the prediction that MT2282 was a proline iminopeptidase. However, assays with a proline iminopeptidase-specific substrate l-proline p-nitroanilide trifluoroacetate salt (PPNA, Sigma) were again negative (data not shown). In each substrate, we observed strongly positive proteolytic activity with the positive control enzymes (which was trypsin for Hide Powder Azure and BZAR and proline iminopeptidase for PPNA; the generous gift of Tadashi Yoshimoto, Nagasaki University, Japan). Carboxylesterase Activity of MT2282—In contrast to previous predictions, a sequence motif scan from the PROSITE data base predicted an esterase motif in MT2282 positioned between residues 89 and 230 with an E value = 0.00045 (24Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). An active site serine (Ser215) was predicted within residues 213-217 (G-Y-S-Y-G), consistent with the G-X-S-X-G consensus motif for members of the esterase/lipase superfamily (25Fojan P. Jonson P.H. Petersen M.T. Petersen S.B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In view of their bioinformatics findings, we tested affinity-purified MT2282 for esterase activity in vitro and found that MT2282 cleaved ester bonds and released α-naphthol from esterase substrates, such as α-naphthyl acetate, α-naphthyl propionate, and α-naphthyl butyrate. Interestingly, the esterase activity of MT2282 increased with the increasing carbon chain length of the substrate (p < 0.001 for 1-NA versus 1-NP and p < 0.05 for 1-NP versus 1-NB). However, the positive control for this system, porcine liver esterase, did not show this pattern (Fig. 5A). Using fluorogenic substrates, we further observed that MT2282 was most active on 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate followed by 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate, with weakest activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (Fig. 5B). In 0.2 m Na2HPO4 buffer, the optimum pH for MT2282 activity on α-naphthyl propionate was 7.0 within the range of pH 5.0-8.5 (Fig. 5C). Enzyme activity was routinely assayed at 39 °C because of the fact that 37 °C assays were 10% lower in activity. Enzymatic kinetics study yielded a curve that fit the classical Michaelis-Menten model, indicating a single active site of MT2282. With 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate as the substrate, the Vmax = 128.1 relative fluorescence units/min and Km = 738 μm (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Michaelis-Menten kinetics suggesting a single active site of MT2282. Data were recorded with the fluorometer (ICN Titertek Fluoroskan II) at room temperature with an excitation of 355 nm and an emission of 460 nm.

Sultatos L.G. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 90: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These inhibitors showed concentration-dependent inhibition in the 0.1-1.0 mm range. Dichlorvos stimulated activity some 10-12% at subinhibitory concentrations. Both sodium fluoride and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which are inhibitory for serine proteases and some esterases, were non-inhibitory at low concentrations but stimulatory for enzyme activity at high concentrations. The stimulation of ester bond hydrolysis was of interest, because it would indicate that sites other than the active site serine of MT2282 were involved. Such cooperativity, in some cases, can lead to activation of enzymes (26Rosenfeld C.A. Sultatos L.G. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 90: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plus, it has already been shown that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride does not inhibit all esterases (27Patel D. Scott C.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis Confirmed a Catalytic Triad—Microbial carboxylesterases share structural similarities (an open twisted β-sheet surrounded on both sides by α-helices) and the arrangement of three catalytic residues (the catalytic triad, Ser-Asp-His) with the serine located in a sharp turn between a β-strand and α-helix that is known as the nucleophile elbow, and the His side chain hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylic group of the Asp side chain to form a charge relay system (28Liu P.

ClustalW sequence alignment indicates that the G-Y-S-Y-G motif is highly conserved not only in the genus of Mycobacterium, but also in the genera Arthrobacter, Rhodococcus, and Nocardia. The same is true for the Asp450 and His477 residues (supplemental Fig. S1). To test the Ser215-Asp450-His477 catalytic triad, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted, and replacement of Ser215, Asp450, and His477 with Ala completely abolished esterase activity as assessed on 1-naphthyl propionate (Fig. 7). The same results were seen in an assay with the fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate as substrate (data not shown). These observations confirmed that the primary enzymatic function of MT2282 is e"

The COPII coat consists of a small GTPase, Sar1, and two protein complexes, Sec23-Sec24 and Sec13-Sec31. Sec23-Sec24 and Sec13-Sec31 appear to constitute the inner and the outermost layers of the COPII coat, respectively. We previously isolated two mammalian proteins (p125 and p250) that bind to Sec23. p125 was found to be a mammalian-specific, phospholipase A1-like protein that participates in the organization of ER exit sites. Here we show that p250 is encoded by the KIAA0310 clone and has sequence similarity to yeast Sec16 protein. Although KIAA0310p was found to be localized at ER exit sites, subcellular fractionation revealed its predominant presence in the cytosol. Cytosolic KIAA0310p was recruited to ER membranes in a manner dependent on Sar1. Depletion of KIAA0310p mildly caused disorganization of ER exit sites and delayed protein transport from the ER, suggesting its implication in membrane traffic out of the ER. Overexpression of KIAA0310p affected ER exit sites in a manner different from that of p125. Binding experiments suggested that KIAA0310p interacts with both the inner and the outermost layer coat complexes, whereas p125 binds principally to the inner layer complex. Our results suggest that KIAA0310p, a mammalian homologue of yeast Sec16, builds up ER exit sites in cooperation with p125 and plays a role in membrane traffic from the ER.

KIAA0310p, which shows sequence similarity to yeast Sec16 protein, was found to be localized at ERES, and its depletion induced their disorganization. Pull-down experiments demonstrated that KIAA0310p differs from p125 in terms of binding to COPII coat proteins. In addition, overexpression of the two proteins differently affected the organization of ERES.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Chemicals—To produce an anti-peptide antibody against human KIAA0310p, a mixture of two peptides with an extra cysteine residue at the C-terminal or N-terminal region (MFFQGGETENEENLC and CRLGRIGQRKHLVLN) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits.

To examine KIAA0310p-depleted HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips.To determine the subcellular distribution of KIAA0310p, 293T cells were cultured on 10 150-mm dishes, collected, suspended in 3.3 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, yielding postnuclear supernatant and nuclear fractions. The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min, yielding supernatant and mitochondrial fractions. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h, yielding microsomal and cytosolic fractions. Mitochondrial and microsomal pellets were suspended in 300 μl each of homogenization buffer. The nuclear pellet was washed once and suspended in 0.97 ml of buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology).Plasmid Construction, Transfection, and Pull-down Assay—The KIAA0310 clone was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kazusa, Japan). The obtained clone lacked nucleotides corresponding to the N-terminal 550 amino acids (aa) and corresponding to aa 2,265-2,310. (The full-length cDNA for KIAA0310p, now available from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, encodes a protein of 2,357 aa.) The C-terminal deletion may be generated by alternative splicing. We constructed a full-length cDNA for KIAA0310p by joining the 5′-end of the cDNA prepared by PCR to the obtained clone. The full-length cDNA for KIAA0310p and a partial cDNA encoding aa 374-2,357 (KIAA0310pΔN), both of which lack aa 2,265-2,310, were inserted into pFLAG-CMV-6c and -6b, respectively, to give rise to the pFLAG-KIAA0310p and pFLAG-KIAA0310pΔN.

Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). HeLa cells were grown on 35-mm dishes, transfected with duplex RNAs (200 nm), and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The cells were then transfected with 1 μg of the plasmid for VSVG-GFP and incubated at 40 °C for 24 h. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and then the cells were shifted to 32 °C to allow transport. At the indicated times, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. Alternatively, the cells were solubilized with 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 ml/35-mm dish) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. A portion of the lysate was digested with Endo H according to the manufacturer's protocol and then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. VSVG was visualized by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-VSVG antibody, and the intensities of the immunostained bands were quantitated with NIH image software.RESULTSIdentification of p250—Sec23-interacting proteins were purified from lysates of mouse brain using GST-mouse Sec23A as described previously (30Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). p250 was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis after tryptic digestion. The sequences of more than 10 peptide fragments derived from p250 were found in a protein encoded by the mouse KIAA0310 clone (41Okazaki N. Kikuno R. Ohara R. Inamoto S. Aizawa H. Yuasa S. Nakajima D. Nagase T. Ohara O. Koga H. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To confirm that p250 is KIAA0310p, we raised a polyclonal antibody against a mixture of two peptides derived from the sequence of human KIAA0310p and examined whether endogenous KIAA0310p is pulled down with GST-Sec23A expressed in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the human p250 pulled down with GST-Sec23A was recognized by the anti-KIAA0310p. The interaction between Sec23A and KIAA0310p was also examined by expressing the two proteins tagged with GST and FLAG, respectively, in 293T cells (Fig. 1B). In this experiment, we used a KIAA0310 construct lacking the N-terminal 373 aa (FLAG-KIAA0310pΔN) because the full-length construct was poorly expressed. As shown in Fig. 1B, FLAG-KIAA0310pΔN was pulled down with GST-Sec23A. The results of these experiments unequivocally indicated that p250 is KIAA0310p.The predicted coding region of KIAA0310 is 2,357 aa long, which is rich in Pro (13.2%), Gly (7.8%), Ser (11.2%), Ala (9.5%), and Leu (8.4%) and includes three Pro-rich regions (aa 3-276, aa 1,113-1,181, and aa 1,931-2,263) and one Tyr-rich region (aa 1,159-1,300). A FASTA search revealed that KIAA0310p shows 19.8% amino acid identity with S. cerevisiae Sec16 protein.KIAA0310p Is Localized at ERES—We next analyzed the localization of KIAA0310p in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2A, immunostaining for KIAA0310p showed a punctuated pattern with some concentration at the perinuclear region, typical for proteins located at ERES. Indeed, KIAA0310p was almost completely colocalized with the COPII component Sec31A (Fig. 2A, top row) and substantially with an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker, ERGIC-53 (middle row). On the other hand, the KIAA0310p-positive puncta, except at the perinuclear region, were negative for the Golgi marker GM130 (bottom row). To confirm the localization of KIAA0310p in ERES, cells were incubated with BFA to disrupt the Golgi apparatus (42Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 16: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (1537) Google Scholar) or transfected with a GTP-restricted form of Sar1 (Sar1(H79G)) to stabilize and nucleate ERES (43Shima D.T. Cabrera-Poch N. Pepperkok R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although BFA treatment induces Golgi disassembly, peripheral ERES are not significantly affected (34Shimoi W. Ezawa I. Nakamoto K. Uesaki S. Gabreski G. Aridor M. Yamamoto A. Nagahama M. Tagaya M.

As shown in Fig. 2B, BFA treatment induced dispersion of the COPI component β-COP (second row) but did not significantly affect the localization of KIAA0310p (top row) or Sec31A (top and second rows). When the GTP-restricted form of Sar1 was expressed, KIAA0310p (Fig. 2B, third row), like Sec31A (bottom row), accumulated at the perinuclear region, perhaps reflecting the consequence of inhibition of uncoating of the COPII coat.FIGURE 2KIAA0310p is localized at ERES.

To confirm this observation, we performed subcellular fractionation. Homogenates of 293T cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation, and each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against KIAA0310p and Sec23. As shown in Fig. 3A, KIAA0310p was predominantly present in the cytosol. On the other hand, Sec23 was found to be equally distributed in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. The distribution of KIAA0310p between cytosolic and microsomal fractions was similar when the subcellular fractionation was performed in the absence (Fig. 3A) or presence (not shown) of EDTA.FIGURE 3KIAA0310p is recruited to microsomal membranes in a Sar1-dependent manner.

Biosynthetic schemes have been proposed for these metabolites but until recently none of the proposed steps had been validated by biochemical or genetic studies. Using Penicillium paxilli as a model experimental system to study indole diterpene biosynthesis we previously showed by deletion analysis that a cluster of seven genes is required for paxilline biosynthesis. Two of these pax genes, paxP and paxQ (encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases), are required in the later steps in this pathway. Here, we describe the function of paxP and paxQ gene products by feeding proposed paxilline intermediates to strains lacking the pax cluster but containing ectopically integrated copies of paxP or paxQ. Transformants containing paxP converted paspaline into 13-desoxypaxilline as the major product and β-PC-M6 as the minor product. β-PC-M6, but not α-PC-M6, was also a substrate for PaxP and was converted to 13-desoxypaxilline. paxQ-containing transformants converted 13-desoxypaxilline into paxilline. These results confirm that paspaline, β-PC-M6, and 13-desoxypaxilline are paxilline intermediates and that paspaline and β-PC-M6 are substrates for PaxP, and 13-desoxypaxilline is a substrate for PaxQ. PaxP and PaxQ also utilized β-paxitriol and α-PC-M6 as substrates converting them to paxilline and α-paxitriol, respectively. These findings have allowed us to delineate clearly the biosynthetic pathway for paxilline for the first time.

Indole diterpenes are a large, structurally and functionally diverse group of secondary metabolites produced mainly by the Penicillium, Aspergillus, Claviceps, and Neotyphodium species of filamentous fungi (1Parker E.J.

Most of these metabolites are potent tremorgenic mammalian toxins (3Steyn P.S. Vleggaar R. Fortschr. Chem. Org.

Although much work has been done to demonstrate the origins of indole and diterpene components of these metabolites from tryptophan or a tryptophan precursor and mevalonate, respectively (5Acklin W.

Biosynthetic schemes have been proposed for these metabolites based on chemical identification of likely intermediates and precursor-feeding studies from the organism of interest and related filamentous fungi (9Gatenby W.A.

However, until recently none of the proposed steps had been validated by biochemical or genetic studies. The cloning and characterization of a cluster of genes from Penicillium paxilli necessary for biosynthesis of the indole diterpene, paxilline, has helped to understand the genetics and biochemistry of this important class of secondary metabolites (12Young C. McMillan L. Telfer E. Scott B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Analysis of the pax gene cluster has also facilitated the isolation of pax gene orthologues from Aspergillus flavus and Neotyphodium lolii, fungi that produce the related, but more complex indole diterpenes aflatrem and lolitrems, respectively (13Young C.A.

Based on gene disruption and chemical complementation studies, a cluster of seven genes including paxG (encoding a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase), paxM (encoding a FAD-dependent monooxygenase), paxC (encoding a prenyltransferase), paxP and paxQ (encoding two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases), and paxA and paxB (encoding two putative membrane proteins) 3B. Monahan, S. Saikia, and B. Scott, unpublished results. , has been shown to be essential for paxilline biosynthesis (12Young C. McMillan L. Telfer E. Scott B. Mol.

Recently, we have shown that four of these genes, paxG, paxM, paxB, and paxC, are required for the biosynthesis of the proposed first stable indole diterpene intermediate, paspaline (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Later steps in the paxilline biosynthesis pathway involve two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, PaxP and PaxQ, which are proposed to utilize paspaline and 13-desoxypaxilline as their respective substrates (15McMillan L.K. Carr R.L. Young C.A. Astin J.W. Lowe R.G. Parker E.J. Jameson G.B. Finch S.C. Miles C.O. McManus O.B. Schmalhofer W.A. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Goetz M. Tkacz J.S. Scott B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 270: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These compounds together with paspaline B, PC-M6, and β-paxitriol have been proposed to form a metabolic grid for paxilline biosynthesis (11Munday-Finch S.C. Wilkins A.L. Miles C.O. Phytochemistry. 1996; 41: 327-332Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The formation of paxilline from PC-M6 was proposed to occur either via 13-desoxypaxilline or viaβ-paxitriol suggesting a bifurcation at the penultimate step to paxilline biosynthesis (11Munday-Finch S.C. Wilkins A.L. Miles C.O. Phytochemistry. 1996; 41: 327-332Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to identify the substrates and products for PaxP and PaxQ and to assess the involvement of proposed paxilline intermediates. Given the versatility of cytochrome P450 enzymes to catalyze multiple steps (17Ro D.K. Arimura G. Lau S.Y. Piers E. Bohlmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using Big-Dye (Version 3) chemistry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with oligonucleotide primers (Sigma Genosys). Products were separated on an ABI Prism 377 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). PCR and RT-PCR Conditions—PCR of paxP and paxQ for cloning was carried out in 50-μl reaction volume containing 1× reaction buffer (Roche Applied Science), a 50 μm concentration of each dNTP, a 300 nm concentration of each primer, 0.75 unit of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix (Roche Applied Science), and 15 ng of genomic DNA. PCR for screening for paxP and paxQ was carried out in 50-μl reaction volume containing 1× reaction buffer (Roche Applied Science), a 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, a 200 nm concentration of each primer, 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and 10 ng of genomic DNA. RT-PCR for paxP and paxQ expression was performed in 25 μl reaction volume containing 1× reaction mix (a 200 μm concentration of each dNTP) (Invitrogen), a 200 nm concentration of each primer, 0.5 μl of RT/Platinum® Taq Mix (Invitrogen), and 100 ng of DNase-treated RNA. The thermocycle conditions routinely used with Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix and TaqDNA polymerase were one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (per kb) and one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min, and with RT/Platinum® Taq Mix one cycle at 50 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (per kb) and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Reactions were carried out in a PC-960, PC-960G (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia), or Mastercycler® gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) thermocycler. The primers used for amplifying paxP and paxQ for cloning were as follows: paxP (paxPEcoRIF2, 5′-TTGAATTCATGCATGGTAAGCAGCCG-3′, and paxPEcoRIR, 5′-GGGAATTC-CGGCCATTCAATCTCAAG-3′), and paxQ (paxQHindIIIF2, 5′-GAAAAGCTTTACTCTGACACACTCCGC-3′ and paxQHindIIIR, 5′-TTGAAGCTTCCTTATTGTGGCGCAGTC-3′). The primers contained mismatches (shown in bold) relative to the genomic sequences to introduce either EcoRI or HindIII sites, as appropriate, at both ends. These primers were also used for screening the transformants for integration of paxP and paxQ. The primers used for RT-PCR analysis of paxP and paxQ were as follows: paxP (SS1, 5′-TTCACGGACCACGTTGGTGG-3′, and SS2, 5′-TGCTCATGGCACTGGTGTGC-3′) and paxQ (SS3, 5′-GGAAGTCTGCATCTGCAACG-3′, and SS4, 5′-AGAACCTGGGTCGTGGTATG-3′). The primers spanned one of the introns so that targets only from RNA or cDNA would be primed. Construction of Plasmids Encoding PaxP and PaxQ Proteins—To construct an expression plasmid encoding PaxP, wild-type genomic DNA was used as a template in a PCR using the forward primer paxPEcoRIF2 and the reverse primer paxPEcoRIR. The 2.68-kb amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and ligated into EcoRI-digested pII99 vector yielding the plasmid pSS1. To obtain an expression plasmid encoding PaxQ, wild-type genomic DNA was used as a template in a PCR using the primers paxQHindIIIF2 and paxQHindIIIR. The 3.02-kb amplified fragment was digested with HindIII and subcloned into HindIII-digested pII99 to generate the plasmid pSS2. P. paxilli Transformation—Protoplasts of P. paxilli paxP and paxQ deletion mutant strains LMP1 and LMQ226, respectively, and pax cluster deletion mutant strains CY2 and LM662 were prepared and transformed with 5 μg of circular plasmids pII99, pSS1, or pSS2 as described previously (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on regeneration medium supplemented with either hygromycin (100 μg/ml) or Geneticin (150 μg/ml) (Roche Applied Science). Synthesis of PC-M6 and Paxitriol—Indole diterpenes PC-M6 and paxitriol were synthesized by sodium borohydride reduction of 13-desoxypaxilline and paxilline, respectively, using the method described by Miles et al. (25Miles C.O. Wilkins A.L. Gallagher R.T. Hawkes A.D. Munday S.C. Towers N.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 234-238Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Approximately 9 mg (0.021 mmol) of each of authentic 13-desoxypaxilline and paxilline (AgResearch, Ruakura, New Zealand) was reduced separately for 10 min with 12 (0.317 mmol) and 9 mg (0.238 mmol) of sodium borohydride in 9 ml of methanol, respectively. The products of the reduction reaction were checked by normalphase TLC (chloroform:acetone 9.5:0.5) to ensure no starting material remain. Ten ml of de-ionized water was then added to the reaction mixture followed by the addition of 2 ml of 10% (v/v) hydrochloric acid. The products were extracted four times with 10 ml of dichloromethane and the pooled extract was dried by the addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and then filtered. The filtrate was dried in vacuo and the residue dissolved in methanol. A sample of this was run on reverse-phase HPLC, as described previously (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which detected two peaks with a 1:2 ratio in both the reduction samples. The peaks in the paxilline reduction sample had retention times of 3.55 and 4.30 min and those in the 13-desoxypaxilline reduction sample had retention times of 5.85 and 7.75 min. The fractions corresponding to the two peaks were separated, pooled, and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The purified products of paxilline reduction were identified as α-paxitriol and β-paxitriol based on comparison to authentic standards (AgResearch, Ruakura, New Zealand). The purified products of 13-desoxypaxilline reduction were identified as α-PC-M6 and β-PC-M6 based on the NMR analysis of β-PC-M6 (Varian INOVA 500 equipped with an inverse-detection capillary probe) and the conversion of α-PC-M6 to α-paxitriol. PC-M6s were analyzed by LC-MSMS (see Supplemental Data) as described previously (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Feeding of Precursor Metabolites to Fungal Cultures—Mycelium from liquid cultures of P. paxilli was grown for 4 days as described previously (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On day 4, mycelium was washed three times with 10 ml of 1 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 g of washed mycelium transferred to two flasks each containing 12.5 ml of 20 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 4% (v/v) glycerol. To one flask, precursor metabolite was added in two equal doses of 100 μg (in 100 μl of acetone) at 24-h intervals during incubations at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. To the other flask, 100 μl of acetone was added as an external control. On day 6, mycelium was harvested for indole diterpene analysis as described previously (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Indole Diterpene Analysis—Fungal mycelia was analyzed for indole diterpenes by normal-phase TLC and reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (16Saikia S. Parker E.J. Koulman A. Scott B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In reverse-phase HPLC analysis, the characteristic feature of an indole moiety showing an absorption maximum at 230 nm and an absorption minimum at 280 nm was employed to confirm the presence of an indole diterpene in a sample. However, all reverse-phase HPLC traces reported here are shown for 230 nm wavelength. Complementation of P. paxilli paxP and paxQ Deletion Mutants with Respective Wild-type Genes—Previously, it was shown that the deletion mutants of paxP (LMP1) and paxQ (LMQ226) were blocked for paxilline biosynthesis and accumulated paspaline and 13-desoxypaxilline, respectively (15McMillan L.K. Carr R.L. Young C.A. Astin J.W. Lowe R.G. Parker E.J. Jameson G.B. Finch S.C. Miles C.O. McManus O.B. Schmalhofer W.A. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Goetz M. Tkacz J.S. Scott B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 270: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To confirm that disruption of paxP and paxQ genes was responsible for the block in paxilline biosynthesis complementation tests were carried out with LMP1 and LMQ226. The complementation constructs, pSS1 (paxP) and pSS2 (paxQ), were prepared by cloning PCR-amplified copies of paxP and paxQ genes into the geneticin-resistant vector pII99, respectively (Fig. 1). Protoplasts of deletion mutants LMP1 and LMQ226 were transformed with pSS1 and pSS2, respectively. Ten arbitrarily selected Geneticin-resistant transformants, from each transformation, were analyzed by normal-phase TLC (data not shown) and reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2) for their ability to synthesize paxilline. These analyses showed that the introduction of pSS1 and pSS2 into LMP1 and LMQ226, respectively, was able to restore paxilline biosynthesis in the recipient strains (Fig. 2). However, the deletion mutants containing the base vector, pII99, were not complemented for paxilline biosynthesis (data not shown). These results confirmed that the replacement of paxP and paxQ genes caused the block for paxilline biosynthesis in LMP1 and LMQ226 mutants, respectively, and that the paxP and paxQ complementation constructs are functional. These complementation constructs were further used for functional analysis of paxP and paxQ.FIGURE 2Genetic complementation of paxilline biosynthesis in paxP (LMP1) and paxQ (LMQ226) deletion mutants. Mycelial extracts of P. paxilli paxP and paxQ deletion mutants and their derivatives containing ectopically integrated copies of paxP and paxQ genes, respectively, were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC for indole diterpenes. A, paxP deletion mutant LMP1, deletion mutant LMP1 containing paxP (LMP1/pSS1-T4), paxilline and paspaline standards.

McMillan L. Telfer E. Scott B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that lacks the entire pax gene cluster and also into CY2 (22Young C. Itoh Y. Johnson R. Garthwaite I. Miles C.O. Munday-Finch S.C. Scott B. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that also lacks the entire pax gene cluster plus considerable flanking sequences (Fig. 1C). An arbitrary selection of Geneticin-resistant transformants was screened by PCR (data not shown) for ectopic integration of paxP or paxQ. Transformants containing a PCR product of the correct size were further assessed for paxP or paxQ expression by RT-PCR analysis using primers that spanned one of the introns so that targets only from RNA or cDNA would be primed. A transcript for paxP or paxQ was detected in all the PCR-positive transformants analyzed (shown in Fig. 3 for the transformants that were further used for functional analysis). As expected, no transcript for paxP or paxQ was detected in LM662, CY2, LM662/pII99, and CY2/pII99 strains. This analysis confirmed that both paxP and paxQ were expressed but at higher levels in the LM662 background than in the CY2 background. Transformants that showed high levels of paxP or paxQ expression were selected for further paxP and paxQ functional analysis experiments. Functional Analysis of paxP—To test that paspaline is a substrate for PaxP, LM662 and CY2 strains containing paxP were incubated with paspaline for 2 days and chloroform:methanol (2:1) extracts of these transformants analyzed for indole diterpenes by normal-phase TLC (data not shown) and reversephase HPLC (Fig. 4). Extracts of LM662/pSS1 and CY2/pSS1 transformants had two new indole diterpenes, 13-desoxypaxilline and β-PC-M6, as major and minor products, respectively, that were absent in LM662 and CY2 (Fig. 4) and transformants containing the base vector pII99 (data not shown). Paspaline was almost completely converted to 13-desoxypaxilline by the LM662/pSS1 transformants, whereas the CY2/pSS1 transformants showed only partial conversion of the added paspaline to indole diterpene products. Analysis of additional paxP-containing transformants showed that the degree of paspaline conversion correlated with the level of paxP expression. These results confirmed that paspaline is a substrate for PaxP and is converted to 13-desoxypaxilline as the major product and β-PC-M6 as the minor product and that PaxP is capable of catalyzing more steps than originally proposed (15McMillan L.K. Carr R.L. Young C.A. Astin J.W. Lowe R.G. Parker E.J. Jameson G.B. Finch S.C. Miles C.O. McManus O.B. Schmalhofer W.A. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Goetz M. Tkacz J.S. Scott B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 270: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Functional Analysis of paxQ—To test whether 13-desoxypaxilline is a substrate for PaxQ, LM662, and CY2 strains that contained paxQ were incubated with 13-desoxypaxilline, together with appropriate controls. Normal-phase TLC (data not shown) and reverse-phase HPLC analysis of extracts of LM662 and CY2 strains containing paxQ identified paxilline as the indole diterpene product (Fig. 5). As expected, no indole diterpenes other than the added 13-desoxypaxilline, were detected in extracts of LM662 and CY2 deletion mutants (Fig. 5) and LM662 and CY2 strains containing the base vector pII99 (data not shown). Similar to the paspaline feeding experiments (see above), the LM662/pSS2 transformants were more efficient at converting the added 13-desoxypaxilline to paxilline than the CY2/pSS2 transformants, with the degree of conversion correlating with the level of paxQ expression. These analyses confirmed that 13-desoxypaxilline is a substrate for PaxQ. PC-M6 Feeding Studies—Although PC-M6 has been proposed as a paxilline inte"
https://openalex.org/W2160085646,"Background Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) are the major long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) of the central nervous system (CNS). These nutrients are present in most infant formulas at modest levels, intended to support visual and neural development. There are no investigations in primates of the biological consequences of dietary DHA at levels above those present in formulas but within normal breastmilk levels. Methods and Findings Twelve baboons were divided into three formula groups: Control, with no DHA-ARA; “L”, LCPUFA, with 0.33%DHA-0.67%ARA; “L3”, LCPUFA, with 1.00%DHA-0.67%ARA. All the samples are from the precentral gyrus of cerebral cortex brain regions. At 12 weeks of age, changes in gene expression were detected in 1,108 of 54,000 probe sets (2.05%), with most showing <2-fold change. Gene ontology analysis assigns them to diverse biological functions, notably lipid metabolism and transport, G-protein and signal transduction, development, visual perception, cytoskeleton, peptidases, stress response, transcription regulation, and 400 transcripts having no defined function. PLA2G6, a phospholipase recently associated with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, was downregulated in both LCPUFA groups. ELOVL5, a PUFA elongase, was the only LCPUFA biosynthetic enzyme that was differentially expressed. Mitochondrial fatty acid carrier, CPT2, was among several genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to be downregulated by high DHA, while the mitochondrial proton carrier, UCP2, was upregulated. TIMM8A, also known as deafness/dystonia peptide 1, was among several differentially expressed neural development genes. LUM and TIMP3, associated with corneal structure and age-related macular degeneration, respectively, were among visual perception genes influenced by LCPUFA. TIA1, a silencer of COX2 gene translation, is upregulated by high DHA. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified a highly significant nervous system network, with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as the outstanding interaction partner. Conclusions These data indicate that LCPUFA concentrations within the normal range of human breastmilk induce global changes in gene expression across a wide array of processes, in addition to changes in visual and neural function normally associated with formula LCPUFA."
https://openalex.org/W2060094384,"Oral fluid-based rapid tests are promising for improving HIV diagnosis and screening. However, recent reports from the United States of false-positive results with the oral OraQuick ADVANCE HIV1/2 test have raised concerns about their performance in routine practice. We report a field evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy, client preference, and feasibility for the oral fluid-based OraQuick Rapid HIV1/2 test in a rural hospital in India.A cross-sectional, hospital-based study was conducted in 450 consenting participants with suspected HIV infection in rural India. The objectives were to evaluate performance, client preference and feasibility of the OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 tests. Two Oraquick Rapid HIV1/2 tests (oral fluid and finger stick) were administered in parallel with confirmatory ELISA/Western Blot (reference standard). Pre- and post-test counseling and face to face interviews were conducted to determine client preference. Of the 450 participants, 146 were deemed to be HIV sero-positive using the reference standard (seropositivity rate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28%, 37%)). The OraQuick test on oral fluid specimens had better performance with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 98, 100) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 99, 100), as compared to the OraQuick test on finger stick specimens with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 98, 100), and a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.4, 99.9). The OraQuick oral fluid-based test was preferred by 87% of the participants for first time testing and 60% of the participants for repeat testing.In a rural Indian hospital setting, the OraQuick Rapid- HIV1/2 test was found to be highly accurate. The oral fluid-based test performed marginally better than the finger stick test. The oral OraQuick test was highly preferred by participants. In the context of global efforts to scale-up HIV testing, our data suggest that oral fluid-based rapid HIV testing may work well in rural, resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2010145411,"Monoamine neurotransmitter transporters for norepinephrine (NE), dopamine and serotonin are important targets for antidepressants and analgesics. The conopeptide χ-MrIA is a noncompetitive and highly selective inhibitor of the NE transporter (NET) and is being developed as a novel intrathecal analgesic. We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a suite of mutated transporters to identify two amino acids (Leu469 and Glu382) that affected the affinity of χ-MrIA to inhibit [3H]NE uptake through human NET. Residues that increased the Kd of a tricyclic antidepressant (nisoxetine) were also identified (Phe207, Ser225, His296, Thr381, and Asp473). Phe207, Ser225, His296, and Thr381 also affected the rate of NE transport without affecting NE Km. In a new model of NET constructed from the bLeuT crystal structure, χ-MrIA-interacting residues were located at the mouth of the transporter near residues affecting the binding of small molecule inhibitors.

The monoamine neurotransmitter transporters are part of a larger family of Na+- and Cl--dependent transporters found in bacteria through to mammals. Dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine transporters (DAT, 3The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; NE, norepinephrine; NET, norepinephrine transporter; hNET, human NET; SERT, serotonin transporter; DMI, desipramine; bLeuT, bacterial leucine transporter; TM, transmembrane. 3The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; NE, norepinephrine; NET, norepinephrine transporter; hNET, human NET; SERT, serotonin transporter; DMI, desipramine; bLeuT, bacterial leucine transporter; TM, transmembrane.

Since desipramine and nisoxetine competitively inhibit NE transport, it appears that the binding site of χ-MrIA overlaps the antidepressant but not the NE binding site. There is currently no crystal structure of NET. Hence, structural details have been inferred from hydrophobicity, site-directed mutagenesis (performed mostly on related DAT and SERT proteins), and sequence analysis and subsequent computer homology models based on related bacterial transporters (12Pacholczyk T.

NET and other monoamine neurotransmitter transporters are predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning regions, intracellular C and N termini, and a large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4. A more detailed view of monoamine transporters is starting to emerge with the recent crystal structure of a bacterial leucine transporter (bLeuT) (20Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar), the closest functionally related transporter crystallized to date. Like monoamine transporters, bLeuT is Na+-dependent with 12 membrane-spanning regions. bLeuT shares 28% identity with human NET (hNET) (see Fig. 1). In the present study, we used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and homology modeling to locate residues on the hNET that interact with χ-MrIA. In the process, we identified a number of new interactions that affect NE transport and small molecule antidepressant binding at hNET. These results support a new model of NET constructed from the bacterial leucine transporter crystal structure. Materials—Desipramine hydrochloride, dopamine hydrochloride, nisoxetine hydrochloride and (-)-norepinephrine bitartrate were obtained from Sigma. U-0521 and GBR-12909 dihydrochloride were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). levo-[ring,2,5,6-3H]Norepinephrine (specific activity: 57.9 Ci/mmol), [N-methyl-3H]nisoxetine hydrochloride (specific activity: 85.0 Ci/mmol), and 3,4[ring-2,5,6-3H]dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine) (specific activity: 60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used with the human NET to produce mutant cDNAs. Oligonucleotide primers were designed and obtained as custom syntheses (Proligo Australia Pty. Ltd., Lismore, Australia). Custom primers of human NET were used to create the point mutants E122A, L169T, N170E, D175A, G177N, H178N, K189H, N192D, G193S, F207T, E223Q, S225H, H228D, L232P, Q234R, H296S, D298A, E304A, D310A, D378A, T381K, E382A, A384P, E393A, K463N, L469A, L469F, D473A, T474H, L543P, D546G, D547A, P552D and W556A, and the double mutants L114S + L469F, L232P + L469F, and L469F + L543P. F472L of the human DAT was also produced. A DAT loop 2 chimera was constructed by using restriction sites for XhoI and SacII present in the large extracellular loop of NET. The appropriate sequence of DAT loop 2 was ligated into the NET (NET residues 166-210) and site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to reorient a frameshift that occurred during the ligation process. Sequencing was used to determine the correct orientation of the EL2 chimera. Escherichia coli were transformed with mutant cDNA and subsequently used for plasmid preparation using a Wizard SV plasmid preparation kit (Beckman Coulter Australia Pty. Ltd., Gladesville, Australia) or a Qiagen mini preparation kit (Qiagen Pty. Ltd., Doncaster, Australia). Samples of purified mutant cDNA were prepared for automatic sequencing using a Big-Dye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia), with custom synthesized sequencing primers (Invitrogen or Sigma-Aldrich) and the cDNA from plasmid preparations. Samples were sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility (University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia) for automated sequencing to confirm each mutation. Cellular Uptake of [3H]Norepinephrine, [3H]Dopamine, and Binding of [3H]Nisoxetine—Cellular accumulation of NE, dopamine, and determination of inhibitor IC50 values were performed in 24-well plates as described previously (11Sharpe I.A. Palant E. Schroeder C.I. Kaye D.M. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40317-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or for norepinephrine uptake and nisoxetine binding assays in a modified 96-well plate assay. Briefly, COS-1 cells (ATCC; Manassas, VA) were grown in 96-well plates (Nunclon; Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with purified plasmid DNA encoding the human NET (hNET) (12Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) or mutant NETs using Metafectene reagent (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany). Assays measuring uptake were performed 48 h after transfection at room temperature. The culture medium was removed and the cells were gently washed three times with 150 μl of transport buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 5.55 mm d-(+)-glucose, 1.0 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μm U-0521 (to inhibit catechol-O-methyltransferase) and 100 μm pargyline (to inhibit monoamine oxidase) at pH 7.4. The final reaction volume was 50 μl. Nonspecific uptake of [3H]NE by transfected cells was defined by the accumulation occurring in the presence of 100 μm desipramine or 100 μm nisoxetine. Transfected cells were exposed to [3H]NE for 5-8 min at room temperature. The solution containing free [3H]NE was then rapidly removed, and the cells washed three times with 200 μl of ice-cold transport buffer without bovine serum albumin. The cells were lysed with 50 μl 0.1 m NaOH at room temperature with gentle shaking. 30 μl of the cell lysate was used to determine the level of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting and the remaining 20 μl was used for protein determination. Triplicate measures were made for each experiment (n = 3-8 experiments). Specific uptake of [3H]NE was defined as the difference between total uptake and that occurring in the presence of 100 μm desipramine or 100 μm nisoxetine. Assays measuring [3H]nisoxetine binding were performed 48 h after transfection on whole cells. Cells were trypsinized from standard plasticware and counted using a hemocytometer and diluted to give 50,000 cells per well. Cells were added to 96-well plates containing binding buffer (transport buffer at 0 °C) with appropriate compounds. Final assay volume was 50 μl. Nonspecific binding of [3H]nisoxetine by transfected cells was determined in the presence of 200 μm dopamine. Transfected cells were exposed to [3H]nisoxetine for 60 min at 0 °C. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by rapid vacuum filtration onto GF/B filters (Whatman, Boston, MA) pretreated with 0.6% polyethylenimine. Filters were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and dried. Filter-retained radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Triplicate measures were made for each experiment (n = 2-6 experiments). Homology Modeling—The FASTA format of the hNET and bLeuT sequences were retrieved and alignments made using the alignments of prokaryotic and eukaryotic Na+ dependent transporters developed by Beuming et al. (21Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), with additional manual adjustments specific for monoamine transporters (see Fig. 1B). The leucine transporter crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2A65) was loaded in the INSIGHT II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) environment and used as a template. Ten homology models of the NET based on our sequence alignment was built on a Silicon Graphics Octane R120000 work station using the MODELLER program (22Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar). N and C termini were not included in the model building process. The most energetically favorable model was chosen for analysis and to produce the figures. The water accessible path (Fig. 6) was calculated using the CAVER program (23Petrek M. Otyepka M. Banas P. Kosinova P. Koca J. Damborsky J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 316Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and rendered with PyMOL. Statistics and Data Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. (or 95% confidence interval range) of averaged results obtained from 2-8 separate experiments. Either analysis of variance with post hoc t-tests performed by the Tukey method or Student's t tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Curve fitting of saturation binding, transport kinetic and concentration-response data were performed by non-linear regression using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Construction of hNET Mutants—To further investigate the residues involved in MrIA inhibition of NE uptake, mutations of hNET were made by introducing DAT residues into regions of difference. All the mutated NETs (Fig. 1) were confirmed by sequence analysis before transient transfection into COS-1 cells. All NET mutations, except F207T, S225H, H296S, T381K, and D473A, produced uptake of [3H]NE that was not significantly different from uptake by wild-type NET and susceptible to inhibition by desipramine (DMI). Specific uptake for wild-type NET under these experimental conditions was 1.776 ± 0.35 pmol/mg of protein/min (n = 8). Inhibition of [3H]NE Uptake by MrIA and DMI at Single Point Mutants of hNET—Mutations of hNET that produced readily measurable [3H]NE uptake were assessed for susceptibility to MrIA and desipramine inhibition (Fig. 2). Concentration-response curves for NET mutants affecting IC50 of MrIA or DMI are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The pIC50 (-logIC50) values for MrIA and DMI at each mutation are shown in Fig. 2, C and D, respectively. These studies reveal that single residue changes at position 382 (E382A) significantly reduced (8.3-fold) the IC50 of MrIA for the NET compared with wild type (Fig. 2C) without affecting DMI inhibition. Conversely, a single change at position 469 (L469F) significantly increased (88-fold) the IC50 of MrIA for inhibition of the NET (Fig. 2C) without affecting DMI inhibition. The reverse mutation of DAT, F472L, conferred MrIA sensitivity which was significant at the mutant but not at the wild type DAT in dopamine uptake assays (mutant pIC50 = 3.70 ± 0.13; n = 3). In contrast, the pIC50 values for DMI inhibition of [3H]NE uptake were not affected by any of these single point mutations (Fig. 2D). In addition, 3.9-4.3-fold increases in IC50 approaching significance (p = 0.054 by t test) were observed for both MrIA and DMI at the L232P and L543P mutants (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting a potential overlap of MrIA and DMI binding sites on NET. Double Mutations and Chimera of hNET—Due to the marked effect of L469F on the pIC50 value for MrIA, the double mutants L232P + L469F and L469F + L543P of hNET were constructed to determine the extent of any interactions between these positions (Fig. 2). The double mutant L114S + L469F of hNET was also assessed (Fig. 2), since L114S increased MrIA and DMI IC50 values ∼3-fold (24Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40324-40329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All double mutations gave IC50 values for MrIA inhibition of [3H]NE uptake that were significantly increased compared with the hNET value (Fig. 2, A and C) but not significantly different to the single mutant value for L469F, indicating there was no additive effect. L114S + L469F also significantly increased (30-fold) the IC50 value of DMI for inhibition of [3H]NE uptake (Fig. 2D). The other double mutants L232P + L469F and L469F + L543P caused small increases (∼3-fold, which was not significant) in the IC50 value of DMI (Fig. 2D), similar to the increase seen previously for L114S alone (24Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40324-40329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The EL2 chimera did not significantly affect the ability of DMI (pIC50 9.13 ± 0.12) or MrIA (pIC50 6.8 ± 0.12) to inhibit NE uptake in this mutant. hNET Mutants with Poor Specific Uptake of [3H]NE—In our initial studies, the F207T, S225H, H296S, T381K, and D473A mutants of hNET failed to show significant [3H]NE uptake. Lack of apparent [3H]NE uptake could arise from (i) a marked reduction in cell surface expression of protein (for example as a result of protein misfolding), (ii) a marked reduction in the affinity of NE for the transporter, and/or (iii) effects on the translocation or gating mechanism of NET. To establish if NET expression was affected, we determined the Bmax and Kd for [3H]nisoxetine binding to these mutants (Fig. 3). Bmax (maximal binding) has been shown previously to provide a good measure of surface expression (25Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 733-743PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, F207T, T381K, S225H, and H296S produced maximal binding that was not significantly different to wild-type hNET, while D473A produced ∼20% wild-type binding (Fig. 3 and Table 1). F207T, T381K, S225H, and H296S also significantly increased (30-130-fold) the Kd for [3H]nisoxetine compared with hNET, while the D473A mutant produced a 9-fold increase in Kd (Table 1). Since specific [3H]nisoxetine binding was detectable for all mutants, we reassessed their ability to transport [3H]NE using higher NE substrate concentrations (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, all mutants displayed measurable uptake of [3H]NE (Fig. 4), with maximal uptake reduced 3-6-fold compared with hNET (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The Km of NE for these mutants was not significantly altered despite the Kd of [3H]nisoxetine being dramatically affected (Table 1, Fig. 4). Unfortunately, assays measuring specific [3H]NE uptake or specific [3H]nisoxetine binding had poor signal to noise and we were unable to measure the IC50 of MrIA at these mutants using these assays.TABLE 1[3H]NE transport and [3H]nisoxetine binding at hNET and selected mutants[3H]NE, KmNormalized [3H]NE, Vmax[3H]Nisoxetine KdNormalized [3H]nisoxetine, BmaxnmnmhNETaVmax for hNET = 1.776 ± 0.35 pmol/mg of protein/min; Bmax for hNET = 129.5 ± 14.5 pmol/mg of protein (n = 8 experiments)690 (320, 1490)b95% confidence interval values shown in parentheses (n = 3-8 experiments)1.05.1 (2.3, 11)b95% confidence interval values shown in parentheses (n = 3-8 experiments)1.0F207T720 (260, 1930)0.26 (0.1, 0.7)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET319 (81, 1260)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET0.60 (0.1, 2.6)S225H1870 (157, 6966)0.31 (0.1, 0.9)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET656 (194, 1120)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET1.1 (0.6, 1.5)H296S1190 (200, 7160)0.25 (0.1, 0.6)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET257 (62, 1070)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET0.66 (0.3, 1.4)T381K530 (190, 1480)0.17 (0.1, 0.3)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET650 (156, 2720)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET0.82 (0.3, 2.5)D473A1580 (400, 6280)0.26 (0.1, 0.5)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET47 (17, 130)cSignificantly different from wild-type hNET0.19 (0.1, 0.7)aVmax for hNET = 1.776 ± 0.35 pmol/mg of protein/min; Bmax for hNET = 129.5 ± 14.5 pmol/mg of protein (n = 8 experiments)a Vmax for hNET = 1.776 ± 0.35 pmol/mg of protein/min; Bmax for hNET = 129.5 ± 14.5 pmol/mg of protein (n = 8 experiments)b 95% confidence interval values shown in parentheses (n = 3-8 experiments)c Significantly different from wild-type hNET Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Saturation of [3H]NE uptake by mutants with poor [3H]NE uptake.

Each point is the mean ± 95% confidence interval determined from three to six experiments each performed in triplicate. The curves were obtained by nonlinear regression analyses according to a hyperbolic model. Specific uptake was calculated as the difference between uptake in the absence and presence of 100 μm nisoxetine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Homology Model of the hNET—A homology model of the hNET was constructed using bLeuT as a template (Fig. 5). The structure maintains 12 membrane spanning helices (TM) as previously predicted by hydrophobicity analysis (12Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). As defined by bLeuT, the majority of the helices are not perpendicular to the lipid bilayer but angled to form a pore with a wide external mouth and associated gating structure (including elements from EL2 and EL4). This architecture uses helices of widely varying lengths (Figs. 1A and 5) including several amphipathic helices (TM3, TM8, and TM10) exposed on the extracellular surface and potentially lying along the top of the lipid bilayer (extracellular loops EL3 and EL6) and helices potentially lining a water-filled translocation pathway (TM1 and TM6) (Fig. 5). Amino acid residues influencing the affinity of the transporter for MrIA (Fig. 5, A and B) and nisoxetine (Fig. 5, C and D) are highlighted. Using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce DAT residues into human NET (Fig. 1), we have identified new positions affecting χ-MrIA (L469F) and tricyclic antidepressant (F207T, T381K, S225H, and H296S) binding to NET. An additional eight NET mutants with negatively charged residues predicted to lie in extracellular loops replaced with alanine also identified a potential MrIA clash (E382A) and an additional contributor to tricyclic binding (D473A). To start to understand how these mutants affected inhibitor interactions with NET, we constructed a homology model of NET (Figs. 5 and 6) from the bLeuT structure, the closest related Na+-dependent transporter crystallised (20Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Examination of this model revealed that most of the interacting residues identified in this study clustered near the predicted entrance for NE transport (Fig. 5), providing experimental support for the bLeuT-derived model of NET. Of the 33 positions examined, E382A enhanced (8-fold) and L469F reduced (88-fold) the affinity of MrIA to inhibit NE uptake by hNET. Given the predicted position of Glu382 in the mouth of NET (Figs. 5A and 6), its charge and/or size might possibly hinder MrIA binding. In a previous alanine scan of MrIA, four residues (Tyr7, Lys8, Leu9, and His11) were identified as contributing directly to MrIA inhibition of NET transport (11Sharpe I.A. Palant E. Schroeder C.I. Kaye D.M. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40317-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Given the negative effect of Glu382 on MrIA binding and the lack of effect of replacing other negative charges in the extracellular loops, potential salt bridges between NET residues and the Lys8 or His11 of MrIA do not appear to contribute to affinity. Leu469 is situated at the mouth of NET in close proximity to Glu382 (Cα-Cα distance: ∼15 Å). However, in this instance replacing it with the corresponding DAT residue (Phe) markedly reduced the affinity of MrIA to inhibit NE uptake. Likewise, changing Phe472 of DAT to the NET residue leucine made the DAT sensitive to MrIA inhibition, confirming that this residue has an important influence on MrIA affinity. Since the L469A mutant had no effect on MrIA inhibition, it appears that smaller hydrophobic residues at this position support high affinity MrIA binding and that the hydrophobic and bulky Phe interferes with MrIA binding, presumably due to a steric clash. The small increases in IC50 of MrIA at the L232P and L543P mutants, which approached significance in these studies, may arise from structural perturbations associated with the introduction of Pro (26Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 27Sansom M.S. Weinstein H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). According to the homology model, these residues are in external loops on opposite sides of NET where they could influence the conformation of the mouth of NET. Double mutants of these residues together with L469F did not have any additional impact on MrIA affinity, indicating that any effect of these residues was relatively minor. In a previous study, residue L114A and L114S mutants reduced MrIA, antidepressant (desipramine) and cocaine affinity to similar extents (3-10-fold) (24Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40324-40329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present study, the L469F + L114S double mutant did not show any additive effects on MrIA IC50. In contrast to MrIA, none of the single point mutations of hNET described above affected desipramine IC50. However, the L469F + L114S double mutant caused a 32-fold increase in desipramine IC50, 5-fold greater than seen for the single L114S mutation alone (24Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40324-40329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After examination of the homology model, it is apparent that L114 is positioned intracellularly, where it is unlikely to have any direct interaction with either substrates or inhibitors. Hence it is most likely that the L114S mutation introduces a structural change or conformational shift in NET, as suspected from its similar effect on IC50 across a range of unrelated inhibitors (24Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40324-40329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Apparently, this mutation exposes an otherwise silent effect of L469F, to further increase the IC50 for desipramine. The chimera of extracellular loop 2 of DAT and NET had no effect on DMI or MrIA inhibition of NE uptake and is unlikely to be involved in the binding of either inhibitor. Of the hNET mutants constructed, F207T, S225H, H296S, and T381K showed poor NE uptake despite normal nisoxetine Bmax values, indicating that the rate of NE transport was diminished while surface expression remained unchanged (NET turnover (Vmax(NE)/Bmax(nisoxetine)) was reduced 2.3-5-fold). The other poor transporter D473A had a 5-fold reduced Bmax, indicating expression levels for this mutant were reduced (24Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40324-40329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), accounting for the reduced NE transport observed. While these mutants had no effect on Km value of NE, they had a dramatic effect on nisoxetine Kd. Mutations affecting transport rate (F207T, T381K, S225H, and H296S) caused a 30-130-fold reduction in [3H]nisoxetine affinity, while the D473A mutant caused a smaller (9-fold) reduction. Examining the homology model revealed that all residues affecting NE transport and nisoxetine affinity were located at the ends of extracellular helices that either lined (Thr381 and Asp473) or were just outside (Phe207, Ser225, and His296) the mouth of the transporter. While residues lining the mouth of NET could directly influence both affinity and transport, mutations outside the mouth might be expected to indirectly reduce affinity and transport by disrupting the structure and/or gating of NET. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess the IC50 of MrIA at these mutants. Earlier studies identified two mutations that caused 6-fold shifts in the IC50 of DMI to inhibit NE uptake (28Roubert C. Cox P.J. Bruss M. Hamon M. Bonisch H. Giros B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8254-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Phe316, which appears near the center of the transporter, and Leu114, which is located intracellularly (Fig. 5).

Nature. 2000; 403: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), glutamate (16Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and Lac permease (32Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) transporters. While these models incorporated mutagenesis and biochemical data, the templates had low homology (∼12%) and limited functional similarity. In contrast, hNET and bLeuT have 28% sequence homology and both are Na+-dependent transporters and thus expected to share secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. A similar level of homology between the functionally related nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein allows the production of predictive homology models of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (33Dutertre S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The new model of NET shows a tapered water-filled cavity that restricts intracellular access and several external helical loops positioned around the mouth of the pore that could influence ligand binding (Fig. 6). The deepest portion of this cavity allows the binding of NE at the same location as the leucine seen in bLeuT. Consistent with results of our previous studies (11Sharpe I.A. Palant E. Schroeder C.I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40317-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the model allows partially overlapping MrIA/tricyclic binding and tricyclic/NE binding but discrete MrIA/NE binding. It is also consistent with previous NET mutant data (6Paczkowski F.A. Bryan-Lluka L.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Roubert C. Cox P.J.

Earlier studies indicate that CARMA1, a Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD) and Membrane-associated GUanylate Kinase domain (MAGUK)-containing scaffold protein, plays an essential role in NF-κB activation induced by the costimulation of T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 molecules. However, the molecular mechanism by which CARMA1 mediates TCR-CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation is not fully understood. Here we show that CARMA1 is constitutively oligomerized. This oligomerization of CARMA1 is through its Coiled-coil domain. Disruption of the predicted structure of the Coiled-coil domain of CARMA1 impaired its oligomerization and, importantly, abrogated CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation. Interestingly, disruption of the CC1 domain abrogates CARMA1 localization, whereas disruption of the CC2 domain seems to inhibit CARMA1 self-association. Together, our results demonstrate that the oligomerization of CARMA1 is required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation.

T cell activation and proliferation is induced by major histo-compatibility complex molecules of antigen-presenting cells presenting antigen peptides to T cell receptors (TCR) 2The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; Bcl10, B cell lymphoma 10; Malt1, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein-1; CC, Coiled-coil; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 2The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; Bcl10, B cell lymphoma 10; Malt1, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein-1; CC, Coiled-coil; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. on the surface of T cells and a second costimulatory signal generated through interaction of B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells and CD28 receptors on T cells. This combined stimulation of TCR/CD3 and CD28 molecules (known as CD3-CD28 costimulation) induces a series of signal transduction pathways leading to activation of cytosolic tyrosine kinases, various adaptor proteins, small GTPases, serine/threonine kinases, and phospholipase. These signaling pathways activate several transcription factors, including NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-AT, which ultimately control the production of various cytokines, leading to T cell activation and proliferation. NF-κB is one of the key transcriptional factors activated by TCR engagement. TCR-induced NF-κB activation plays important roles for the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of T cells (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). Stimulation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells induces the formation of a large multicomponent complex at the contact area between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell, termed the supramolecular activation complex (SMAC) or immunological synapse (IS) (2Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The SMAC/IS of a T cell is highly enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, also termed lipid rafts. Some signaling molecules are constitutively associated with lipid rafts, whereas others are recruited into lipid rafts following CD3-CD28 costimulation (3Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G.

Although it is not fully understood how signaling pathways induced by CD3-CD28 costimulation lead to the activation of NF-κB, recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated that CARMA1, a scaffold molecule, plays an essential role for CD3-CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation (4Lin X.

CARMA1 is a scaffold molecule containing an N-terminal CAspase Recruitment Domain (CARD), a Coiled-coil (C-C) domain, a PDZ domain, a Src homology 3 domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain and is a member of the Membrane-associated GUK (MAGUK) family of proteins (7Bertin J.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with the roles of MAGUK family proteins, CARMA1 is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and is recruited into the immunological synapse following CD3-CD28 costimulation (5Gaide O.

Biochemical and gene-targeting studies have confirmed that CARMA1 is required for TCR-induced IκB kinase (IKK) activation and functions downstream of protein kinase C θ (6Wang D. You Y. Case S.M.

More recent studies suggest that protein kinase C θ and protein kinase B β phosphorylate CARMA1 in T and B cells, respectively (11Matsumoto R. Wang D. Blonska M. Li H. Kobayashi M. Pappu B. Chen Y.

This phosphorylation likely induces conformational changes in CARMA1, which recruits downstream signaling components Bcl10 (B Cell Lymphoma-10) and MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein-1, also known as human paracaspase) to the immunological synapse (9Egawa T.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that oligomerization of Bcl10 regulates MALT1 and TRAF6, two potential ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase ubiquitination ligases (E3), leading to NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) ubiquitination (19Zhou H. Wertz I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M. Seshagiri S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 20Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). However, how CARMA1 induces Bcl10 oligomerization remains to be determined. Although it has also been proposed that the stimulation of antigen receptors induces oligomerization of CARMA1 (21Rawlings D.J. Sommer K. Moreno-Garcia M.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Schulze-Luehrmann J. Ghosh S. Immunity. 2006; 25: 701-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence showing that the oligomerization of CARMA1 is functionally important. In this study, we demonstrated that CARMA1 could indeed form oligomers and, importantly, that this oligomerization was required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation and disruption of this oligomerization completely inhibited CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation. Furthermore, domain mapping of the CC domain shows different regions contribute to membrane localization and oligomerization. Thus, our studies provide biochemical evidence that oligomerization and localization of CARMA1 play an essential role in TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were performed in yeast strain AH109 transfected by the standard lithium acetate method (Clontech). A human lymph node cDNA library was used (Clontech). Screening plasmids were generated by inserting the CARD+CC domains of CARMA1 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). Screening was performed at high stringency as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Positive clones were screened for β-galactosidase activity and sequenced. Further confirmatory yeast two-hybrid experiments used high stringency plate agar. Plasmids and Antibodies—Plasmids encoding Myc- and FLAG epitope-tagged CARMA1 were described previously (14Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X. Gaffen S. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). CARMA1 point mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing analysis. These mutants were inserted into pCMVTag2B (FLAG), pRK6 (Myc or HA), or lentiviral vector pRV (Myc or HA) plasmids. Mouse full-length WT and L298Q CARMA1 expression plasmids were kindly provided by C. C. Goodnow (23Jun J. Wilson L. Vinuesa C. Lesage S. Blery M. Miosge L. Cook M. Kucharska E. Hara H. Penninger J.

Antibodies for c-Myc, HA, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies for p-JNK, JNK, Bcl10, p-ERK, ERK, and MALT1 were from Cell Signaling, Inc.; antibodies for FLAG (M2) were from Sigma Co.; and antibodies for CARMA1 were from Axxora Life Science Inc. Cell Culture and Stimulation—Jurkat E6.1, JPM50.6 (6Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and Raji cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Costimulation of Jurkat cells (1 × 107) was performed in a final volume of 1 ml by addition of anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (3 μg/ml) antibodies, with goat anti-mouse (3 μg/ml) (Signal Transduction Laboratories). Additional stimulations include phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10 ng/ml), ionomycin (100 ng/ml), and 20 ng of TNFα. Luciferase Reporter Assay—JPM50.6 cells (1 × 107 in 0.4 ml of RPMI1640 medium) were electroporated with 5 μg of NF-κB-dependent luciferase (firefly) reporter plasmid and 100 ng of EF1α promoter-dependent Renilla luciferase plasmid together with 10 μg of expression vectors of CARMA1 and its CC mutants or vector controls. After a 16-h incubation, the cells were stimulated with or without anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (3 μg/ml) antibodies or PMA (10 ng/ml) plus anti-CD28 (3 μg/ml) antibodies for 6 h. Luciferase activities in the cell lysates were determined by utilizing the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). For HEK293T cell luciferase assays, 6-well plates were seeded with 2 × 106 cells and transfected with 100 ng of NF-κB-dependent luciferase (firefly) reporter plasmid and 1 ng of EF1α promoter-dependent Renilla luciferase plasmid together with 2 μg of expression vectors of CARMA1 or CARMA1-CCM. Stable Cell Lines—Jurkat or JPM50.6 cells were transfected at 250 V (950 μF) with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. Stable cell lines were selected with either neomycin (1500 ng/ml) or hygromycin (250 ng/ml) medium by limited dilution. Clonal populations were assayed for gene expression to verify the presence of an integrated plasmid. Lentiviral transduction was also used to create some stable cell lines with vectors containing different CARMA1 mutants. First, HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected with 5 μg each of pEnv/pHep for virus packaging of 10 μg of Myc-tagged or HA-tagged WT CC1M, CC2M, or CCM CARMA1 by calcium phosphate precipitation. After 16 h, viral supernatant was removed and replaced with complete RPMI1640 medium. After an additional 24 h, virus-containing medium was collected and plated with 1-3 × 106 Jurkat or JPM50.6 cells. Cells were expanded and expression was verified by Western blot with appropriate antibodies. EMSA Analysis—Nuclear extracts were prepared from different cells after various stimulations. Cells (1 × 107) were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). Cytoplasmic fractions were isolated for biochemical analysis. Nuclear pellets were washed in 500 μl of lysis buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of EMSA extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). After vortexing for 15 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged, and the nuclear proteins in the supernatant were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin standards. EMSA analysis was performed with 10 μg of nuclear extract and 32P-labeled NF-κB or Oct-1 probes (Promega). Cell Conjugation Assay—Jurkat T cells expressing GFP-CARMA1 WT, CC1M, CC2M, or CCM were stained with ALEXA594-conjugated cholera toxin B (8 μg/ml (Sigma)) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed and resuspended in serum-free RPMI1640 at 106 cells/ml. Raji B cells were incubated with or without 2 μg of Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE) (Toxin Technology, Inc., Sarasota, FL) per ml at 37 °C for 90 min. Raji cells were then washed, mixed with an equal volume of GFP-CARMA1-expressing Jurkat cells, pelleted, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and attached to poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides by Cytospin® centrifugation. Fluorescence was detected on an Olympus Fluoview FV300 confocal laser scanning biological microscope. Co-immunoprecipitation—Various FLAG/Myc-tagged constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. After 16-h of incubation, proteins were immunoprecipitated with various indicated antibodies and Protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer. The eluted samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. CARMA1 Oligomerization—To determine the molecular mechanism by which the function of CARMA1 is regulated, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N terminus of CARMA1 (CARD and CC domains) as the bait against a human lymph node cDNA library. Several positive clones were isolated and sequenced. One of the positive clones encoded an N-terminal truncated CARMA1 (131-residue truncation) in which the N-terminal CARD domain was removed, leaving a portion of the CC domain as well as the entire MAGUK domain. This screening result suggests that CARMA1 can self-associate. To test this possibility, several constructs were introduced into the yeast two-hybrid system and assayed for positive interaction (Table 1). We found that the CARD-CC fragment was able to self-associate. This fragment was able to associate with the CARMA1 CC domain, but not with the CARD domain. Furthermore, when two CC domains were used, positive interaction occurred (Table 1). Together, these results indicate that CARMA1 can form a dimer through its CC domain.TABLE 1Yeast two-hybrid CARMA1 interactionsBDADGrowthCD + CCΔCD CARMA1+CD + CCCARMA1+CARMA1CARMA1+ΔCD CARMA1ΔCD CARMA1+CD + CCCD−CD + CCCC+CCCC+CD + CCCARMA1 L298Q+ Open table in a new tab Mouse and human CC domains could associate with each other (data not shown), indicating that the dimerization is a common feature of both mouse and human CARMA1. Although the formation of a homotrimer has been found in other CC domain-containing proteins, the Y2H assay cannot investigate this possibility. In addition, a known functional CC mutation, L298Q, was still capable of dimerization, indicating that the L298Q mutation disrupts another aspect of CARMA1 signaling (23Jun J. Wilson L. Vinuesa C. Lesage S. Blery M. Miosge L. Cook M. Kucharska E. Hara H. Penninger J. Domashenz H. Hong N. Glynne R. Nelms K. Goodnow C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that CARMA1 can form a dimer or oligomer through its coiled-coil domain and that the CARMA1 CC alone is both necessary and sufficient for this oligomerization. To further investigate whether CARMA1 forms dimers/oligomers in mammalian cells, an immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. Expression vectors encoding Myc- and FLAG-tagged CARMA1 proteins were transfected into HEK293 cells. After transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. Consistent with the above results, we found that Myc-CARMA1 was able to associate with FLAG-CARMA1, whereas Myc-TRAF2, which also contains a CC domain, was unable to associate with FLAG-CARMA1 (Fig. 1A). Additionally, to determine whether oligomerization is a common structural feature among CARMA family members, CARMA3, a homologue of CARMA1 with different tissue distribution, was assayed for its ability to form oligomers (24McAllister-Lucas L. Inohara N. Lucas P. Ruland J. Benito A. Li Q. Chen S. Chen F. Yamaoka S. Verma I. Mak T. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30589-30597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We found that CARMA3 could self-oligomerize as well as associate with CARMA1 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that CARMA1 and CARMA3 act in a similar fashion in signal transduction pathways. Earlier studies indicate that CARMA3 can functionally reconstitute CARMA1-deficient cells (11Matsumoto R. Wang D. Blonska M. Li H. Kobayashi M. Pappu B. Chen Y. Wang D. Lin X. Immunity. 2005; 23: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that the CARMA1 protein is assembled into a dimeric (or possibly oligomeric) form. To determine the oligomerization status of CARMA1 in resting T cells and whether this status changes after cell stimulation, JPM50.6WT (reconstituted with Myc-CARMA1) cells were transduced with or without a lentivirus encoding an HA-tagged CARMA1 and stimulated with or without CD3-CD28 for 0, 10, or 20 min. Cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and Western blotting for Myc and HA epitope-tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 1C, the status of CARMA1 oligomerization does not change after stimulation. This indicates that stimulation does not alter CARMA1 oligomerization status and CARMA1 is self-associated regardless of its activation state. Stimulation was confirmed by phospho-ERK immunoblot (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Generation of a Coiled-coil Mutant—To determine the functional significance of CARMA1 oligomerization, the structure of the CARMA1 CC domain was analyzed. Using MultiCoil and COILs programs (25Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), we predicted that CARMA1 residues Leu-149, Leu-152, Leu-225, Leu-229, Ile-421, and Leu-424 might contribute to the interactions between their CC domains (Fig. 2A). The graphs indicate regions of potential Coiled-coil formation at critical residues that can bind two Coiled-coil domains together (Fig. 2B). There are three peaks of predicted coil formation. CARMA1 mutants with pair mutations including LL149/152TT (CC1M) and IL421/424TT (CC2M) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Additionally, a CARMA1 mutant, CCM, was constructed with the mutation LLIL149/152/421/424TTTT (Fig. 2A). Shown in Fig. 2B are graphs from Multicoil that show regions of predicted Coiled-coil formation (left panel) (25Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). After threonine mutagenesis, predictions of Coiled-coil dimer formation were significantly reduced (Fig. 2B, right panel) (25Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Investigation of Coiled-coil Mutant Oligomerization—To determine whether mutation of these residues disrupts the oligomerization of CARMA1, HA-tagged CARMA1-WT and Myc-tagged WT, CC1M, CC2M, or CCM version of CARMA1 were introduced into JPM50.6 cells (CARMA1-deficient Jurkat T cells). Therefore, the resultant cells expressed HA-tagged wild type CARMA1 as well as Myc-tagged WT or mutants of CARMA1. We found that CARMA1-WT was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with CARMA1-WT and CARMA1-CC1M, but to a significantly lesser extent with CARMA1-CC2M, and not with CARMA1-CCM (Fig. 3). These results indicate that CARMA1 is oligomerized in lymphocytes and that mutation in the CARMA1 CC domain can abrogate its oligomerization. Furthermore, the CC2 region of CARMA1 appears to be more involved in CARMA1 oligomerization than the CC1 region, although both regions appear to contribute to CARMA1-CARMA1 interaction. Determination of the Functional Relevance of Impaired CARMA1 Oligomerization—To determine whether mutations in the CC domain altered CARMA1 function, we reconstituted JPM50.6 cells by lentiviral transductions in which either CARMA1-WT, -CC1M, -CC2M, or -CCM were expressed. These cell lines were analyzed by EMSA for their ability to rescue the TCR-induced NF-κB defect. Although wild type CARMA1 could effectively rescue the NF-κB defect in CARMA1-deficient cells, we found that each CC mutation could not rescue CD3-CD28 costimulation- or PMA/ionomycin-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4A). Comparable levels of CARMA1-WT and its mutants were found in these reconstituted cells (Fig. 4B). The Oct-1 levels show equivalent loading of nuclear extracts. Consistent with previous results (6Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), CARMA1 deficiency had no effect on TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4A). In addition, we examined ERK activation induced by these stimulations and found that ERK was effectively activated by PMA/ionomycin stimulation in all cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the CCM mutations inadvertently disrupted signaling downstream of CARMA1, wild type and CCM mutant of CARMA1 were evaluated for their ability to activate the NF-κB pathway downstream of CARMA1. To determine whether the CCM mutant is defective in activation of downstream signaling components, we transfected expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged wild type or CCM version of CARMA1 with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter into HEK293T cells. We found that overexpressed CARMA1-WT and CARMA1-CCM both could activate the NF-κB luciferase reporter equally (Fig. 5A). This result indicates that the pathway downstream of CARMA1 is not affected by a lack of CARMA1 self-association. Therefore, the CCM mutations do not significantly disrupt downstream signaling cascades leading to NF-κB activation. To determine whether CARMA1-CCM can associate with Bcl10 and MALT1 directly, stable cells expressing either CARMA1-WT or CARMA1-CCM were stimulated with or without PMA/ionomycin. CARMA1 (Myc) proteins were precipitated from stimulated and unstimulated samples, and the presence of Bcl10 and MALT1 was detected in stimulated but not unstimulated samples (Fig. 5B). Together, these data indicate that mutations in the CC domain do not affect the ability of CARMA1 to associate with downstream signaling components. The CCM mutations disrupt the oligomerization of CARMA1, resulting in a signaling defect at the level of CARMA1, which cannot functionally incorporate into the TCR signaling pathway because of a defective Coiled-coil domain. The CC1 Mutation Impairs CARMA1 Subcellular Localization—To determine whether mutation of the CC domain of CARMA1 affects the subcellular localization of CARMA1, we compared the localization of WT, CC1M, CC2M, and CCM of CARMA1. Jurkat T cells stably expressing GFP-tagged CARMA1 WT and mutants were generated. These cells (Jurkat-WT, Jurkat-CC1M, Jurkat-CC2M, and Jurkat-CCM) were used in a cell conjugation assay to determine the effect of CC domain mutation on proper localization to the immunological synapse upon antigen presentation. Jurkat-CARMA1 cells were labeled with ALEXA594-conjugated cholera toxin B, which associates with and labels lipid rafts. These cells were then mixed with Raji B cells primed with or without Staphylococcus enterotoxin E. Cell conjugates were examined under confocal microscopy for the colocalization of GFP-CARMA1 and lipid rafts stained by cholera toxin B. In unstimulated cells, CARMA1 was localized throughout cells (Fig. 6). Following stimulation, we found that CARMA1 WT and CC2M were localized at the Jurkat/Raji cell interface upon Staphylococcus enterotoxin E stimulation, whereas stimulation did not redistribute CARMA1-CC1M or CARMA1-CCM to the lipid raft domain (Fig. 6, A-D). These results indicate that mutations in the CC1 domain of CARMA1 alter its subcellular localization, suggesting that the CC1 region is involved in the localization of CARMA1, because the mutant CC1M shows improper localization whereas CARMA1-CC2M shows proper localization. Dominant Negative Function of the Coiled-coil Mutant—Because the mutations in the CC1 and CC2 regions (Fig. 2) significantly blocked PMA/ionomycin-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4), it is possible that these regions could function as a dominant negative mutant in TCR signaling. A stable Jurkat cell line that expressed CARMA1-CCM was used to perform an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 7A, CARMA1-CCM expression in Jurkat-CCM cells blocked PMA/ionomycin activation of NF-κB, in contrast to normal Jurkat cells. In an effort to determine the minimal region of interaction between CARMA1 oligomers, Jurkat cells were transfected with either CARMA1-CC1 or CARMA1-CC2 expression plasmids together with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter, and a luciferase assay was performed with stimulation. We found that expression of these small fragments of CARMA1 effectively inhibited PMA/ionomycin-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 7B). The CC1 region inhibited NF-κB activation by ∼40%, and the CC2 region inhibited NF-κB activation by ∼90%. Protein-protein interactions enable the flow of signaling information between proteins. A complex array of interactions is necessary for the transduction of appropriate TCR signaling to activate target gene expression for the initiation of an immune response. Earlier studies have demonstrated that CARMA1 plays an essential role in TCR-induced NF-κB activation. In this study, we demonstrate that CARMA1 exists as a dimer/oligomer in T cells. The oligomerization of CARMA1 is mainly through its Coiled-coil domain. Importantly, our results indicate that CC domain mutants significantly impair the function of CARMA1. Oligomerization does not depend on cell stimulation, suggesting that TCR signaling may alter the association of CARMA1 with other proteins but not affect CARMA1 oligomerization. Therefore, our studies provide biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrating that the oligomerization of CARMA1 is required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation. It has been shown CARMA1 recruits signaling components such as Bcl10, MALT1, and IKK (inhibitor of κB kinase) complex into the immunological synapse (13Che T. You Y. Wang D. Tanner M.J. Dixit V.M.

Med. 2004; 200: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, proper subcellular localization of CARMA1 is required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Interestingly, although CARMA1-CCM is able to associate with Bcl10 and MALT1 after activation, these downstream components were not activated. It seems distinct events regulate the formation and the signal transduction through the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex. Our earlier studies suggest that the C-terminal MAGUK domain of CARMA1 contributes to the subcellular localization of CARMA1 (11Matsumoto R. Wang D. Blonska M. Li H. Kobayashi M. Pappu B. Chen Y. Wang D. Lin X. Immunity. 2005; 23: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X. Gaffen S. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that mutation of the CC1 domain of CARMA1 also impaired its subcellular localization, suggesting that the CC domain of CARMA1 may also contribute to its subcellular localization. Although our results suggest that both the CC1 and CC2 regions are required for dimerization, it appears that only the CC1 region contributes to the localization of CARMA1. The CC1M mutation probably disrupts a key interaction between CARMA1 and an unknown component that links CARMA1 to the immunological synapse. Although Leu-298 is located at the end of the CC1 region, it is possible that the defect of the L298Q mutation in CARMA1, obtained in earlier genetic screening (23Jun J. Wilson L. Vinuesa C. Lesage S. Blery M. Miosge L. Cook M. Kucharska E. Hara H. Penninger J. Domashenz H. Hong N. Glynne R. Nelms K. Goodnow C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), may also be due to the defect of the subcellular localization of CARMA1. Because the CC2 fragment had a significant inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation, it is likely that this small fragment may disrupt the dimerization of endogenous CARMA1 and inhibit TCR-induced NF-κB activation. The fragment most likely acts as a competitive inhibitor by preventing two full-length CARMA1 proteins from associating, which abrogates their function. Therefore, this oligomerization may be a therapeutic target for antigen receptor-induced NF-κB activation. A small peptide covering the CARMA1 CC2 region could serve as an inhibitor for modulating lymphocyte activation. We thank Prashant Shambharkar for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1995723419,"The ATP-dependent protease FtsH (HflB) complexed with HflKC participates in post-translational control of the lysis-lysogeny decision of bacteriophage lambda by rapid degradation of lambda CII. Both phage-encoded proteins, the CII transcription activator and the CIII polypeptide, are required for efficient lysogenic response. The conserved CIII is both an inhibitor and substrate of FtsH. Here we show that the protease inhibitor CIII is present as oligomeric amphipathic α helical structures and functions as a competitive inhibitor of FtsH by preventing binding of the CII substrate. We identified single alanine substitutions in CIII that abolish its activity. We characterize a dominant negative effect of a CIII mutant. Thus, we suggest that CIII oligomrization is required for its function. Real-time analysis of CII activity demonstrates that the effect of CIII is not seen in the absence of either FtsH or HflKC. When CIII is provided ectopically, CII activity increases linearly as a function of the multiplicity of infection, suggesting that CIII enhances CII stability and the lysogenic response. FtsH function is essential for cellular viability as it regulates the balance in the synthesis of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides. Genetic experiments confirmed that the CIII bacteriostatic effects are due to inhibition of FtsH. Thus, the early presence of CIII following infection stimulates the lysogenic response, while its degradation at later times ensures the reactivation of FtsH allowing the growth of the established lysogenic cell."
https://openalex.org/W2169937394,"Methylated DNA binding domain (MBD) proteins and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain epigenetic silencing of transcriptional activity. We report that the DNA methylation-mediated repressor MBD1 interacts with Ring1b and hPc2, the major components of Polycomb repressive complex 1. The cysteine-rich CXXC domains of MBD1 bound to Ring1b and the chromodomain of hPc2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MBD1 and hPc2 were present in silenced Homeobox A (HOXA) genes which could be reactivated by knockdown of either MBD1 or hPc2, suggesting that MBD1 and hPc2 cooperate for transcriptional repression of HOXA genes. In the nuclei of HeLa cells, MBD1 existed in close association with these PcG proteins in some heterochromatin foci, whereas an MBD1 mutant lacking the CXXC domains or an hPc2 mutant lacking the chromodomain lost this colocalization in foci. Use of the DNA demethylating agent 5-azadeoxycytidine abolished the formation of MBD1 foci but not PcG foci. Knockdown of MBD1 by small interfering RNAs did not affect the foci containing hPc2 and Ring1b, whereas the MBD1 foci were not influenced by knockdown of hPc2. These indicate that the heterochromatin foci showing MBD1 and hPc2 colocalization arise through the interaction of MBD1 and hPc2 and that the foci of MBD1 are separable from those of the PcG proteins per se. Our present findings suggest that MBD1 and PcG proteins have overlapping roles in epigenetic gene silencing and heterochromatin foci formation through their interactions.

Our present findings suggest that MBD1 and PcG proteins have overlapping roles in epigenetic gene silencing and heterochromatin foci formation through their interactions. Patterns of gene expression are stably inherited during somatic cell division through maintenance of the epigenetic state of the mammalian genome (1.Damelin M. Ooi S.K. Bestor T.H. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cytosine methylation in 5′-CpG-3′ dinucleotides is well correlated with gene repression and the formation of transcriptionally inactive chromatin (8.Fuks F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) methylate genomic DNAs followed by binding of MBD family proteins (9.Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol.

To date, five members of the MBD family have been identified in mammals by the presence of highly conserved MBD sequences (3.Wade P.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 4.Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar, 5.Klose R.J. Bird A.P. Trends Biochem.

Among these, MBD1 is known to act as a transcriptional repressor through cooperation of the MBD, cysteine-rich CXXC domains (CXXC1, CXXC2, and CXXC3), and a transcriptional repression domain (TRD) (11.Fujita N.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) and is also associated with a histone methyltransferase, Suv39h1, which methylates lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) and heterochromatin protein 1 (15.Fujita N.

Furthermore, the TRD of MBD1 produces a strong repressive activity by recruiting MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1)/ATFa-associated modulator (AM) (16.Fujita N. Watanabe S.

MCAF1/AM complexes with another histone methyltransferase, SETDB1, and is required for trimethylation of H3K9 by this enzyme (18.Wang H. An W. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Chatton B. Tempst P. Roeder R.G. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, there are at least five isoforms of MBD1 that are alternatively spliced in the region containing the three CXXC sequences (11.Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The CXXC domain was originally found in DNMT1 and the Trithorax group protein ALL-1 (also known as MLL) (11.Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although the CXXC3 domain of MBD1 was shown to bind DNA (13.Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the significance of the CXXC domains in MBD1 remains to be determined. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins were initially identified as regulators of the homeobox (hox) genes during development in Drosophila melanogaster (20.Ringrose L. Paro R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). These proteins are evolutionarily conserved in mammals and are expected to maintain the heritable repressive state of the HOX genes and various growth-controlling genes (21.Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. Bell G.W. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R.

Young R.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Similarly to the DNA methylation system, PcG proteins are involved in a variety of phenomena, such as X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and control of cell proliferation and differentiation (23.Orlando V. Cell. 2003; 112: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24.Otte A.P. Kwaks T.H. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Biochemical and genetic studies have indicated that PcG proteins can be classified into at least two Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) named PRC1 and PRC2 (25.Cao R. Zhang Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 26.Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 27.Levine S.S. King I.F. Kingston R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At the initiation of gene silencing, PRC2, which contains EED, EZH2, YY1, and SU(Z)12, is recruited to methylate lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) via the histone methyltransferase EZH2 present in the complex. At the maintenance stage, PRC1, which contains Ring1b, hPc2, and BMI1, binds the trimethylated H3K27 through recognition by hPc2 (28.Min J. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 29.Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The sequential actions of these PRCs result in stable maintenance of gene silencing. It is of interest that EZH2 and BMI1 are overexpressed in certain cancers and have been implicated in the process of tumorigenesis (30.Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), suggesting that PcG proteins are crucial for cell regulation. Despite the biological importance of MBD proteins and PcG proteins, the functional relationship of these repressive proteins has remained unknown. A recent study showed that EZH2 in PRC2 directly interacts with DNMTs and maintains CpG methylation at EZH2-targeted promoters (31.Vire E. Brenner C. Deplus R. Blanchon L. Fraga M. Didelot C. Morey L. Van Eynde A. Bernard D. Vanderwinden J.M. Bollen M. Esteller M. Di Croce L. de Launoit Y. Fuks F. Nature. 2006; 439: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), suggesting that EZH2 directly controls DNA methylation of EZH2 target genes. Mice embryos deficient for Eed changed the DNA methylation status of specific CpGs in differentially methylated regions at imprinted loci (32.Mager J. Montgomery N.D. de Villena F.P. Magnuson T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As well, the association of BMI1 with PcG bodies, sites of the PcG complex accumulation mostly located in heterochromatin regions, requires DNMT1 as well as EZH2 and EED (33.Hernandez-Munoz I. Taghavi P. Kuijl C. Neefjes J. van Lohuizen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11047-11058Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests that DNMT1 is involved in the formation of silent chromatin by PcG proteins. Collectively, these observations suggest that the two epigenetic silencing pathways are mechanistically linked. During an investigation of the roles of the CXXC domains of MBD1, we found that MBD1 interacts with Ring1b and hPc2, which are key molecules in PRC1. Here, we present evidence demonstrating the importance of the overlapping roles of MBD1 and PcG proteins in transcriptional repression of HOXA genes and heterochromatin foci formation. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening−Yeast strain AH109 carrying pAS2-1-CXXC domain of MBD1 (amino acids 150-268 in isoform v1) was transformed with the mouse E17 whole embryo cDNA libraries constructed in pACT2 (Clontech). Plasmids harboring cDNA were recovered from both histidine- and adenine-positive colonies and were used for DNA sequencing analysis. Plasmids−The cDNA for hPc2 and Ring1b were cloned into pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-FLAG-hPc2 and pcDNA3-DsRed-monomer-Ring1b). The chromodomain of hPc2 (amino acids 3-71) was subcloned into pCMV-GAL4. pSilencer3.1puro vector (Ambion) was used to express small hairpin RNAs. Target sequences are indicated in supplemental Table 1. The pCGN-MBD1, pEGFP-MBD1, and pCMV-GAL4-CXXC of MBD1 were previously described (13.Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cell Culture−HeLa cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimum essential medium and Ham’s F-12 nutrient medium (Sigma) supplied with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transfection and Cell Treatment−HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs by using a liposome-mediated gene transfer method. For the luciferase assay, HeLa cells (1.0 × 105 cells) were transfected with siRNA expression vector (2.0 μg) with FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science) in a 6-well plate, and after 24 h the cells were diluted to 1:2 and transferred to a 12-well plate under selection with puromycin (1.0 μg/ml). In addition, HeLa cells were treated with 5 μm 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. After 3 days, the treated cells were used for immunofluorescent assay and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Protein Expression−The cDNAs for Ring1b, hPc2, and the deletion mutants of hPc2 were cloned into pET28a (Novagen). The expression of these proteins, GST-fused MBD1v1 and GST-fused portions of MBD1, were performed as described previously (17.Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13928-13935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Antibodies−The polyclonal antibodies against hPc2 were generated by immunizing a rabbit against His-tagged hPc2 (amino acids 59-466). For affinity purification of the antibodies, His-tagged hPc2 (amino acids 59-466) was coupled to HiTrap Protein G HP (GE Healthcare). Rabbit anti-MBD1 polyclonal antibodies were previously described (13.Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-Ring1b monoclonal antibodies were provided from Dr. H. Koseki. Other antibodies utilized were anti-MBD1 (Santa Cruz), anti-trimethylated H3K9, anti-trimethylated H3K27 (Upstate), anti-FLAG (M5) (Sigma), anti-His tag (Qiagen), anti-GST (DAKO), anti-lamin A/C (Santa Cruz), anti-GAL4 (Santa Cruz), and anti-β-tubulin (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation−HeLa cells were treated with dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl (5 mm) (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed with an ice-cold buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl), and lysed with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation (1500 rpm) at 4 °C for 10 min, mixed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors, and then incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (1500 rpm), the nuclei extracts were lysed using sonication with a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with specific antibodies or control IgG and then incubated for 1 h after the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After the washings, the bound proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. In Vitro Binding and GST Pulldown Assay−Bacterially expressed GST and GST fusion proteins (1 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with His-tagged PcG proteins (1 μg) in a buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. The input indicates 10% of the His-tagged proteins. Immunofluorescent Analysis−After being washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), HeLa cells were similarly fixed 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, we incubated them with specific antibodies in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were analyzed with an Olympus IX71 microscope using LuminaVision software. Luciferase Assay−At 48 h after transfection with a luciferase reporter plasmid and together with pCMV-GAL4 (CXXC domains of MBD1 or chromodomain of hPc2) and pcDNA3-FLAG-hPc2, HeLa cells were lysed in a buffer provided by the manufacturer (Promega). pRL-SV40, insertless pcDNA3, and pCMV-GAL4 were used as controls. Values are the means and S.D. of results from three independent experiments. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation−HeLa cells (1 × 106) were treated with dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl (5 mm), rinsed, and then cross-linked by the addition of 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Crude cell lysates were sonicated to generate 200-1000 bp of DNA fragments. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-MBD1, anti-hPc2 antibodies, or control IgG according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). PCR amplification of human HOXA gene promoters was carried out for 35 cycles under the conditions of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C using specific set of primers described in supplemental Table 2. DNAs in input lysates were used as a positive control (input control). siRNA Knockdown of MBD1 and hPc2−Twenty-one-nucleotide siRNA duplexes were designed to target mRNAs encoding human MBD1 and hPc2. The selected siRNA target sequences were submitted to human genome and EST databases to ensure the target specificities. These sequences were described in supplemental Table 1. The siRNAs for lamin A/C were previously reported (17.Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13928-13935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The siRNAs were transfected into the cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 48 h. RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR−Total RNAs were isolated using Isogen (Nippon Gene). For cDNA synthesis, 5 μg of total RNAs was reverse-transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen) using oligo-dT or random oligo primers. The RT-PCR was carried out for 30 cycles. Quantitative real-time PCR of the target cDNAs was performed by the SYBR Green method using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each experiment was carried out at least three times. The -fold relative enrichment was quantified together with normalization by the β-actin level. The primer sets are listed in supplemental Table 2. Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing−Genomic DNAs were treated with sodium bisulfite followed by PCR amplification with specific primers using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The primers used were described in supplemental Table 2. The resulting PCR products were purified and directly sequenced. MBD1 Interacts with PcG Proteins−To identify factors that interact with MBD1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the region containing the CXXC domains (amino acids 150-268) as bait (Fig. 1A). From a screening of ∼7 × 106 independent transformants of 17-day-old mouse embryo cDNA libraries, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding Ring1b (amino acids 250-337). To confirm an interaction between MBD1 and Ring1b, we prepared His-tagged full-length Ring1b and subjected it to an in vitro pulldown analysis (Fig. 1B). Briefly, GST and GST-fused portions of MBD1 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with His-Ring1b. Ring1b predominantly bound the CXXC1 and CXXC2 domains of MBD1, but not its MBD, CXXC3, and TRD domains, in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid screen. Our previous alignment analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of the CXXC3 domain of MBD1 shows high identity with that of the CXXC domain of ALL1/MLL (11.Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ALL1/MLL is one of the Trithorax group proteins and methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (34.Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T. Wassell R. Dubois G. Mazo A. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1119-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 35.Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that the region containing the CXXC domain of ALL1/MLL interacts with hPc2 (36.Xia Z.B. Anderson M. Diaz M.O. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8342-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To test whether the CXXC domains of MBD1 can interact with hPc2, His-tagged hPc2 was prepared for an in vitro pulldown analysis (Fig. 1B). His-hPc2 specifically bound the CXXC3 domain as well as full-length MBD1. To further determine the region responsible for binding MBD1, we used two deletion mutants of hPc2, hPc2ΔN, and hPc2ΔC, which lacked the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein, respectively (Fig. 1A). hPc2ΔC bound GST-MBD1, whereas hPc2ΔN lacking the chromodomain did not (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that the CXXC domains of MBD1 directly interact with Ring1b and hPc2, which are essential components of PRC1. MBD1 Forms Complexes with PcG Proteins in Vivo−To confirm the interactions between MBD1 and PcG proteins in vivo, we performed an immunoprecipitation analysis. Hemagglutinin-tagged MBD1 and FLAG-tagged hPc2 were coexpressed in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-MBD1 and anti-hPc2 antibodies, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that MBD1 was present in the immunoprecipitates with hPc2 but not in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1D). hPc2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates with MBD1. Likewise, an immunoprecipitation analysis after coexpression of hemagglutinin-MBD1 and DsRed-tagged Ring1b revealed that MBD1 formed complexes with Ring1b (data not shown). To confirm whether exogenously expressed hPc2 and Ring1b form complexes in cells, immunoprecipitation of FLAG-hPc2 and DsRed-Ring1b was carried out (Fig. 1E). These PcG proteins were found to be mutually coprecipitated. We further investigated the association of endogenous MBD1 and hPc2 in HeLa cells without any overexpression. The coprecipitated bands for endogenous proteins were relatively faint and constant in repeated experiments (data not shown), probably due to the low biochemical solubility of endogenous MBD1 (16.Fujita N.

Together with the colocalization data (see Figs. 4 and 5), these results show that MBD1 and PcG proteins form complexes in vivo.FIGURE 5Cooperative formation of heterochromatin foci by MBD1 and PcG proteins.

The cells were grown in the presence of 5 μm 5-aza-dC for 3 days or transfected with specific siRNAs targeted against the mRNAs encoding human MBD1 or hPc2. Quantitative analyses of each 300 foci were performed to examine the levels of the colocalization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cooperative Interaction of MBD1 and hPc2 for a Transcriptional Role−We tested whether combinations of the CXXC domains of MBD1 and hPc2 and of the chromodomain of hPc2 and MBD1 functionally interact for transcriptional control using luciferase reporter experiments (Fig. 2A). We expressed GAL4-fused CXXC domains of MBD1 (GAL4-CXXC) or the GAL4-fused chromodomain of hPc2 (GAL4-chromo) in HeLa cells. Western blot analyses revealed that GAL4-CXXC and GAL4-chromo were appropriately expressed in this assay (Fig. 2, B-D). The effects of the combinations were examined by using a Photinus pyralis luciferase reporter containing five GAL4 binding elements upstream of the human p16 gene promoter. The p16 gene is targeted by CpG hypermethylation and subsequent binding of MBD1 or by PcG proteins in certain cancer cells (10.Baylin S.B. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2005; 2: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 30.Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 38.Jones P.A.

GAL4-CXXC alone tended to decrease the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). To assess the functional implication of the MBD1-hPc2 association, we checked the effect of exogenous hPc2 on the CXXC-based transcription. Coexpression of FLAG-hPc2 moderately decreased the CXXC-based luciferase activities, consistent with the interaction of MBD1 with hPc2. To elucidate the cooperative role of MBD1 and hPc2, we performed selective knockdown of endogenous hPc2 or MBD1 using pSilencer3.1puro vectors producing specific short hairpin RNAs (Fig. 2C). Western blot analyses revealed the effectiveness of the MBD1 or hPc2 knockdown (supplemental Fig. 1A). Knockdown of hPc2 constantly increased the CXXC-based transcription compared with the level with CXXC alone. To further examine the transcriptional effect of the chromodomain of hPc2, we expressed GAL4-chromo in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). GAL4-chromo alone efficiently repressed transcription in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm the functional association of MBD1-hPc2, we knocked down endogenous MBD1. In comparison to the controls, the repression of the promoter activities by GAL4-chromo was weakened after knockdown of MBD1. In addition, the expression of GAL4-fused full-length MBD1 or hPc2 alone showed stronger repression of the promoter activity (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that the CXXC domains of MBD1 associate with the chromodomain of hPc2. Transcriptional Repression of HOXA Genes by MBD1 and PcG Proteins−There is a possibility that DNA methylation as well as PcG complexes is involved in the repression of HOX genes in mammals (40.Shiraishi M. Sekiguchi A. Oates A.J. Terry M.J. Miyamoto Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3659-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41.Terranova R. Agherbi H. Boned A. Meresse S. Djabali M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), although the roles of the MBD family proteins have not been investigated. To test the roles of MBD1 and PcG proteins in gene regulation, we performed an expression analysis of the HOXA gene cluster on human chromosome 7p15.3 using a reverse transcription-PCR method (Fig. 3A). The HOXA2, HOXA4, and HOXA7 genes were repressed in HeLa cells, whereas other HOXA genes were expressed in the cells. The expression profiles of the HOXA genes differed among the cell lines tested (supplemental Fig. 2). To check whether the repression was related to DNA methylation, the cells were treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; 5 μm) for 3 days. Under these hypomethylation conditions, the HOXA4 and HOXA7 genes were reactivated mostly to the expression levels of the originally transcribed HOXA genes. By co"
https://openalex.org/W2005030856,"The homodimeric light chains LC8 and Tctex-1 are integral parts of the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein, as they directly associate with dynein intermediate chain IC and various cellular cargoes. These light chains appear to regulate assembly of the dynein complex by binding to and promoting dimerization of IC. In addition, both LC8 and Tctex-1 play roles in signaling, apoptosis, and neuronal development that are independent of their function in dynein, but it is unclear how these various activities are modulated. Both light chains undergo specific phosphorylation, and here we present biochemical and NMR analyses of phosphomimetic mutants that indicate how phosphorylation may regulate light chain function. For both LC8 and Tctex-1, phosphorylation promotes dissociation from IC while retaining their binding activity with other non-dynein proteins. Although LC8 and Tctex-1 are homologs having a common fold, their reduced affinity for IC upon phosphorylation arises by different mechanisms. In the case of Tctex-1, phosphorylation directly masks the IC binding site at the dimer interface, whereas for LC8, phosphorylation dissociates the dimer and indirectly eliminates the binding site. This modulation of the monomer-dimer equilibrium by phosphorylation provides a novel mechanism for discrimination among LC8 binding partners."
https://openalex.org/W2060872170,"The complete degradation of uric acid to (S)-allantoin, as recently elucidated, involves three enzymatic reactions. Inactivation by pseudogenization of the genes of the pathway occurred during hominoid evolution, resulting in a high concentration of urate in the blood and susceptibility to gout. Here, we describe the 1.8Å resolution crystal structure of the homodimeric 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase, which catalyzes the last step in the urate degradation pathway, for both ligand-free enzyme and enzyme in complex with the substrate analogs (R)-allantoin and guanine.

The structure and the mutational analysis of the active site have allowed us to identify some residues that are essential for catalysis, among which His-67 and Glu-87 appear to play a particularly significant role. Glu-87 may facilitate the exit of the carboxylate group because of electrostatic repulsion that destabilizes the ground state of the substrate, whereas His-67 is likely to be involved in a protonation step leading to the stereoselective formation of the (S)-allantoin enantiomer as reaction product.

Uric acid, a key compound in the degradation pathway of purines (1Vogels G.D. van der Drift C. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 403-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is degraded in many organisms to (S)-allantoin. It had long been thought that allantoin was formed directly from urate by the action of urate oxidase. However, a refined analysis of the urate oxidation reaction (2Modric N. Derome A.E. Ashcroft S.J.H. Poje M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 6691-6694Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Khan K. Tipton P.A.

Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), involving three enzymatic reactions: oxidation of urate, catalyzed by urate oxidase, yields 5-hydroxyisourate (HIU), 3The abbreviations used are: HIU, 5-hydroxyisourate; OHCU, 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline. 3The abbreviations used are: HIU, 5-hydroxyisourate; OHCU, 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline. which is then acted upon HIU hydrolase to yield 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU); in turn, OHCU undergoes stereoselective decarboxylation by the action of OHCU decarboxylase to give CO2 and (S)-allantoin (Scheme 1). In contrast, the slow non-enzymatic OHCU decarboxylation generates the racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-allantoin (7Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Genes encoding for OHCU decarboxylase are present in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and metazoa and are tightly associated with urate oxidase and HIU hydrolase; in general, a species either has all three genes involved in urate degradation or none of them (6Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Inactivation by pseudogenization of all three genes of the pathway occurred during hominoid evolution (6Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), resulting in high concentration of urate in the blood and susceptibility to gout. Urate oxidase is currently being employed therapeutically for refractory hyperuricemia (8Lee S.J. Terkeltaub R.A. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2006; 8: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Addition of OHCU decarboxylase to this therapeutic regimen in humans could speed the conversion of urate oxidation products and thus make urate oxidase therapy better tolerated and safer. The first enzyme of the pathway, urate oxidase, has been subjected to detailed structural characterization (9Colloc'h N. El Hajji M. Bachet B. L'Hermite G. Schiltz M. Prange T. Castro B. Mornon J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Gabison L. Chiadmi M. Colloc'h N. Castro B. El Hajji M.

This enzyme is a multimer made up by four T-fold domains, a fold type that is found in other enzymes acting on purine or pterine substrates (11Colloc'h N. Poupon A. Mornon J.P.

The three-dimensional structure of HIU hydrolase has very recently been determined by four independent groups for bacterial (12Hennebry S.C. Law R.H. Richardson S.J. Buckle A.M. Whisstock J.C. J.

Biol. 2006; 363: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) organisms. HIU hydrolase is a homotetramer that structurally resembles a plasma transport protein, transthyretin; these two proteins represent a relevant example of divergent evolution. At variance with the two preceding enzymes of the pathway, OHCU decarboxylase, which has not been structurally characterized yet, has no similarity with other proteins. The structure of this enzyme was thus anticipated to reveal a novel fold and, possibly, a novel decarboxylation mechanism. Here, we report on the crystal structure of OHCU decarboxylase from zebrafish and, based on the structures of the enzyme in complex with two different ligands and on mutational analysis of the enzyme active site, we provide insights into the mechanism and stereoselectivity of the enzymatic reaction. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Forms of Zebrafish OHCU Decarboxylase and Mutational Analysis—The portion of the expressed sequence tag CN168729 (obtained from the Deutsches-Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung) encoding the complete sequence of zebrafish decarboxylase was PCR-amplified using a high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase (Deep Vent DNA polymerase; New England Biolabs) and two sequence-specific primers: a NcoI-tailed upstream primer (5′-CCATGGATATAAATGTTGTAAATGC-3′) and an EcoRI-tailed downstream primer (5′-GAATTCTTAGCTTCCCCTGTATG-3′). The amplification product digested with NcoI and EcoRI was cloned into the expression vector pET28b (Novagen). The expression of zebrafish decarboxylase in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; after a 4-h incubation at 28 °C, cells were lysed by 30-s bursts of sonication. The protein was purified to homogeneity using a one-step procedure consisting of gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G100; Sigma) with a final yield of ∼75 mg/liter of cell culture. Because the amino acid sequence of OHCU decarboxylase contains only 3 Met residues, one of which is at the N terminus, in order to solve the phase problem a mutant form with an additional Met residue was produced. The amino acid substitution L125M was selected on the basis of a multiple alignment of OHCU decarboxylase sequences showing the presence of a Met residue in position 125 in some piscine species (not shown). Mutant forms of OHCU decarboxylase (L125M, H67N, E87Q, and R161Q) were obtained by PCR using a high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase (PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase; Stratagene). The plasmid pET28b-OHCU decarboxylase was used as template, and mutagenic primers complementary to opposite strands were synthesized. The products of PCR were treated with DpnI (Stratagene) to digest the parental DNA template. This procedure allowed us to select the newly synthesized and potentially mutated plasmids. Single clones were then sequenced to confirm the occurrence of the desired mutation. Finally, mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described for the wild-type enzyme, with a final yield range of 35–90 mg/liter of cell culture. Se-Met-labeled enzyme was produced via inhibition of the Met metabolism pathway as described (16Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar); cell cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow overnight at 25 °C. Se-Met-labeled enzyme was purified to homogeneity according to the procedure described above for wild-type OHCU decarboxylase. The oligomerization status of wild-type and mutant enzymes was verified by means of analytical gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G100; Sigma). The enzymatic activities of purified wild-type and mutant forms of OHCU decarboxylase were evaluated as described, following the change of the OHCU-specific CD signal at 257 nm (6Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Single crystals of the wild-type zebrafish OHCU decarboxylase (typical size: 0.15 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm) were obtained in 3–7 days, at 4 °C, by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method after equilibrating a solution containing OHCU decarboxylase (10 mg/ml), 10% (v/v) EtOH, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, against 20% (v/v) EtOH, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (precipitant n.9 of Structure Screen 2; Molecular Dimension Ltd.). These crystallization conditions have been adopted for wild-type OHCU decarboxylase, the seleno-methionine derivative of the L125M enzyme mutant, and the wild-type enzyme in complex with guanine. Crystals of the enzyme in complex with allantoin were produced by soaking crystals of the wild-type enzyme with a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-allantoin for ∼36 h. To obtain crystalline enzyme-ligand complexes, due to the poor solubility of guanine and allantoin an excess of these compounds from aqueous saturated solutions was added to the enzyme in solution prior to its crystallization or directly in the crystal, respectively. Data sets used for the determination of the structures described here were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at beamlines ID23 and ID29 of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The best diffraction patterns were obtained with crystals soaked for ∼30 s in a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% ethylene glycol, 20% EtOH, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Crystals of both the native enzyme and Se-Met enzyme derivative belong to space group P32. Cell parameters for the native OHCU decarboxylase crystals are a = b = 101.81 Å, c = 103.91 Å; three dimers are present in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of ∼50% and a VM coefficient of 2.48 (17Matthews B. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7909) Google Scholar). A data set for the native enzyme was obtained at 1.8 Å resolution. A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was successfully performed using two crystals of the Se-Met enzyme derivative from the same crystallization drop. The best data sets collected with high redundancy around the selenium K edge showed an acceptable quality until 2.6 Å resolution. Data were processed with the programs MOSFLM and SCALA (18Collaborative Computing Project 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar), and the corresponding statistics are summarized in Table 1. The selenium substructure was identified by the program ShelxD (19Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). Interpretable maps were obtained by density modification and phase improvement procedures using the program AutoSHARP 2.2.0 (20Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg M. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The rotation matrices and the translation vectors that relate the three dimers in the asymmetric unit were determined after the building of main chain atoms, with the help of the skeletonization procedure available in the Coot graphic software (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22994) Google Scholar). Several cycles of model building and refinement applied to the high resolution data set for the native enzyme using both the packages CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Residues 2–165 for all polypeptide chains A-F of the three dimers present in the asymmetric unit are clearly visible in the electron density map, with the exception of chain F, for which residues 1–168 are visible. The final model, analyzed with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), is characterized by a good stereochemistry (no residues are present in disallowed or in generously allowed regions), with an overall G-factor of 0.2. Data sets for both complexes of the enzyme with either allantoin or guanine were obtained using one crystal each. Because the crystals of both complexes were found to be isomorphous with crystals of the native enzyme, refinement was carried out starting from the native enzyme refined structure. A Fourier difference map contoured at 3σ level clearly showed the presence of a ligand after the first cycles of refinement. The coordinates of the ligand, obtained with the server PRODRG (25Schuettelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

In the case of allantoin, the electron density clearly reveals the presence of the (R) enantiomer. Individual B factors were refined in all models. The final statistics are detailed in Table 1.

Each monomer, comprising 174 amino acids, is made up by ten α-helices (labeled A through J, Fig. 1, A and B) and is composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain (domain I) spans from residue Asp-2 to residue His-67 and includes the first five helices. The C-terminal domain (domain II) includes residues from Pro-68 to Ile-165 and the remaining five helices. The α-helices of domain I are rather short, between 5 and 10 residues long (α-helix C is quite irregular at its end, so that its length can be considered to span from 7 to 10 residues), with the exception of α-helix D, which comprises 14 residues. They are connected by short loops and fold up in a flat, compact domain. The segment 66–72, which is in extended conformation, connects domain I to domain II. The latter is formed by helices F through J: helix F (4 residues long) is the shortest, whereas helices H and J (18 and 22 residues long, respectively) are the longest. A long strand, mainly in extended conformation, is also present in this domain and connects helices H and I. The last helix, J, participates in the majority of contacts between the two domains. This arrangement confers to the monomer the shape of a flat parallelepiped, whose approximate size is 50 × 35 × 22 Å (Fig. 1B). The amino acid sequence of OHCU decarboxylase (Fig. 1A) does not exhibit homology with other known amino acid sequences. Accordingly, in a search of structural homology with deposited protein structures, no significant structural similarity of other proteins with OHCU decarboxylase has been found. Therefore, a novel protein fold characterizes the structure described here. 21 potentially positively charged (Arg and Lys) and 25 negatively charged (Glu and Asp) residues are present in the model of the monomer (an additional Lys and an additional Asp are not visible in our model, being located in the C terminus). Most of these residues are on the surface of the molecule, with the exception of Glu-146, Arg-138 Glu-23, Arg-161, and Glu-87, whose charged side chains point toward the interior of the protein molecule, where they are involved in electrostatic interactions. Each monomer also contains 5 Cys residues that do not form disulfide bridges. The dimeric state of the protein, which has been verified in solution by gel filtration (see “Experimental Procedures”), mainly involves interactions between α-helices C of one monomer and E of the other (and vice versa) and between the loop connecting helix B to helix C of both monomers. The area buried by dimerization is ∼2,300 Å2/monomer. This large surface participates in both polar and apolar interactions, including 14 H-bonds (a list of the latter is reported in supplemental Table S1). Structures of Allantoin- and Guanine-OHCU Decarboxylase Complexes and the Enzyme Active Site—Crystals of OHCU decarboxylase were soaked with a racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-allantoin before data collection. A portion of the electron density of the Fourier difference map (supplemental Fig. S1) clearly shows that allantoin is bound inside a small cavity, the catalytic cleft, which is close to the external surface of the protein and is positioned between helix G and the stretches connecting helices H-I and E-F (Fig. 1C). It is located at the border of domain II of each monomer, in close contact with domain I, which partially lines its surface. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues line the internal surface of the cavity (Fig. 2). The top of it, toward the solvent, is closed up by the side chains of Glu-87 and Arg-161. Glu-87 is neutralized by Arg-161; the latter also interacts with Glu-23, which in turn is neutralized by His-67. Therefore, an array of four alternating charges (Glu-87-Arg-161-Glu-23-His-67) is present at the enzyme active site. Other hydrophilic residues are Ser-84 and Gln-88. The side chains of residues Leu-70, Val-120, Ile-157, and Ala-123 form the hydrophobic portion of the cavity surface. Both active sites in the enzyme dimer are occupied by the ligand and are quite far apart, the distance between equivalent atoms of the two allantoin molecules being ∼32 Å. The structural models of the liganded and unliganded states of OHCU decarboxylase are virtually identical (the root mean square deviation for the Cα atoms of the two dimers is in fact 0.1 Å), the space occupied by bound ligand being filled with five water molecules in the unliganded enzyme. Unexpectedly, (R)-allantoin, rather than the (S)-enantiomer, is found bound inside the cavity. Extensive interactions are established between (R)-allantoin and atoms of the enzyme active site (Fig. 3A). This pseudo-product of reaction participates in the formation of a number of H-bonds: all of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the ligand are at a distance shorter than 3.1 Å from protein N or O atoms or from a water molecule inside the active site. In particular, allantoin interacts with main chain atoms of residues 68, 119, 121, and 123, with the carboxylate group of Glu-87, and, through a water molecule, with the hydroxyl group of Ser-84 (Fig. 3A). The preferential binding of (R)-allantoin is consistent with the results of molecular modeling: in fact, by substituting this enantiomer with (S)-allantoin, some H-bond interactions are abolished. It should be noted that the residues mentioned above are conserved or chemically similar in the sequences of OHCU decarboxylases from phylogenetically distant species (Fig. 1A), consistent with their catalytic or conformational role at the enzyme active site.FIGURE 3Amino acid residues involved in the interaction with substrate analogs and in catalytic activity. A, stereo view of one of the enzyme active sites with bound (R)-allantoin. Electron density maps were calculated as omit maps and contoured at 3σ level. Possible H-bonds, corresponding to interatomic distances between atoms of bound ligand and protein atoms shorter than 3.1 Å, are shown as dotted lines. B, same as panel A for guanine. C, stereo view of the hypothetical OHCU-OHCU decarboxylase complex. One of the two possible stereoisomers of OHCU was modeled inside the active site in the position occupied by allantoin, without optimization. The only modification is a rotation of the His-67 side chain around its Cα-Cβ bond that brings it closer to the five-membered ring of the substrate. Distances are C5-NE His-67, 3.0 Å; OAE, OAD-OH Ser-84, 2.4 and 2.7 Å; OAE-NH3 Arg-161 3.1 Å; OAE-OE1 Glu-87, 2.9 Å. D, enzymatic activities of wild-type zebrafish OHCU decarboxylase and enzyme mutant forms were monitored by following the change of the OHCU-specific negative ellipticity at 257 nm by CD measurements (6Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Upon rapid formation of OHCU, catalyzed by urate oxidase and HIU hydrolase, OHCU decarboxylation is revealed. Time courses in the absence of OHCU decarboxylase (gray) or in the presence of wild-type (black), H67N (green), E87Q (light blue), and R161Q (dark blue) OHCU decarboxylases are shown. The activity for the enzyme in which the non-catalytic 125 residue is replaced (L125M, red) is also shown. Reaction conditions: 1 unit of urate oxidase from Candida utilis, 2.5 μg of zebrafish HIU hydrolase, and 0.6 μg of zebrafish OHCU decarboxylase in a solution (1 ml) containing 0.1 mm urate and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6; 22 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Crystals of the enzyme in complex with guanine, a precursor of urate, were obtained by crystallization of the enzyme-ligand complex prepared in solution. The mode of binding of guanine is very similar to that of allantoin: nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the ligand make H-bonds with main chain atoms of residues 68, 119, 121, the carboxylate group of Glu-87, the hydroxyl group of Ser-84, and a water molecule (Fig. 3B). The superposition of bound allantoin and guanine shows that they occupy the same space inside the cavity but guanine is bound in a reverse way as compared with allantoin. The binding of each of the two enzyme ligands does not induce any conformational change in the protein. The active site cleft is a nearly closed cavity in both the liganded and unliganded states of the enzyme, so that we must assume that the protein undergoes transient conformational changes in order to provide access to OHCU and to permit the release of allantoin from the active site. Movements of the side chains of Glu-87 and Arg-124, and possibly of residues Ala-123 and Leu-125, are likely to take place to allow substrate binding and product release. Putative Catalytic Mechanism—A modeling of enzyme-bound OHCU in the position occupied by allantoin in the crystal structure (Fig. 3C) indicates that the carboxylate group of Glu-87 is close to the carboxylate of the substrate: the distance between oxygen atoms of the two negatively charged groups is ∼3 Å, possibly causing an electrostatic repulsion between them. In the crystal structure of the allantoin-OHCU decarboxylase complex, the imidazole ring of His-67 is at a distance of ∼5.5 Å from the C5 atom of the five-membered ring of the substrate, but a simple rotation around the Cα-Cβ bond of His-67 can reduce this distance to ∼3 Å, or even less (Fig. 3C). This model suggests that at least 2 residues, Glu-87 and His-67, are close to the substrate and in a position suitable for playing a crucial role in catalysis. Besides, the enzymatic reaction could be indirectly affected by Arg-161 and Glu-23, the other 2 charged residues in the cavity that contribute to the charge balance. To evaluate the importance in catalysis of residues His-67, Glu-87, and Arg-161, enzyme mutants H67N, E87Q, and R161Q were prepared and tested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The three mutant forms have been found to be unable to accelerate the spontaneous decay of OHCU (Fig. 3D), indicating that the replaced residues play a crucial role in catalysis or in maintaining the structural integrity of the active site. The catalytic mechanism of decarboxylases in general implies the stabilization of the carbanion originating from decarboxylation, a task that can be achieved in several ways, often involving metal ions or cofactors or through delocalization into aromatic systems of the charge of the carbanion generated upon decarboxylation (29O'Leary M.H. Sigman D.S. Enzymes. 20. Academic, San Diego, CA1992: 235-269Google Scholar, 30Begly T.P. Ealick S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). OHCU decarboxylase, however, does not employ cofactors or metal ions and the five-membered ring of the substrate is unable to delocalize the charge of the carbanion developing upon the release of CO2. Therefore, a distinct catalytic mechanism of action is operating in OHCU decarboxylase. To postulate this mechanism, the non-enzymatic decarboxylation of OHCU, for which a mechanistic explanation implies the formation of an electrophilic center able to accept the electron pair donated upon the release of the carboxylate group, is taken into account; decarboxylation of carboxylic acids containing a C = N bond in β position is facilitated by protonation of the nitrogen atom participating in this bond to generate an effective electron sink (31Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Dover Publication, New York1987: 116-120Google Scholar). We thus propose that an initial step of the enzymatic decarboxylation of OHCU is the protonation of the substrate, afforded by a H3O+ molecule or by a protonated residue, resulting in the formation of an electron sink at N6 and allowing the release of CO2 through an enol intermediate (Scheme 2). The proximity of the carboxylate group of Glu-87 could produce a destabilization of the ground state of the substrate, facilitating the release of its carboxylate group as CO2. The deletion of a positive charge at position 161 also abolishes any activity. The charged side chain of Arg-161 directly interacts with Glu-87 and is at ∼5 Å distance from the carboxylate group of the substrate. In this respect, the mechanism of action of OHCU decarboxylase is reminiscent of that of orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase, for which metal ions or cofactors are not required for catalysis: a network of four alternating charges has been revealed at the active site, and an electrostatic repulsion between the carboxylate groups of the substrate and of the side chain of an Asp residue present in the network possibly takes place (32Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 33Miller B.G. Wolfenden R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 847-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After the release of CO2, an enol intermediate is formed, which rearranges to give the final keto product. The rearrangement of the enol intermediate, which in itself might take place without the assistance of the enzyme according to an enol-keto tautomerization, can be remarkably affected by the presence of His-67. This residue, which is likely to be protonated and is close enough to C5 atom of the substrate, can donate a proton to the enol intermediate to form the final keto product. Because His-67 is in the re position with respect to the mean plane of bound substrate, allantoin would be generated in the correct (S) configuration. In this hypothesis, His-67 plays a major role in catalysis, acting as proton donor in the reaction and controlling its stereochemistry. Structural data, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis experiments, have provided indications about the mechanism of action of OHCU decarboxylase. In particular, they strengthen the role of His-67 as proton donor and offer an explanation for the formation of the (S)-enantiomer of allantoin as reaction product. The technical assistance of the staffs of beamlines ID29 and ID23-1 of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, during data collection is gratefully acknowledged.

https://openalex.org/W2082032892,"The zinc-finger transcription factor GLI3 is a key regulator of development, acting as a primary transducer of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling in a combinatorial context dependent fashion controlling multiple patterning steps in different tissues/organs. A tight temporal and spatial control of gene expression is indispensable, however, cis-acting sequence elements regulating GLI3 expression have not yet been reported. We show that 11 ancient genomic DNA signatures, conserved from the pufferfish Takifugu (Fugu) rubripes to man, are distributed throughout the introns of human GLI3. They map within larger conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) that are found in the tetrapod lineage. Full length CNEs transiently transfected into human cell cultures acted as cell type specific enhancers of gene transcription. The regulatory potential of these elements is conserved and was exploited to direct tissue specific expression of a reporter gene in zebrafish embryos. Assays of deletion constructs revealed that the human-Fugu conserved sequences within the GLI3 intronic CNEs were essential but not sufficient for full-scale transcriptional activation. The enhancer activity of the CNEs is determined by a combinatorial effect of a core sequence conserved between human and teleosts (Fugu) and flanking tetrapod-specific sequences, suggesting that successive clustering of sequences with regulatory potential around an ancient, highly conserved nucleus might be a possible mechanism for the evolution of cis-acting regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2069567827,"Vps4p and Vps36p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are involved in the transport of proteins to the vacuole via the carboxypeptidase Y pathway. We found that deletion of VPS4 and VPS36 caused impaired maturation of the vacuolar proaminopeptidase I (pAPI) via autophagy or the cytosol to vacuole targeting pathway. Supplementation with ethanolamine rescued this defect, leading to an increase of the cellular amount of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), an enhanced level of the PtdEtn-binding autophagy protein Atg8p and a balanced rate of autophagy. We also discovered that maturation of pAPI was generally affected by PtdEtn depletion in a psd1Δ psd2Δ mutant due to reduced recruitment of Atg8p to the preautophagosomal structure. Ethanolamine supplementation provided the necessary amounts of PtdEtn for complete maturation of pAPI. Since the expression level of Atg8p was not compromised in the psd1Δ psd2Δ strain, we concluded that the amount of available PtdEtn was limiting. Thus, PtdEtn appears to be a limiting factor for the balance of the carboxypeptidase Y pathway and autophagy/the cytosol to vacuole targeting pathway in the yeast.

Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). PtdEtn can be synthesized by three different pathways, namely through decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) by the major phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, Psd1p, a component of the inner mitochondrial membrane; through extramitochondrial decarboxylation of PtdSer by Psd2p; and through the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Nebauer R. Birner-Grünberger R. Daum G. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 6: 125-168Crossref Google Scholar). A lack of the major PtdEtn-synthesizing enzyme, Psd1p, leads to a substantial decrease of PtdEtn in total cellular and mitochondrial membranes, thereby conferring a petite phenotype, which is linked to the loss of respiratory capacity (1Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1992; 267: 15277-15280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PtdEtn was also shown to be involved in two vacuolar delivery pathways, autophagy and cytosol to vacuole targeting (Cvt) (see Fig. 1) (reviewed in Refs. 6Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Yoshimori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These processes are mechanistically related and involve the formation of double-membrane cytosolic vesicles, sequestering either precursor aminopeptidase I (pAPI) specifically or, in the case of autophagy, also enveloping bulk cytosol in a non-selective manner. Whereas autophagy is a catabolic process inducible by starvation, the Cvt pathway is a constitutive biosynthetic route. PtdEtn dependence of autophagy/the Cvt pathway is due to covalent binding of the phospholipid to the starvation-inducible autophagy protein Atg8p (9Huang W.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Atg8p is then delivered to the vacuole enclosed in double-membrane transport vesicles and finally turned over by vacuolar proteases. Involvement of Atg8p as a structural component in vesicle formation was suggested. The main pathway for the delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the vacuole is the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) pathway (13Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The CPY pathway involves transport of proteins from the late Golgi complex via a prevacuolar compartment (PVC) to the vacuole. A second pathway, referred to as the alkaline phosphatase pathway (13Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), differs from the CPY pathway insofar as it uses a different type of Golgi-derived carrier vesicles and bypasses the PVC en route to the vacuole. Vps4p and Vps36p are two polypeptides that are involved in the transport of CPY precursors to the vacuole (14Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D.

Class E vps mutants accumulate vacuolar, endocytic, and late Golgi markers in an aberrant multilamellar structure, the so-called class E compartment (19Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Internalization of proteins in the PVC occurs in concerted action of the three multisubunit complexes ESCRT-I, -II, and -III (15Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Snyder W.B. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 283-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), which are proposed to act sequentially in the order I, II, and III to select and concentrate cargoes destined for internalization in the multivesicular body/CPY pathway. Loss of Vps4p activity results in the accumulation of ESCRT-III components on the membrane (20Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Vps4p in disassembly of complexes on the PVC membrane during cargo sorting. Deletion of a class E VPS gene, however, does not lead to a complete block in protein and membrane transport to the vacuole. In this case, translocation of polypeptides may occur by alternative mechanisms that are different from the normal endosome to vacuole transport system. In the study presented here, we aimed at identifying components that were affected by changes in the cellular PtdEtn level. A genetic screening led to the identification of mutants defective in Vps4p and Vps36p. When the CPY route is inactivated by vps4 or vps36 mutations, autophagy/the Cvt pathway is also impaired. We demonstrate that full activity of the latter route requires a certain cellular level of PtdEtn, which is essential for the formation of autophagosomes/Cvt vesicles by covalently binding to Atg8p. The general requirement for PtdEtn in the targeting of proteins to the vacuole is discussed. Strains and Culture Conditions—Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. S. cerevisiae strains were grown under aerobic conditions at 30 or 37 °C on synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose (SD) or 2% lactate (SL), respectively, or on YP medium (1% yeast extract and 2% peptone) containing 2% glucose (YPD) or lactate (YPL), respectively, as the carbon source. In the cases indicated, supplementation with serine, ethanolamine, or choline was 2 mm. Starvation medium consisted of 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose (SD(–N)) or 2% lactate (SL(–N)). For large scale cultivation, inoculations to an A600 of 0.1 in fresh medium were made by diluting precultures grown to the stationary phase. For auxotrophy tests, yeast strains were cultivated on solid synthetic medium (21Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual.

Approximately 100,000 transformants were screened for ethanolamine auxotrophy on glucose minimal medium at 37 °C. The site of transposon insertion was identified using a vectorette PCR protocol as described (available on the World Wide Web at genome-www.stanford.edu/group/botlab/protocols/vectorette.html) employing the oligonucleotides Bubble-1, -2, and -224 (Table 2). DNA sequencing was performed at MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Analysis of Strains Bearing a GFP-Atg8p Hybrid—Cells expressing the centromeric plasmid GFP-Atg8p, which carries a GFP-Atg8p fusion under the native Atg8p promoter (kindly provided by Y. Ohsumi, Okazaki, Japan), were grown on SD or SL medium to the late exponential phase, harvested, washed twice with water, and then shaken at 30 °C in SD(–N) or SL(–N) medium. Samples were taken within a time range of 4 h and subjected to alkaline lysis (25Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described below. Wild type and psd1Δ psd2Δ cells expressing GFP-Atg8p were grown to the late logarithmic growth phase on SL medium supplemented with Etn and shifted to SL(–N) supplemented with Etn for 4 h. Cells were screened under the fluorescence microscope, and cells with fluorescence signals on the PAS were counted. As controls, atg1Δ and atg21Δ cells expressing GFP-Atg8p were analyzed under the microscope. Fluorescence and light microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were quantified by the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

(27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described by Haid and Suissa (28Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using a primary rabbit antibody against pAPI or Atg8p (kindly provided by M. Thumm, Göttingen, Germany) or a primary mouse antibody against GFP (Roche Applied Science). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Phospholipid Analysis—For the analysis of total cellular phospholipids, yeast cells harvested from a 500-ml culture grown to the late logarithmic phase were disintegrated by shaking with glass beads in a Merckenschlager homogenizer under CO2 cooling in the presence of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem). After removal of the beads by centrifugation, the supernatant representing the total cell homogenate was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. Lipids from samples containing 3 mg of protein were extracted by the procedure of Folch et al. (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Individual phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (70:35:5, v/v/v) as first and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (55:20:10:10:5, v/v/v/v/v) as second developing solvent. Phospholipids were visualized on TLC plates by staining with iodine vapor, scraped off, and quantified by the method of Broekhuyse (30Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A Screen for Mutants with an Enhanced Requirement for Phosphatidylethanolamine Identifies vps4 and vps36—To investigate the function of PtdEtn in yeast cells and to identify processes that depend on PtdEtn, we performed a screening for mutants that require exogenous ethanolamine as a supplement when cellular PtdEtn homeostasis is disturbed. To increase the stringency of this screening, we used a psd2Δ genetic background. The PtdEtn level of a psd2Δ mutant was slightly decreased as compared with wild type (Table 3) but still higher than in a psd1Δ strain that lacks the major cellular PtdSer decarboxylase (3Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, the temperature of 37 °C was chosen as another means to modulate the PtdEtn requirement of the yeast. At this temperature, the cellular level of PtdEtn is lower than at 30 °C, which made the screening more efficient for the expected defects. Thus, an appropriate strategy had been designed to identify mutations that were sensitive to alterations of the PtdEtn amount in the cell.TABLE 3Phospholipid composition of homogenatesStrainPercentage of total phospholipidsPtdChoPtdEtnPtdInsPtdSerLPLDMPEPACL%%%%%%%%BY474260157122122BY4742 + Etn51256102231BY4742 + Ser60166120510BY4742 + Cho60166102222psd2Δ63125132132psd2Δ + Etn6118471522vps4Δ6715573021vps4Δ + Etn5131561222vps4Δ + Ser6514571243vps4Δ + Cho6614863112vps36Δ6615573012vps36Δ + Etn4932571402vps36Δ + Ser59138102332vps36Δ + Cho5913893432 Open table in a new tab For the introduction of random deletions into the genome, the psd2Δ deletion strain was transformed with a transposon-based knock-out library (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mutants with a requirement for ethanolamine were selected on glucose minimal medium with or without ethanolamine, respectively, at 37 °C. This approach led to the identification of 10 mutants. 3R. Nebauer, S. Rosenberger, and G. Daum, unpublished data. Two of these mutants contained a transposon insertion in genes that are involved in vacuolar protein sorting, namely VPS4 and VPS36. For further investigations, we used the vps4Δ and vps36Δ deletion strains (Table 1) from the Euroscarf collection (Frankfurt, Germany). Ethanolamine dependence of growth on glucose minimal medium at 37 °C was confirmed with vps4Δ psd2Δ and vps36Δ psd2Δ double deletion strains (data not shown). Surprisingly, vps4Δ and vps36Δ single mutants (Fig. 2A) exhibited the same ethanolamine auxotrophy as psd2Δ vps4Δ and psd2Δ vps36Δ double mutants. Thus, the ethanolamine auxotrophy was independent of psd2Δ and only due to deletion of VPS4 or VPS36, indicating that the vps4Δ and vps36Δ mutants had an increased requirement for PtdEtn. A similar effect, although less pronounced, was observed at 30 °C (Fig. 2B), supporting our strategy to perform the screening at 37 °C (see above). Supplementation with Ethanolamine Increases the Amount of Phosphatidylethanolamine in vps4Δ and vps36Δ Strains—To test whether the ethanolamine auxotrophy of vps4Δ and vps36Δ was reflected in the amount of PtdEtn in the respective mutants, we analyzed homogenates of cells grown on minimal medium with or without ethanolamine (Table 3). In the absence of ethanolamine, the wild type BY4742, vps4Δ, and vps36Δ contained the same amount of PtdEtn, whereas the psd2Δ mutant used as a control showed a slight decrease of PtdEtn. The addition of ethanolamine to the medium generally led to an increase of the amount of PtdEtn, which was accompanied by the decrease of phosphatidylcholine in all strains that were analyzed. The increase of the PtdEtn level upon ethanolamine supplementation in vps4Δ and vps36Δ was even higher than in wild type. Thus, enhanced formation of PtdEtn by supplementation with ethanolamine in vps4Δ and vps36Δ correlated with the growth characteristics. Supplementation with serine or choline did not lead to an increased cellular level of PtdEtn (see Table 3). Processing of Proaminopeptidase I in vps4Δ and vps36Δ Is Enhanced in the Presence of Ethanolamine—Since growth of vps4Δ and vps36Δ was improved by ethanolamine, we hypothesized that a block of the CPY pathway might cause enhancement of a vacuolar transport pathway different from autophagy and/or the Cvt pathway (see Fig. 1) and increase the requirement for PtdEtn. This hypothesis is in line with the finding of Ichimura et al. (10Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), who showed that PtdEtn plays a role in autophagy by covalently conjugating to Atg8p. A marker protein for autophagy/the Cvt pathway in S. cerevisiae is pAPI, a resident vacuolar proteinase, which was described to be selectively targeted to the vacuole through this route. Once in the vacuole, pAPI is proteolytically matured (6Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Wang C.W. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 65-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the above mentioned hypothesis, we examined maturation of pAPI in vps4Δ and vps36Δ and studied the effect of ethanolamine on this process. For analysis of the effects on autophagy, cells were grown to the late exponential phase, shifted to starvation medium for 4 h, and analyzed with antibodies against pAPI (Fig. 3). In the absence of ethanolamine, maturation of pAPI was incomplete in vps4Δ and vps36Δ with ∼20% of API remaining in its precursor form, whereas the addition of ethanolamine led to the same level of maturation as in wild type. Thus, maturation of pAPI in vps4Δ and vps36Δ correlated with the ethanolamine-induced growth rate. Entirely the same result was obtained for the Cvt pathway (data not shown). To further explore the specific dependence of pAPI maturation on PtdEtn in vps4Δ and vps36Δ, we studied growth, phospholipid composition and pAPI processing upon the addition of serine and choline to the growth medium. Serine can be introduced into PtdEtn via Psd1p- or Psd2p-dependent PtdSer decarboxylation, and choline can be incorporated into phosphatidylcholine via the CDP-choline pathway (2Nebauer R. Birner-Grünberger R. Daum G. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 6: 125-168Crossref Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 31Birner R. Daum G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 225: 273-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, an effect of serine addition on pAPI maturation could be expected, because PtdSer is the direct precursor of PtdEtn. In contrast, choline should only exert an effect similar to that of ethanolamine if the observed effects were generally due to aminoglycerophospholipid homeostasis. In the wild type, growth was unchanged irrespective of serine or choline supplementation. Serine improved growth of vps4Δ and vps36Δ similar to ethanolamine, but choline enhanced only growth of vps4Δ to a small extent (data not shown). However, serine or choline addition to the growth medium neither changed the PtdEtn level of BY4742, vps4Δ, or vps36Δ (see Table 3) nor processing of pAPI (Fig. 4). Conclusively, enhancement of maturation of pAPI to the level of wild type in vps4Δ and vps36Δ appears to be specifically due to the increased cellular level of PtdEtn caused by supplementation with exogenous ethanolamine. Phosphatidylethanolamine Is Essential to Overcome the Autophagy Defect in vps4Δ and vps36Δ—Since PtdEtn was shown to conjugate covalently to the autophagy protein Atg8p, we examined Atg8p expression in vps4Δ and vps36Δ in the presence or absence of ethanolamine. As shown in Fig. 3, the level of Atg8p in the mutants was comparable with wild type in the absence of ethanolamine but ∼3-fold increased upon the addition of ethanolamine to the medium. Thus, although vps4Δ and vps36Δ had wild type levels of PtdEtn (see Table 3) and Atg8p in the absence of ethanolamine, autophagy was defective in the mutants as shown by the maturation defect of pAPI (see Fig. 3). We speculated from these results that in vps4Δ and vps36Δ, ethanolamine supplementation and, consequently, enhanced levels of PtdEtn and Atg8p are required to increase the rate of autophagy to the wild type level. To test this hypothesis, we measured the rate of autophagy in vps4Δ and vps36Δ by following the selective vacuolar targeting of GFP-Atg8p as reported by Meiling-Wesse et al. (32Meiling-Wesse K. Barth H. Voss C. Barmark G. Muren E. Ronne H. Thumm M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar to Atg8p, GFP-Atg8p is targeted to the vacuole, where proteolysis of the fusion protein leads to formation of free GFP. As opposed to unsupplemented cells, ethanolamine supplementation of vps4Δ indeed led to a production of free GFP comparable with wild type (see Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with vps36Δ (data not shown). Thus, the requirement for autophagy and consequently for autophagosome-associated Atg8p in vps4Δ and vps36Δ can obviously only be fulfilled when a sufficient amount of PtdEtn is present for anchoring the polypeptide to the membrane. Phosphatidylethanolamine Depletion Leads to a Processing Defect and Decreased Amounts of Proaminopeptidase I—The obvious importance of PtdEtn for autophagy led us to examine in a more general way the contribution of the different PtdEtn biosynthetic pathways (see Introduction) to the cellular pool of PtdEtn necessary for autophagy/the Cvt pathway. To study possible effects of PtdEtn depletion on pAPI maturation, we analyzed pAPI processing in wild type, psd1Δ, psd2Δ, psd1Δ psd2Δ, and cki1Δ dpl1Δ eki1Δ. It has to be noted that defects in the different pathways lead to a different extent of PtdEtn depletion. Although the psd2Δ and cki1Δ dpl1Δ eki1Δ mutants did not have a significantly altered PtdEtn level as compared with wild type, PtdEtn was reduced in psd1Δ and even more dramatically in psd1Δ psd2Δ (1Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Processing of pAPI was examined in cells grown on lactate complete medium (YPL). On nonfermentable carbon sources, a higher level of PtdEtn is required for growth than on glucose-containing media, and maintaining growth of a strain deleted of PSD1 requires supplementation with ethanolamine (1Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The growth rate of psd1Δ psd2Δ is dramatically reduced on YPL even in the presence of ethanolamine and choline in YP media, and the PtdEtn level of psd1Δ psd2Δ cells grown on YPL without ethanolamine is very low. As shown in Fig. 6, processing of pAPI in wild type, psd1Δ, psd2Δ, and cki1Δ dpl1Δ eki1Δ was identical, with no unprocessed precursor remaining. However, a dramatic difference in pAPI processing was observed with the unsupplemented and ethanolamine-supplemented psd1Δ psd2Δ double mutant. In the absence of ethanolamine, about 35% of precursor remained unprocessed, whereas the addition of ethanolamine led to maturation of pAPI comparable with wild type. Again, the same results were obtained with cells shifted to starvation medium for 4 h to induce autophagy (data not shown). Thus, the effect of severe PtdEtn depletion in psd1Δ psd2Δ is similar to that observed in vps4Δ or vps36Δ, which exhibit an enhanced requirement for this phospholipid. The psd1Δ psd2Δ Mutant Shows Reduced Recruitment of Atg8p to the Preautophagosomal Structure and a Decrease in the Autophagy Rate—Atg8p is synthesized as a soluble precursor and conjugated to PtdEtn, which is essential for its proper localization and function in autophagy/the Cvt pathway (10Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In living cells, a functional GFP-Atg8p chimera has been localized to the PAS in addition to completely formed autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles (33Kim J. Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Localization of GFP-Atg8p to the PAS, which is believed to be a physiological intermediate structure for pAPI import into the vacuole and vesicle formation, is tightly coupled to Atg8p lipidation. Interestingly, Atg8p levels of all mutants bearing defects in the different PtdEtn-synthesizing pathways were the same as in wild type (see Fig. 6), indicating that malfunction of autophagy in psd1Δ psd2Δ was not due to a limited amount of Atg8p. Therefore, we investigated whether the defect in maturation of pAPI upon PtdEtn depletion in the double mutant was reflected in defects in the organization of the PAS. For this purpose, we used a GFP-Atg8p hybrid and determined its presence in the PAS, indicated by the formation of a perivacuolar dot. Wild type and psd1Δ psd2Δ cells were grown on SL medium to the late logarithmic phase and shifted to starvation medium SL(–N) for 4 h. It has to be noted that the medium had to be supplemented with ethanolamine, since psd1Δ psd2Δ cells are strictly auxotrophic for ethanolamine on lactate synthetic minimal medium (1Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type, psd1Δ psd2Δ cells exhibited a significantly reduced recruitment of GFP-Atg8p to the PAS (Fig. 7), which might be due to a decreased rate of autophagy in the mutant. To assess this hypothesis, we followed the selective vacuolar targeting of GFP-Atg8p as described before (32Meiling-Wesse K. Barth H. Voss C. Barmark G. Muren E. Ronne H. Thumm M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, increasing levels of GFP accumulated in wild type cells during starvation. Compared with wild type, psd1Δ psd2Δ cells showed a significantly reduced rate of GFP formation, suggesting that autophagy proceeded at a reduced rate in this mutant. Thus, a certain level of PtdEtn appears to be necessary for the assembly of Atg8p to the PAS to form vesicles for vacuolar transport via autophagy.FIGURE 8Reduced rate of GFP-Atg8p degradation in the vacuole of psd1Δ psd2Δ cells. Cells expressing GFP-Atg8p from a centromeric plasmid under control of the ATG8 promoter were grown to the exponential growth phase in SL medium supplemented with Etn and starved for nitrogen in SL(–N) medium supplemented with Etn for the indicated times. Cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and, after electroblotting on a nitrocellulose membrane, analyzed with an antibody against GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the yeast, PtdEtn was shown to affect various cellular processes, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, targeting of amino acid transporters, cytokinesis, and autophagy (for a review, see Ref. 2Nebauer R. Birner-Grünberger R. Daum G. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 6: 125-168Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we present a screening for additional gene products with a specific requirement for PtdEtn, which identified VPS4 and VPS36. We show that a block in the CPY pathway caused by deletion of VPS4 or VPS36 affected an alternative route to the vacuole (i.e. autophagy/the Cvt pathway) (Fig. 1) and resulted in an increased requirement for PtdEtn for the assembly of Atg8p into membranes of the PAS. This view was supported by the fact that maturation of pAPI was defective in vps4Δ and vps36Δ mutants, although they exhibited wild type levels of PtdEtn and Atg8p. Supplementation with ethanolamine stimulated PtdEtn formation via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and expression of Atg8p, providing the necessary amounts of both components for vesicle formation. Thus, PtdEtn is essential to overcome the autophagy defect in vps4Δ and vps36Δ. The novel aspect of this work is that autophagy/the Cvt pathway and the CPY pathway are linked and balanced through the cellular PtdEtn level. We used the processing of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase API as a model to address this problem. API is synthesized as an inactive precursor and converted to its active form by the vacuolar proteinase A, Pep4p (34Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although some vps mutants are extremely defective in processing CPY and Pep4p, vps4Δ still exhibits substantial maturation of CPY, Pep4p, and proteinase B (35Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Westphal et al. (36Westphal V. Marcusson E.G. Winther J.R. Emr S.D. van den Hazel H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11865-11870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) claimed that an alternative mechanism of Pep4p sorting to the vacuole may exist, which involves a carrier protein (e.g. an integral membrane protein of the vacuole) that does not cycle between the late endosome and the Golgi complex but rather remains trapped in the late endosome or proceeds to the vacuole. The necessity of an alternative, CPY-independent delivery of Pep4p to the vacuole is most likely due to the central role of this enzyme as the primary activating protease for numerous vacuolar proenzymes. In the vps4Δ mutant, Pep4p seems to be present in its active form, although it is not known whether this protease is correctly localized to the vacuole or trapped within the class E organelle. One might assume, however, that a substantial amount of Pep4p reaches the vacuole, where it contributes to the breakdown of Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. As a result, a large portion of pAPI can be correctly processed in vps4Δ and vps36Δ. Increased amounts of PtdEtn facilitating membrane assembly of Atg8p might be required to transport the amount of Pep4p to the vacuole via autophagy/the Cvt pathway, which is necessary to cleave the remaining portion of pAPI in vps4Δ and vps36Δ. PtdEtn dependence of maturation of pAPI in vps4Δ and vps36Δ led us to speculate whether depletion of PtdEtn in general or depletion of the different PtdEtn pools provided by the three PtdEtn biosynthetic pathways had an effect on the transport of pAPI to the vacuole. Our results clearly demonstrate that severe depletion of PtdEtn in the psd1Δ psd2Δ mutant leads to an accumulation of pAPI (see Fig. 6). Thus, it appears to be PtdEtn depletion in general and not the effect of a specific PtdEtn biosynthetic route or pool that leads to defects in pAPI maturation. Because Atg8p expression was not compromised in the psd1Δ psd2Δ mutant, we concluded that the amount of PtdEtn was limiting. This was also reflected in a significant defect in recruitment of GFP-Atg8p to the PAS and a reduced autophagy rate in psd1Δ psd2Δ. Since stimulation of PtdEtn formation via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway rescued the autophagy defect, we assume that a minimum level of this phospholipid is essential for proper function of autophagy. Our experiments, however, do not exclude the possibility that PtdEtn depletion might also lead to a defect in membrane extension around the Cvt vesicles or autophagosomes, to a defect in the fusion of cytosolic vesicles with the vacuole, or to a defect in the breakdown of subvacuolar vesicles by Pep4p. A specific membrane composition may be required for the lysis of Cvt bodies and autophagic bodies. One component that has been shown to be involved in the degradation of vesicles is Cvt17p (37Teter S.A. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Fischer A.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2083-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Specific lipids could even provide the molecular basis for recognition within the vacuole lumen, allowing an alternate vacuolar lipase to distinguish between subvacuolar vesicles destined for degradation and the vacuolar membrane, which must remain intact. A process related to Cvt/autophagy is pexophagy. Recent studies in our laboratory revealed that induction of yeast peroxisomes upon growth on oleate is delayed in strains with unbalanced PtdEtn biosynthesis.3 Upon the shift to glucose, peroxisomes are no longer required and rapidly degraded within the vacuole, either by micropexophagy or macropexophagy. Although these two processes are morphologically distinct, they seem to require the same set of proteins as starvation-induced macroautophagy (reviewed in Ref. 38Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this process is not impaired in PtdEtn depleted strains.3 Thus, although PtdEtn is essential for vesicle formation during Cvt/autophagy, its depletion does not affect pexophagy in the same manner as Cvt/autophagy. In summary, this study underlines the importance of PtdEtn for the cell as a mediator of complex processes. Thus, cellular PtdEtn homeostasis is essential not only to ensure structural integrity of membranes but also through its specific interaction with various components that govern organelle structure and function.

SC also exists in the free form, with innate-like neutralizing properties against pathogens. Free SC consists of five glycosylated variable (V)-type Ig domains (D1–D5), whose structure was determined by x-ray and neutron scattering, ultracentrifugation, and modeling. With a radius of gyration of 3.53–3.63 nm, a length of 12.5 nm, and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.0 S, SC possesses an unexpected compact structure. Constrained scattering modeling based on up to 13,000 trial models shows that SC adopts a J-shaped structure in which D4 and D5 are folded back against D2 and D3. The seven glycosylation sites are located on one side of SC, leaving known IgA-binding motifs free to interact with pIgA. This work represents the first analysis of the three-dimensional structure of full-length free SC and paves the way to a better understanding of the association between SC and its potential ligands, i.e. pIgA and pathogenic-associated motifs.

The mucosal epithelia lining the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts represent the largest surface (400 m2 for the human body) in contact with the external environment (1Brandtzaeg P. APMIS. 1995; 103: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consequently, they are permanently exposed to foreign antigens and must therefore be efficiently protected to prevent possible damage by pathogenic agents (2Lamm M.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 311-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In response to this threat, a major immune defense system is mediated by secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) 5The abbreviations used are: SIgA, secretory immunoglobulin A; SC, secretory component; Ig, immunoglobulin; pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; V, variable type domain. within the lumen (3Nagler-Anderson C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), where SIgA exerts its function of antigen neutralization. IgA is produced locally as polymeric IgA (pIgA), which consists of two or four IgA molecules linked covalently by a J chain (4Johansen F.E. Braathen R. Brandtzaeg P. Am. Assoc. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5185-5192Google Scholar). Subsequent transport of pIgA (and to a lesser extent pentameric IgM) across the epithelium is ensured by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), which is expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. Following cleavage at luminal surfaces, SIgA is released as a complex of pIgA and the cleaved extracellular portion of the pIgR which is termed secretory component (SC). Because secretory IgM can be present in external secretions with an accessory role as a neutralizing antibody, this suggests that SC has a generic antibody-binding ability, being able to bind to both pIgA and pentameric IgM (5Mach J.P. Nature. 1970; 228: 1278-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This selectivity may be required to allow only larger, polymerized antibodies protected by heavily glycosylated SCs to enter the harsh environment of external secretions. SC consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains (D1–D5) and up to seven glycan chains. SC bound to pIgA protects the antibody against proteolytic digestion (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and governs anchoring of SIgA at mucosal surfaces (7Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Free SC is also found in secretions and is now recognized as an active antibacterial participant to protect mucosal surfaces against Helicobacter pylori (8Boren T. Falk P. Roth K.A. Larson G. Normark S. Science. 1993; 262: 1892-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile toxin A (9Dallas S.D. Rolfe R.D. J. Med.

Recombinant human SC produced from transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells behaves identically, and its neutralizing properties rely on the presence of oligosaccharides on SC (12Perrier C. Sprenger N. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14280-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of SC and its glycosylation, only partial information is available on its structure. SC comprises the first 585 residues in pIgR (Fig. 1A) (13Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Savoy L.A. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Jaton J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 410: 443-446Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of rabbit SC domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) indicates that both exhibit the typical features of Ig variable (V)-type superfamily members with seven β-strands A–G and an extra two designated C′ and C″ (14Coyne R. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Corthésy B. Kaufmann M. Phalipon A. Peitsch M. Neutra M. Kraehenbuhl J.P.

A similar topology was determined in the modeling of domains 2 and 3 (D2 and D3) of mouse SC (16Crottet P. Cottet S. Corthésy B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These were confirmed by the crystal structure of D1 of human SC, which revealed a V-type fold (17Hamburger A.E. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1925-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). So far, the three-dimensional domain arrangement of full-length SC has not been considered, even though this is essential to appreciate molecular mechanisms that are involved in mucosal immunity. Its high glycosylation and the presence of long interdomain linkers suggest that SC may be too flexible to be crystallized intact. In a situation such as this, x-ray and neutron scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation in combination with constrained modeling techniques will reveal the domain arrangement of SC (18Perkins S.J. Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Chamberlain D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we determine a solution structure for recombinant human SC produced in CHO cells. We show that SC forms a compact domain arrangement, and this structure rationalizes many of the biological roles of both free and bound SC for the first time. Recombinant Secretory Component and Its Fragments—CHO cells producing human SC (7Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) were cultured in suspension in CHO-S-SFM II medium (Invitrogen) using CELLine 350 bioreactors (Integra-Biosciences). Supernatants (8 ml) were collected twice a week, and immediately chromatographed onto a 1.6-cm × 1-meter long Superdex-200 column in PBS. Fractions containing human SC as confirmed by immunoblotting were pooled and filtered through 0.22-μm cartridges. Filtered aliquots were stored at 4 °C in PBS (116 mm NaCl, 10.4 mm Na2HPO4, 3.2 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) prior to use for scattering and ultracentrifugation. Cleaved SC fragments were obtained from purified SC samples that were stored for at least 6 months at 4 °C. Separation was performed by chromatography onto a 1.6-cm × 1-m Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS. Pools of fractions containing fragments D1–D3 and D4–D5 were concentrated using Amicon Ultra (30-kDa molecular mass cut-off) and Centricon YM-10 (10-kDa molecular mass cut-off) filters (Millipore), respectively. Further purification of fragments D1–D3 and D4–D5 was achieved by repeating chromatography onto the Superdex-200 column. To identify the SC cleavage site, N-terminal sequencing of purified D4–D5 from a polyvinylidene difluoride blot was performed by Edman degradation at Alta Biosciences (University of Birmingham, UK). For the x-ray scattering and ultracentrifugation experiments, samples were recovered in PBS. For neutron scattering, the buffer was Dulbecco's PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5), made up in 100% 2H2O. The neutron samples were dialyzed at 6 °C into this 100% 2H2O buffer for 36 h with four buffer changes. The two buffer densities in H2O solvent were predicted to be 1.00485 g/ml and 1.00543 g/ml, respectively, from these compositions using SEDNTERP. The SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 concentrations were determined using absorption coefficients of 12.3, 7.1, and 18.7 (1%, 280 nm, and 1-cm path length) that were calculated from its composition by assuming the presence of seven biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides Man3GlcNAc4Gal2NeuNAc2 (see Fig. 1) (19Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume v¯ for SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 was calculated to be 0.717, 0.717, and 0.718 ml/g, respectively, from their compositions (19Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular masses for SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 were 79.6, 45.5, and 34.1 kDa, respectively, their unhydrated volumes were 99.7, 56.9, and 42.7 nm3, respectively, and their hydrated volumes were 132.2, 75.5, and 56.7 nm3, respectively (assuming 0.3 g of H2O/g of glycoprotein). X-ray and Neutron Scattering and Ultracentrifugation Data—X-ray scattering data were obtained in two sessions on the Beamline ID02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), operating at 6.03 GeV (20Narayanan T. Diat O. Bösecke P. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 2001; 467–468: 1005-1009Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To reduce the incident flux, the experiments were performed in 16-bunch and 4-bunch mode with storage ring currents ranging between 92 and 53 mA (SC) and 4-bunch mode with currents ranging between 41 and 23 mA (D1–D3 and D4–D5). The sample-to-detector distance of 3.0 m, yielded a Q range from 0.07 to 2.1 nm–1 (where Q = 4π sin θ/λ; 2θ = scattering angle; λ = wavelength). Samples were measured at concentrations between 0.62 and to 2.0 mg/ml (SC), 0.39 to 1.6 mg/ml (D1–D3), and 0.40 to 0.73 mg/ml (D4–D5). Data were acquired using five or ten time frames of 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 s to establish the absence of radiation damage. Neutron scattering data for SC were collected in one session in a Q range between 0.02 and 1.93 nm–1 on Instrument LOQ at the ISIS facility at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory, Didcot, UK (21Heenan R.K. Penfold J. King S.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1140-1147Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The proton beam current was 172–173 μA, and acquisition times were 1–2 h for concentrations between 0.62 and 2.0 mg/ml, measured at 15 °C. Other details, including calibrations and data reduction, the Guinier analyses to determine the radius of gyration RG and the radius of gyration of the cross-sectional structure RXS, and the calculation of the distance distribution function P(r) using GNOM for which Q ranged between 0.08 and 2.06 nm–1, are described previously (22Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 20 °C on a Beckman XL-I instrument, equipped with an AnTi50 rotor. Sedimentation equilibrium data sets for SC between 0.20 and 2.50 mg/ml were acquired over 45 h with column heights of 2 mm at rotor speeds of 8,000, 11,000, 14,000, 18,000, and 23,000 rpm, until equilibrium had been reached at each speed as shown by the perfect overlay of runs measured at 5-h intervals. Sedimentation velocity data for SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 were acquired over 16 h at rotor speeds of 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, and 35,000 rpm (and 42,000 rpm for D1–D3 and D4–D5) with column heights of 12 mm. SC was studied at five concentrations from 0.30 to 2.50 mg/ml. D1–D3 and D4–D5 were each studied at two concentrations of 0.39–1.6 mg/ml and 0.40–0.73 mg/ml respectively. DCDT+ g(s*) time-derivative analyses and SED-FIT Lamm equation fits based on the non-interacting species model were performed as previously described (23Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Constrained Modeling of SC—SC corresponds to residues 19–603 of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (SwissProt code P01833). The start and end of D2–D5 is defined as residues 1–104 in Fig. 1. The homology modeling of D2–D5 employed MODELLER v7 (24Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) and was based on a topological sequence alignment with the D1 crystal structure identified using BLASTP (PDB code 1xed) (17Hamburger A.E. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1925-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The models were structurally validated using PROCHECK. Seven biantennary oligosaccharide chains Man3GlcNAc4Gal2NeuNAc2 were incorporated in extended conformations in the D1–D5 models (25Boehm M.K. Perkins S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The first SC residue Lys was added to the D1 crystal structure using MODELLER v7. To model the other interdomain linkers, residues 109–116, 219–221, 324–335, 440–446, and 543–585 (Fig. 1B) were created in extended β-strand conformations using INSIGHT II 98.0 with BIOPOLYMER, DISCOVER, HOMOLOGY, and DELPHI modules (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), and 5000 randomized conformations for each were generated using DISCOVER3 (22Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Linker length constraints of 95–100% were applied to generate sufficient conformational variability when needed. Full SC models were created by superimpositions of the domains and the linkers. Each SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 model was converted into Debye spheres to calculate the x-ray and neutron scattering curves (22Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A cube side length of 0.542 nm in combination with a cutoff of 4 atoms consistently produced sphere models within 95% of the total unhydrated volume of 99.7, 56.9, and 43.8 nm3, respectively, calculated from their compositions. Hence the optimal totals of unhydrated spheres were 626, 268, and 353 respectively, which were then hydrated. The number of spheres N in the unhydrated and hydrated models after grid transformation was used to assess steric overlap between the D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 domains. The models were assessed by calculation of the RG and RXS values in the same Q ranges used for the experimental Guinier fits. Models that passed these RG and RXS filters were ranked using the R-factor goodness-of-fit agreement. A flat background correction of 2.7% of I(0) was applied to the final neutron scattering curve fits in Fig. 8 to allow for a uniform incoherent scattering of residual protons in the sample. Other details, including those of calibration studies used to validate this approach, are given elsewhere (22Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Perkins S.J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients s20,w0 were calculated directly from the hydrated SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 sphere models using the GENDIA and HYDRO programs (22Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Control calculations of s20,w0 were performed using HYDROPRO shell modeling directly from the molecular models for SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 (27Sun Z. Almogren A. Furtado P.B. Chowdhury B. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ten best SC α-carbon co-ordinate models were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 2OCW. Characterization of SC and Its Fragments—In SC, sequence similarities between D1 and the other four SC domains (D2–D5) show that all belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V)-type classification (Fig. 1A). For clarification, the domains and interdomain linkers are depicted in Fig. 1B. As glycosylation and proper disulfide bonding are essential features of SC, we chose to produce the protein in CHO cells, which yields SC that is indistinguishable when compared with colostrum SC (12Perrier C. Sprenger N. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14280-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31456-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human SC resulted in a major band at an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa when analyzed by silver staining and immunodetection (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). This molecular mass agrees well with the sequence-derived value of 79.6 kDa. Upon storage for several months at 4 °C, two additional bands at 45 and 30 kDa appear (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). In Western blots, detection with polyclonal antisera specific for D1 and D5 established that the bands at 45 and 30 kDa represent cleavage of full-length SC into D1–D3 and D4–D5 fragments. This was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of fragment D4–D5 that identified the sequence SPTVVKGVAG corresponding to the beginning of domain 4 and indicating cleavage between Arg336 and Ser337. The PeptideCutter web tool (available from the ExPASy server) suggested that the enzymatic cleavage may be caused by one of trypsin, thrombin, or other related proteases. This unexpected observation provided us with three different polypeptides that were used to generate the results presented below. X-ray and Neutron Scattering—X-ray scattering identified the domain arrangements in SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 at concentrations between 0.40 and 2.7 mg/ml (see “Materials and Methods”). Because no radiation damage was detectable, the ten time frames of each acquisition were averaged for analyses. SDS-PAGE analyses before and after runs showed that, although SC and D4–D5 generally remained intact, further cleavages occurred in D1–D3 to give single domain fragments as well as the three-domain fragment. All the SC and D4–D5 results below correspond to samples shown to be intact by SDS-PAGE before and after the experiment. At low Q values, Guinier analyses of ln I(Q) against Q2 resulted in linear plots for SC and its two fragments, yielding the radius of gyration (RG) (Fig. 2, A, E, and F). At larger Q values, analyses of ln I(Q)Q against Q2 yielded the RG of the cross-section (RXS). For SC, a mean x-ray RG of 3.53 (± 0.03) nm and mean RXS of 1.76 (± 0.08) nm were recorded from seven runs (Table 1). Another SC sample gave a similar mean x-ray RG of 3.64 (± 0.17) nm and RXS of 1.63 (± 0.12) nm from six runs. A partially cleaved sample with ∼33% SC, 33% D1–D3, and 33% D4–D5 showed a small increase in the mean RG to 3.77 (± 0.17) nm and a small decrease in the mean RXS to 1.60 (± 0.61) nm. From five runs, the partially cleaved sample of D1–D3 showed an apparent RG of 3.44 (± 0.27) nm and an apparent RXS of 1.07 (± 0.07) nm (supplemental Fig. S1). From five runs, D4–D5 was found to have a mean RG of 3.16 (± 0.04) nm and a mean RXS of 1.11 (± 0.08) nm (supplemental Fig. S1). The Guinier analyses were confirmed by the I(0)/c values, which are proportional to molecular masses, where c is the concentration (18Perkins S.J. Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Chamberlain D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The observed I(0)/c values were in the ratio of 1:0.30:0.53, respectively, relative to Lupolen. The sequence-derived molecular mass ratios were 1:0.57:0.43 in that order. I(0)/c for D1–D3 was lower than expected, which is attributed to its cleavage, whereas that for D4–D5 was in fair agreement with the sequence.TABLE 1Experimental x-ray and neutron scattering and ultracentrifugation analyses for SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5ProteinGuinier analysesP(r) analysesAUC analysesRGRXSRG/R0L from RG and RXSL from I(0) and [I(Q)Q]Q→0RGMLs20,w0 (SEDFIT)s20,w0 (DCDT+)f/fonmnmSSC (x-ray)3.53 ± 0.031.76 ± 0.081.4410.611.93.66 ± 0.193.8 ± 0.213.04.24.0 (int)1.55SC (x-ray)3.64 ± 0.171.63 ± 0.121.4911.3NAaNA, data not available.3.71 ± 0.12NANA3.9 (abs)SC (neutron)3.63 ± 0.281.30 ± 0.10NA11.713.13.73 ± 0.173.212.0D1-D3 (x-ray)3.44 ± 0.27bApparent (see text).1.07 ± 0.07bApparent (see text).1.6911.39.13.52 ± 0.272.912.03.1NA1.42D4-D5 (x-ray)3.16 ± 0.041.11 ± 0.081.7010.210.83.15 ± 0.182.710.02.42.4 (int) 2.3 (abs)1.48a NA, data not available.b Apparent (see text). Open table in a new tab Interestingly SC appeared more compact than either D1–D3 or D4–D5. Shape information was determined from the anisotropy ratio, RG/RO (where RO is the RG value of a sphere of equal volume to that of the hydrated glycoprotein). The ratios were 1.44–1.49, 1.69, and 1.70 for SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 in that order (Table 1). Because RG/RO for globular proteins is close to 1.28 (29Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), all three proteins are elongated. Assuming that the proteins possess cylindrical shapes, the lengths of SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 were calculated from its RG and RXS values to be 10.6–11.3, 11.3, and 10.2 nm, respectively. From the I(0) and [I(Q)Q]Q→0 values, the lengths were calculated to be 11.9, 9.1, and 10.8 nm, respectively (Table 1). Despite the cleavage in the D1–D3 sample, the similarity of these three lengths is explained by postulating that SC is folded back upon itself. If the end-to-end length of the SC domains is taken to be 3.7 nm from the D1 crystal structure (17Hamburger A.E. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1925-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5 are predicted to be 18.5, 11.1, and 7.4 nm long if they are fully extended but with no linkers. The disparity between the observed SC length of 10.6–11.9 nm and the 18.5 nm prediction shows that SC must be folded back. That D4–D5 (Table 1) is observed to be longer than the predicted value may result from the 42 C-terminal residues in SC (Fig. 1A). The observed lengths for D1–D3 are in fair agreement with the predicted length of 11.1 nm. Neutron scattering data for SC confirm the x-ray RG values (Table 1). These were obtained as a control of radiation damage by x-rays, because these effects are absent in neutron scattering. The neutron data are complementary in that the hydration shell surrounding SC is not detectable (26Perkins S.J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The high negative protein-solvent scattering contrast acts as a control of any scattering inhomogeneity effects caused by the high proportion of carbohydrate in SC. The mean of three RG and RXS values for SC were 3.63 (± 0.28) nm and 1.30 (± 0.10) nm, respectively (Fig. 2). The decrease in the neutron RXS compared with the x-ray RXS value is attributed to the absence of hydration effects on the cross-section of SC (25Boehm M.K. Perkins S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The length of SC from the neutron RG and RXS was 11.7 nm and from I(0) and [I(Q)Q]Q→0 was 13.1 nm, which is consistent with the x-ray determined lengths. The neutron data gives molecular masses from the expression I(0)/c × 9 × 105 (22Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The observed I(0)/c of 0.087 (± 0.009) resulted in 78 (± 8) kDa, which is close to the sequence-derived value of 79.6 kDa. The transformation of I(Q) into the distance distribution function, P(r) confirmed that SC has a folded back conformation in solution. The P(r) curves for SC (x-rays and neutrons) and for D1–D3 and D4–D5 (x-rays) were reproducible with single maxima (Fig. 3). The RG from these were 3.66 (± 0.19) nm and 3.71 (± 0.12) nm (two SC x-ray samples), 3.73 (± 0.17) nm (SC neutrons), 3.52 (± 0.27) nm (D1–D3), and 3.15 (± 0.18) nm (D4–D5), all of which were consistent with the Guinier analyses (Table 1). The maximum, M, corresponds to the most frequently occurring interatomic distance. These were 3.8 (± 0.2) nm and 3.2 nm, respectively, for the x-ray and neutron data for SC and were slightly smaller at 2.9 nm and 2.7 nm for D1–D3 and D4–D5, respectively. The length, L, is determined when P(r) becomes zero at large r values and is not dependent on shape assumptions. For SC, L was determined to be 13 (± 1) nm (x-rays) and 12 (± 1) nm (neutrons). For D1–D3 and D4–D5, L was determined to be 12 (± 1) nm and 10 (± 1) nm, respectively. Although the D1–D3 analysis may be affected by cleaved products, this analysis will reveal the maximum length of the intact protein as any cleavage products will be shorter in length. These lengths were consistent with the Guinier-derived analyses (Table 1). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The oligomerization of SC at concentrations between 0.2 and 2.5 mg/ml was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to show that this is monomeric. Assuming a single species was present, good curve fits with small random residuals were obtained (Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE analyses before and after runs confirmed that any SC cleavage was not detectable. A small decrease in the molecular mass of SC was observed with increasing rotor speed, which is attributable to sample polydispersity (30McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA1993: 9-12Google Scholar). This is most likely to result from heterogeneous occupation at the seven N-linked glycosylation sites, and/or any cleavage products (Fig. 1). Thus the presence of seven bi-antennary oligosaccharides would give a molecular mass of 79,600 Da, whereas seven tetra-antennary ones would give 88,800 Da. In addition, the molecular masses slightly increased on dilution (lower panels, Fig. 4). This was attributed to decreased interactions between SC molecules at lower concentrations, because any oligomerization would result in a decrease in molecular masses on dilution. Regressions resulted in molecular masses of 79,500 (± 2,900) Da (interference) and 81,600 (± 5,500) Da (absorbance) at zero concentration. These agree well with the sequence-derived molecular mass. The equilibrium data therefore showed that all seven putative glycosylation sites are filled. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,w0, monitors the macromolecular elongation, independently from RG. Sedimentation velocity was used to examine SC, D1–D3, and D4–D5, as well as SC that was cleaved into an equimolar mixture of the three forms, by incubating this at room temperature. The advantage of SEDFIT c(s) distribution plots is that these identify the s20,w0 values of any species present in each sample (Table 1), hence these values are independent of degradation effects. All the boundary fits showed good agreements (Fig. 5, A–D). The c(s) plots showed that SC sedimented as a single species at 4.2 S, whereas major species were seen at 3.1 S for D1–D3 and 2.4 S for D4–D5 (Fig. 5, E–G). Th"
https://openalex.org/W2114121049,"The α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor (AMPAR) is an ionotropic glutamate receptor that governs most of excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons. In vitro biochemical assay has shown that calpain, a Ca2+-activated protease, can cleave AMPAR GluR1 subunits. Our physiological study found that calpain, which was activated by prolonged stimulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (100 μm, 10 min), caused a substantial suppression of AMPAR currents in cortical neurons. Since the phosphorylation sites of GluR1 by several protein kinases are located in close proximity to the calpain cleavage sites, we investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the susceptibility of GluR1 to calpain cleavage. Interestingly, we found that the calpain regulation of AMPAR currents was diminished by inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) but was augmented by inhibition of protein phosphatase 1/2A (PP1/2A). In agreement with this, in vitro assay showed that the calpain-induced proteolytic cleavage of GluR1 C-terminal fusion protein was strongly potentiated by adding the purified active CaMKII, and GluR1 phosphorylated at Ser831 by CaMKII is much more sensitive to calpain cleavage. Taken together, our data suggest that calpain activation suppresses AMPA receptor currents via proteolytic cleavage of GluR1 subunits, and the susceptibility of AMPARs to calpain cleavage is determined by the phosphorylation state of GluR1 subunits, which is mediated by CaMKII-PP1/2A activity.

The AMPA receptor is a tetramer composed of subunits coded by GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4 subunits (1.Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 2.Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2003; 40: 361-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that AMPA receptors are regulated by several mechanisms. One is to change the phosphorylation state of AMPARs by protein kinases/phosphatases (3.Yan Z. Hsieh-Wilson L. Feng J. Tomizawa K. Allen P.B. Fienberg A.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4.Cai X. Gu Z. Zhong P. Ren Y. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36553-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Another one is to change the trafficking of AMPARs, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of functional AMPARs located at the synaptic membrane (1.Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical assay also show that AMPAR GluR1 subunit is a potential substrate of the Ca2+-activated protease calpain (5.Bi X. Chang V. Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A. Baudry M. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6.Bi X. Chen J. Dang S. Wenthold R.J. Tocco G. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that AMPAR function could be regulated by another mechanism, i.e. calpain-mediated proteolysis. As a Ca2+-dependent protease, calpain has been implicated in many pathological conditions when calcium homeostasis is disrupted, such as stroke and epilepsy (7.Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 8.Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). Calpain cleaves many targets, including ion channels such as AMPAR and NMDAR subunits (5.Bi X. Chang V. Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A. Baudry M. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21588-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal proteins like MAP2 (11.Fischer I. Romano-Clarke G. Grynspan F. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and signaling molecules such as calcineurin (12.Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Matsui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4929-4940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that the calpain-mediated proteolysis is often affected by the phosphorylation state of the substrates. For example, PKA phosphorylation of tau, a microtubule-associated protein, protects tau from calpain truncation (13.Litersky J.M. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1563-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR NR2 subunits prevents calpain-mediated cleavage of their C-terminal domains (14.Bi R. Rong Y. Bernard A. Khrestchatisky M. Baudry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26477-26483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation reduces calpain-induced truncation of GluR1 subunits, does not affect calpain proteolysis of NR2B subunits, but facilitates calpain cleavage of NR2A subunits (15.Rong Y. Lu X. Bernard A. Khrestchatisky M. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The putative sites of calpain-mediated truncation of GluR1 subunits are at residues N833 and R837 (5.Bi X. Chang V. Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A. Baudry M. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6.Bi X. Chen J. Dang S. Wenthold R.J. Tocco G. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites of GluR1 by several protein kinases are located in close proximity to the calpain cleavage sites, including PKA (Ser845), CaMKII and PKC (Ser831) (16.Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 17.Mammen A.L. Kameyama K. Roche K.W. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32528-32533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Particularly, CaMKII is a major protein enriched in the postsynaptic density (18.Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 19.Kelly P.T. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Activation of CaMKII can induce the increased AMPAR channel activity via GluR1 phosphorylation at Ser831 (16.Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 17.Mammen A.L. Kameyama K. Roche K.W. Huganir R.L. J. Biol.

Scannevin R.H. Huganir R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6008-6017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent study has found that a prolonged (10-min) application of NMDA (100 μm) to cortical neurons induces the activation of calpain, which leads to the proteolysis of GluR1 subunits and the suppression AMPAR-mediated currents (9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the calpain regulation of AMPARs is happening in excitotoxic conditions like ischemia in vivo (9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of GluR1 phosphorylation in calpain regulation of AMPAR functions. We found that CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1 determines the susceptibility of AMPARs to calpain-mediated cleavage. Acute Dissociation Procedure and Primary Neuronal Culture−Cortical neurons from 3–4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were acutely dissociated as what we described previously (10.Wu H.Y. Yuen E.Y. Lu Y.F.

The frontal cortical areas were dissected and digested in an oxygenated chamber consisted of papain (0.4 mg/ml; Calbiochem) for 40 min at room temperature. Following washing, the tissue was mechanically dissociated with a graded series of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. The isolated cells were then dispersed into a 35-mm Lux Petri dish positioned on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope. Rat cortical cultures from E18 embryos were prepared with procedures similar to what we used previously (22.Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Whole Cell Recordings−Whole cell recordings of ion channel currents in acutely dissociated neurons employed standard voltage clamp techniques as what we described previously (10.Wu H.Y. Yuen E.Y.

The external solution contains (in mm): 127 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 BaCl2, 12 glucose, 0.001 tetrodotoxin, pH 7.3–7.4, 300–305 mosM. Recording electrodes (2–4 megaohms) were filled with the following internal solution (in mm): 170 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4 MgCl2, 40 HEPES, 0.5 BAPTA, 12 phosphocreatine, 3 Na2ATP, and 0.5 Na2GTP, pH 7.2–3, 265–270 mosm. Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments 200B patch clamp amplifier that was controlled and monitored with an IBM PC running pCLAMP (v.8) with a DigiData 1320 series interface (Axon instruments). Following seal rupture, series resistance (4–10 mΩ) was compensated (70–90%). AMPAR-mediated currents were recorded with glutamate (1 mm) or AMPA (100 μm) application for 2 s every 30 s in cells (held at -60 mV) exposed to an Mg2+-containing solution (to block NMDAR activation). During prolonged NMDA or glutamate treatment, NMDA (100 μm) or glutamate (100 or 500 μm) was continuously perfused for 10 min in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, 20 μm glycine, and Mg2+-free external solution. Drugs were applied with a gravity-fed “sewer pipe” system. The array of application capillaries (∼150 μm inner diameter) was positioned a few hundred microns from the cell under study. Solution changes were effected by the SF-77B fast-step solution stimulus delivery device (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Data were analyzed with AxoGraph (Axon instruments) and Kaleidagraph (Albeck Software). Second messenger reagents KN-93, KN-92, autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, okadaic acid, microsystin, cyclosporine A, myristoylated PKI14–22, PKI5–24, bisindolylmaleimide I, and calphostin C (Calbiochem) were made up as concentrated stocks in water or Me2SO and stored at -20 °C. Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately prior to use. The CS peptide contains the functional sequence of TIPPKYR that is critical for inhibiting calpain activity (23.Maki M. Bagci H. Hamaguchi K. Ueda M. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18866-18869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To make the CS peptide membrane permeable, we tethered it with 11 polyarginines, namely 11R-CS. Previous studies have shown that the 11R-CS peptide is a potent, membrane-permeable and specific inhibitor of calpain (10.Wu H.Y. Yuen E.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Yan Z. Tomizawa K. J. Biol.

Small Interfering RNA−To suppress the endogenous calpain expression, we transfected cortical cultures with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets to the regulatory subunit of μ-calpain mRNA. The calpain siRNA oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) contained three sense strands: 5′-CCACGUAGUCAUUACUCUA-3′, 5′-GACUAUCGGUAGCCAUGAA-3′, and 5′-GUACCCAGCUUCCCAAUCA-3′. The α-CaMKII siRNA oligonucleotide (Ambion, Austin, TX) was 5′-GGAGUAUGCUGCCAAGAUUtt-3′ (sense). Transfection of siRNA was performed as what we described previously (22.Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The siRNA was co-transfected with enhanced GFP into cultured cortical neurons (8 days in vitro) using the Lipofectamine 2000 method. Electrophysiological experiments were performed in GFP-positive neurons after 2–3 days of transfection. Immunocytochemistry−Cortical cultures (11 days in vitro) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After incubating in 5% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific staining, neurons were incubated with the anti-calpain polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and a TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the coverslips were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were detected using a 60× objective with a cooled CCD camera mounted on a Nikon microscope. All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed with identical parameters. Western Blotting−After treatment, cultured cortical neurons (14 days in vitro) were lysed with the lysis buffer containing: 1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and supernatant fractions were incubated with primary antibodies. Antibodies against the N terminus of GluR1 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GluR2 (1:500, Chemicon), the C terminus of GluR1 (1:500, last 15 aa, Upstate Biotechnology) and GluR2/3 (1:500, aa 864–883, Upstate Biotechnology), α-spectrin (1:5000, Chemicon) and GABAARβ2/3 subunits (1:500, Upstate Biotechnology) were used. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), positive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was obtained from densitometric measurements of immunoreactive bands on films. Calpain Cleavage Assay−The C terminus of GluR1 (residues 809–889) was cloned into pQE-80 (Qiagen. Inc.) as described previously (24.Barria A. Derkach V. Soderling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32727-32730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). GluR1 C-terminal mutants (S831A, S831D, S831E, and S845A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The fusion protein was tethered with 6 consecutive His tags and a hemagglutinin tag at the N terminus and a FLAG tag at the C terminus. After expression and purification, the fusion protein was incubated overnight at room temperature in a phosphorylation buffer containing (mm): 50 Tris, pH 7.4, 10 MgCl2, 5 MnCl2, 0.001 Na2VO4. GluR1 was phosphorylated by adding CaMKII (0.6 μg/ml, Calbiochem), CaM (30 μg/ml, Calbiochem), ATP (500 μm), and CaCl2 (0.5 mm) for 5 min at 37 °C. Non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated GluR1 was incubated with calpain I (5 units/ml, Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 in each tube. Samples were denatured with SDS-sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Activation of Calpain Produces a Sustained Suppression of AMPAR Currents in Cortical Neurons−Our previous study has shown that calpain is activated in cortical neurons by prolonged NMDAR stimulation (9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Wu H.Y. Yuen E.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Yan Z. Tomizawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21588-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of calpain in AMPAR-mediated currents in neurons, we performed cellular knockdown of calpain in cortical cultures by transfecting a siRNA directed toward the regulatory subunit of μ-calpain. As shown in the immunocytochemical images (Fig. 1A), calpain, which is enriched at soma and dendrites of cortical neurons, was markedly suppressed in calpain siRNA-transfected neurons, while the staining of MAP2 (a dendritic marker) was unchanged. Since the calpain siRNA has caused efficient and specific down-regulation of calpain expression, it is likely to cause functional inactivation of calpain. Then we examined the regulation of AMPAR currents by calpain, which is activated by prolonged NMDA treatment, in cortical neurons transfected with the calpain siRNA. Whole cell AMPAR-mediated currents was elicited by glutamate (1 mm) application in an Mg2+-containing solution as what we described before (4.Cai X. Gu Z. Zhong P. Ren Y. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36553-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). No difference in AMPAR current density (pA/pF) was detected in neurons transfected with the calpain siRNA or a scrambled siRNA (calpain siRNA: 28.4 ± 2.3; scrambled siRNA: 27.3 ± 2.2). As shown in Fig. 1B, when endogenous calpain was activated by prolonged NMDA treatment (100 μm, 10 min), AMPAR currents was substantially reduced in neurons transfected with a scrambled siRNA (48.2 ± 2.0%, n = 7, Fig. 1C) or GFP alone (44.7 ± 1.5%, n = 9, Fig. 1C), while this effect was significantly abolished in neurons transfected with the calpain siRNA (10.2 ± 2.1%, n = 6, Fig. 1C). These data suggest that calpain, which is activated by prolonged stimulation of NMDA receptors, down-regulates AMPAR function in cortical neurons. Calpain Activation Causes the Proteolysis of AMPAR GluR1 Subunit in Cortical Neurons−To provide further evidence to complement our electrophysiological studies, we performed biochemical experiments to test whether overstimulation of NMDARs can indeed activate calpain and induce the cleavage of AMPAR subunits. Cultured cortical neurons transfected with the calpain siRNA or a scrambled siRNA were treated with glutamate (500 μm) or NMDA (100 μm) for 10 min, and then washed in culture medium for 10 min before collection. Antibodies against the N termini of GluR1 or GluR2 were used to detect both cleaved and uncleaved subunit, while those against the C termini of GluR1 or GluR2/3 were used to detect the full-length (uncleaved) subunit. As shown in Fig. 2A, in cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA, prolonged glutamate or NMDA treatment led to a dramatically reduced level of GluR1 subunit. The same stimulation cleaved α-spectrin (240 kDa), a well defined substrate of calpain, into two fragments (150 and 145 kDa). However, in cells transfected with the calpain siRNA, prolonged glutamate or NMDA treatment failed to reduce GluR1 levels and cleave α-spectrin. GluR2/3 subunit or GABAAR β2/3 subunit was not affected by prolonged glutamate or NMDA treatment in all the transfected cells. As summarized in Fig. 2B, GluR1 was significantly diminished by prolonged glutamate or NMDA treatment in scrambled siRNA-transfected neurons (Glu, 39 ± 5% of control; NMDA, 44 ± 6% of control, n = 5; p < 0.001, ANOVA) but not in calpain siRNA-transfected neurons (Glu, 98 ± 6% of control; NMDA, 95 ± 5% of control, n = 5). The GluR2 level was unaltered. These results suggest that calpain activated by prolonged stimulation of NMDA receptors induces the specific proteolysis of GluR1 subunits, which could account for the down-regulation of AMPAR currents. CaMKII Phosphorylation of GluR1 Affects the Calpain Regulation of AMPAR Currents−The putative sites of calpain-mediated truncation of GluR1 subunit are at C-terminal residues Asn833 and Arg837 (5.Bi X. Chang V. Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A. Baudry M. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These sites are in close proximity to PKA phosphorylation site (Ser845) and CaMKII phosphorylation site (Ser831) on GluR1 subunit (17.Mammen A.L. Kameyama K. Roche K.W. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32528-32533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 25.McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 26.Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). To test whether the phosphorylation state of GluR1 subunit alters the susceptibility to calpain proteolysis, we applied various agents that selectively inhibit these kinases. As shown in Fig. 3A, bath application of the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (20 μm) substantially blocked the reduction of AMPAR currents by prolonged NMDA treatment (8.6 ± 3.9%; n = 7, Fig. 3B), while the inactive analog KN-92 failed to do so (44.6 ± 4.1%; n = 5, Fig. 3B). Dialysis with autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (5 μm), another mechanistically different CaMKII inhibitor, also significantly attenuated the effect of prolonged NMDA treatment on AMPAR currents (7.6 ± 3.5%, n = 5, Fig. 3B). Moreover, in the presence of KN-93, prolonged NMDA treatment had a substantially smaller effect on AMPAR-excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude (7.9 ± 2.6%, n = 7), compared with control cells (58.6 ± 3.9%, n = 9) in cortical slices (data not shown). To further assess the involvement of CaMKII in calpain regulation of AMPARs, we suppressed the endogenous CaMKII level in cultured cortical neurons by introducing a siRNA directed against α-CaMKII (22.Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and tested the effect of prolonged NMDA treatment in these cultures. Our previous study has reported that the CaMKII siRNA specifically and efficiently suppressed CaMKII expression in GFP-positive neurons (22.Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). No difference in AMPAR current density (pA/pF) was found in neurons transfected with GFP alone or CaMKII siRNA (GFP, 19.0 ± 3.5; CaMKII siRNA, 19.6 ± 2.2). However, the effect of prolonged NMDA treatment on AMPAR currents was profoundly attenuated in GFP-positive neurons transfected with CaMKII siRNA (9.1 ± 1.3%, n = 8, Fig. 3, C and D), compared with control cells transfected with GFP alone (41.2 ± 1.5%, n = 6, Fig. 3, C and D) or cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (43.3 ± 3.2%, n = 4, Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that CaMKII is involved in modifying the effect of calpain on AMPA receptors. How does the suppression of CaMKII activity attenuate the calpain effect on AMPAR functions? Several potential mechanisms may underlie this observation. First, inhibition of CaMKII may reduce calpain activity, which results in diminished AMPAR cleavage. To test this, we compared the proteolysis of α-spectrin, a good indicator of calpain activity (27.Vanderklish P. Saido T.C. Gall C. Arai A. Lynch G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), in cells treated with glutamate in the absence or presence of CaMKII inhibitors. We found that application of glutamate (500 μm, 10 min) induced a similar breakdown of α-spectrin with or without KN-93 treatment (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of CaMKII does not affect calpain activity. Another possible mechanism is that suppressing CaMKII activity directly affects AMPAR channel properties. However, we found that bath application of KN-93 (20 μm) alone did not alter AMPAR currents throughout the entire recording (Fig. 3E). Moreover, after establishing the reduction of AMPAR currents by prolonged NMDA treatment, subsequent application of KN-93 failed to alter this effect (Fig. 3F). Phosphorylation of GluR1 by CaMKII at Ser831 Affects the Calpain Cleavage of GluR1−Next, we performed in vitro calpain cleavage assay to confirm the effect of CaMKII phosphorylation on the susceptibility of GluR1 to calpain cleavage. We generated a GluR1 fusion protein by tethering hemagglutinin to GluR1 C terminus (aa 809–889). This fusion protein includes the calpain cleavage site aa 833–834 and aa 837–838 (5.Bi X. Chang V. Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A. Baudry M. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, application of purified calpain (5 units/ml, 30 min, in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+) cleaved the 13-kDa GluR1 fusion protein into two fragments (6 and 7 kDa), which was significantly blocked by the specific calpain inhibitor 11R-CS (10 μm). Moreover, the calpain cleavage of GluR1 was markedly augmented by adding the purified active CaMKII (0.6 μg/ml), which was prevented by adding the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (20 μm). Summary data (Fig. 4B) indicate that CaMKII increased the calpain cleavage of GluR1 by 3.1 ± 0.3 fold (n = 3). There results provide direct evidence showing that CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1 increases the sensitivity of GluR1 to calpain proteolysis. To further confirm that it is the CaMKII phosphorylation site, Ser831, that determines the sensitivity of GluR1 to calpain cleavage, we generated the GluR1 C-term fusion proteins with mutations at S831. Ser831 was mutated to alanine to represent the non-phosphorylatable form (S831A), and Ser831 was mutated to aspartic acid or glutamic acid to represent the phosphomematic form (S831D, S831E). To examine the role of Ser845, the PKA phosphorylation site, the GluR1 C-terminal fusion protein with Ser845 mutated to alanine (S845A), was used. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, adding active CaMKII significantly increased the calpain cleavage of GluR1 C-terminal fusion protein (3.0 ± 0.3-fold increase, n = 4) but failed to enhance the calpain cleavage of GluR1 mutant S831A (0.07 ± 0.01-fold increase, n = 3). In the absence of CaMKII, the effect of calpain on the cleavage of GluR1 mutant S831D or S831E was significantly bigger (S831D, 3.5 ± 0.4-fold increase; S831E, 3.0 ± 0.1 fold increase, n = 3, compared with control). Adding CaMKII did not further enhance the calpain cleavage of GluR1 mutant S831D or S831E. Moreover, CaMKII significantly enhanced the calpain cleavage of GluR1 mutant S845A (3.1 ± 0.1 fold increase, n = 3). These results suggest that GluR1 phosphorylated at Ser831, but not Ser845, is much more sensitive to calpain proteolysis. Changing Protein Phosphatase Activity Affects the Effect of Calpain on AMPAR Currents−Since inhibiting CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1 diminished the calpain modulation of AMPARs, we then examined whether enhancing GluR1 phosphorylation would augment the calpain effect. To do this, we examined the effect of prolonged NMDA treatment on AMPAR currents in cells treated with protein phosphatase inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 5A, dialysis with the PP1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid (1 μm) potentiated the reducing effect of NMDA (100 μm, 10 min) on AMPAR currents. In contrast, bath application of the PP2B (calcineurin) inhibitor cyclosporine A (20 μm) failed to alter the NMDA effect (Fig. 5B). In the sample of neurons we tested (Fig. 5C), prolonged NMDA treatment reduced AMPAR current by 41.2 ± 3.1% (n = 5) under control conditions, and this effect was significantly (p < 0.01, ANOVA) enhanced in cells dialyzed with the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor microsystin (5 μm, 60.0 ± 2.3%, n = 5), or okadaic acid (63.3 ± 4.1%, n = 6), but not cyclosporine A (45.5 ± 3.6%, n = 6). These results suggest that PP1/2A, but not PP2B, is involved in modifying the effect of calpain on AMPA receptors. As controls, we also tested the potential involvement of other signaling molecules. As shown in Fig. 5D, the effect of prolonged NMDA treatment on AMPAR current was intact in neurons treated with PKA inhibitors (PKI14–22, 1 μm, 49.0 ± 6.4%, n = 5; PKI5–24, 20 μm, 45.8 ± 5.5%, n = 6). The effect was also unaltered by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (4 μm, 36.0 ± 4.0%, n = 5) or calphostin C (1 μm, 41.6 ± 3.7%, n = 5). These results indicate that PKA and PKC, both phosphorylating GluR1 subunit at locations near the putative cleavage sites, are not involved in calpain regulation of AMPAR currents. The present study provides functional evidence showing that activation of endogenous calpain by prolonged NMDA treatment reduces AMPAR-mediated currents. This in vitro phenomenon is pathophysiologically relevant because it is mimicked in animals exposed to transient ischemic insults, and the NMDAR-induced, calpain-mediated depression of AMPA responses is occluded in ischemic animals (9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of calpain on AMPAR currents is abolished by inhibiting CaMKII but is augmented by inhibiting PP1/2A. Consistently, in vitro assay shows that GluR1-CT is cleaved by application of calpain. Furthermore, activation of CaMKII enhances the ability of calpain to cleave GluR1 subunit. These results suggest that the phosphorylation state of GluR1 subunit, which is regulated by CaMKII-PP1/2A, controls its susceptibility to calpain cleavage. Previous studies using repetitive synaptic stimulation or glutamate treatment (to drive long term potentiation/long term depression in situ) did not find the CaMKII-facilitated, calpain-mediated proteolysis of AMPARs. There are two major reasons for this. First, our stimulus (10-min glutamate) is more potent and persistent than long term potentiation/long term depression-driven stimuli (such as brief tetanic stimulus or 1–2 min glutamate application). We have compared the distinct effects of prolonged versus transient NMDAR stimulation on AMPARs (9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A brief NMDA treatment only triggers clathrin-mediated AMPAR internalization, while a prolonged NMDA treatment has a long term effect leading to calpain-mediated proteolysis (9.Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Only the strong stimulus (e.g. 10-min glutamate) will cause the activation of calpain. Second, most of electrophysiological studies used protease inhibitors (e.g. leupeptin) in their recording electrodes; therefore the effect of proteases (such as calpain) was blocked. Calpain-mediated cleavage not only induces protein degradation but also modifies the substrate activity or generates new molecules. For example, in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, calpain cleaves cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) activator p35 to p25, resulting in prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5, ultimately leading to neuronal death (28.Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Our electrophysiological and biochemical results suggest that calpain alters the function of another target, AMPA receptor, via proteolytic cleavage of GluR1 subunits. This leads to the suppression of functional AMPARs at the neuronal membrane and thus reduces AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Thus, calpain could function as a feedback inhibitor of AMPAR activity when neuron is overstimulated. Several studies have suggested that AMPAR functions can be influenced by protein kinases and phosphotases. For example, phosphorylation of GluR1 subunits (Ser845) by PKA stabilizes AMPARs at the synapse, whereas dephosphorylation of the same site by phosphatase 2B promotes internalization of AMPARs (29.Dell'Acqua M.L. Smith K.E. Gorski J.A. Horne E.A. Gibson E.S. Gomez L.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that manipulating CaMKII activity alters the susceptibility of AMPARs to calpain regulation. This is not due to the direct phosphorylation at AMPAR channels, because application of CaMKII inhibitors did not affect basal AMPAR currents nor reverse the pre-established calpain suppression of AMPAR currents. We speculate that prolonged NMDAR stimulation may cause CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1 subunits, therefore altering the calpain proteolysis of AMPARs. In agreement with it, we found that application of CaMKII inhibitors or suppression of CaMKII expression by siRNA prevented the calpain-induced reduction of AMPAR currents. In vitro biochemical assay also indicated that the calpain cleavage of GluR1 C-terminal fusion protein was substantially augmented by adding purified active CaMKII. These results suggest that the conformational change of GluR1 caused by CaMKII phosphorylation at Ser831 makes GluR1 more vulnerable to calpain cleavage. Another important molecule that regulates the phosphorylation state of AMPA receptors is the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1. PP1 is enriched in dendritic spines of neurons (30.Ouimet C.C. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3396-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in modulating AMPAR functions (3.Yan Z. Hsieh-Wilson L. Feng J. Tomizawa K. Allen P.B. Fienberg A.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Appropriate NMDAR activation recruits more PP1 to synapses, allowing it to gain access to synaptic substrates, which is necessary for sustaining long term depression (31.Morishita W. Connor J.H. Xia H. Quinlan E.M. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1133-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). PP1 could reduce GluR1 phosphorylation either directly or indirectly through inhibiting CaMKII Thr286 autophosphorylation and its autonomous activity (20.Lisman J.E. Zhabotinsky A.M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We found that suppressing PP1 activity (which would lead to elevated GluR1 phosphorylation) augmented the calpain effect on AMPAR currents, further suggesting that phosphorylated GluR1 subunits are more vulnerable to calpain cleavage. Given the important role of calpain in the pathophysiology of multiple brain diseases, it is important to understand the cellular basis of calpain-mediated cleavage. Here we provide evidence suggesting that the phosphorylation state of one of the calpain substrates, AMPAR GluR1 subunit, controls its sensitivity to calpain cleavage. Thus, by increasing or decreasing calpain-mediated cleavage of AMPARs, CaMKII/PP1 activity could be especially critical for neurons to control excessive excitability as what occurs during stroke and ischemia.

BLAST searches with MDMPI sequence against GenBank™ and other protein data bases revealed that MDMPI is not homologous to any functionally identified proteins but showed significant identities (27–36%) to a range of conserved hypothetical proteins from the genomes of Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces avermitilis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Nocardia farcinica (10.Shen X.H. Jiang C.Y. Huang Y. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3442-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Earlier research on mycothiol biochemistry and biosynthesis has been conducted with mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis, with the ultimate aim of defining new targets against tuberculosis, the resurgence of which has been a growing health concern in both developed and developing nations. The understanding of MSH-dependent enzyme structure is the key to the characterization of MSH-dependent enzymes that are helpful for the development of new drugs against diseases caused by Mycobacterium spp. To elucidate the catalytic mechanism of MDMPI and to provide clues to find more MSH-dependent enzymes, we have determined the crystal structure of MDMPI from C. glutamicum at a resolution of 1.75Å. The structure reveals that the MDMPI contains two domains: A metal binding domain binds a divalent metal cofactor (Zn2+) and an extended domain contains totally new folding. The site-directed mutagenesis reveals 9 of the 14 conserved amino acid residues are essential for activity. One mutant (H52A) was crystallized. By combination of structural and biochemical results, a putative catalytic center is proposed. So far as we know this is the first structure of an MSH-dependent enzyme, as well as an enzyme involved in gentisate/3-hydroxybenzoate assimilation that is widely existed in bacteria and participate in microbial geocycling of elements of aromatic compounds in nature. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions−Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Escherichia coli strains were grown aerobically on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37 °C in LB broth or on LB plate with 1.5% (w/v) agar. When needed, kanamycin at 50 μgml–1 for E. coli was used. Expression and Purification of MDMPI and Its Mutants−Various derivatives of plasmid pET28a (supplemental Table S1) that harbor MDMPI or its mutants were constructed by methods described previously (10.Shen X.H. Jiang C.Y. Huang Y. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3442-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells by inducing with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture reached an A600 of 0.6–0.8. The culture was harvested after growing for additional 8 h at 25 °C. Protein was purified using a nickel affinity column and a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare). The prepared protein sample was checked for purity by SDS-PAGE and by gel-filtration chromatography, which showed only one protein of 28 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of MDMPI and its mutants. After changing buffer to 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) by repeatedly concentration and dilution using Amicon Ultra-4 concentrators (molecular weight cutoff 5000), the purified protein was finally concentrated to 17 mg/ml and stored at –80 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection−The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was used for crystallization. The drop was formed by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (17 mg/ml) with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 12% glycerol, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5). A 1.75 Å resolution native data set was collected utilizing Rigaku RAXIS IV image plate detector at Institute of Biophysics (Chinese Academy of Sciences). A bromide derivative was prepared by soaking the crystal in cryoprotecting solution containing 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 25% glycerol, 1 m NaBr, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) for 10 min. Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility at the peak wavelength of bromine (0.920 Å) with 1° oscillation and an exposure of 15 s per image. A total of 600° of data were collected to a resolution of 1.95 Å with an average of 20-fold redundancy. The crystallization of mutant H52A was performed similarly to that of native MDMPI. The drops were composed of 1 μl of protein solution (15 mg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 1.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 11% glycerol, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5). A 2.05 Å resolution data set for this mutant was collected at the Institute of Biophysics (Chinese Academy of Sciences). All the diffraction data (Table 1) were integrated using DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (11.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

After phase improvement an initial model was built using PHENIX with the final figure of merit 0.65 for eight bromide sites. ARP/wARP was used to automated model rebuilding with the sequence of MDMPI (14.Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

After several cycles of refinement and model rebuilding a final model with an R factor of 0.21 and an Rfree factor of 0.22 was obtained, which consisted of 240 residues and 272 water molecules. We modeled Zn2+ into the density and the B-factor of Zn2+ has been refined to 26. Crystallographic statistics showed the quality of the overall structure was very good. The N-terminal His-tag fragment was missed in the electron density map due to its location on the molecule surface, and the C-terminal residue 241 was also missed. The structure of mutant H52A was solved by molecular replacement with MolRep (17.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar) using the MDMPI wild type structure as a search model. After several cycles of refinement and model rebuilding, a final model with an R-factor of 0.20 and an Rfree-factor of 0.22 was obtained. A structure appraisal of the final model of MDMPI and H52A using PROCHECK (18.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that the main-chain torsion angles for both molecules corresponded well with allowed values (96.6% in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot of MDMPI and 96.2% in the most favored regions of H52A). A summary of the refinement statistics is given in Table 1. X-ray Fluorescence Scan Analysis−To determine what kind of metal ion binds to the protein, fluorescence scan analysis of the same crystal used in data collection was performed at beamline, Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The wavelength ranges of the experiments were selected near the K-edge of Zn2+, Ni2+,Cu2+,Mn2+,Fe3+, and Ca2+, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis of MDMPI and Enzyme Activity Assay−Fourteen mutants (supplemental Table S1) of MDMPI (W44A, H48A, H52A, N56A, C61A, Y76A, S78A, R82A, E85A, R141A, E144A, H148A, D151A, and R222A) were constructed according to the method described by Sambrook et al. (19.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primers used for generation of these mutants are provided in supplemental Table S2. Screening for mutants was conducted through enzymatic activity assays, and subsequently the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. MDMPI activity was determined according to Feng et al. (9.Feng J. Che Y. Milse J. Yin Y.J. Liu L. Rueckert C. Shen X.H. Qi S.W. Kalinowski J. Liu S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10778-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein Data Bank Accession Numbers−The coordinates and structure factors for MDMPI wild type and mutant H52A have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession numbers of 2NSF and 2NSG, respectively. Overall Structure of the MDMPI−The MDMPI of C. glutamicum was purified from recombinant E. coli and its crystal structure was resolved at 1.75 Å. The MDMPI is a monomer and belongs to α/β folding type (Figs. 2B and Fig. 3). Two domains were clearly observed: An N-terminal domain largely composed of α-helices and a C-terminal domain characterized by shorter stretches of α-helices and β-sheets. The core of the N-terminal domain consists of five long (≈20 residues) α-helices (α1, α2, α3, α4, and α5). Also included in the core domain is a metal ion (Fig. 3). The C-terminal domain shows a novel fold with the pattern of αβαββα fold, which contains three long loops, three α-helices (α7, α8, and α9), and three β-strands (β3, β4, and β5). It is noteworthy that 42% of the amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain are located at the three long loops, with the longest loop containing 20 residues (residues 221–241) and are not part of the core C-terminal domain structure (Fig. 3). The C-terminal Domain Represents a Novel Folding Pattern and Is Necessary for Enzymatic Activity−The folding topology of the C-terminal domain of MDMPI is novel. Structural similarity searches of MDMPI C-terminal domain utilizing the DALI server (20.Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) showed few matches with significant Z score and small root mean square deviation values. The best match was a putative sterol carrier protein (PDB code 1WFR) with Z value of 3.0. The 67 residues of this protein share 15% sequence identity with the C-terminal domain of MDMPI and can be superimposed to this domain with a root mean square deviation of 3.3 Å. The C-terminal domain is necessary for the enzyme activity and structural stability. When the C-terminal domain was deleted, the truncated MDMPI did not show any enzyme activity (Table 2) and existed as inclusion bodies in E. coli cells (data not shown). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a conserved Arg222 residue at the C-terminal domain was necessary for MDMPI activity. When this Arg222 residue was mutated into Ala222 residue, the resulting mutant R222A did not show any enzymatic activity. Structural analysis indicated that the side chain of Arg222 (NH1) at the C-terminal domain interacted with Asp151 (OD2) of the N-terminal domain through a salt bridge (Fig. 4). These two amino acid residues (Arg222 and Asp151) are highly conserved among the protein family (Fig. 2A). Replacement of either of them with Ala residue resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. Thus, it is proposed that the interaction between these two residues is vital to enzyme activity and structure stability.TABLE 2Determination of MDMPI activity from various MDMPIsMDMPI wild type or mutantsMDMPI activityaThe activity was determined from recombinant E. coli cells that harbor each plasmid (for details, please refer to supplemental Tables S1 and S2) and was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.

The wild type MDMPI activity was calculated as 100%. Open table in a new tab The MDMPI Is a Metal-dependent Protein and Contains a Metal-binding Motif, His52-Glu144-His148−Structural analysis revealed that MDMPI is a metal-dependent protein with the metal binding site located in the N-terminal domain. The metal atom is coordinated by His52 (NE2), Glu144 (OE1), His148 (NE2), two water molecules and one glycerol molecule (Fig. 5A). The x-ray fluorescence scan gave clear absorption jump at the spectrum over K-edge of Zn2+ and Ni2+ (data not shown), which demonstrated that this was a mixture of Zn2+ and Ni2+. Coordination of Zn2+ and Ni2+ indicated that either could be coordinated in a tetragonal bipyramidal geometry (21.Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Since in the whole expression and purification course, we did not add any zinc-containing reagent, it suggested that Zn2+ was integrated into the metal-ion binding site in vivo. In addition, previous enzyme activity assays showed that Zn2+ (1 mm) stimulated isomerase activity up to 121%, while Ni2+ (1 mm) did not affect activity (9.Feng J. Che Y. Milse J. Yin Y.J. Liu L. Rueckert C. Shen X.H. Qi S.W. Kalinowski J. Liu S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10778-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is deduced that the natural MDMPI contains Zn2+ ion instead of Ni2+ ion. It is further deduced that Zn2+ was partially replaced by Ni2+ during purification of MDMPI with a nickel-affinity chromatography. The contribution of the three conserved residues, namely His52, Glu144, and His148, to the binding of metal atom was examined by individual mutation of each amino acid residue. Enzyme activity assays indicated that all mutants (H52A, E144A, and H148A) were inactive. Moreover, the crystal structure of mutant H52A at resolution of 2.05Å revealed that there was no metal ion bound to the protein (although nickel-affinity chromatography was used in the purification process). The metal atom position at the native MDMPI molecule was occupied by one glycerol moiety (Fig. 5B). Compared with the native MDMPI, the mutant MDMPI (H52A) has the following structural changes: 1) the main chain of the loop (amino acid residues 36–45) moved toward the inner; 2) the side chain of Trp44 at the loop is much closer to the former metal binding site; 3) the side chain of Glu144 had double conformations; and 4) conformational change took place at the side chain of Arg82 (Fig. 6). Probably it is the absence of the metal ion that resulted in the significant conformation change around the proposed metal binding region. Previously, it was proposed that MDMPI represents a novel family of proteins (9.Feng J. Che Y. Milse J. Yin Y.J. Liu L. Rueckert C. Shen X.H. Qi S.W. Kalinowski J. Liu S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10778-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the structures of this novel family were unknown. According to sequence alignment, the metal binding site, namely residues His52-Glu144-His148, are highly conserved throughout the whole family (Fig. 2A), and these binding residues are located in the surface pocket between the α2 (His52) and α5 (Glu144 and His148) in N-terminal domain (Fig. 5A). Biochemical and Structural Identification of Catalytic Center−In total fourteen amino acid residues were targeted for mutation (Table 2), according to sequence alignment and the above structure analysis. Some mutant MDMPIs such as H52A, E144A, H148A, D151A, and R222A that completely (100%) lost enzymatic activity were described above. The other mutant MDMPIs include three (H48A, C61A, E85A) that did not lose activity, two that showed significant loss of activity (S78A, 7%; R82A, 30%; activity remained), and four (Y76A, R141A, W44A, N56A) that demonstrated a complete loss of activity (Table 2). Structure modeling indicated that Tyr76, Arg82, Ser78, Arg141, Trp44, and Asn56 are located at the metal-binding region. Moreover, eight of these amino acid residues, including His52, Trp44, Asn56, Tyr76, Arg82, Arg141, Glu144, and His148, formed a surface pocket (Fig. 7). The metal ion (Zn2+) and its binding site (His52, Glu144, and His148) are located at the bottom of the surface pocket. Thus, it is proposed that these highly conserved sites (Trp44, Asn56, Tyr76, Arg82, and Arg141) that surrounding the metal binding site provides the hydrophilic environment for MDMPI catalysis. The surface pocket including the metal atom (Zn2+) and the MSH moiety further formed the potential catalytic center. Sulfate Ion in the Catalytic Center and Proposed Process for MDMPI-catalyzing Isomerization−A tetrahedral density was observed at this surface pocket. This density was molded as a sulfate ion (Fig. 7). The sulfate ion interacted with Tyr76 and Asn56 and was located near Arg82. These three amino acid residues are conservative in the whole family (Fig. 2A) and are necessary for enzymatic activities, as demonstrated by mutagenesis of these amino acid residues resulting complete loss of enzymatic activity (Table 2). Interestingly, a sulfate ion was also observed in the active site (a deep cavity) of the human GSH-dependent maleylacetoacetate isomerase, and this sulfate ion was proposed to mimicking substrate (maleylacetoacetate) binding (22.Polekhina G. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Parker M.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic mechanism of MDMPI is still not clear, this and previous studies have revealed several key molecular elements that are necessary for catalysis, including the metal ion (Zn2+) and its surrounding amino acid residues (His52, Glu144, and His148), and the –SH group of the MSH molecule (9.Feng J. Che Y. Milse J. Yin Y.J. Liu L. Rueckert C. Shen X.H. Qi S.W. Kalinowski J. Liu S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10778-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here, a preliminary and hypothetical process is proposed for description of the MDMPI-catalyzed isomerization (Fig. 1): isomerization of maleylpyruvate is initiated by the attack of –SH of the mycothiol on the α-carbon of the maleylpyruvate molecule, which is catalyzed by the MDMPI (most probably by the Zn2+ ion on the enzyme). This attack results in the formation of MSH-maleylpyruvate conjugate (Fig. 1, step I). Upon conjugation, the resulting single bond would be freely to rotate (Fig. 1, step II). Finally, the MSH moiety is released and the product (fumarylpyruvate) is generated (Fig. 1, step III). Although this proposed mechanism is similar to that proposed for the GSH-dependent maleylacetoacetate isomerase from humans (22.Polekhina G. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Parker M.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), some sharply different properties between MDMPI and GSH-dependent maleylacetoacetate were observed. The MDMPI is a metalloprotein but the GSH-dependent maleylacetoacetate isomerase is not; the latter belongs to a group of enzymes named zeta class glutathione transferase that catalyze reductive dehalogenation of α-hologenated acids (22.Polekhina G. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Parker M.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but this property was not observed for the MDMPI from C. glutamicum. Currently, works on characterization of more MDMPIs from different bacteria and on details of the catalytic mechanism of MDMPI are in progress.

SUMO proteases bind to SUMOs noncovalently, but the physiological roles of the binding in the functions of SUMO proteases are not well understood. In this study we found that SUMO proteases (Axam, SENP1, and yeast Ulp1) show different preferences for noncovalent binding to various SUMOs (SUMO-1, -2, -3, and yeast Smt3) and that the hydrolase and isopeptidase activities of SUMO proteases are dependent on their binding to SUMOs through salt bridge. Expression of Smt3 suppressed the phenotype of yeast mutant lacking smt3, which exhibits growth arrest, and the binding of Ulp1 to Smt3 was essential for this rescue activity. Although expression of an Smt3 mutant (smt3R64E(GG)), which conjugates to substrate but loses the ability to bind to Ulp1, rescued the phenotype of yeast lacking smt3 partially, the mutant cells showed an increment in the doubling time and a delay of desumoylation of Smt3-conjugated Cdc3. These results indicate that the noncovalent binding of SUMO protease to SUMO through salt bridge is essential for the enzymatic activities and that the balance between sumoylation and desumoylation is important for cell growth control.

The pattern of SUMO conjugates changes dynamically during the cell cycle and in response to various stimuli (7.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). SUMO proteases have at least two functions in this process. They remove SUMO from proteins, making the modification reversible, and they also provide a source of free SUMO to be used for conjugation. Free SUMO is generated both from newly synthesized SUMO, which is cleaved to remove a short C-terminal peptide and expose glycine at the C terminus, and from desumoylation of existing conjugates. All known SUMO proteases belong to the ubiquitin-like protease 1 (Ulp1) cysteine protease family, which was originally found in S. cerevisiae (7.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Ulp1 proteases are characterized by a C-terminal 200-amino acid core domain that contains the catalytic triad Cys-His-Asp. In addition to the catalytic domain, Ulp1 proteases contain N-terminal domains that are variable in both size and sequence. These domains are critical for intracellular localization and may also have roles in target specificity or regulation of activity (8.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Two SUMO proteases with distinct functions have been described in S. cerevisiae. Ulp1 localizes to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and is required for cleaving both the Smt3 precursor and Smt3 conjugates to other proteins; whereas Ulp2/Smt4 localizes to the nucleus, does not cleave the precursor, and appears to desumoylate a distinct set of conjugates (7.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 9.Panse V.G. Kuster B. Gerstberger T. Hurt E. Nat.

At least seven genes in mammalian genomes encode proteins with the Ulp domain, which constitute the so-called Sentrin-specific protease (SENP) family (11.Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Among them, SENP1 mainly localizes to foci in the nucleus and the nuclear rim (12.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), while SENP2 (also called Axam) binds to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC (13.Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that different members of the SENP family differ in their catalytic properties, the details have not yet been systematically studied. SUMO proteases are also known to bind to SUMOs noncovalently. SMT3IP1 (SENP3) was originally identified as a Smt3-binding protein (14.Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analyses of the x-ray structures of the complexes between Ulp1 and Smt3, between SENP2 and SUMO-1, and between SENP1 and SUMO-2 have identified some interfaces between SUMO proteases and SUMO proteins (15.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 16.Reverter D. Lima C.D.

J. 2006; 397: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has been shown that six motifs of SUMO proteases recognize the SUMO/Smt3 β-sheet and C-terminal strand. Among them, the region of SENP1 that interacts with the C-terminal strand of SUMO is important for the enzymatic activity of SENP-1, whereas the region of SENP1 that recognizes the SUMO β-sheet through salt bridge plays less critical roles (17.Shen L.N. Dong C. Liu H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mutation of the amino acid involved in the salt bridge in Ulp1 cannot rescue the ulp1 phenotype (15.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), indicating that the noncovalent binding is necessary for biological functions of SUMO proteases. However, the role of the noncovalent binding between SUMO proteases and SUMOs through salt bridge is not clear. In this study we analyzed the physiological significance of the salt bridge between SUMO proteases and SUMOs. Here we show that their noncovalent binding is important for the hydrolase and isopeptidase activities of SUMO proteases and is essential for cell growth.

SUMO-conjugated His6-tagged Tcf-4-(273–387) (SUMO-Tcf-4) proteins were obtained by using an Escherichia coli sumoylation system (20.Uchimura Y. Nakao M. Saitoh H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3), co-transformed with pET28/Tcf-4E-(273–387) and pT-E1E2SUMO protein expression vectors, was used to express SUMO-Tcf-4. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified from E. coli according to the suppliers’ instructions. Because GST-Axam was easily degraded, GST-Axam-(72–588) was used as an enzyme source of Axam, and throughout this study this protein was called GST-Axam. 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) was purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Anti-FLAG (M2), anti-HA, anti-GFP, anti-His6, anti-SUMO-1, anti-SUMO-2/3, and anti-Tcf3/4 antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., Covance Laboratories, Inc. (Richmond, CA), Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA), Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland), Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA), and Upstate (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody was made by a standard method. Other materials were from commercial sources.

The detailed construction information will be provided upon request. Strains and Genetic Manipulations−S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. W303 was used as a wild-type strain. To generate YHK001, YHK002 was transformed with the ulp1::HIS3 fragment and selected a clone viable on SD-His-Ura plates and non-viable on SD-His + 5-FOA plates. The ulp1::HIS3 fragment was amplified with the primers 5′-ATTAAACAGCTTTCAGCAGGTGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCACATAAGGTCGAAGACAATCGTC-3′. MHY1321 genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR to amplify the ulp1::HIS3 fragment. To generate YHK003, YCp-CDC3-HA::HIS3 was cut with NcoI and introduced into W303, and His+ transformants were confirmed by PCR and Western blotting. Preparation of rich (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose, YPD) and synthetic complete (SC) media and standard genetic methods were as described (23.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

The supernatant (200 μg of protein) was incubated with 1 μm GST-SUMO immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-SUMO was precipitated by centrifugation and washed once with lysis buffer, twice with 0.5 m LiCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The precipitates were probed with anti-GFP, anti-FLAG, or anti-GST antibody. To determine whether SUMO-1-Tcf-4 interacts with Axam, 1 μm SUMO-1-Tcf-4 or SUMO-1R64E-Tcf-4 was incubated with 1 μm GST-AxamC547S immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 50 μl of T20D1 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 1 mm DTT) for 2 h on ice. GST-AxamC547S was precipitated by centrifugation, and then the precipitates were washed with T20D1 buffer three times and probed with anti-SUMO-1 antibody. Enzyme Assays in Vitro−To examine the hydrolase activity of SUMO proteases in vitro, 2 μm GST-SUMOs-Myc were incubated with the indicated concentrations of GST-Axam, GST-SENP1, or GST-Flag-Ulp1 in 25 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) at 30 °C for 10 min as described previously (21.Kadoya T. Yamamoto H. Suzuki T. Yukita A. Fukui A. Michiue T. Asahara T. Tanaka K. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3803-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After the incubation, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image (version 1.63). The Km value was calculated by averaging the values derived from the fits for each data set. For analysis of cleavage of SUMO-Tcf-4 by SUMO proteases in vitro, 1 μm SUMOs-Tcf-4 were incubated with the indicated concentrations of GST-Axam, GST-SENP1, or their mutants in 25 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 30 °C. After the incubation, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. To prepare Smt3-Cdc3, CDC3-HA smt3Δ/pRS425-SMT3, and CDC3-HA smt3Δ/pRS425-smt3R64E(GG) were arrested by nocodazole (15 μg/ml) and harvested by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.14 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)) and lysed by vigorous vortexing for 10 min with an equal volume of glass beads at 4 °C. Cdc3-HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. For analysis of the cleavage of Smt3-Cdc3 by Ulp1 in vitro, 20 μl of Smt3-Cdc3-HA conjugated protein A beads were incubated with the indicated amounts of GST-Ulp1 or its mutants in 25 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) for 10 min at 30 °C. After the incubation, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-HA antibody. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analyses−W303 was grown in YPD medium and smt3Δ background strains were grown in SG-Leu-Ura medium at 28 °C. All strains were resuspended in YPD medium to 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 28 °C. At 0 and 12 h, 1 × 107 cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol and stored overnight at -20 °C. The fixed cells were washed with 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and suspended in 200 μl of the same buffer. After a brief sonication (5 s), 100 μl of the same buffer containing RNase A (1 mg/ml) was added to the sample, and the incubation was continued for 4 h at 30 °C. The RNase A-treated cells were stained with 100 μl of propidium iodide (PI) solution (50 μg/ml) in 4 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice. The fluorescence intensities of stained cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo (Tree Star). The morphology and nuclear localization of PI-stained cells were observed with an inverted microscope (IX-FLA; OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). Sumoylation and Desumoylation Assay in Intact Cells−COS or 293T cells (35-mm-diameter dishes) were transfected with pCGN-, pEGFP-pEF-BOS-, or pFlag-CMV2-derived plasmids to examine the sumoylation and desumoylation in intact mammalian cells as described (22.Yamamoto H. Ihara M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2047-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To examine the desumoylation of the Smt3 modification of Cdc3-HA in intact yeast cells, the T-9 strain was arrested at G2/M with 15 μm nocodazole for 4 h. At the indicated time after nocodazole was removed, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm mannitol, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (20 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm PMSF) and 10 mm NEM. After the lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, the precipitates and the samples were further incubated with the indicated amounts of GST-Flag-Ulp1, GST-Flag-ulp1C580S, or GST-Flag-ulp1D451N in 25 μl of reaction mixture for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with the anti-HA or anti-GST antibody. To quantify the sumoylation level of Cdc3, the intensity of Smt3-conjugated Cdc3-HA, which was recognized by anti-HA antibody, was measured by the NIH Image, and normalized with the intensity of tubulin. The sumoylation level of Cdc3-HA at each time was expressed as the percentage of the sumoylated Cdc3-HA before the release from nocodazole arrest. Other Assays−The immunofluorescence study was done as described (22.Yamamoto H. Ihara M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2047-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24.Ihara M. Yamamoto H. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interaction of SUMO Proteases with SUMOs−The nomenclatures of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are confusing at present. According to a previous report (1.Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar), throughout this study we will refer to SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 as SUMO proteins that have 11 amino acids and 2 amino acids, respectively, after the C-terminal diglycine motif (Fig. 1A). Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated SUMO-3 as one of the Axam-binding proteins (data not shown). To clarify the physiological significance of the binding of SUMO-3 and Axam, the specificity of the binding between SUMO proteases and SUMOs was examined biochemically. When the lysates of COS cells expressing GFP-Axam were incubated with GST-SUMOs, GFP-Axam was precipitated with GST-SUMO-3 and GST-SUMO-2 but not with GST-SUMO-1 (Fig. 1B, left panel). GST-SUMO-1, -2, and -3 all precipitated Flag-SENP1, another SUMO protease (Fig. 1B, right panel). Ulp1-Smt3 crystal structural analyses showed the formation of a salt bridge between Arg64 of Smt3 and Asp451 of Ulp1 (15.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These amino residues are conserved in SUMO-1 (Arg63), SUMO-2 (Arg58), SUMO-3 (Arg59), Axam (Asp412), and SENP1 (Asp464). None of the SUMO mutants in which Arg is changed to Glu could precipitate Axam or SENP1 (Fig. 1B). AxamD412N and SENP1D464N, in which Asp is changed to Asn, did not form a complex with GST-SUMO-3 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, AxamD412N did not bind to GST-SUMO-2 either, and SENP1D464N interacted with neither GST-SUMO-1 nor GST-SUMO-2 (data not shown). To examine whether the C-terminal region of SUMO is required for the binding to SUMO protease, we generated SUMO mutants in which the C-terminal region after the diglycine motif (GG) or the C-terminal region, including the diglycine motif (ΔGG), is deleted. Axam bound to GST-SUMO-3 (GG) and GST-SUMO-3 (ΔGG) with the similar efficiency to its binding with GST-SUMO-3 (WT) (Fig. 1D, left panel). SENP1 interacted with GST-SUMO-1(GG) or GST-SUMO-3(GG) but not with GST-SUMO-1(ΔGG) or GST-SUMO-3(ΔGG) (Fig. 1D, right panel). These results indicate that the specificity of the binding between SUMO protease and SUMO is dependent on the salt bridge and that the recognition of the SUMO diglycine motif by SUMO protease may be specific. Specificity of Hydrolase Activity of Axam and SENP1−To clarify the role of the salt bridge to SUMO in the actions of SUMO proteases, we analyzed the hydrolase activity using purified proteins. Axam hydrolyzed SUMO-3-Myc efficiently to produce SUMO-3(GG) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Although SUMO-2 bound to Axam, SUMO-2-Myc was only slightly hydrolyzed (Fig. 2B). Axam did not act on SUMO-1-Myc (Fig. 2B). Axam did not hydrolyze SUMO-3R59E-Myc (Fig. 2C), and AxamD412N did not act on SUMO-3-Myc (Fig. 2B). When a large amount of Axam (1 μm) was incubated with SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 for 3 h, hydrolysis of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 was observed. Even under these conditions, Axam could not hydrolyze SUMO-1R63E or SUMO-2R58E (Fig. 2C). SENP1 hydrolyzed SUMO-1-Myc and SUMO-3-Myc, and less effectively hydrolyzed SUMO-2-Myc (Fig. 2, D and E). SENP1 did not hydrolyze SUMO-1R63E-Myc, SUMO-2R58E-Myc, and SUMO-3R59E-Myc (Fig. 2F), and SENP1D464N did not act on SUMO-1 (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the binding of SUMO proteases and SUMOs is necessary but not sufficient for the hydrolase reaction. Specificity of Isopeptidase Activity of Axam and SENP1−Next we examined the role of the salt bridge between SUMO proteases and SUMOs in isopeptidase activity. We previously showed that Axam cleaves SUMO-1 from SUMO-1-conjugated Tcf-4 (22.Yamamoto H. Ihara M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2047-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24.Ihara M. Yamamoto H. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because Tcf-4 could not be modified with SUMO-1 efficiently in in vitro reconstitutional assays, we overexpressed SUMO-conjugated Tcf-4 in E. coli (20.Uchimura Y. Nakao M. Saitoh H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to generate high concentrations of SUMO-1-Tcf-4 that would be suitable for enzymatic analyses. Approximately 50% of His6-Tcf-4 was modified with SUMO-1, -3, or their mutants in E. coli and purified them to use as substrates (Fig. 3A). His6-Tcf-4 was also modified with SUMO-2 and its mutant (data not shown). Axam catalyzed the deconjugation of SUMO from SUMO-3-Tcf-4 and SUMO-2-Tcf-4 at nearly equivalent rates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, Axam was able to deconjugate SUMO-1-Tcf-4 although it could not hydrolyze SUMO-1. However, Axam did not show isopeptidase activity for SUMO-3R59E-Tcf-4 and SUMO-1R63E-Tcf-4 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, GST-AxamC547S, which was used to prevent desumoylation of SUMO-1-Tcf-4, directly bound to SUMO-1-Tcf-4 but not SUMO-1R63E-Tcf-4 (Fig. 3D). Similarly, SENP1 deconjugated all of SUMO-conjugated Tcf-4 in a dose-dependent manner, but did not act on SUMO-3R59E-Tcf-4 and SUMO-1R63E-Tcf-4 (Fig. 3, E and F). Neither AxamD412N nor SENP1D464N acted on SUMO-3-conjugated Tcf-4 (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the binding of SUMO proteases to SUMO target proteins through salt bridge is necessary for the isopeptidase activity. The Binding of SUMO Proteases to SUMOs Regulates Sumoylation Status in Intact Cells−To show how the salt bridge of SUMO proteases and SUMOs affects sumoylation in intact cells, we expressed various SUMO-1 mutants in HeLa S3 cells and observed their intracellular localization (Fig. 4A). HA-SUMO-1(GG) and HA-SUMO-1R63E(GG) showed diffuse nuclear localization with a few small dots. In contrast, HA-SUMO-1R63E and HA-SUMO-1(ΔGG) showed diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Similar results were obtained with HA-SUMO-3 mutants (data not shown). To see whether these SUMO mutants were present as monomer forms or protein-conjugated forms, lysates of cells expressing various SUMO-1 mutants were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). When HA-SUMO-1 was expressed, both the monomer form of SUMO-1 and SUMO-conjugated proteins were observed. Expression of HA-SUMO-1(GG) and HA-SUMO-1(ΔGG) mainly produced SUMO-conjugated proteins and the monomer form of SUMO-1, respectively. Although the monomer form was observed in lysates of cells by expressing HA-SUMO-1R63E, SUMO-conjugated proteins were mainly detected by the expression of HA-SUMO-1R63E(GG). Consistent with these results, Tcf-4 was sumoylated efficiently when SUMO-1R63E(GG) was expressed (Fig. 4C). Taken together with the data from the biochemical analyses, these results indicate that the SUMO Arg mutants in which the C-terminal region is cleaved are used for sumoylation and that the SUMO Arg mutant-conjugated proteins are not substrates for SUMO proteases in intact cells.

We examined additional roles of ROM2 in C. neoformans and found that ROM2 plays a role in several cell functions specifically at high temperature conditions. Morphologically rom2 mutant cells demonstrated a ""tear""-like shape and clustered together. A sub-population of cells had a hyperelongated phenotype at restrictive growth conditions. Altered morphology was associated with defects in actin that was concentrated at the cell periphery and with abnormalities in microtubule organization. Interestingly, the ROM2 associated defects in cell morphology, location of nuclei, and actin and microtubule organization were not observed in cells grown at temperatures below 37 degrees C. These results indicate that in C. neoformans, ROM2 is important at restrictive temperature conditions and is involved in several cell maintenance functions."
https://openalex.org/W2045718133,"Current theories of auditory pitch perception propose that cochlear place (spectral) and activity timing pattern (temporal) information are somehow combined within the brain to produce holistic pitch percepts, yet the neural mechanisms for integrating these two kinds of information remain obscure. To examine this process in more detail, stimuli made up of three pure tones whose components are individually resolved by the peripheral auditory system, but that nonetheless elicit a holistic, “missing fundamental” pitch percept, were played to human listeners. A technique was used to separate neural timing activity related to individual components of the tone complexes from timing activity related to an emergent feature of the complex (the envelope), and the region of the tonotopic map where information could originate from was simultaneously restricted by masking noise. Pitch percepts were mirrored to a very high degree by a simple combination of component-related and envelope-related neural responses with similar timing that originate within higher-frequency regions of the tonotopic map where stimulus components interact. These results suggest a coding scheme for holistic pitches whereby limited regions of the tonotopic map (spectral places) carrying envelope- and component-related activity with similar timing patterns selectively provide a key source of neural pitch information. A similar mechanism of integration between local and emergent object properties may contribute to holistic percepts in a variety of sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2050375181,"Eukaryotes have evolved quality control mechanisms that prevent the expression of genes in which the protein coding potential is crippled by the presence of a premature translation-termination codon (PTC). In addition to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a well documented posttranscriptional consequence of the presence of a PTC in an mRNA, we recently reported the transcriptional silencing of PTC-containing immunoglobulin (Ig) μ and γ minigenes when they are stably integrated into the genome of HeLa cells. Here we demonstrate that this transcriptional silencing of PTC-containing Ig-μ constructs requires active translation of the cognate mRNA, as it is not observed under conditions where translation of the PTC-containing mRNA is inhibited through an iron-responsive element in the 5′-untranslated region. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated depletion of the essential NMD factor Upf1 not only abolishes NMD but also reduces the extent of nonsense-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (NMTGS). Collectively, our data indicate that NMTGS and NMD are linked, relying on the same mechanism for PTC recognition, and that the NMTGS pathway branches from the NMD pathway at a step after Upf1 function.

To recognize mistakes during the molecular processes involved in gene expression and to prevent production of faulty gene products, several quality control mechanisms have evolved (1.Fasken M.B.

Recent transcriptome analysis of yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells revealed that, in addition to serving as a quality control system, NMD also influences the steady-state level of 5–15% of the physiological mRNAs, suggesting an important role of NMD in fine-tuning gene expression (5.Lelivelt M.J.

The exact mechanisms of PTC recognition and subsequent mRNA degradation are not yet understood und are currently under intensive investigation in many laboratories (10.Buhler M. Steiner S. Mohn F. Paillusson A. Muhlemann O. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11.Amrani N. Ganesan R. Kervestin S. Mangus D.A. Ghosh S. Jacobson A. Nature. 2004; 432: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The three evolutionary conserved proteins Upf1/SMG-2, Upf2/SMG-3, and Upf3/SMG-4 (2.Maquat L.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) are undoubtedly the key NMD factors involved in PTC recognition in all eukaryotes, whereas additional factors function as NMD regulators in metazoans (4.Amrani N. Sachs M.S. Jacobson A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). During our studies of NMD with reporter gene constructs derived from the mouse Sp6 heavy chain gene expressed under the control of the human β-actin promoter (12.Buhler M. Paillusson A. Muhlemann O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3304-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we made an unexpected observation when these so-called mini-μ constructs were stably integrated into the genome of HeLa cells. In addition of triggering NMD, the transcription rate of PTC-containing (PTC+) mini-μ genes was also reduced under these conditions (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This PTC-specific transcriptional silencing is accompanied by a change in the chromatin state toward reduced acetylation and increased mono- and dimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3, and we dubbed the term nonsense-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (NMTGS) to describe our observations. Among the six NMD reporter gene constructs we have tested so far, only the Ig-μ and the Ig-γ minigene showed NMTGS (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that NMTGS depends on a gene-specific signal that might be confined to immunoglobulin heavy chain encoding genes. In a first attempt to elucidate the intriguing molecular pathway by which a translation signal (the PTC) can feed back to inhibit the transcription of the gene that gives raise to this PTC+ transcript, we found that overexpression of the small interfering RNase (siRNAse) 3′hExo completely suppressed NMTGS (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This suggests the involvement of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or siRNA-like molecules in NMTGS, but all attempts to detect these putative siRNAs were not successful so far. 4M. Bühler, R. Gudipati, and O. Mühlemann, unpublished information. Although the biological relevance of NMTGS is still unclear, our observations appear to fit into a puzzle of reminiscent results recently reported from other experimental systems. On the one hand, polymerase II transcription from pericentromeric repeat regions or certain intergenic loci was found to be silenced by a mechanism that involves small RNAs, components of the RNAi machinery, and chromatin remodeling factors in a variety of different eukaryotes ranging from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to mammals and plants (14.Bernstein E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1635-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). From that point of view, nonsense mRNAs that trigger NMTGS may also represent a kind of non-coding transcripts with the potential to induce the RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing system. On the other hand, a genetic link between NMD factors and RNAi has been documented both in Caenorhabditis elegans (15.Domeier M.E. Morse D.P. Knight S.W. Portereiko M. Bass B.L. Mango S.E. Science. 2000; 289: 1928-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis thaliana (16.Arciga-Reyes L. Wootton L. Kieffer M. Davies B. Plant J. 2006; 47: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutations in the NMD factors SMG-2, SMG-5, or SMG-6 of C. elegans resulted in worms that still responded to double-stranded RNA-induced gene silencing but that had lost the persistence of RNAi-mediated silencing (15.Domeier M.E. Morse D.P. Knight S.W. Portereiko M. Bass B.L. Mango S.E. Science. 2000; 289: 1928-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, A. thaliana with a mutation in Upf1/SMG-2 are defective in silencing an inverted repeat construct (16.Arciga-Reyes L. Wootton L. Kieffer M. Davies B. Plant J. 2006; 47: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen in the future if and how this yet unsolved puzzle will fit together. To explore the hypothesized link between the translation-dependent PTC recognition step in NMD and NMTGS, we inhibited translation of our PTC+ mini-μ transcripts by the insertion of an iron-responsive element (IRE) into the 5′-UTR of the mini-μ construct. Using this approach, we demonstrate here that NMTGS depends on the translation of the PTC+ mRNA and that it involves the essential NMD factor Upf1. Together, these data corroborate the mechanistic link between NMD and NMTGS and suggest that both processes rely on the same mechanism for PTC recognition and branch from each other at a step after Upf1 function. Plasmids and Cell Lines−The pβmini-μ-IRE and pβmini-μ-mutIRE plasmids were generated by insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the IRE or the mutIRE sequence into the SalI site of pβmini-μwt and pβmini-μter310 (12.Buhler M. Paillusson A. Muhlemann O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3304-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively. The inserted sequence was 5′-TAGCAACCCGGGTTTCCTGCTTCAACAGTGCTTGGACGGAACCC-3′ (excluding the SalI sites); the deleted C in mutIRE is underlined. Correct orientation of the inserts was confirmed by sequencing. HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or Dreamfect (OZ Biosciences) according to manufacturer’s protocol, and polyclonal populations of stably transfected HeLa cells were obtained by selection with 0.5–1.0 mg/ml G418 (Roche Diagnostics) for 10–14 days. Before analysis, the cells were cultured in the absence of G418 for at least 2 weeks. Northern Blot Analysis−Total cellular RNA (15 μg) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 1× MOPS and 1% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics) in 0.5× MOPS by 1 h of wet blotting in a genie blotter (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis). After UV cross-linking of the RNA to the nylon filter, prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in 6× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt’s reagent, and 0.5% SDS at 60 °C. Pre-hybridization was with 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 100 μg/ml denatured calf thymus DNA. For hybridization, 100 ng of μter310 mutIRE DNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready-To-Go™ DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight hybridization, membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS and twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C before exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. Nuclear Run-on Analysis−Nuclear run-on analysis was performed essentially as described in Bühler et al. (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli transformed with pBluescript KS(–) containing the antisense sequences of human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA and mini-μ and infected with helper phage M13K07 (New England Biolabs). For nuclei preparation, ∼4 × 107 cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4 °C with 300 × g for 8 min. The cells were then resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold nuclei lysis buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% IgePalCAG30) under gentle vortexing and incubated for 5 min on ice. The nuclei were pelleted at 4 °C with 500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 6 ml of nuclei lysis buffer, centrifuged again as above, resuspended in 250 μl of nuclei storage buffer (40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 nm EDTA, 2.5 mm Tris HCl pH 8.25, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 units of RNasIn (Promega)), and stored in liquid nitrogen. Per run-on reaction, ∼107 nuclei were incubated with 11 MBq of [α-32P]UTP (0.834 μm), 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.834 μm UTP, 120 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm magnesium acetate under 500 rpm shaking for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, total RNA was isolated using Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene) and hybridized to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics) on which 5 μg of single-stranded DNA probe had been immobilized per dot. The nylon membrane was loaded with the single-stranded DNA dots using a Bio-Rad assemble vacuum system, cross-linked with 120 kJ (Stratalinker), and dried in the air. The membranes were prehybridized for 3 h in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s, 0.5% SDS, 20 ng/μl herring sperm DNA, and 100 ng/μl E. coli tRNA. Hybridization conditions were 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s, 0.5% SDS, 10 ng/μl herring sperm DNA, 50 ng/μl E. coli tRNA. The isolated nuclear RNA was denatured at 90 °C for 5 min, mixed with the hybridization buffer, and hybridized for 24 h at 60 °C. The filter strips were washed twice at 65 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Signals were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager scanning. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations (ChIP)−ChIP was performed from formaldehyde-fixed, stably transfected HeLa cells using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 17-295) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 5 μg of polyclonal rabbit α-H3K9me1, α-H3K9me2, α-H3K9me3, or α-H3 antibody (Upstate) were used. For each real-time PCR measurement (see below), 40 ng of input DNA or immunoprecipitated DNA was used to quantify mini-μ and endogenous β-globin. The TaqMan assays span the 5′ splice site of mini-μ exon C2 and the 5′ splice site of endogenous β-globin exon 2 (sequences are available upon request). For each antibody, the relative amount of immunoprecipitated mini-μ DNA was normalized to that of endogenous β-globin DNA and to input DNA and calculated as “-fold enrichment” relative to mini-μter310 IRE using the formula (IPμ/inputμ)/(IPβglob/inputβglob). Finally, these relative -fold enrichment of mini-μ for each of the three H3K9 methylation-specific antibodies was normalized to the relative -fold enrichment of mini-μ determined with the α-H3 antibody. Inhibition of Histone Deacetylases and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR−Between 2 and 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated the next day with 15 mm sodium butyrate (SB; Upstate) or 200 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) for 24 h. Subsequently, total cellular RNA was isolated using Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene), and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in 50 μl of Stratascript first strand buffer in the presence of 0.4 mm dNTPs, 300 ng of random hexamers, 40 units of RNasIn (Promega), and 50 units of Stratascript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). For real-time RT-PCR, reverse-transcribed material corresponding to 40 ng of RNA was amplified in 25 μl of Universal PCR Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems) with specific primers, and TaqMan probes (sequences are available upon request) by using the ABI SDS7000 Sequence Detection system. RNAi-mediated Upf1 Knockdown−Knockdown of Upf1 was induced by transfection of pSUPERpuro plasmids targeting two different sequences in hUpf1 (17.Paillusson A. Hirschi N. Vallan C. Azzalin C.M. Muhlemann O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e54Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Starting 24 h after transfection, untransfected cells were eliminated by culturing the cells in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in puromycin-free medium in the presence or absence of 15 mm SB for another 24 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and whole cell lysates for Western blotting were prepared 96 h post-transfection. The efficiency of the knockdown was assessed on the mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR (not shown) and on the protein level by Western blotting. Western Blotting−Whole cell lysates corresponding to 0.25 × 104–2 × 105 cells per lane were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Optitran BA-S 85 reinforced nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with 1:2500-diluted polyclonal rabbit anti-hUpf1 antiserum (18.Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), 1:500-diluted AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (μ chain-specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and 1:400-diluted supernatant of the mouse hybridoma cell line Y12, which produces a monoclonal antibody against human Sm proteins (19.Lerner E.A. Lerner M.R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). 1:4000-Diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-goat or 1:2500-diluted HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Promega) was used as secondary antibody. ECL+ Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection, and signals were visualized on a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-1000 (Fujifilm). Inhibited Translation of Ig-μ mRNA with an Iron-responsive Element in the 5′-Untranslated Region−To further investigate NMTGS of our Ig-μ minigene (12.Buhler M. Paillusson A. Muhlemann O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3304-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (hereafter called mini-μ), we have introduced the IRE of the human ferritin H chain (20.Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W. Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) into the 5′-UTR of mini-μ, giving rise to the mini-μ IRE constructs (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The IRE is an endogenous regulatory sequence that allows specific controlling of the translation in response to the intracellular iron concentration, for example the translation of ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNA (21.Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The IRE forms a bulged stem loop structure in the 5′-UTR that binds the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) when the intracellular iron concentration is low. Under these conditions, the IRP bound to the IRE inhibits the formation of a 48 S preinitiation complex at the 5′ end of the mRNA, thus blocking translation initiation at an early step (22.Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Increasing the iron concentration in the cells leads to dissociation of the IRP, thus permitting the mRNA for translation. Under standard cell culture conditions, the IRP is bound to the IRE, and translation is strongly inhibited (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We have tried to induce the translation of the mini-μ IRE with several iron sources, but the induction was neither efficient nor reliable (data not shown). As a control for our experiments, we, therefore, inserted a mutated IRE (mutIRE) with a single nucleotide deletion in the loop into the 5′-UTR of mini-μ, which cannot bind to the IRP (20.Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W. Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and, thus, allows translation (Fig. 1A, lower panel). We transfected HeLa cells with mini-μ constructs harboring a PTC at amino acid 310 (μter310) or not (μwt) and containing either the functional IRE (IRE) or the mutated version (mutIRE) and selected polyclonal pools that had these different mini-μ constructs stably integrated into the genome. Quantification of a Western blot with a 3-fold serial dilution shows about a 30-fold less Ig-μ protein in cells expressing μwt IRE than cells expressing μwt mutIRE even though the mRNA level of μwt mutIRE was consistently 2-fold lower than that of μwt IRE (Fig. 1C and data not shown). This demonstrates that the translation of μwt IRE mRNA is efficiently inhibited. In cells expressing the μter310 IRE or μter310 mutIRE construct, we could not detect any Ig-μ protein (data not shown). Insertion of the IRE into μter310 restored the otherwise hardly detectable mRNA levels of this PTC+ transcript to mRNA levels similar to those obtained with μwt constructs (Fig. 1C). Our previous study showed that the low steady-state mRNA level of stably integrated μter310 constructs into the genome of HeLa cells is the net result of both posttranscriptional mRNA degradation (i.e. NMD) and NMTGS (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IRE-mediated translation inhibition of transiently transfected PTC+ β-globin and mini-μ constructs efficiently inhibits NMD (23.Thermann R. Neu-Yilik G. Deters A. Frede U. Wehr K. Hagemeier C. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3484-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) 5L. Stalder, unpublished results., but the almost complete recovery of the μter310 IRE mRNA level suggested that NMTGS might also be inhibited by preventing translation of the μter310 mRNA. Translation of the Ig-μ PTC+ mRNA Is Required for NMTGS−To address if NMTGS depends on translation of its cognate mRNA, we needed an assay that allows monitoring of transcriptional effects without affecting NMD. We have previously shown that NMTGS involves chromatin remodeling and that the transcriptionally silenced state can be reversed by inhibition of histone deacetylases (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L.

Therefore, we treated the cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitors SB or TSA and determined the relative mini-μ mRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR. 18 S rRNA served as the endogenous control for normalization in these experiments. As shown in Figs. 1, D and E, the relative mRNA levels of μter310 mutIRE increased between 5- and 8-fold in cells treated with SB or TSA compared with untreated cells. To rule out that different average transgene copy numbers or differences in genomic integration sites could account for the observed effects, three individual polyclonal cell pools were generated for each mini-μ construct by independent transfections. Although some variations between the results obtained from the three corresponding cell pools were observed, only the three cell pools expressing μter310 mutIRE showed a strong mRNA increase upon SB treatment (Fig. 1D), which indicates that μter310 mutIRE is subjected to NMTGS to an extent that is comparable with the previously observed NMTGS of mini-μ constructs that have no insertions in the 5′-UTR (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the relative mRNA levels of translation-suppressed μter310 IRE changed only marginally (less than 2.5-fold up or down) when cells were treated with SB or TSA. Likewise, changes of less than 2.5-fold were observed for μwt IRE and μwt mutIRE mRNA levels upon SB or TSA treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that translation of the PTC+ mRNA is a prerequisite for NMTGS to occur and confirms the PTC specificity of NMTGS. The Transcription Rate of PTC+ Ig-μ Is Translation-dependent−To determine the transcription rate of the μter310 IRE and μter310 mutIRE constructs and the effect of histone deacetylase inhibition on these transcription rates in the polyclonal HeLa cell pools, nuclei of SB-treated or untreated cell pools were isolated and assayed by nuclear run-on analysis (Fig. 2A). The 32P-labeled nuclear RNA was isolated and hybridized to dots of single-stranded antisense mini-μ DNA, antisense GAPDH cDNA, and pBluescript DNA immobilized on nylon filter strips, and the radioactivity bound to each dot was quantified by PhosphorImager scanning. The pBluescript signal served as the control for background hybridization and was subtracted from the signal obtained for mini-μ and GAPDH. The net signal of mini-μ was normalized to the net GAPDH signal and to the relative average transgene copy number of the corresponding polyclonal cell pool and is displayed in the histogram in Fig. 2B. The relative mini-μ gene copy number in the different cell pools was determined from genomic DNA by real-time PCR (data not shown). These nuclear run-on experiments revealed a 4.5-fold lower transcription rate of μter310 mutIRE compared with the transcription rate of μter310 mutIRE. This reduced transcription of μter310 mutIRE could be increased by treatment of the cells with SB to a similar rate as measured for μter310 IRE, whereas the transcription rate of μter310 IRE did not alter significantly upon SB treatment. This translation-dependent reduction of mini-μter310 transcription strongly indicates that NMTGS requires translation of the cognate PTC+ transcript. The results of the run-on assays confirm the data obtained by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1, D and E) showing that NMTGS can be reversed by histone deacetylase inhibitors. NMTGS Is Accompanied by Histone H3 Lysine 9 Methylation−We next wanted to analyze the chromatin state of mini-μ in the stable polyclonal cell pools. It is well documented that transcriptional silencing often is accompanied by methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9; for review, see Ref. 24.Peters A.H. Schubeler D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that the silenced state of the PTC+ Ig-μ is accompanied by increased monomethylation of H3K9 (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed ChIP assays using antibodies specific for mono-, di-, or tri-methylated H3K9 (α-H3K9me1, α-H3K9me2, α-H3K9me3) and as a control with an antibody against all forms of H3. HeLa cells expressing the μter310 IRE or the μter310 mutIRE constructs were cross-linked with formaldehyde, the genomic DNA was sheared to an average size of 500 base pairs, and the DNA was then immunoprecipitated. The amount of mini-μ-containing DNA in the immunoprecipitated material and in the cell lysate before immunoprecipitation (input) was determined relative to the amount of endogenous β-globin by real-time PCR. Additionally, the values were normalized to the amount of total H3 to rule out possible differences between the cell pools. The ratio between the relative amounts of immunoprecipitated mini-μ and input mini-μ is depicted in Fig. 3, A–C, as -fold enrichment, and μter310 IRE was set to 1. In general, μter310 mutIRE is more associated with methylated H3K9 than μter310 IRE, which is in agreement with previous results that also revealed a correlation between reduced transcription and increased H3K9me1 (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our data show that the actively translated μter310 mutIRE is about 2.5-fold more associated with H3K9me1, about 3-fold more associated with H3K9me2, and about 5-fold more associated with H3K9me3 than the non-translated μter310 IRE. NMTGS Depends on the NMD Factor Upf1−Because NMTGS and NMD are triggered by the same signal, namely translation termination at a PTC, we hypothesized that NMD factors involved in PTC recognition would also be required for NMTGS. Although the exact mechanism of PTC recognition is not yet understood, it is clear that Upf1 plays a central role in this process. Upf1 has recently been shown to be a component of the so-called SURF complex (Smg1-Upf1-eRF1-eRF3), which is thought to assemble at ribosomes that terminate at PTCs (25.Kashima I. Yamashita A. Izumi N. Kataoka N. Morishita R. Hoshino S. Ohno M. Dreyfuss G. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Therefore, we depleted Upf1 from the cells by RNAi and tested if this affects NMTGS. HeLa cells expressing the mini-μ IRE or the mini-μ mutIRE constructs were transfected with pSUPERpuro plasmids encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that target Upf1 mRNA for RNAi-mediated degradation (Fig. 4, hUpf1 KD+) or encoding a “scrambled” shRNA with no predicted target in human cells (hUpf1 KD–) (17.Paillusson A. Hirschi N. Vallan C. Azzalin C.M. Muhlemann O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e54Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Untransfected cells were eliminated by treating the cells with puromycin for 48 h. 72 h after transfection the cells were treated with SB for 24 h and then harvested. The relative mRNA levels of the mini-μ reporter genes and of Upf1 were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to the relative levels of endogenous 18 S rRNA. A representative Western blot with extracts from μwt IRE-expressing cells under all four experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 4A to document that Upf1 was very efficiently depleted irrespectively if the cells were treated with SB or not. The relative Upf1 mRNA levels in all Upf1 knockdown samples (hUpf1 KD+) were reduced at least 10-fold compared with the corresponding controls (hUpf KD–) (data not shown). In agreement with earlier results (Fig. 1D), the mRNA level of μter310 mutIRE increased on average 10-fold upon treatment with SB in the control knockdown (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the mRNA level increased only marginally (1.5-fold) upon SB in Upf1-depleted cells, suggesting that Upf1 is required for NMTGS. As expected, the mRNA levels of the translation-inhibited μter310 IRE and of the PTC-free mini-μ constructs (IRE and mutIRE), which all are not subjected to NMTGS and NMD, change only marginally upon SB treatment (between 0.6 and 2-fold). This result shows that NMTGS is lost when PTC recognition (and as a consequence NMD) is abrogated and indicates a mechanistic link between NMTGS and NMD. The recent discovery that the presence of a PTC in a gene can lead to a transcriptional silencing of this gene that exhibits chromatin characteristics typically found in heterochromatic regions and that appears to involve components of the RNAi machinery was unexpected and exciting at the same time (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the physiological significance of this observation is not yet understood, it immediately raised some intriguing mechanistic questions. One of these questions, which we have addressed in this study, concerns the relationship between NMTGS and NMD. So far, the evidence that NMTGS is really PTC-specific was based on correlation; we have observed transcriptional silencing only with PTC+ Ig-μ and Ig-γ minigene constructs but not with missense or silent mutations in these genes or with more sophisticated “frameshift-shift-back” constructs (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, important to test the postulated PTC-specificity of NMTGS by an additional approach. Because recognition of a PTC necessitates decoding of an mRNA open reading frame and because translating ribosomes are the only known cellular entities with this function, it is expected that a PTC-specific process must depend on translation. To test this hypothesis, the use of unspecific translation inhibitors like cycloheximide seemed not suitable in our experimental system because (i) of the pleiotropic effects of such drugs and because (ii) we do not know in which phase of NMTGS translation might be involved. It could be that translation is only necessary for initiation of NMTGS but not for the maintenance of the silenced state. Therefore, we decided to use the IRE system, which allowed us to selectively inhibit translation of our NMTGS reporter mRNA. We could demonstrate that under such conditions, NMTGS is not observed (Figs. 1, D and E, 2, and 4B). Thus, we conclude that transcriptional silencing of a PTC+ gene requires translation of the PTC+ mRNA that it encodes. Because this IRE-mediated inhibition of translation also abrogates NMD (23.Thermann R. Neu-Yilik G. Deters A. Frede U. Wehr K. Hagemeier C. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3484-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar)5 and because in our experimental system the PTC+ mini-μ reporter genes are subjected to both NMD and NMTGS, it was important to use assays that allow to specifically detect transcriptional effects. Among the available assays, nuclear run-on analysis (Fig. 2) is the most direct method to detect differences in transcription rates, but it has the disadvantage that it requires large amounts of nuclei (107 per reaction). Therefore, nuclear run-ons are not feasible for certain experiments, as for example RNAi-mediated knockdowns. Thus, as an alternative method to distinguish between transcriptional (NMTGS) and posttranscriptional (NMD) effects on the steady-state mRNA level, we have established an assay that involves treatment of the cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors. We have previously demonstrated that SB does not interfere with NMD and that the measured changes in mRNA levels mirror the changes detected by run-on analysis (13.Bühler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The finding that NMTGS depends on translation immediately suggested that NMD and NMTGS are mechanistically linked and share the same mechanism for PTC recognition. Consistent with this proposition, μter310 mutIRE mRNA levels did not increase significantly upon SB treatment in cells devoid of Upf1, indicating that the transcriptional silencing of μter310 mutIRE was lost as a consequence of the Upf1 knockdown (Fig. 4B). We cannot exclude that Upf1 indirectly regulates NMTGS, but it is much more likely that it is directly involved, given its characterization as an essential NMD factor involved in PTC recognition (3.Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4.Amrani N. Sachs M.S. Jacobson A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The fact that transcription of the μter310 mutIRE gene is silenced in the cells at the beginning of the experiment and that its transcription activity increases during the 4 days of the Upf1 knockdown further suggests that Upf1 is not only required to establish NMTGS but also for maintaining it. In mechanistic terms, this implies that the entire pathway from PTC recognition to establishment of the transcriptionally silenced chromatin state must be constantly active to maintain NMTGS. If true, this should facilitate future identification of additional factors involved in NMTGS. In summary, the data presented in this study support a model in which NMD and NMTGS represent two different pathways to down-regulate gene expression in response to the detection of an improper translation termination event at a premature termination codon. The result that translation and Upf1 are essential for NMTGS suggests that NMD and NMTGS use the same machinery for PTC recognition, since there is compelling evidence that Upf1 has a crucial role in the discrimination between correct and improper translation termination (for review, see Ref. 4.Amrani N. Sachs M.S. Jacobson A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our data also imply that NMTGS branches from the NMD pathway after Upf1 function. This suggests that the signal for an mRNA to elicit NMTGS would then comprise the recognition of a PTC in combination with a yet unidentified, gene-specific cis-acting element. Clearly, this is only the beginning, and much more work is necessary to further elucidate the mechanisms downstream of PTC recognition leading to mRNA degradation and sometimes to transcriptional silencing of the affected gene.

https://openalex.org/W2086004814,"It has been shown that presenilin is involved in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons, including regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ storage. From studies of primary cultures and cell lines, however, its role in stress-induced responses is still controversial. In the present study we analyzed the effects of presenilin mutations on membrane currents and synaptic functions in response to stress using an in vivo preparation. We examined voltage-gated K+ and Ca2+ currents at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) with voltage-clamp recordings. Our data showed that both currents were generally unaffected by loss-of-function or Alzheimer's disease (AD) -associated presenilin mutations under normal or stress conditions induced by heat shock (HS) or ER stress. In larvae expressing the mutant presenilins, prolonged Ca2+ tail current, reflecting slower deactivation kinetics of Ca2+ channels, was observed 1 day after stress treatments were terminated. It was further demonstrated that the L-type Ca2+ channel was specifically affected under these conditions. Moreover, synaptic plasticity at the NMJ was reduced in larvae expressing the mutant presenilins. At the behavioral level, memory in adult flies was impaired in the presenilin mutants 1 day after HS. The results show that presenilin function is important during the poststress period and its impairment contributes to memory dysfunction observed during adaptation to normal conditions after stress. Our findings suggest a new stress-related mechanism by which presenilin may be implicated in the neuropathology of AD."
