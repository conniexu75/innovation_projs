To understand the conditions under which people felt the most connected, we examined whether changes in overall feelings of social connection varied by household size and composition. In two pre-registered studies, undergraduates in Canada (N Study 1 = 548) and adults primarily from the U.S. and U.K. (N Study 2 = 336) reported their perceived social connection once before and once during the pandemic. In both studies, living with a partner robustly and uniquely buffered shifts in social connection during the first phases of the pandemic (β Study 1 = .22, β Study 2 = .16). In contrast, neither household size nor other aspects of household composition predicted changes in connection. We discuss implications for future social distancing policies that aim to balance physical health with psychological health."

In this study, we focus on factors that differentiate those who are undecided from those who are either willing or unwilling to accept a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Methods An online survey in May 2020 assessed Australian adults’ willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (yes, maybe, no). A multinomial logistical regression of responses (N = 1,313) was used to identify correlates of vaccine willingness between the three groups. Results 65% were willing to vaccinate, with 27% being in the ‘maybe’ category. Respondents were more likely to be in the ‘maybe’ than the ‘yes’ group when they perceived COVID-19 to be less severe, had less trust in science, were less willing to vaccinate for influenza, and were female. They were more likely to be in the ‘maybe’ than ‘no’ group when they perceived COVID-19 as severe, and less likely to be a hoax, had more trust in science, and greater willingness to vaccinate for influenza. A repeat of the survey in November 2020 with a subset of participants found fewer of them saying yes to the vaccine (56%) and more saying maybe (31%). Conclusions The effectiveness of any COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be reliant on maximizing uptake. The significant number of people who remain undecided about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the ongoing devastating consequences of the virus for individuals, communities, and economies, is concerning. Our findings aid current research seeking to inform policy regarding how to convince the undecided to vaccinate."
https://openalex.org/W3122847645,"Background Understanding patterns of multimorbidity in the US older adult population and their relationship with mortality is important for reducing healthcare utilization and improving health. Previous investigations measured multimorbidity as counts of conditions rather than specific combination of conditions. Methods This cross-sectional study with longitudinal mortality follow-up employed latent class analysis (LCA) to develop clinically meaningful subgroups of participants aged 50 and older with different combinations of 13 chronic conditions from the National Health Interview Survey 2002–2014. Mortality linkage with National Death Index was performed through December 2015 for 166,126 participants. Survival analyses were conducted to assess the relationships between LCA classes and all-cause mortality and cause specific mortalities. Results LCA identified five multimorbidity groups with primary characteristics: “healthy” (51.5%), “age-associated chronic conditions” (33.6%), “respiratory conditions” (7.3%), “cognitively impaired” (4.3%) and “complex cardiometabolic” (3.2%). Covariate-adjusted survival analysis indicated “complex cardiometabolic” class had the highest mortality with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 5.30, 99.5% CI [4.52, 6.22]; followed by “cognitively impaired” class (3.34 [2.93, 3.81]); “respiratory condition” class (2.14 [1.87, 2.46]); and “age-associated chronic conditions” class (1.81 [1.66, 1.98]). Patterns of multimorbidity classes were strongly associated with the primary underlying cause of death. The “cognitively impaired” class reported similar number of conditions compared to the “respiratory condition” class but had significantly higher mortality (3.8 vs 3.7 conditions, HR = 1.56 [1.32, 1.85]). Conclusion We demonstrated that LCA method is effective in classifying clinically meaningful multimorbidity subgroup. Specific combinations of conditions including cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms have a substantial detrimental impact on the mortality of older adults. The numbers of chronic conditions experienced by older adults is not always proportional to mortality risk. Our findings provide valuable information for identifying high risk older adults with multimorbidity to facilitate early intervention to treat chronic conditions and reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3123235992,"Antibiotic fixed dose combinations (FDCs) can have clinical advantages such as improving effectiveness and adherence to therapy. However, high use of potentially inappropriate FDCs has been reported, with implications for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and toxicity. We used a pharmaceutical database, IQVIA-Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System (IQVIA-MIDAS®), to estimate sales of antibiotic FDCs from 75 countries in 2015. Antibiotic consumption was estimated using standard units (SU), defined by IQVIA as a single tablet, capsule, ampoule, vial or 5ml oral suspension. For each FDC antibiotic, the approval status was assessed by either registration with the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) or inclusion on the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicines List (EML). A total of 119 antibiotic FDCs were identified, contributing 16.7 x 10 9 SU, equalling 22% of total antibiotic consumption in 2015. The most sold antibiotic FDCs were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin/cloxacillin. The category with the highest consumption volume was aminopenicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor +/- other agents. The majority of antibiotic FDCs (92%; 110/119) were not approved by the US FDA. Of these, the most sold were ampicillin/cloxacillin, cefixime/ofloxacin and metronidazole/spiramycin. More than 80% (98/119) of FDC antibiotics were not compatible with the 2017 WHO EML. The countries with the highest numbers of FDC antibiotics were India (80/119), China (25/119) and Vietnam (19/119). There is high consumption of FDC antibiotics globally, particularly in middle-income countries. The majority of FDC antibiotic were not approved by either US FDA or WHO EML. International initiatives such as clear guidance from the WHO EML on which FDCs are not appropriate may help to regulate the manufacturing and sales of these antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3124179293,"Since 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has experienced an unprecedented rise in acute food insecurity (AFI), and current projections for the year 2020 indicate that more than 100 million Africans are estimated to receive emergency food assistance. Climate-driven drought is one of the main contributing factors to AFI, and timely and appropriate actions can be taken to mitigate impacts of AFI on lives and livelihoods through early warning systems. To support this goal, we use observations of peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of seasonal drought conditions following a rainy season to show that delays in the onset of the rainy season (onset date) can be an effective early indicator of seasonal drought conditions. The core of this study is an evaluation of the relationship of the onset dates and peak NDVI, stratified by AFI risks, calculated using AFI reports by the United States Agency of International Development (USAID)-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Several parts of SSA, mostly located in East Africa (EA), reported the “Crisis” phase of AFI—requiring emergency food assistance—at least one-third of the time between April 2011 to present. The results show that the onset date can effectively explain much of the interannual variability in peak NDVI in the regions with the highest AFI risk level, particularly in EA where the median of correlation (across all the Administrative Unit 2) varies between -0.42 to -0.68. In general, an onset date delay of at least 1 dekad (10 days) increases the likelihood of seasonal drought conditions. In the regions with highest risks of AFI, an onset delay of just 1 dekad doubles the chance of the standardized anomaly of peak NDVI being below -1, making a -1 anomaly the most probable outcome. In those regions, a 2-dekads delay in the onset date is associated with a very high probability (50%) of seasonal drought conditions (-1 standardized anomaly of NDVI). Finally, a multivariate regression analysis between standardized anomaly and onset date anomaly further substantiates the negative impacts of delay in onset date on NDVI anomaly. This relationship is statistically significant over the SSA as a whole, particularly in the EA region. These results imply that the onset date can be used as an additional critical tool to provide alerts of seasonal drought development in the most food-insecure regions of SSA. Early warning systems using onset date as a tool can help trigger effective mid-season responses to save human lives, livestock, and livelihoods, and, therefore, mitigate the adverse impacts of drought hazards."
https://openalex.org/W3124361569,"Water affordability is central to water access but remains a challenge to measure. California enshrined the human right to safe and affordable water in 2012 but the question remains: how should water affordability be measured across the state? This paper contributes to this question in three steps. First, we identify key dimensions of water affordability measures (including scale, volume of water needed to meet ‘basic’ needs, and affordability criteria) and a cross-cutting theme (social equity). Second, using these dimensions, we develop three affordability ratios measured at the water system scale for households with median, poverty level, and deep poverty (i.e., half the poverty level) incomes and estimate the corresponding percentage of households at these income levels. Using multiple measures conveys a fuller picture of affordability given the known limitations of specific affordability measures. Third, we analyze our results disaggregated by a key characteristic of water system vulnerability–water system size. We find that water is relatively affordable for median income households. However, we identify high unaffordability for households in poverty in a large fraction of water systems. We identify several scenarios with different policy implications for the human right to water, such as very small systems with high water bills and low-income households within large water systems. We also characterize how data gaps complicate theoretical ideals and present barriers in human right to water monitoring efforts. This paper presents a systematic approach to measuring affordability and represents the first statewide assessment of water affordability within California’s community water systems."
https://openalex.org/W3123627301,"Background and purpose Organizations strive to increase the work engagement of their employees, as engaged employees are more productive employees, but often neglect the significant effects of work-family balance on work engagement. Numerous studies confirm the importance of work-family balance and work engagement, but there is lack of research that explores the relationship between the concepts. Our research fills a research gap in investigating the impact of work-family balance on work engagement, both directly and through individual perceptions of organizational support for work-family balance. The main aim of our research is to empirically test the relationships between the policies and practices of organizations regarding work-family balance, work-life balance and work engagement. Methods Using validated questionnaires, we collected data on organizational support for work-family balance (family-friendly policies and practices, support by leader, support by co-workers, working hours and complexity of work), work-family balance and work engagement. The quantitative data for our analysis was collected through a survey of 343 online participants who were employees in various positions in companies in Slovenia. The results Our results show that the organization's work-family balance policies and practices, such as support by leader, co-workers, and family-friendly policies and practices, have a positive impact on the individual's work-family balance, that work-family balance leads to an increase in work engagement, and that the individual's perception of the organization's work-family balance support leads to an increase in work engagement. Conclusion Knowledge of important work-family balance implications with an understanding of organizational support for work-family balance and the relationships between the constructs of work-family balance and work engagement can be beneficial to business leaders. This understanding can help them to strengthen employee work engagement through family-friendly policies and practices, and thereby contributing to the area of employee behavior and improving employee productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3124948849,"The ability of butyrate to promote differentiation of cancer cells has important implication for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium butyrate (NaBT) on the energy metabolism of colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells coupled with their differentiation. NaBT increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase indicating differentiation of Caco-2 cells. Changes in the expression of pluripotency-associated markers OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 were characterized during the induced differentiation at mRNA level along with the measures that allowed distinguishing the expression of different transcript variants. The functional activity of mitochondria was studied by high-resolution respirometry. Glycolytic pathway and phosphotransfer network were analyzed using enzymatical assays. The treatment of Caco-2 cells with NaBT increased production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, enhanced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity and caused rearrangement of the cellular phosphotransfer networks. The flexibility of phosphotransfer networks depended on the availability of glutamine, but not glucose in the cell growth medium. These changes were accompanied by suppressed cell proliferation and altered gene expression of the main pluripotency-associated transcription factors. This study supports the view that modulating cell metabolism through NaBT can be an effective strategy for treating CRC. Our data indicate a close relationship between the phosphotransfer performance and metabolic plasticity of CRC, which is associated with the cell differentiation state."
https://openalex.org/W3122815678,"In the social and cognitive sciences, crowdsourcing provides up to half of all research participants. Despite this popularity, researchers typically do not conceptualize participants accurately, as gig-economy worker-participants. Applying theories of employee motivation and the psychological contract between employees and employers, we hypothesized that pay and pay raises would drive worker-participant satisfaction, performance, and retention in a longitudinal study. In an experiment hiring 359 Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers, we found that initial pay, relative increase of pay over time, and overall pay did not have substantial influence on subsequent performance. However, pay significantly predicted participants' perceived choice, justice perceptions, and attrition. Given this, we conclude that worker-participants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, having relatively low power to negotiate pay. Results of this study suggest that researchers wishing to crowdsource research participants using MTurk might not face practical dangers such as decreased performance as a result of lower pay, but they must recognize an ethical obligation to treat Workers fairly."
https://openalex.org/W3124719346,"Background The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly worldwide increasing exponentially in Italy. To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the people at high risk of infection. Hence, we aimed (i) to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, (ii) to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, and (iii) to compare it with unspecific scores. Methods Retrospective case-control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each person with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS) was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. Discriminant power was used to compare SIS performance with that of other comorbidity scores. Results Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinson’s disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS = 4) 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS = 1). Conclusion Conditions and diseases making people more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified by the current study. Our results support decision-makers in identifying high-risk people and adopting of preventive measures to minimize the spread of further epidemic waves."
https://openalex.org/W3121193230,"A limited number of publications have identified risk factors for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Healthcare Providers (HCPs). We aimed to assess the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and the predicting factors related to COVID-19 among HCPs in Egypt. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among HCPs via an online questionnaire. Out of 440 responses, a total of 385 complete responses were analyzed. The responders’ mean age was 37.5±9.4 years, 215 (55.8%) of the participants were males. They included 77 (20%) confirmed COVID-19 cases; most of them had mild (58.6%) or moderate symptoms (30%), and (9.1%) were asymptomatic. Almost all sustained infection while on duty (97.4%). The sources of infection were either infected patients (39%), colleagues (22.1%), household contacts (5.2%) or uncertain (33.8%). The sources were symptomatic in only 62.3% of cases. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic sources accounted for 37.7% of the cases. Exposure occurred during healthcare provision in 66.3% of the cases. The presence of co-morbidities (OR = 2.53, CI 1.47–4.38, P = 0.001), working more than 8 hours per day in isolation hospital (OR = 3.09, CI 1.02–9.35, P = 0.046), training on hand hygiene (OR = 2.31, CI 1.05–5.08, P = 0.038) and adherence to IPC measures (OR = 2.11, CI 1.16–3.81, P = 0.014) were the significant predictors of COVID-19. In conclusion, COVID-19 occurred in 20% of responders. Silent spread from asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients, and infected colleagues in hospital settings is an alarming sign. Proactive infection prevention and control measures are highly encouraged on both strategic and operational levels. Reconsideration of surveillance strategy and work-related regulations in healthcare settings are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3124317956,"Purpose Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) frequently suffer from supraventricular tachycardias (SVT). The main purpose of our study was to identify the cumulative incidence of SVT in patients with different etiologies of PH. The secondary objective was to analyse the clinical impact of SVT. Methods We retrospectively studied the prevalence of SVT and the clinical outcome in 755 patients (41% males; 60 ± 15 years; mean follow-up 3.8 ± 2.8 years) with PH of different etiologies. The prevalence of SVT was analysed separately in isolated pre-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) and in patients with combined post- and pre-capillary PH (Cpc-PH). Results The prevalence of SVT in the Ipc-PH group (n = 641) was 25% (n = 162). The most prevalent arrhythmias were atrial fibrillation followed by a typical atrial flutter (17% and 4.4% of all Icp-PH patients). An excessive prevalence of SVT was found in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease (35%, p = 0.01). Out of the overall study population, Cpc-PH was present in 114 (15%) patients. Patients with Cpc-PH manifested a higher prevalence of SVT than subjects with Ipc-PH (58; 51% vs. 162; 25%; p &lt;0.0001) and were more likely to have persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (38; 29% vs. 61; 10%; p &lt;0.0001). Parameters significantly associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis included age, male gender, functional exercise capacity and right atrial diameter (p &lt; 0.05). Neither diagnosis of SVT nor type of arrhythmia predicted mortality. Conclusions The study detected a significant prevalence of SVT in the population of PH of different origins. Different spectrum and prevalence of arrhythmia might be expected in different etiologies of PH. Patients with an elevated post-capillary pressure showed a higher arrhythmia prevalence, predominantly due to an excessive number of atrial fibrillations. The diagnosis of SVT was not associated with mortality."

Solid dispersion systems (SD) of DCN were prepared by solvent evaporation, using hydrophilic polymers. In-vitro dissolution studies were performed and dissolution parameters were evaluated. I-Optimal factorial design was employed to study the effect of formulation variables (drug:polymer ratio and polymer type) on the measured responses including; drug content (DC) (%), dissolution efficiency at 15 min (DE (15 min)%) and 60 min (DE (60 min)%) and mean dissolution time (MDT) (min). The optimized SD was selected, prepared and evaluated, allowing 10.83 and 3.42 fold increase in DE (15 min)%, DE (60 min)%, respectively and 6.07 decrease in MDT, compared to plain drug. DSC, XRD analysis and SEM micrographs confirmed complete amorphization of DCN within the optimized SD. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was employed to predict PK parameters of DCN in middle aged healthy adults and geriatrics. Simcyp® software established in-vivo plasma concentration time curves of the optimized SD, compared to plain DCN. Relative bioavailability of the optimized SD compared to plain drug was 229.52% and 262.02% in healthy adults and geriatrics, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3122047258,"Fish populations subject to heavy exploitation are expected to evolve over time smaller average body sizes. We introduce Stackelberg evolutionary game theory to show how fisheries management should be adjusted to mitigate the potential negative effects of such evolutionary changes. We present the game of a fisheries manager versus a fish population, where the former adjusts the harvesting rate and the net size to maximize profit, while the latter responds by evolving the size at maturation to maximize the fitness. We analyze three strategies: i) ecologically enlightened (leading to a Nash equilibrium in game-theoretic terms); ii) evolutionarily enlightened (leading to a Stackelberg equilibrium) and iii) domestication (leading to team optimum) and the corresponding outcomes for both the fisheries manager and the fish. Domestication results in the largest size for the fish and the highest profit for the manager. With the Nash approach the manager tends to adopt a high harvesting rate and a small net size that eventually leads to smaller fish. With the Stackelberg approach the manager selects a bigger net size and scales back the harvesting rate, which lead to a bigger fish size and a higher profit. Overall, our results encourage managers to take the fish evolutionary dynamics into account. Moreover, we advocate for the use of Stackelberg evolutionary game theory as a tool for providing insights into the eco-evolutionary consequences of exploiting evolving resources."
https://openalex.org/W3124920842,"Background Despite the fact that an educational programme for parents of youth tennis players has been launched recently, there is a need to empower parents of athletes in sustaining the combination of education and sport careers (i.e., dual career) of their talented and elite athletes across sports. The aim of this study was to explore the parents’ view of their role as dual career supporters and their need for educational support in this area. Methods In total, 115 parents (F = 49, M = 66) of athletes (14–23 yrs) engaged in full time academic education (high school/university) and competitive (e.g., National, International) sports (individual = 12, team = 9) in five European Member States (e.g., France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia) took part in national workshops. The workshops involved discussing five themes and agreeing statements relevant to assist parents supporting their children as dual career athletes: 1) the athletes’ needs; 2) the sports environment; 3) the academic environment; 4) dual career-related policies and services; 5) The educational methods for parenting dual career athletes. Results A final list of 80 agreed statements were identified: 25 statements mainly related to the sports entourage; 23 to information on dual career-related policies and services; 22 to the athletes’ needs; 17 to the academic entourage, and 8 to the relevant educational resources to parenting dual career athletes, respectively. Conclusions This cross-national qualitative research synthesized the parents’ perspectives about their needs and the most relevant content of an educational programme for parenting dual career athletes. The findings of this research will help influence the formulation of effective education strategies on parenting dual career athletes to ensure an optimal supportive environment for the successful combination of high-level sport and education careers."
https://openalex.org/W3113528911,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are common and known to have consequences for individuals’ adult health, leading to a higher risk of illness. The aims of the study were to investigate the ACEs in couples, to examine the extent of assortative mating and to investigate the association between the relationship of the load of ACEs within couples and health outcomes, one year after the birth of a common child. At antenatal clinics in Sweden 818 couples were recruited and investigated one year after the birth of a common child answering a questionnaire including the exposure to ten ACE categories and several outcome variables. In total, 59% of both mothers and partners reported exposure to at least one of the ten ACE categories. Among the mothers 11% and among the partners 9% reported exposure to ≥4 ACE categories (p = 0.12). There was a correlation between the numbers of ACE categories reported by the mothers and their partners (Spearman’s ρ = 0.18, p&lt;0.001). This association pertained to six of the ten ACE categories. In multiple logistic regression analyses, there were associations between the ACE exposure load and unfavourable outcomes among the mothers, the partners and within the couples. Unfavourable outcomes concerning health were most prominent in couples where both members reported exposures to ≥4 ACE categories (self-rated bad health (OR 13.82; CI 2.75–69.49), anxiety (OR 91.97; CI 13.38–632.07), depression (OR 17.42; CI 2.14–141.78) and perceived stress (OR 11.04; CI 2.79–43.73)). Mothers exposed to ACEs tend to have partners also exposed to ACEs. Exposure to ACEs was associated with bad health and unfavourable life conditions within the couples, especially among couples where both members reported exposure to multiple ACEs. These results should stimulate incentives to find, to support and to treat individuals and couples where both members report multiple ACEs. The consequences for the children should be further studied as well as how these families should be treated in health care and society."
https://openalex.org/W3123539866,"Approximately 500,000 new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are reported annually. Radiation therapy is an important treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The survival rate of patients with HNSCC remained low (50%) in decades because of radiation therapy failure caused by the radioresistance of HNSCC cells. This study aimed to identify PI3K inhibitors that can enhance radiosensitivity. Results showed that pan-Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 and class I α-specific PI3K inhibitor BYL719 dose-dependently reduced the growth of OSCC cells but not that of radioresistant OML1-R cells. The combination treatment of BKM120 or BYL719 with radiation showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on OSCC cells and radioresistant OML1-R cells. Furthermore, the enhanced inhibitory effect of the combination treatment was confirmed in patient-derived OSCC cells. The triple combination treatment of mTOR inhibitor AZD2014 and BKM120 or AZD2014 and BYL719 with radiation showed a significantly enhanced inhibitory effect on radioresistant OML1-R cells. These results suggest that the PI3K inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents with radiosensitivity for patients with OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3123351092,"Introduction Self-reported levels of disability in individuals with low back pain (LBP) have not improved in the last decade. A broader perspective and a more comprehensive management framework may improve disability outcomes. We recently developed and validated the Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model, which aims to identify the domains driving pain and disability to guide clinical decisions. The objectives of this study were to determine the applicability of the PDDM model to a LBP population and the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic trial, as well as to explore clinicians’ perceived acceptability of the PDDM model’s use in clinical settings. Methods This study was an one-arm prospective feasibility trial. Participants included physiotherapists working with a population suffering from LBP and their patients aged 18 years or older presenting with a primary complaint of LBP that sought a new referral and deemed fit for rehabilitation from private and public clinical settings. Clinicians participated in a one-day workshop on the integration of the PDDM model into their clinical practice, and were asked to report various LBP-related outcomes via self-reported questionnaires (i.e., impact of pain on physical function, nervous system dysfunctions, cognitive-emotional factors, work disabilities) at baseline and at six-week follow-up. Physiotherapists’ acceptability of the use of the PDDM model and appreciation of the training were assessed via semi-structured phone interviews. Analyses focused on a description of the model’s applicability to a LBP population, feasibility outcomes and acceptability measures. Results Applicablity of the PDDM model was confirmed since it successfully established the profile of patients according to the elements of each categories, and each of the 5 domains of the model was represented among the study sample. Trial was deemed feasible contingent upon few modifications as our predefined success criteria for the feasibility outcomes were met but feasibility issues pertaining to data collection were highlighted. Twenty-four (24) clinicians and 61 patients were recruited within the study’s timeframe. Patient’s attrition rate (29%) and clinicians’ compliance to the study protocol were adequate. Clinicians’ perceived acceptability of the use of the model in clinical settings and their appreciation of the training and online resources were both positive. Recommendations to improve the model’s integration in clinical practice, content of the workshop and feasibility of data collection methods were identified for future studies. A positive effect for all patients’ reported outcome measures were also observed. All outcome measures except for the PainDetect questionnaire showed a statistically significant reduction post-intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion These findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential of the PDDM model to optimize LBP management as well as conducting a future larger-scale pragmatic trial to determine its effectiveness.

https://openalex.org/W3124509117,"Introduction Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 suppresses pro-inflammatory IL-12b expression after Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in colonic macrophages, as part of the innate immunity Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-NF-κB activation system. This homeostatic mechanism limits excess inflammation in the intestinal mucosa, as it constantly interacts with the gut flora. This effect is reversed with Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a class I HDAC, siRNA, suggesting it is mediated through HDAC3. Given alveolar macrophages’ prominent role in Acute Lung Injury (ALI), we aim to determine whether a similar regulatory mechanism exists in the typically sterile pulmonary microenvironment. Methods Levels of mRNA and protein for IL-10, and IL-12b were determined by qPCR and ELISA/Western Blot respectively in naïve and LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages. Expression of the NF-κB intermediaries was also similarly assessed. Experiments were repeated with AS101 (an IL-10 protein synthesis inhibitor), MS-275 (a selective class 1 HDAC inhibitor), or both. Results LPS stimulation upregulated all proinflammatory mediators assayed in this study. In the presence of LPS, inhibition of IL-10 and/or class 1 HDACs resulted in both synergistic and independent effects on these signaling molecules. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR on key components of the TLR4 signaling cascade demonstrated significant diversity in IL-10 and related gene expression in the presence of LPS. Inhibition of IL-10 secretion and/or class 1 HDACs in the presence of LPS independently affected the transcription of MyD88, IRAK1, Rela and the NF-κB p50 subunit. Interestingly, by quantitative ELISA inhibition of IL-10 secretion and/or class 1 HDACs in the presence of LPS independently affected the secretion of not only IL-10, IL-12b, and TNFα, but also proinflammatory mediators CXCL2, IL-6, and MIF. These results suggest that IL-10 and class 1 HDAC activity regulate both independent and synergistic mechanisms of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine signaling. Conclusions Alveolar macrophages after inflammatory stimulation upregulate both IL-10 and IL-12b production, in a highly class 1 HDAC-dependent manner. Class 1 HDACs appear to help maintain the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory IL-12b and IL-10 respectively. Class 1 HDACs may be considered as targets for the macrophage-initiated pulmonary inflammation in ALI in a preclinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3124711118,"Robinia pseudoacacia L. is an interesting example of how one plant species can be considered invasive or useful depending on its environment. In the past this tree species was planted for decorative purposes and for wood in Poland. For many years it was recommended in poor and degraded habitats because it facilitated late-successional plant species. The aim of this study was to verify if black locust can still be regarded as a resistant tree species in urban greenery. The health condition of old tree specimens growing along streets and in parks was compared. The occurrence of pests and pathogens on R . pseudoacacia trees was assessed and the content of mineral elements in leaves was examined. The research results showed that the health of black locust trees growing in the urban environment in Polish cities, especially along streets (in comparison to park sites), deteriorated significantly due to the interaction of harmful biotic and abiotic factors. Increased level of toxic metals (Fe, Zn, Pb, Mn and Cd) in plant tissues and the accumulation of pests and pathogens negatively influenced the health of R . pseudoacacia ."
https://openalex.org/W3122322372,"Several cytoskeleton-associated proteins and signaling pathways work in concert to regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and migration. Although the leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1) has been shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton, its function in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics is, as yet, not fully understood. We have recently demonstrated that the bimolecular complex between LSP1 and myosin1e controls actin cytoskeleton remodeling during phagocytosis. In this study, we show that LSP1 downregulation severely impairs cell migration, lamellipodia formation, and focal adhesion dynamics in macrophages. Inhibition of the interaction between LSP1 and myosin1e also impairs these processes resulting in poorly motile cells, which are characterized by few and small lamellipodia. Furthermore, cells in which LSP1-myosin1e interaction is inhibited are typically associated with inefficient focal adhesion turnover. Collectively, our findings show that the LSP1-myosin1e bimolecular complex plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion dynamics required for cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W3123982133,"Production and perception of birdsong critically depends on early developmental experience. In species where singing is a sexually dimorphic trait, early life song experience may affect later behavior differently between sexes. It is known that both male and female songbirds acquire a life-long memory of early song experience, though its function remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that male and female birds express a preference for their fathers’ song, but do so differently depending on the developmental stage. We measured preference for their father’s song over an unfamiliar one in both male and female Bengalese finches at multiple time points across ontogeny, using phonotaxis and vocal response as indices of preference. We found that in males, selective approach to their father’s song decreased as they developed while in females, it remained stable regardless of age. This may correspond to a higher sensitivity to tutor song in young males while they are learning and a retained sensitivity in females because song is a courtship signal that is used throughout life. In addition, throughout development, males vocalized less frequently during presentation of their father’s song compared to unfamiliar song, whereas females emitted more calls to their father’s song. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of why songbirds acquire and maintain such a robust song memory."
https://openalex.org/W3124596816,"The phenomenon of a massive vertebral deformity was recorded in the radiating Labeobarbus assemblage from the middle reaches of the Genale River (south-eastern Ethiopia, East Africa). Within this sympatric assemblage, five trophic morphs—generalized, lipped, piscivorous and two scraping feeders—were reported between 1993 and 2019. In 2009, a new morph with prevalence of ~10% was discovered. The new morph, termed ‘short’, had an abnormally shortened vertebral column and a significantly deeper body. This type of deformity is common in farmed Atlantic salmon and other artificially reared fish, but is rare in nature. In the Genale Labeobarbus assemblage, the deformity was present exclusively within the generalized and lipped morphs. The short morph had between seven and 36 deformed (compressed and/or fused) vertebrae. Their body depth was positively correlated with number of deformed vertebrae. In another collection in 2019, the short morph was still present at a frequency of 11%. Various environmental and genetic factors could contribute to the development of this deformity in the Genale Labeobarbus , but based on the available data, it is impossible to confidently identify the key factor(s). Whether the result of genetics, the environment, or both, this deep-bodied phenotype is assumed to be an anti-predator adaptation, as there is evidence of its selective advantage in the generalized morph. The Genale monstrosity is the first reported case of a massive deformity of the vertebral column in a natural population of African fishes."
https://openalex.org/W3116495150,"Recent findings on Antibiotic Resistance (AR) have brought renewed attention to the comparison of data on AR from human and animal sectors. This is however a major challenge since the data is not harmonized. This study performs a comparative analysis of data on resistance combinations in Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) from different routine surveillance and monitoring systems for human and different animal populations in Germany. Data on E . coli isolates were collected between 2014 and 2017 from human clinical isolates, non-clinical animal isolates from food-producing animals and food, and clinical animal isolates from food-producing and companion animals from national routine surveillance and monitoring for AR in Germany. Sixteen possible resistance combinations to four antibiotics—ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin–for these populations were used for hierarchical clustering (Euclidian and average distance). All analyses were performed with the software R 3.5.1 (Rstudio 1.1.442). Data of 333,496 E . coli isolates and forty-one different human and animal populations were included in the cluster analysis. Three main clusters were detected. Within these three clusters, all human populations (intensive care unit (ICU), general ward and outpatient care) showed similar relative frequencies of the resistance combinations and clustered together. They demonstrated similarities with clinical isolates from different animal populations and most isolates from pigs from both non-clinical and clinical isolates. Isolates from healthy poultry demonstrated similarities in relative frequencies of resistance combinations and clustered together. However, they clustered separately from the human isolates. All isolates from different animal populations with low relative frequencies of resistance combinations clustered together. They also clustered separately from the human populations. Cluster analysis has been able to demonstrate the linkage among human isolates and isolates from various animal populations based on the resistance combinations. Further analyses based on these findings might support a better one-health approach for AR in Germany."

We compute the maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs) of ( μ , λ) by applying the Newton-Raphson method (NRM) and expectation maximization algorithm (EMA). In addition, the estimate hazard functions and reliability are evaluated by applying the invariance property of MLEs. We calculate the Fisher information matrix (FIM) by applying the missing information rule, which is important in finding the asymptotic confidence interval. Finally, the different proposed estimation methods are compared in simulation studies. A simulation example and real data example are analyzed to illustrate our estimation methods."

Although the skeletal muscle has been a primary focus, exercise also mediates robust adaptations in white adipose tissue. To determine if exercise affects in vivo adipocyte formation, fifty-two, sixteen-week-old C57BL/6J mice were allowed access to unlocked running wheels [Exercise (EX) group; n = 13 males, n = 13 females] or to locked wheels [Sedentary (SED) group; n = 13 males, n = 13 females] for 4-weeks. In vivo adipocyte formation was assessed by the incorporation of deuterium (2H) into the DNA of newly formed adipocytes in the inguinal and gonadal adipose depots. A two-way ANOVA revealed that exercise significantly decreased new adipocyte formation in the adipose tissue of mice in the EX group relative to the SED group (activity effect; P = 0.02). This reduction was observed in male and female mice (activity effect; P = 0.03). Independent analysis of the depots showed a significant reduction in adipocyte formation in the inguinal (P = 0.05) but not in the gonadal (P = 0.18) of the EX group. We report for the first time that exercise significantly reduced in vivo adipocyte formation in the adipose tissue of EX mice using a physiologic metabolic 2H2O-labeling protocol."
https://openalex.org/W3125076945,"In the last decades, climate change has caused an increase in mean temperatures and a reduction in average rainfall in southern Europe, which is expected to reduce resource availability for herbivores. Resource availability can influence animals' physical condition and population growth. However, much less is known on its effects on reproductive performance and sexual selection. In this study, we assessed the impact of three environmental factors related to climate change (rainfall, temperature and vegetation index) on Iberian red deer Cervus elaphus hispanicus reproductive timing and sexual behaviour, and their effects on the opportunity for sexual selection in the population. We measured rutting phenology as rut peak date, the intensity of male rutting activity as roaring rate, and the opportunity for sexual selection from the distribution of females among harem holding males in Doñana Biological Reserve (Southwest Spain), from data of daily observations collected during the rut over a period of 25 years. For this study period, we found a trend for less raining and hence poorer environmental conditions, which associated with delayed rutting season and decreased rutting intensity, but that appeared to favour a higher degree of polygyny and opportunity for sexual selection, all these relationships being modulated by population density and sex ratio. This study highlights how climate change (mainly rainfall reduction in this area) can alter the conditions for mating and the opportunity for sexual selection in a large terrestrial mammal."
https://openalex.org/W3122737791,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is among the most abundant organic pollutants and is widely distributed in the environment, wildlife, and humans. Its toxic effects and biological hazards are associated with its long elimination half-life in humans. However, how it affects renal tubular cells (RTCs) remains unclear. In this study, PFOS was observed to mediate the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, followed by the activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, which induced autophagy in RTCs. Although PFOS treatment induced autophagy after 6 h, prolonged treatment (24 h) reduced the autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP), leading to increased p62 protein accumulation and subsequent apoptosis. The increase in LMP was visualized through increased green fluorescence with acridine orange staining, and this was attenuated by 3-methyladenine, an autophagy inhibitor. N-acetyl cysteine and an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (U0126) attenuated autophagy and apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that ROS activation and ROS-mediated phosphorylated ERK1/2 activation are essential to activate autophagy, resulting in the apoptosis of PFOS-treated RTCs. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of PFOS-mediated renal toxicity."

While several prognostic indices for mortality in dialysis patients have been developed, their performance among elderly patients initiating dialysis is unknown, despite great need for reliable prognostication in that context. To assess the performance of 6 previously validated prognostic indices to predict 3 and/or 6 months mortality in a cohort of elderly incident dialysis patients. Study design Validation study of prognostic indices using retrospective cohort data. Indices were compared using the concordance (“c”)-statistic, i.e. area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Calibration, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were also calculated. Setting &amp; participants Incident elderly (age ≥75 years; n = 349) dialysis patients at a tertiary referral center. Established predictors Variables for six validated prognostic indices for short term (3 and 6 month) mortality prediction (Foley, NCI, REIN, updated REIN, Thamer, and Wick) were extracted from the electronic medical record. The indices were individually applied as per each index specifications to predict 3- and/or 6-month mortality. Results In our cohort of 349 patients, mean age was 81.5±4.4 years, 66% were male, and median survival was 351 days. The c-statistic for the risk prediction indices ranged from 0.57 to 0.73. Wick ROC 0.73 (0.68, 0.78) and Foley 0.67 (0.61, 0.73) indices performed best. The Foley index was weakly calibrated with poor overall model fit (p &lt;0.01) and overestimated mortality risk, while the Wick index was relatively well-calibrated but underestimated mortality risk. Limitations Small sample size, use of secondary data, need for imputation, homogeneous population. Conclusion Most predictive indices for mortality performed moderately in our incident dialysis population. The Wick and Foley indices were the best performing, but had issues with under and over calibration. More accurate indices for predicting survival in older patients with kidney failure are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3124225347,"Background The complications inherent to conization include vaginal bleeding, cervical stenosis, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and deep dyspareunia. Cervical stenosis is the most important complication due to the clinical repercussions. Studies show rates of cervical stenosis ranging from 1.3 to 19% after the Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP). Objective Our primary outcome was to compare the role of a new endocervical device to prevent cervical stenosis after LEEP in patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). Methods A randomized clinical trial was performed including phases II and III for evaluation of a new device for cervical stenosis prevention. In Phase II, we included 25 patients who underwent LEEP and placement of the device to assess its toxicity and efficacy. In phase III, we compared two groups (with and without the use of an anti-stenosis device) to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Results From August 2015 to June 2018, 265 participants were randomized (Phase II: 25, Phase III: 120 with DUDA and 120 without DUDA). The toxicity during phase II was observed in only one patient (4%) with pain grade &gt; 7. There were 7 cases of toxicity during Phase III, 2 in the DUDA group (1.8%), and 5 in the No DUDA group (4.5%). The complications rate was numerically higher in the No DUDA group (2.5x higher) than the DUDA group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.52). The rate of cervical stenosis in DUDA group was (4–7,3%), and in No DUDA group was (4.3–5.8%) (p = 0.5). We did not find a significant difference when comparing the evolution at 3, 6, and 12 months in terms of cervical patency and visualization of the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) during colposcopy. The DUDA group exhibited 15% to 19% nonvisualization of the SCJ, whereas that rate ranged from 10 to 12% in the No DUDA group. Conclusions The rate of cervical stenosis was not different comparing the use of a new device, specifically produced to prevent cervical stenosis, compared to no use after LEEP procedure. This clinical trial opens up space for a discussion of the utility of using cervical stenosis devices after LEEP. Perhaps in another type of conization it can be evaluated to avoid cervical stenosis."

How do these inordinately influential people think about the world and about our common future? In this paper, we test a) whether members of the tech elite share a common, meritocratic view of the world, b) whether they have a “mission” for the future, and c) how they view democracy as a political system. Our data set consists of information about the 100 richest people in the tech world, according to Forbes, and rests on their published pronouncements on Twitter, as well as on their statements on the websites of their philanthropic endeavors. Automated “bag-of-words” text and sentiment analyses reveal that the tech elite has a more meritocratic view of the world than the general US Twitter-using population. The tech elite also frequently promise to “make the world a better place,” but they do not differ from other extremely wealthy people in this respect. However, their relationship to democracy is contradictory. Based on these results, we conclude that the tech elite may be thought of as a “class for itself” in Marx’s sense—a social group that shares particular views of the world, which in this case means meritocratic, missionary, and inconsistent democratic ideology."

However, evidence from low-income countries is lacking. The objective of this study was to measure the association between co-morbid mental disorders and quality of life and functioning in people with epilepsy.A facility-based, community ascertained cross-sectional survey was carried out in selected districts of the Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Participants were identified in the community and referred to primary health care (PHC) clinics. Those diagnosed by PHC workers were recruited. Co-morbid mental disorders were measured using a standardised, semi-structured clinical interview administered by mental health professionals. The main outcome, quality of life, was measured using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-10p). The secondary outcome, functional disability, was assessed using the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-2).The prevalence of comorbid mental disorders was 13.9%. Comorbid mental disorders were associated with poorer quality of life (Adjusted (Adj.) β -13.27; 95% CI -23.28 to-3.26) and greater disability (multiplier of WHODAS-2 score 1.62; 95% CI 1.05, 2.50) after adjusting for hypothesised confounding factors. Low or very low relative wealth (Adj. β = -12.57, 95% CI -19.94 to-5.20), higher seizure frequency (Adj.β coef. = -1.92, 95% CI -2.83 to -1.02), and poor to intermediate social support (Adj. β coef. = -9.66, 95% CI -16.51 to -2.81) were associated independently with decreased quality of life. Higher seizure frequency (multiplier of WHODAS-2 score 1.11; 95% CI 1.04, 1.19) was associated independently with functional disability.Co-morbid mental disorders were associated with poorer quality of life and impairment, independent of level of seizure control.

https://openalex.org/W3121646366,"Monolignol glucosides are storage forms of monolignols, which are polymerized to lignin to strengthen plant cell walls. The conversion of monolignol glucosides to monolignols is catalyzed by monolignol β-glucosidases. Rice Os4BGlu18 β-glucosidase catalyzes hydrolysis of the monolignol glucosides, coniferin, syringin, and p -coumaryl alcohol glucoside more efficiently than other natural substrates. To understand more clearly the basis for substrate specificity of a monolignol β-glucosidase, the structure of Os4BGlu18 was determined by X-ray crystallography. Crystals of Os4BGlu18 and its complex with δ-gluconolactone diffracted to 1.7 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. Two protein molecules were found in the asymmetric unit of the P 2 1 2 1 2 1 space group of their isomorphous crystals. The Os4BGlu18 structure exhibited the typical (β/α) 8 TIM barrel of glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1), but the four variable loops and two disulfide bonds appeared significantly different from other known structures of GH1 β-glucosidases. Molecular docking studies of the Os4BGlu18 structure with monolignol substrate ligands placed the glycone in a similar position to the δ-gluconolactone in the complex structure and revealed the interactions between protein and ligands. Molecular docking, multiple sequence alignment, and homology modeling identified amino acid residues at the aglycone-binding site involved in substrate specificity for monolignol β-glucosides. Thus, the structural basis of substrate recognition and hydrolysis by monolignol β-glucosidases was elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W3122483542,"Background and aim A measles outbreak occurred in Greece during 2017–2018 affecting mainly pediatric population. The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases diagnosed in the major pediatric tertiary hospital of Athens, where 26.5% of national pediatric measles cases were diagnosed and treated. Methods This is a retrospective study of children 0–16 years old, who presented at the emergency department and/or were hospitalized with clinical presentation compatible with measles and diagnosis was confirmed with molecular detection of the measles RNA in pharyngeal swabs. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics were retrieved from medical records and analyzed. Results A total of 578 children with measles were identified during the study period. 322 (55.7%) were male with median age 36 months (range:1–193), while the largest number of documented cases (251; 43.4%) were children aged 1–5 years. Most children (429/578; 74.2%) belonged to the Roma minority and only 64 (11.1%) had Greek origin. 497 (91.5%) children were unvaccinated and 37 (6.8%) were partially vaccinated with measles vaccine. Hospitalization was required for 342 (59.2%) children, whereas one or more complications were reported in 230 (67.2%) of them. Most frequent complications were elevated transaminases (139; 40.6%), acute otitis media (72; 21%), dehydration (67; 19.6%) and pneumonia (58; 16.9%). 11 children (3.2%) required intensive care admission for altered mental status/status epilepticus (3), sepsis (2) and ARDS (6). 119/342 (34.8%) children were treated with antibiotics because of possible or confirmed bacterial coinfection. One death was reported, concerning an 11-month-old unvaccinated infant, with underlying dystrophy, who died of sepsis. Conclusion Measles is not an innocent viral infection, as it is still characterized by high morbidity and complications rates. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated populations could trigger new outbreaks, resulting in significant cost in public health. To avoid future measles outbreaks, high vaccination coverage should be achieved, as well as closing immunity gaps in the population and ensuring high-quality measles surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3123931494,"Pecan bacterial leaf scorch caused by Xylella fastidiosa is an emerging disease for the U.S. and international pecan industries and can be transmitted from scion to rootstock via grafting. With the expanse of global transportation and trade networks, phytosanitation is critical for reducing the spread of economically significant pathogens, such as X . fastidiosa . We developed and evaluated thermal treatments using microwave irradiation and microwave absorbers [sterile deionized water (dH 2 O) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)] as novel disinfectant methods for remediating X . fastidiosa in pecan scions. Partial submergence of scions in dH 2 O or CNT dispersions resulted in the transport of microwave absorbers in the xylem tissue via transpiration but did not compromise plant health. The microwave absorbers effectively transferred heat to the scion wood to reach an average temperature range of 55–65°C. Microwave radiation exposure for 6 sec (3 sec for two iterations) of CNT- or dH 2 O-treated scions reduced the frequency of X . fastidiosa -positive in pecan scions without negatively affecting plant viability when compared to the control group (dH 2 O-treated with no microwave). The efficacy of the new thermal treatments based on microwave irradiation was comparable to the conventional hot-water treatment (HWT) method, in which scions were submerged in 46°C water for 30 min. Microwave irradiation can be employed to treat X . fastidiosa -infected scions where the conventional HWT treatment is not feasible. This study is the first report to demonstrate novel thermal treatment methods based on the microwave irradiation and microwave absorbers of dH 2 O and CNT as an application for the phytosanitation of xylem-inhabiting bacteria in graftwood."
https://openalex.org/W3124395521,"Introduction Hospital-based practices today remain predominantly disease-oriented, focusing on individual clinical specialties with less visibility on a comprehensive picture of each patient’s health needs. To tackle the challenge of growing multimorbidity worldwide, practices without disease-specific focus have shown better integration of services. However, as we move away from the familiar disease-specific approaches of care delivery, many of us are still learning how to implement generalist care in a cost-effective manner. Methods This mixed-method case study, which centred on a specialist-led General Medicine model implemented at an acute hospital in Singapore, aimed to (1) quantitatively summarise its clinical outcomes, and (2) qualitatively describe the challenges and lessons gathered from the pragmatic implementation of the care model. Quantitative hospital data were extracted from databases and summarised. Qualitative staff-reported experiences and insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Quantitative findings revealed that the generalist care model was implemented with high fidelity, where more than 75% of patients admitted were placed under General Medicine’s or General Surgery’s care. The mean length of stay was 2.6 days, and the 30-day post-discharge readmission rate was 15%. Inpatient mortality rate was found to be 2.8%, and the average gross hospitalisation bill amounted to SGD3,085.30. For qualitative findings, themes concerning feasibility and operational aspects of the implementation were grouped into categories- (1) Feasibility of ‘One Care Team’ approach, (2) Enablers required for meaningful generalist care, (3) Challenges surrounding information sharing, (4) Lack of integration with the community to facilitate care transition, and (5) Evolving roles of self-management. The findings were rich, with some being identified as barriers that could benefit from system-level de-constraining. Discussion This case study was an illustration of our pursuit for an integrated solution to rising prevalence of multimorbidity. While quantitative findings indicated that a pivot towards General Medicine might be possible, data also revealed gaps in clinical outcomes, especially in readmission rates. These findings corroborated with much of the lessons and challenges gathered from qualitative interviews, specifically surrounding the lack of receptacles in the community to facilitate care transition, training, and competency of generalists in holistic management of complex multimorbid cases, as well as inadequate infrastructure to allow information sharing between providers. Thus, a multi-pronged approach might be required to develop a new and sustainable care model for patients with multimorbidity in the long run. In the short to medium transitional period, nonetheless, the specialist-led General Medicine care model demonstrated might be a viable interim approach, especially in circumstances where trained medical generalists remained limited."
https://openalex.org/W3124467721,"Objectives To investigate the longitudinal association of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) with loss of independence (LOI) or death among independent community-dwelling older adults. Design Population-based cohort study. Setting The Locomotive Syndrome and Health Outcome in Aizu Cohort Study (LOHAS), Minami-Aizu Town and Tadami Town, Fukushima, Japan. Participants A total of 1,580 participants aged ≥65 years who underwent a health check-up conducted by LOHAS in 2010. Measurements Exposure was defined as the presence of UUI, which was measured by a questionnaire based on the definition of UUI from the International Continence Society. The primary outcome was defined as incidence of LOI or death. After the check-up in 2010, the outcome was monitored until March 2014. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to estimate the hazard ratio for the outcome. Ten potential confounders were adjusted in the analysis. Furthermore, we defined the secondary outcomes as two separate outcomes, LOI and death, and performed the same analysis. Results Among all participants, 328 reported UUI. The incidence rates of the outcome were 20.4 and 11.4 (per 1,000 person–years) among participants with and without UUI, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, those who experienced UUI showed a substantial association with LOI or death (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.01–2.68). However, they did not show such an association with LOI alone (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.49–2.33). On the other hand, those with UUI exhibited a substantial association with death (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.22–4.31). Conclusions In this study, UUI was associated with the occurrence of LOI or death; however, UUI is not associated with the occurrence of LOI alone among independent community-dwelling older adults. Our results suggest that there may be a difference between UUI-associated diseases that cause LOI and those that cause death."

Hospitalized preterm infants frequently experience elevated oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which contribute to telomere shortening. Our aim was to examine changes in telomere length during neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization in a cohort of preterm infants &lt;32 weeks’ gestation. We conducted a longitudinal study of 10 infants (mean gestational age 27 weeks, range 23.5 to 29, at birth). We isolated DNA from dried blood spots and used Real Time Quantitative PCR to measure relative leukocyte telomere length in triplicate at three time points for each participant. From birth to discharge, infants experienced an average decline in relative telomere length of 0.021 units per week (95% CI -0.040, -0.0020; p = 0.03), after adjustment for gestational age at birth. Our results suggest a measurable decline in telomere length during NICU hospitalization. We speculate that telomere length change may convey information about NICU exposures that carry short- and long-term health risks."
https://openalex.org/W3124895400,"With the advent of potent second-line anti-androgen therapy, we and others have observed an increased incidence of androgen receptor (AR)-null small cell or neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNPC) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our study was designed to determine the effect of cabozantinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET on SCNPC. Transcriptome analysis of the University of Washington rapid autopsy and SU2C mCRPC datasets revealed upregulated MET and RET expression in SCNPCs relative to adenocarcinomas. Additionally, increased MET expression correlated with attenuated AR expression and activity. In vitro treatment of SCNPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells with the MET inhibitor AMG-337 had no impact on cell viability in LuCaP 93 (MET+/RET+) and LuCaP 173.1 (MET-/RET-), whereas cabozantinib decreased cell viability of LuCaP 93, but not LuCaP 173.1. Notably, MET+/RET+ LuCaP 93 and MET-/RET- LuCaP 173.1 tumor volumes were significantly decreased with cabozantinib treatment in vivo , and this activity was independent of MET or RET expression in LuCaP 173.1. Tissue analysis indicated that cabozantinib did not inhibit tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), but significantly decreased microvessel density (CD31) and increased hypoxic stress and glycolysis (HK2) in LuCaP 93 and LuCaP 173.1 tumors. RNA-Seq and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that hypoxia and glycolysis pathways were increased in cabozantinib-treated tumors relative to control tumors. Our data suggest that the most likely mechanism of cabozantinib-mediated tumor growth suppression in SCNPC PDX models is through disruption of the tumor vasculature. Thus, cabozantinib may represent a potential therapy for patients with metastatic disease in tumor phenotypes that have a significant dependence on the tumor vasculature for survival and proliferation."

Adherence (measured by medication possession ratio/MPR) and persistence (measured as the duration of continuous treatment) were compared between the cohorts with and without dose titration. Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the factors associated with adherence (MPR ≥ 0.8) and predictors of time to discontinuation. Results Among the 5,186 patients in the analysis, only 18% of patients had dose titration. Patients who had dose titration were approximately 2.6 times as likely to be adherent (MPR ≥ 0.8) (odds ratio = 2.59, P &lt; 0.001) than those who did not have dose titration. Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that the time to discontinuation or switch was significantly longer among patients who had dose titration (4.99 vs. 4.04 months, P = 0.009). Conclusions Dose titration was associated with improved treatment adherence and persistence among NeP patients receiving pregabalin. The findings will provide valuable evidence to increase physician awareness of dose recommendations in the prescribing information and to educate patients on the importance of titration and adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3122102945,"Background Returning to dialysis after kidney graft loss (GL) is associated with a high risk of mortality, mainly in the first 3–6 months. The follow-up of patients with GL should be extended to better understand crude patient outcomes, mainly in emerging countries, where the transplantation activity has increased. Methods This is a historical single-center cohort study conducted in an emerging country (Brazil) that included 115 transplant patients with kidney allograft failure who were followed for 44.1 (21.4; 72.6) months after GL. The outcomes were death or retransplantation after GL calculated by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Proportional hazard ratios for death and retransplantation were assessed by Cox regression. Results The 5-year probability of retransplantation was 38.7% (95% CI: 26.1%-51.2%) and that of death was 37.7% (95% CI: 24.9%-50.5%); OR = 1.03 (95% CI: 0.71–1.70) and P = 0.66. The likelihood of retransplantation was higher in patients who resumed dialysis with higher levels of hemoglobin (HR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.04–1.43; P = 0.01) and lower in blood type O patients (HR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.25–0.93; P = 0.03), which was associated with a lower frequency of retransplantation with a subsequent living-donor kidney. On the other hand, the risk of death was significantly associated with Charlson comorbidity index (HR for each point = 1.37; 95% CI 1.19–1.50; P&lt;0.001), and residual eGFR at the time when patients had resumed to dialysis (HR for each mL = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.05–1.25; P = 0.002). The trend toward a lower risk of death when patients had resumed to dialysis using AV fistula access was observed (HR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.25–1.02; P = 0.06), while a higher risk seems to be associated with the number of previous engraftment (HR = 2.01; 95% CI 0.99–4.07; P = 0.05). Conclusions The 5-year probability of retransplantation was not less than that of death. Variables related to the probability of retransplantation were hemoglobin level before resuming dialysis and ABO blood type, while the risk of death was associated with comorbidities and residual eGFR."
https://openalex.org/W3121700289,"Cattle are cosmopolitan in distribution. They are economically and ecologically significant. The cattle menace on the urban streets of developing and underdeveloped countries is challenging. The number of road accidents is increasing rapidly over time, in the urban areas of most of the developing countries, like India. In the present study, we estimated the population of cattle wandering on the streets/roads/highways of Raipur city of India using the direct headcount method and advanced Photographic Capture-Recapture Method (PCRCM). We compared these two methods of population estimation to check their suitability and adequacy. We superimposed 163 grids (1.0 x 1.0 km each) on the map of Raipur city using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) software. We randomly selected 20 grids for the estimation of the street cattle population. We used both line transect and block count sampling techniques under the direct headcount method. The estimates of visibly roaming cattle on the Raipur city streets were 11808.45 and 11198.30 using the former and the latter sampling techniques, respectively. Further, advanced PCRCM indicated an estimated 35149.61 and 34623.20 cattle using the line transect and block counting sampling techniques, respectively. We observed a female-biased sex ratio in both mature and immature cattle. The frequency of mature cattle was significantly higher than that of naive cattle, followed by the calf. Further, we noticed the frequency of cattle in a grid in the following order: cow &gt; bull &gt; heifer &gt; immature male &gt; female calf &gt; male calf. We concluded that the estimated population of street cattle in Raipur city is about 35 thousand. The results of both the techniques, i.e., direct headcount method and PCRCM, are consistent for population estimation. The direct headcount method yields the number of cattle visibly roaming on the street at a particular time. In contrast, advanced PCRCM gives the total population of street cattle in the city. Active surveillance of the urban cattle population might be of critical importance for municipal and city planners. A better understanding of the urban cattle population might help mitigate the cattle menace on the street, eventually preventing cattle-human conflict and minimizing road accidents. The techniques adopted in this study will also help estimate the population of free-ranging dogs and other wildlife animals in any target location."

The main objective of this study was to determine HPV prevalence among a healthy community-based Malaysian men. Method This was a cross-sectional study that recruited 503 healthy males from 3 community-based clinics in Selangor, Malaysia. Genital and anal samples were collected from each participant for 14 high risk and 2 low risk HPV DNA detection and genotyping. All participants responded to a set of detailed sociodemographic and sexual behaviour questionnaire. Results The median age at enrolment was 40 years old (IQR: 31–50). The anogenital HPV6/11 prevalence was 3.2% whereas high risk HPV prevalence was 27.1%. The genital HPV prevalence for HPV6/11 was 2.9% while high risk HPV was 18.8%. HPV6/11 prevalence in the anal canal was 1.6% and high risk HPV was 12.7%. HPV 18 was the most prevalent genotype detected in the anogenital area. There was a significant independent association between genital and anal HPV infections. Conclusion Anogenital HPV infection is common among Malaysian men. These findings emphasize the ubiquity of HPV infection and thus the value of population-wide access to HPV prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3123921512,"The 4SPRR-SPR parallel robot, which has considerable potential for application in the field of machining, is a novel closed-loop mechanism with a high rigid-weight ratio. Kinematics and workspace analyses of the 4SPRR-SPR parallel robot are key requirements for its application in machining. In this study, the inverse kinematics of the 4SPRR-SPR parallel robot is analyzed using a geometric method based on the mechanism arrangement of the robot. The forward kinematics model is derived by training the vector-quantified temporal associative memory (VQTAM) network, which originates from a self-organizing map (SOM). Furthermore, an improved algorithm is obtained by combining the locally linear embedding (LLE) and VQTAM methods. A boundary extraction algorithm for the workspace analysis of the parallel robot is proposed. The performance of the boundary extraction algorithm is analyzed and compared with that of a global search algorithm; the result indicates that the novel algorithm has the same computational accuracy in addition to higher efficiency. The workspace of the 4SPRR-SPR parallel robot is analyzed using the boundary extraction algorithm. Finally, the 3D model of the 4SPRR-SPR parallel robot is simulated using the ADAMS software to verify the reliability of the proposed algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods proposed in this study. In addition, the robot kinematics and workspace analysis methods described herein can be extended to other serial and parallel robots. This research provides a theoretical framework for trajectory planning of mechanisms, workspace optimization of robots, and robotic control."
https://openalex.org/W3124020225,"Antioxidant uptake and regular exercise are two well-acknowledged measures used for rejuvenation and oxidative stress elimination. Previous studies have revealed that moderate exercise mildly increases intracellular signaling oxidant levels and strengthens the ability of an organism to deal with escalating oxidative stress by upregulating antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase. Antioxidant supplementation directly scavenges intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to reduce oxidative stress. However, research to understand the impacts of these enzymes on mitigating oxidative stress from the perspective of simple animals is limited. Herein, we show that exercise combined with antioxidant supplementation ameliorates the physiological phenotypes and markers of aging in wild-type and SOD/CAT-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans . We discovered that treated wild-type and gene-deficient worms show better survivorship, reproduction, and motility compared with their control counterparts. Assays of biochemical indices revealed that variations in sod-3 expression under different stress levels imply an inducible enzyme response resulting from exercise training and antioxidant supplementation. In addition, induced ROS resistance obtained from any type of treatment could persist for several days even after treatment cessation, thus suggesting a potential long-term antioxidative stress effect. Our findings confirm that exercise, antioxidant supplementation, and their combination could significantly improve the ability of C . elegans to withstand adverse stress. Our observations provide promising insights into future therapies of anti-oxidative stress in higher animals."
https://openalex.org/W3124176627,"Background Compared to other studies, the injury monitoring of Chinese children and adolescents has captured a low level of intentional injuries on account of self-harm/suicide and violent attacks. Intentional injuries in children and adolescents have not been apparent from the data. It is possible that there has been a misclassification of existing intentional injuries, and there is a lack of research literature on the misclassification of intentional injuries. This study aimed to discuss the feasibility of discriminating the intention of injury based on Machine Learning (ML) modelling and provided ideas for understanding whether there was a misclassification of intentional injuries. Methods Information entropy was used to determine the correlation between variables and the intention of injury, and Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Adaboost algorithms and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) were used to create an intention of injury discrimination model. The models were compared by comprehensively testing the discrimination effect to determine stability and consistency. Results For the area under the ROC curve with different intentions of injuries, the NB model was 0.891, 0.880, and 0.897, respectively; the DT model was 0.870, 0.803, and 0.871, respectively; the RF model was 0.850, 0.809, and 0.845, respectively; the Adaboost model was 0.914, 0.846, and 0.914, respectively; the DNN model was 0.927, 0.835, and 0.934, respectively. In a comprehensive comparison of the five models, DNN and Adaboost models had higher values for the determination of the intention of injury. A discrimination of cases with unclear intentions of injury showed that on average, unintentional injuries, violent attacks, and self-harm/suicides accounted for 86.57%, 6.81%, and 6.62%, respectively. Conclusion It was feasible to use the ML algorithm to determine the injury intention of children and adolescents. The research suggested that the DNN and Adaboost models had higher values for the determination of the intention of injury. This study could build a foundation for transforming the model into a tool for rapid diagnosis and excavating potential intentional injuries of children and adolescents by widely collecting the influencing factors, extracting the influence variables characteristically, reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the models in the future."

https://openalex.org/W3122095928,"Reduction of nitrate to nitrite in bacteria is an essential step in the nitrogen cycle, catalysed by a variety of nitrate reductase (NR) enzymes. The soil dweller, Mycobacterium smegmatis is able to assimilate nitrate and herein we set out to confirm the genetic basis for this by probing NR activity in mutants defective for putative nitrate reductase (NR) encoding genes. In addition to the annotated narB and narGHJI , bioinformatics identified three other putative NR-encoding genes: MSMEG_4206, MSMEG_2237 and MSMEG_6816. To assess the relative contribution of each, the corresponding gene loci were deleted using two-step allelic replacement, individually and in combination. The resulting strains were tested for their ability to assimilate nitrate and reduce nitrate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, using nitrate assimilation and modified Griess assays. We demonstrated that narB , narGHJI , MSMEG_2237 and MSMEG_6816 were individually dispensable for nitrate assimilation and for nitrate reductase activity under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Only deletion of MSMEG_4206 resulted in significant reduction in nitrate assimilation under aerobic conditions. These data confirm that in M . smegmatis , narB , narGHJI , MSMEG_2237 and MSMEG_6816 are not required for nitrate reduction as MSMEG_4206 serves as the sole assimilatory NR."
