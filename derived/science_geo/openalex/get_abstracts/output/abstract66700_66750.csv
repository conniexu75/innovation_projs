https://openalex.org/W2019435019,"After diversion of sewage effluent from Lake Washington, winter concentrations of phosphate and nitrate decreased at different rates. From 1963 to 1969, phosphate decreased to 28 percent of the 1963 concentration, but nitrate remained at more than 80 percent of the 1963 value. Free carbon dioxide and alkalinity remained relatively high. The amount of phytoplanktonic chlorophyll in the summer was very closely related to the mean winter concentration of phosphate, but not to that of nitrate or carbon dioxide."

https://openalex.org/W2060260706,"A substance which stimulates growth of granulocytic and mononuclear cell colonies from mouse and human bone marrow was produced by incubated human blood cells. It is resistant to heat and freezing and is not dialyzable. Intact irradiated and unirradiated cells had very little activity, and sonically disrupted cells had no activity. The addition of plasma or sonically disrupted cells to the cell supernatant decreased its activity."
https://openalex.org/W2044174954,"Many workers have suggested that the crayfish giant fibers trigger swimming movements or tail flips during escape responses. Recordings from intact animals show that this is often not the case; both swimming and single tail flips can occur in the absence of giant fiber activity. Swimming movements and tail flips are coordinated by neural mechanisms not involving the giant fibers. When giant fibers are active, they may trigger the first flexion in a swimming sequence, initiate a single tail flip, or synchronize the muscular activity in the several segments of the abdomen, but they are not a necessary part of the neural oscillator which drives swimming."
https://openalex.org/W2034685375,"A spectral analysis technique for locating the site of an epileptic focus in the cat brain with the use of multielectrode data, obtained during a generalized seizure, is described. The data, indicating widespread appearance of epileptic activity, does not lend itself to conclusive analysis by conventional means. Three channels of data are examined at a time. One channel is said to drive the other channels if the first channel explains or accounts for the linear relation between the other two over a frequency interval corresponding to the interval of greatest energy concentration. The method of analysis involves computation of the coherence and partial coherence between data from all electrode pairs."

https://openalex.org/W2075750733,"Cell-mediated immunity, as evidenced by inhibition of macrophage migration in the presence of antigen, was associated with lymphocytes obtained from the respiratory tract of guinea pigs immunized by dinitrophenylated human immunoglobulin G in nose drops, but not from those immunized parenterally. However, splenic lymphocytes from parenterally immunized animals inhibited macrophage migration while those from locally immunized animals did not."

A variety of oximes and amides are also effective inhibitors of ethanol metabolism. These various inhibitors may prove important in the elucidation of several facets of alcohol metabolism and also may have application in the treatment of methanol poisoning and in the reduction of the sequelae of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction syndrome in man."

The lateral preoptic and arcuate nuclei and median eminence were examined by light and electron microscopy for possible monosodium glutamate effects. As adults, treated animals showed no adverse monosodium glutamate effects on the reproductive system and neural morphology."

https://openalex.org/W2075309917,Relatively high concentrations of serotonin are found in the three regions of the rat pituitary gland. Administration of melatonin causes a selective increase in the serotonin concentration of the pars intermedia; deprivation of water for 5 days causes a selective decrease in the serotonin concentrations of the neural lobe and pars distalis.

https://openalex.org/W2071372080,"In the giant polytene chromosomes, gene amplification is made visible by formation of DNA puffs, and gene transcription is made visible by formation of RNA puffs. Ligation of the anterior portion of the larva at the end of the fourth larval instar inhibited the formation of the DNA puffs that normally develop at this stage and caused regression of RNA puffs."

https://openalex.org/W2029650885,"ACCORDING to Brodie and Shore, the behaviour of higher animals depends on neurohumoral agents produced in the diencephalon. Catecholamines such as noradrenaline and dopamine are said to act as ergotropic agents, whereas serotonin is their antagonistic trophotropic factor1,2. The essential validity of these concepts has been confirmed many times3,4. There are, however, some discrepancies concerning the supposed stimulating (ergotropic) effects of catecholamines; some results confirm their alerting action, but others point to a depressing effect5,6. We found7–11 that not only catecholamines, but also their amino-acid precursor L-dopa, suppress exploratory behaviour in mice, whereas amphetamine derivatives, as well as β-phenylethylamine and its amino-acid precursor phenylalanine, enhance it; there is a mutual antagonism between the two groups of substances. Serotonin too suppresses exploratory activity in mice and produces a Parkinson-like state in rats, similar to that produced by reserpine. β-Phenylethylamine antagonizes these effects of serotonin12. We concluded that β-phenylethylamine rather than catecholamines should be considered the ergotropic agent, while serotonin, as proposed by Brodie and Shore, is its antagonistic trophotropic factor. It seems to us that catecholamines may function differently in particular systems, but they do not seem to stimulate motor activity. Amphetamine and its derivatives may act by liberating β-phenylethylamine."

Skeletal walls of more than one mineralogy have the magnesium-rich layer (calcite) surrounding the living chamber and the strontium-rich layer (aragonite) on the outside. In contrast, phosphorus may be present in greater or lesser amounts in different parts of the same calcite skeletal wall. Aragonitic crystallites appear oriented roughly perpendicular to skeletal walls, whereas calcitic crystallites are parallel to skeletal walls."
