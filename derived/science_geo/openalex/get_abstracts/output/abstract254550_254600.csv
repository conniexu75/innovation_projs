https://openalex.org/W2060271974,"Mammalian mitochondrial complex I is a multisubunit membrane-bound assembly with a molecular mass approaching 1 MDa. By comprehensive analyses of the bovine complex and its constituent subcomplexes, 45 different subunits have been characterized previously. The presence of a 46th subunit was suspected from the consistent detection of a molecular mass of 10,566 by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of subunits fractionated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The component was found associated with both the intact complex and subcomplex Ibeta, which represents most of the membrane arm of the complex, and it could not be resolved chromatographically from subunit SGDH (the subunit of bovine complex I with the N-terminal sequence Ser-Gly-Asp-His). It has now been characterized by tandem mass spectrometry of intact protein ions and shown to be a C-terminal fragment of subunit SGDH arising from a specific peptide bond cleavage between Ile-55 and Pro-56 during the electrospray ionization process. Thus, the subunit composition of bovine complex I has been established. It is a complex of 45 different proteins plus non-covalently bound FMN and eight iron-sulfur clusters."

https://openalex.org/W2013521944,"Epimutations in the germline, such as methylation of the MLH1 gene, may contribute to hereditary cancer syndrome in human, but their transmission to offspring has never been documented. Here we report a family with inheritance, in three successive generations, of germline allele-specific and mosaic hypermethylation of the MSH2 gene, without evidence of DNA mismatch repair gene mutation. Three siblings carrying the germline methylation developed early-onset colorectal or endometrial cancers, all with microsatellite instability and MSH2 protein loss. Clonal bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing showed different methylation levels in different somatic tissues, with the highest level recorded in rectal mucosa and colon cancer tissue, and the lowest in blood leukocytes. This mosaic state of germline methylation with different tissue distribution could act as the first hit and provide a mechanism for genetic disease inheritance that may deviate from the mendelian pattern and be overlooked in conventional leukocyte-based genetic diagnosis strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2133379372,"To judge causality, organisms must determine the temporal order of their actions and sensations. However, this judgment may be confounded by changing delays in sensory pathways, suggesting the need for dynamic temporal recalibration. To test for such a mechanism, we artificially injected a fixed delay between participants' actions (keypresses) and subsequent sensations (flashes). After participants adapted to this delay, flashes at unexpectedly short delays after the keypress were often perceived as occurring before the keypress, demonstrating a recalibration of motor-sensory temporal order judgments. When participants experienced illusory reversals, fMRI BOLD signals increased in anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal cortex (ACC/MFC), a brain region previously implicated in conflict monitoring. This illusion-specific activation suggests that the brain maintains not only a recalibrated representation of timing, but also a less-plastic representation against which to compare it."

Although calcineurin is present at high levels in normal heart, its activity appears to be unaffected by calcium during the course of a cardiac cycle. The mechanism(1212125) whereby calcineurin is selectively activated by calcium under pathological conditions has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that diverse signals for cardiac hypertrophy stimulate expression of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. TRPC consists of a family of seven membrane-spanning nonselective cation channels that have been implicated in the nonvoltage-gated influx of calcium in response to G protein-coupled receptor signaling, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and depletion of internal calcium stores. TRPC3 expression is up-regulated in multiple rodent models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, whereas TRPC5 expression is induced in failing human heart. We demonstrate that TRPC promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through activation of calcineurin and its downstream effector, the nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factor. These results define a novel role for TRPC channels in the control of cardiac growth, and suggest that a TRPC-derived pool of calcium contributes to selective activation of calcineurin in diseased heart.

Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response of the heart to many forms of cardiac disease, including hypertension, mechanical load abnormalities, myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, endocrine disorders, and genetic mutations in cardiac contractile protein genes. Whereas the hypertrophic response is thought to be an initially compensatory mechanism that augments cardiac performance, sustained hypertrophy is maladaptive and frequently leads to ventricular dilation and the clinical syndrome of heart failure. Accordingly, cardiac hypertrophy has been established as an independent risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality (1Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar).Abnormal calcium handling, characterized by elevated intracellular diastolic calcium levels, is a hallmark of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Elevated intracellular calcium not only impairs the contractile performance of the heart, but also activates calcium-dependent signaling pathways that mediate maladaptive cardiac remodeling (2Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One such pathway is regulated by the calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which has been shown to be sufficient, and in some cases, necessary for pathological hypertrophy (3Molkentin J.D.

The activity of calcineurin is tightly regulated in vivo by a negative feedback mechanism; one of the most highly sensitive NFAT target genes encodes a potent calcineurin inhibitor, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 (MCIP1) (6Rothermel B.

In lymphocytes, influx of extracellular calcium through calcium release-activated calcium channels provides the sustained calcium signal required to activate the calcineurin/NFAT pathway (9Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Unlike voltage-gated L-type calcium channels, calcium entry via calcium release-activated calcium channels is triggered by the release of calcium from intracellular stores, a mechanism referred to as store-operated calcium or capacitative calcium entry. Recent work has confirmed that hypertrophic agonists stimulate capacitative calcium entry in cardiac myocytes, leading to activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and cardiac hypertrophy (10Hunton D.L.

Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1124-H1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the cardiac channel(s) responsible for capacitative calcium entry remains unknown.Members of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of channels have been implicated in the control of capacitative calcium entry in non-cardiac cell types (12Putney J.W. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The seven members of the TRPC family (TRPC1-7) are nonselective calcium-permeable cation channels. Most family members can be activated directly by diacylglycerol, a second messenger product of phospholipase C. Furthermore, TRPC channels have recently been shown to function as stretch receptors, admitting calcium influx in response to mechanical stress (13Maroto R. Raso A. Wood T.G. Kurosky A. Martinac B. Hamill O.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 14Barritt G. Rychkov G. Nat.

Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Other signaling molecules known to regulate TRPC channel activity include the receptor tyrosine kinase Src (16Vazquez G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40521-40528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase PKG (17Kwan H.Y. Huang Y. Yao X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2625-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Previously, we reported results of microarray studies with RNA from cultured cardiac myocytes exposed to distinct hypertrophic stimuli (18Bush E. Fielitz J. Melvin L. Martinez-Arnold M. McKinsey T.A. Plichta R. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among the genes most potently up-regulated by two distinct hypertrophic agonists, the α-adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine (PE), and the serotonin receptor agonist, pyridine activator of myocyte hypertrophy (PAMH), was that encoding TRPC3. Here we demonstrate that cardiac TRPC3 expression is up-regulated through a calcineurin-dependent mechanism by discrete pharmacologic, genetic, and physiologic stimuli that trigger pathological cardiac hypertrophy in rodent models. In contrast, TRPC5 is selectively induced in failing human heart. Gain and loss of function studies demonstrate that TRPC channels positively regulate cardiac hypertrophy through activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling. These results suggest a role for TRPC channels in the transmission of pathological calcium signals in the heart.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemical Reagents, Plasmids, and Adenoviral Constructs—PE, endothelin-1, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB) were obtained from Sigma. N-{4-[3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl}-4-methyl-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxamide (BTP2) was obtained from Calbiochem. The cDNA encoding full-length, human TRPC3 (accession number NM_003305) was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR with the One Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For adenovirus production, this cDNA was subcloned into pShuttle-cytomegalovirus (QBiogen) and adenovirus was generated in HEK293 cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Clonal populations of virus were obtained using the agar overlay method and titered with the Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech). The adenovirus encoding GFP-NFATc (NFAT2) was provided by Dr. Martin Schneider (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD).Cardiomyocyte Culture—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were prepared from 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (19Harrison B.C. Roberts C.R. Hood D.B. Sweeney M. Gould J.M. Bush E.W. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10636-10649Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on gelatin-coated plates in DMEM containing fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine (DMEM complete). After 12 h, plating medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with Nutridoma-SP (0.1%; Roche Applied Sciences), which contains albumin, insulin, transferrin, and other defined organic and inorganic compounds the following day. Cells were treated with agonists/inhibitors for 48-72 h.Animal Models and Human Heart Samples—The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. The spontaneous hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rat is a well documented genetic model of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (20Haas G.J. McCune S.A. Brown D.M. Cody R.J. Am. Heart J. 1995; 130: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the isoproterenol model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted subcutaneously with Alzet Mini-Pumps filled with either vehicle control (0.5 mg/ml sodium bisulfite in 0.9% sterile NaCl) or isoproterenol (dissolved in vehicle sufficient to administer 5 mg/kg/day of isoproterenol for 4 days). For thoracic aortic banding (TAB), male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-9 weeks of age, 200-225 g) were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (v/v 100% O2), intubated, and maintained at 2.0% isoflurane with positive pressure ventilation. A left thoracotomy through the third intercostal space was performed and the descending thoracic aorta 3-4 mm cranial to the intersection of the aorta and azygous vein was isolated. A segment of 5-0 silk suture was then positioned around the isolated aorta to function as a ligature. A blunted hypodermic needle (gauge determined by weight) was placed between the aorta and the suture to prevent complete aortic occlusion when the suture was tied. When tying was completed, the needle was removed from between the aorta and ligature, re-establishing flow through the vessel. The thorax was then closed and the pneumothorax evacuated. After 7 days of recovery, animals were sacrificed and left ventricular tissue processed for Western blot analysis. Average heart weight to body weight ratios in banded versus sham-operated rats increased 22% at 1 week. The construction and characterization of transgenic mice expressing constitutively active calcineurin have been described elsewhere (3Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar).Ventricular samples from human patients with end-stage idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or nonfailing human cardiac tissue samples were obtained through the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Cardiac Transplantation Program. End-stage failing hearts came from individuals who underwent heart transplantation because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6; 3 male, 3 female, average age 49.8 years). Nonfailing controls were obtained from organ donors whose hearts were unsuitable for donation due to blood type or size incompatibilities (n = 6; 4 male, 2 female; average age 51.8 years). Tissue samples were taken immediately upon explantation and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen.Immunoblotting—NRVMs and in vivo tissue samples were homogenized in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing EDTA (5 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm; sodium fluoride, 2 mm; β-glycerolphosphate, 10 mm; sodium molybdate, 1 mm; and sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm). Homogenates were briefly sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce) and 15 μg of total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE with gradient gels (4-20% polyacrylamide; Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed with TRPC3- or TRPC5-specific antibodies, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Alomone Labs). Experiments were performed with freshly diluted antibodies, because in our experience we have found that the lyophilized antibodies, once resuspended, lose significant immunoreactivity in storage. Negative controls for specificity were performed by preincubating the antibody with the corresponding antigen peptide (0.75 μg of peptide/1 μg of antibody) for 1 h. Antibodies against MCIP1 and calnexin have been described previously (18Bush E. Fielitz J. Melvin L. Martinez-Arnold M. McKinsey T.A. Plichta R. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation experiments, 3 μgof antibody was incubated with homogenate in a total volume of 0.5 ml for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads (10 μl, GE Healthcare) were added, and after a 1-h incubation, beads were washed three times in homogenization buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE.Hypertrophy Measurements—The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, measurement of β-myosin heavy chain expression, RNA dot blot assay for hypertrophic marker gene expression, and adenylate kinase release assay have been described previously (19Harrison B.C. Roberts C.R. Hood D.B. Sweeney M. Gould J.M. Bush E.W. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10636-10649Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For cell volume measurements, NRVM cultured in 6-well dishes were harvested by treatment with trypsin (Cellgro). After recovery by centrifugation, cell pellets were washed in PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of IsoFlow electrolyte solution (Beckman-Coulter), and analyzed with a Z2 Coulter Particle Counter and Size Analyzer (Beckman-Coulter).RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from NRVMs using TRI Reagent® (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using both standard spectrophotometry of nucleic acids at 260 nm using a DU64 spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter) and fluorescence with a TD700 fluorometer (Turner Designs). RT-PCR of rat TRPC3 (accession number NM_021771) used primers that spanned the first intron (7950 bp): forward primer, 5′-ctggccaacatagagaaggagt-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-caccgattccagatctccat-3′. Rat 18 S ribosomal RNA amplicons were used as input controls: forward primer, 5′-cgaggaattcccagtaagtgc-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-aagttcgaccgtcttctcagc-3′. Reverse transcription and amplification of 0.5 μg of total RNA were done using the SuperScript™ One-step RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), on a I-cycler™ thermocyler (BioRad). Reverse transcription reactions were run on 2% agarose gels containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Imaging and densitometry were performed with an Alpha Innotech gel imaging system and ChemImage 5.5 software. RT-PCR amplified a single 141-bp band of the expected size, which sequencing confirmed to be TRPC3. Negative control reactions excluding RNA template, reverse transcriptase, or either primer did not yield a PCR product. For analysis of human samples, RNA was extracted from left ventricular tissue as described above and subjected to TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by Riccio et al. (21Riccio A. Medhurst A.D. Mattei C. Kelsell R.E. Calver A.R. Randall A.D. Benham C.D. Pangalos M.N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Human TRPC5 primers were: forward, 5′-cctctcatcagaaccatgccaa-3′, and reverse, 5′-gcgtttgcttgatgactcagc-3′.Indirect Immunofluorescence—NRVMs were plated on gelatin-coated 6-well dishes (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM complete and transferred 12 h subsequently to serum-free DMEM supplemented with Nutridoma-SP (0.1%; Roche Applied Sciences). Adenovirus was added to cells at the time of plating. Unless otherwise indicated, virus was used at a multiplicity of infection of 20. Following experimental treatment, cells were washed two times in PBS, fixed with formalin (10%) in PBS, permeabilized, and blocked with PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (0.1%) and bovine serum albumin (3%), and then incubated in the same solution containing primary antibodies specific for either sarcomeric α-actinin (Sigma; 1:200 dilution) or Myc (Santa Cruz; 1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 4 times in PBS and incubated in PBS/Nonidet P-40/bovine serum albumin containing either a fluorescein- or CY3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories; 1:200 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 4 times in PBS and then covered with mounting solution (SlowFade, Molecular Probes) and glass coverslips. Proteins were visualized with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus model BH-2) at ×40 magnification, and images were captured using a digital camera (Photometrics; Roper Scientific).RESULTSCalcineurin-dependent Induction of TRPC3 Expression in Cultured Cardiac Myocytes—To gain insight into changes in gene expression underlying stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy, RNA microarray studies were performed with cultured NRVMs. NRVMs undergo hypertrophy in response to multiple agonists, including PE, which stimulates the α1-adrenergic receptor, and PAMH, a novel 5-HT2B serotonin receptor agonist. A complete summary of microarray results with RNA from NRVMs stimulated with PE or PAMH for 48 h is found in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE925. Among the genes most potently up-regulated by both agonists were those encoding β-myosin heavy chain, a classical marker of cardiac hypertrophy, and the transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) calcium channel.Although calcium is known to play a key role in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy (2Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the relative contribution of distinct calcium pools to this growth response remains unclear. As such, we focus here on elucidating the potential role of TRPC channels in the control of stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.To confirm the microarray results, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed with RNA from freshly isolated NRVMs treated with PE or two independent hypertrophic agonists, endothelin-1 and fetal bovine serum, for 48 h. Each agonist stimulated expression of TRPC3 mRNA transcripts, with PE and fetal bovine serum inducing the highest levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were obtained with RNA from PAMH-treated cells (data not shown).Prior studies have suggested that signaling by the calcineurin phosphatase stimulates expression of TRPC3 in skeletal muscle (22Rosenberg P. Hawkins A. Stiber J. Shelton J.M. Hutcheson K. Bassel-Duby R. Shin D.M. Yan Z. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9387-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine the role of calcineurin in TRPC3 gene regulation in cardiac myocytes, RT-PCR was performed with RNA from NRVMs stimulated with PE in the absence or presence of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A or FK506. As shown in Fig. 1C, agonist-dependent induction of TRPC3 mRNA transcripts was completely blocked by either of the two calcineurin inhibitors.To evaluate expression of TRPC3 protein expression in NRVMs and rat and mouse ventricles, we performed immunoblot analysis with a TRPC3-specific antibody. As a control for specificity, the TRPC3 antibody was preincubated with the antigen peptide. The antibody detected immunoreactive bands of the expected molecular mass (∼110-120 kDa) (Fig. 1D, left panel). The most abundant band observed in NRVM was ∼115 kDa, with a slightly smaller band of ∼110 kDa predominating in rat and mouse ventricular samples. Notably, detection of these immunoreactive bands was efficiently competed by preincubation of the TRPC3 antibody with the antigen peptide. Intentional overexposure of the same immunoblot (Fig. 1D, right panel) revealed a number of nonspecific bands that were not competed in the antigen peptide-blocked controls. Immunoblot analysis verified that the observed induction of TRPC3 mRNA correlated with modest (between 1.5- and 2-fold) but significant increases in TRPC3 protein levels in PE-treated NRVMs (Fig. 1, E and F).Induction of TRPC3 Expression in Rodent Models of Cardiac Hypertrophy—Experiments were performed to determine whether TRPC3 expression is elevated in animal models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. TAB places a pressure overload on the heart and triggers left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Immunoblotting studies revealed that TRPC3 protein expression was consistently elevated in LVs of rats subjected to TAB for 7 days (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Induction of cardiac TRPC3 protein expression in vivo. A, male, 2-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were given a sham operation or subjected to thoracic aortic banding to trigger pressure overload hypertrophy of the LV of the heart, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Seven days following the operation, animals were sacrificed and TRPC3 levels in LV protein lysates analyzed by immunoblotting. Blots were reprobed with calnexin-specific antibodies to control for protein loading. B, parallel samples of LV protein lysates were run to assess MCIP1 protein levels by immunoblot. C, male SHHF rats of the indicated ages were sacrificed and TRPC3 levels in LV preparations assessed as described in A. D, male SD rats were implanted with osmotic mini-pumps that release either vehicle or the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO, 4 mg/kg/day) for 4 days. TRPC3 levels in LV preparations were assessed as described in A. E, male mice (∼2 months of age) expressing a constitutively active calcineurin transgene (Cn-Tg) and control nontransgenic littermates (WT) were sacrificed and TRPC3 and MCIP1 levels in LV preparations assessed as described in A. F, TRPC3 protein levels in the indicated models were quantified by densitometry. Values represent averages ± S.D. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether induction of TRPC3 expression correlates with stimulation of calcineurin signaling, we quantified expression of the endogenous NFAT target gene, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1 (MCIP1). The MCIP1 protein is a negative-feedback regulator of calcineurin signaling (8Rothermel B.A. Vega R.B. Williams R.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and is expressed as 28- and 38-kDa isoforms (18Bush E. Fielitz J. Melvin L. Martinez-Arnold M. McKinsey T.A. Plichta R. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of 28-kDa MCIP1 is regulated by an alternative promoter that harbors 15 NFAT binding sites, and thus this lower molecular weight form of the protein serves as a sensitive marker of NFAT activity (23Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed significantly increased expression of 28-kDa MCIP1 in TAB ventricles, indicating enhanced calcineurin/NFAT activation (Fig. 2B). These observations are consistent with a role of calcineurin in the control of TRPC3 gene expression.SHHF rats provide a genetic model of pathological cardiac remodeling and heart failure (20Haas G.J. McCune S.A. Brown D.M. Cody R.J. Am. Heart J. 1995; 130: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Due to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene, SHHF rats develop hypertension that results in cardiac hypertrophy and eventual heart failure. As shown in Fig. 2C, TRPC3 protein levels were elevated in LVs from failing hearts of ∼20-month-old SHHF rats. However, TRPC3 expression was normal in 8-9-month-old rats with compensated LV hypertrophy. TRPC3 protein expression was also increased in LVs of rats infused for 4 days with the α-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, which stimulates cardiac hypertrophy that is accompanied by fibrosis (Fig. 2D). Similar to the TAB model, increased expression of MCIP1 protein was observed in LV samples from both ISO-infused and ∼20-month-old SHHF rats (data not shown).To address the role of calcineurin signaling in the control of cardiac TRPC3 expression, TRPC3 protein levels were measured in LVs of transgenic mice expressing constitutively active calcineurin in the heart under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (Cn-Tg) (3Molkentin J.D.

As shown in Fig. 2E, TRPC3 expression was dramatically elevated in Cn-Tg mice compared with wild-type littermates. Levels of TRPC3 protein in LV samples from each model of cardiac hypertrophy were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 2F). Together, the results demonstrate that TRPC3 protein expression is induced by diverse cues for pathological cardiac growth in vivo, and suggest a role for calcineurin signaling in the induction of cardiac TRPC3 expression.Regulation of Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy by TRPC Channels—Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with enhanced protein synthesis, cell growth in the absence of mitosis, and increased sarcomere assemb"

Human OCT-4 isoform mRNAs encode proteins that have identical POU DNA binding domains and C-terminal domains but differ in their N-terminal domains. We report here the cloning and characterization of the human OCT-4B isoform. Human OCT-4B cDNA encodes a 265-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 30 kDa. Embryonic stem (E14141) cell-based complementation assays using ZHBTc4 ES cells showed that unlike human OCT-4A, OCT-4B cannot sustain ES cell self-renewal. In addition, OCT-4B does not bind to a probe carrying the OCT-4 consensus binding sequence, and we demonstrate that two separate regions of its N-terminal domain are responsible for inhibiting DNA binding. We also demonstrate that OCT-4B is mainly localized to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of OCT-4B did not activate transcription from OCT-4-dependent promoters, although OCT-4A did as reported previously. Furthermore, transcriptional activation by human OCT-4A was not inhibited by co-expression of OCT-4B. Taken together, these data suggest that the DNA binding, transactivation, and abilities to confer self-renewal of the human OCT-4 isoforms differ.

Taken together, these data suggest that the DNA binding, transactivation, and abilities to confer self-renewal of the human OCT-4 isoforms differ. The oct-4 gene, also referred to as oct-3, encodes a nuclear protein that belongs to a family of transcription factors containing the POU DNA binding domain (1Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R. Balling R.

It is normally found in the pluripotent stem cells of pregastrulation embryos, including oocytes, early cleavage-stage embryos, and the inner cell mass of the blastocyst (1Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R.

Its expression is down-regulated during differentiation, and knock-out of oct-4 causes early lethality in mice because of the absence of an inner cell mass (9Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar). These results suggest that OCT-4 plays a pivotal role in mammalian development (10Pesce M. Wang X. Wolgemuth D.J. Scholer H. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (11Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). During human development, OCT-4 is expressed at least until the blastocyst stage where it regulates gene expression (12Abdel-Rahman B. Fiddler M. Rappolee D. Pergament E. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 2787-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). OCT-4 is a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in maintaining the undifferentiated pluripotent state and may also prevent expression of genes activated during differentiation (13Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It activates transcription via octamer motifs located proximal or distal to transcriptional start sites (14Lamb K.A. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 51: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The POU domain of OCT-4 is a conserved DNA binding domain that binds as a monomer to the octamer sequence motif 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′ (15Scholer H.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This cis-acting element is important in controlling the activity of many promoters and enhancers of house-keeping and cell type-specific genes (16Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). OCT-4-binding sites have been found in various genes, including fgf-4 (fibroblast growth factor-4), pdgfαr (platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor), osteopontin, and Nanog (17Rodda D.J. Chew J.L.

In addition, genes expressed in the trophectoderm but not in the embryo prior to blastocyst formation, such as IFN-τ (τ-interferon) and the α and β subunits of chorionic gonadotropin, may be targets for silencing by OCT-4 (22Ezashi T. Ghosh D. Roberts R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7883-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Liu L. Leaman D. Villalta M. Roberts R.M. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16683-16689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggests that OCT-4 functions as a master switch during differentiation by regulating cells that have pluripotent potential or can develop such potential (25Pesce M. Scholer H.R. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 26Ovitt C.E. Scholer H.R. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation by OCT-4 is complex. In embryonic stem cells, the octamer sequence motif is active irrespective of its distance from the site of transcriptional initiation (2Okamoto K. Okazawa H. Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. Cell. 1990; 60: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 28Scholer H.R. Balling R. Hatzopoulos A.K. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, in differentiated cells, OCT-4 can transactivate only when the octamer motif is in a proximal position (1Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Rohdewohld H. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 13Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1991; 66: 291-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); to be active from distal sites, it requires stem cell-specific bridging factors that link it to the transcription initiation site (29Scholer H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 291-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A number of factors such as Sox2, high mobility group, E7, and E1A are known to influence the ability of OCT-4 to act as activator or repressor (15Scholer H.R.

Recently, physical association of OCT-4 with Ewing's sarcoma protein was documented, suggesting that Ewing's sarcoma protein may also play a role in regulating OCT-4 (35Lee J. Rhee B.K. Bae G.Y. Han Y.M. Kim J. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2005; 23: 738-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although only a single form of OCT-4 mRNA has been identified in embryonic mouse tissues, two forms, i.e. OCT-4A and OCT-4B, generated by alternative splicing, were identified in the RT 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; ES, embryonic stem cells; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CTD, C-terminal domains; NTD, N-terminal domains; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase. -PCR products from adult human pancreatic islets (36Takeda J. Seino S. Bell G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4613-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Compared with human OCT-4A, little is known about the properties of OCT-4B. To identify the biochemical functions of the human OCT-4B isoform, we performed RT-PCR and sequenced OCT-4 cDNAs from human ES cells. This revealed a novel alternative spliced variant of OCT-4 mRNA in which exon 1a is replaced by exon 1b. The DNA binding and C-terminal domains of OCT-4B are identical to the corresponding domains of OCT-4A, but it lacks the sequences necessary for transactivation. Moreover, it does not bind DNA and mainly localizes to the cytoplasm. We also found that, unlike OCT-4A (35Lee J. Rhee B.K. Bae G.Y. Han Y.M. Kim J. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2005; 23: 738-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it cannot stimulate transcription from OCT-4-dependent promoters, nor does it antagonize the induction of gene expression by OCT-4A. In addition, ectopic expression of human OCT-4B in ZHBTc4 ES cells, unlike that of human OCT-4A, was not sufficient to maintain stem cell self-renewal and permit them to display differentiated ES cell phenotypes. These data imply that the DNA binding and transactivation properties of the human OCT-4 isoforms and their abilities to confer self-renewal differ. Thus, the different polypeptides encoded by the human OCT-4 gene may have different targets as well as different roles as regulators of human ES cells. Materials and General Methods—Restriction endonucleases, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Pfu Turbo polymerase was purchased from Stratagene, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, DNA ligation, bacterial transformations, and SDS-PAGE of proteins were carried out by standard methods (37Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Subclones generated from PCR products were sequenced by the chain termination method with double-stranded DNA templates to ensure the absence of mutations. Plasmid Construction—To construct the human OCT-4 isoforms, total RNA was prepared from human ES cells, and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript™ first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen), as described previously (35Lee J. Rhee B.K. Bae G.Y. Han Y.M. Kim J. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2005; 23: 738-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The construction of pcDNA3-hOCT-4A has been described previously (35Lee J. Rhee B.K. Bae G.Y. Han Y.M. Kim J. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2005; 23: 738-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To construct pcDNA3-OCT-4B, the human ES cell-derived cDNAs were amplified with primer 5′-hOCT4B-1 (5′-GATCGGATCCATGCACTTCTACAGACTATTCCTTGGGGCC-3′ (a BamHI site is underlined)) and 3′-hOCT-4B-40 (5′-pCTGGATTTTAAAAGGCAG-3′), and primers 5′-hOCT-4B-41 (5′-pTCCCAGGACATCAAAGCT-3′) and 3′-OCT-4B-265 (5′-GATCGAATTCTCAGTTTGAATGCATGGG-3′ (an EcoRI site is underlined)). The two PCR products were ligated, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the same sites of pcDNA3. pCAG-IP/EGFP, pCAG-IP/mOCT-4-EGFP, pCAG-IP/hOCT-4A-EGFP, and pCAG-IP/hOCT-4B-EGFP were generated as follows.

This was then digested with XhoI and NotI and cloned into the same sites of vector pCAG-IP.

This in turn was digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of pCAG-IP. (d) For pCAG-IP/hOCT-4B-EGFP, human OCT-4B was amplified from pcDNA3/hOCT-4B by PCR using primers 5′-hOCT-4B-1 (5′-GATCGGATCCATGCACTTCTACAGACTATTCCTTGGGGCC-3′, a BamHI site is underlined) and 3′-OCT-4-351, digested with BamHI and AgeI, and cloned into the same sites of pEGFP N1 to generate pEGFP-hOCT-4B, which was digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into XhoI and NotI sites of vector pCAG-IP. GST fusion OCT-4A and GST fusion OCT-4B, and their derivative plasmids GST-OCT-4A(POUA), GST-OCT-4B(POUB), GST-OCT-4B(NBPB), GST-OCT-4B(PBC), GST-OCT-4A(NBPAC), GST-OCT-4B(NAPBC), GST-OCT-4B (NBPB)Δ(21-40), and GST-OCT-4B (NBPB)Δ(1-20), were generated by the following steps.

(d) For GST-OCT-4B (POUB), the POU domain of OCT-4B was amplified from pcDNA3/OCT-4B by PCR using primers 5′-hOCT4B-41 (5′-GATCGGATCCATCCAGTCCCAGGACATC-3′, a BamHI site is underlined) and 3′-hOCT4A-289 (5′-GATCGAATTCGCTTGATCGCTTGCCCTT-3′, an EcoRI site is underlined), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the same sites of pGEX (4T-1). (e) For GST-OCT-4B (NBPB), the N-terminal and POU domain of OCT-4B was amplified from pcDNA3/OCT-4B by PCR using primers 5′-hOCT4B-1 (5′-GATCGGATCCATGCACTTCTACAGACTATTCCTTGGGGCC-3′, a BamHI site is underlined) and 3′-hOCT4A-289 (5′-GATCGAATTCGCTTGATCGCTTGCCCTT-3′, an EcoRI site is underlined), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the same sites of pGEX (4T-1).

(g) For GST-OCT-4A(NBPAC), the N-terminal domain of OCT-4B or the POU and C-terminal domains of OCT-4A were amplified from pcDNA3/OCT-4B or pcDNA3/OCT-4A by PCR using primers 5′-hOCT4B-1 and 3′-hOCT4B-40 (5′-CTCCTCCTGGATTTTAAAAGGCAGAAGA-3′) or primers 5′hOCT4A-134B (5′-ATCCAGGAGGAGTCCCAGGACATCAAAG-3′) and 3′-hOCT4A-360, respectively. The secondary PCR was performed using gel-purified primary PCR products as templates and primers 5′-hOCT4B-1 and 3′-hOCT4A-360. The secondary PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pGEX (4T-1). (e) For GST-OCT-4B(NAPBC), the N-terminal domain of OCT-4A or the POU and C-terminal domains of OCT-4B were amplified from pcDNA3/OCT-4A or pcDNA3/OCT-4B using primers 5′-hOCT4A-1 and 3′-hOCT4A-137 (5′-CTGGGACGGGTTTTGCTCCAGCTTCTCC-3′) or primers 5′-hOCT4B-41B (5′-AACCCGTCCCAGGACATCAAAGCTCTGC-3′) and 3′-hOCT4A-360, respectively. The secondary PCR was performed using gel-purified primary PCR products as templates and primers 5′-hOCT4A-1 and 3′-hOCT4A-360. The secondary PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pGEX (4T-1). (f) For GST-OCT-4B (NBPB)Δ(21-40), a fragment of the human OCT-4B sequence extending from the N-terminal domain through the POU DNA binding domain was cloned into pKSII vector (Stratagene). A deletion of amino acids 21-40 was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using a mutagenic primer set (5′-CTTGAATCCCGAATGGAAATCCCAGGACATCAAAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTTTGATGTCCTGGGATTTCCATTCGGGATTCAAG-3′) and the QuikChange kit™ (Stratagene). Then the OCT-4B (NBPB)Δ(21-40) fragment of the pKSII-OCT-4B (NBPB)Δ(21-40) construct was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pGEX (4T-1). (g) For GST-OCT-4B (NBPB)Δ(1-20), the (NBPB)Δ(1-20) fragment of OCT-4B was amplified from pcDNA3/OCT-4B by PCR using primers 5′-hOCT4B-21 (5′-GATCGGATCCGGGGAGATTGATAACTGG-3′, a BamHI site is underlined) and 3′-hOCT4-289, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the same sites of pGEX (4T-1). The reporter construct pOCT-4(10x)TATAluc has been described (35Lee J. Rhee B.K. Bae G.Y. Han Y.M. Kim J. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2005; 23: 738-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The FOR promoter (-508 to +1) was cloned by PCR amplification from pGL3-FOR(3.5 kb). 4J. Lee and J. Kim, manuscript in preparation. The primers used for this purpose were 5′-FOR(-508) (5′-GATCGGTACCCCATGCCCCCTT-3′, a KpnI site is underlined) and 3′-FOR(+1) (5′-GATCTTCGAATAACCCCTATTCG-3′, a HindIII site is underlined). The PCR product was digested with KpnI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites of the promoterless pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Cell Culture—Human ES cells (Miz-hES1, SNU-hESC3, and Cha-hESC3) were grown as described previously (38Aamlid K.H. Hough L. Richardson A.C. Carbohydr.

Briefly, they were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium with 20% knock-out serum replacement, 1 mm l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen) on mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 5 days of culture, colonies were detached mechanically from the feeder cells with a micropipette, and individual colonies were mechanically divided into four or five pieces. These ES cell clumps were then separately plated on fresh feeder cell layers. HEK293T or NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin. RT-PCR and Alkaline Phosphatase Staining—Total RNA was prepared from human ES cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment, and messenger RNA was purified with an Oligodex-dT mRNA mini kit (Qiagen) followed by cDNA synthesis using a Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), as instructed by the manufacturers. To detect human OCT-4 isoforms in human ES cells, human OCT-4A and OCT-4B cDNAs were amplified with human OCT-4A primers [5′e1a (5′-GATCGGATCCATGGCGGGACACCTGGCT-3′) and 3′e1 (5′-CCTTCCCAAATAGAACCC-3′)], and human OCT-4B primers [5′e1b (5′-GATCGGATCCATGCACTTCTACAGACTATTCCTTGGGGCC-3′) and 3′e1], respectively. RT-PCRs for Oct-4 downstream target genes and differentiation marker genes were performed with gene-specific primer sets as described previously (9Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H.

Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), as described previously (43Rho J.Y. Yu K. Han J.S. Chae J.I. Koo D.B. Yoon H.S. Moon S.Y. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Hum. Reprod. 2006; 21: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a control, the level of GAPDH mRNA was determined in the real time PCR assay of each RNA sample and was used to correct for experimental variation. The following primer sequences were used: hOCT-4A forward primer was 5′-CTCCTGGAGGGCCAGGAATC-3′, and hOCT-4A reverse primer was 5′-CCACATCGGCCTGTGTATAT-3′. The hOCT-4B forward primer was 5′-ATGCATGAGTCAGTGAACAG-3′, and the hOCT-4B reverse primer was 5′-CCACATCGGCCTGTGTATAT-3′. The GAPDH forward primer was 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, and the GAPDH reverse primer was 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Quantitation of the relative expression levels of the human OCT-4 isoforms was achieved by normalizing for the endogenous GAPDH using the ΔCT method of quantitation. ES Cell-based Complementation Assay—ES cell-based complementation assays were performed with ZHBTc4 ES cells as described previously (44Niwa H. Masui S. Chambers I. Smith A.G. Miyazaki J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, 1X51) equipped with a Cool-SNAP digital camera (Olympus). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-OCT-4 proteins were generated in Escherichia coli as described previously (45Lee H.J. Kim S. Pelletier J. Kim J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After binding to glutathione-Sepharose, the proteins were washed and eluted with reduced glutathione (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). The purity and size of the eluted proteins were evaluated by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-OCT-4 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and reactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Western Lightening (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Probes for EMSAs were prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides whose sequences have been described previously (46Botquin V. Hess H. Fuhrmann G. Anastassiadis C. Gross M.K. Vriend G. Scholer H.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2073-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The probes were prepared by end labeling annealed complementary oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSAs were performed with recombinant GST-OCT-4 proteins (OCT-4A, OCT-4B, and their derivatives) for 30 min at 4 °C in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 μg of poly(dI·dC)·(dI·dC). Following binding, the reaction mixtures were run on 4% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 37:1) in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) buffer at 150 V for 2-3 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -70 °C. Transfection and Reporter Assays—Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with the Gene Pulser II RF module system (Bio-Rad), as instructed by the manufacturer. Luciferase assays were performed with the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Subcellular Localization Experiments—Full-length human OCT-4A or OCT-4B cDNAs were subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pBabePuro. NIH3T3 cells were plated on glass coverslips and infected with high titer retrovirus stocks produced by transient transfection of Phoenix cells (47Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analyses were performed as described previously (45Lee H.J. Kim S. Pelletier J. Kim J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the infected cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min at -20 °C with acetone/methanol (1:1, v/v). To detect human OCT-4A or OCT-4B, we used anti-OCT-4 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and fluorescence was detected with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM5 Pascal; Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). To localize the human OCT-4 isoforms in ES cells, pCAG-IP/EGFP, pCAG-IP/mOCT-4-EGFP, pCAG-IP/hOCT-4A-EGFP,orpCAG-IP/hOCT-4B-EGFP-transfected ZHBTc4 ES cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 10 min at -20 °C in a mixture of acetone and methanol (1:1, v/v). The coverslips were mounted with 50% glycerol/PBS, and green fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence microscope (IX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CoolSNAP digital camera (Olympus). Identification of OCT-4 Isoforms in Human Embryonic Stem Cells—Transcripts of the human OCT-4 isoforms (OCT-4A and OCT-4B) were first observed as RT-PCR products during a search for transcription factors containing POU-domains in adult human pancreatic islets (36Takeda J. Seino S. Bell G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4613-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We examined OCT-4 isoforms in human embryonic stem cells by RT-PCR using total human ES cell (Miz-hES1) RNA with specific oligonucleotide primers flanking the coding region corresponding to the N-terminal domain of OCT-4 proteins. As shown in Fig. 1A, OCT-4A mRNA was generated from exon 1a (labeled E1a), the 3′-half of exon 1b (E1b), and exons 2-4 (E2, E3, and E4) using an internal splicing acceptor site in exon 1b. OCT-4B mRNA contains exons 1b to 4 (Fig. 1A). PCR products of the expected size of 532 and 247 bp derived from human OCT-4A (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and OCT-4B (lane 2) mRNA, respectively, were observed using human ES cell RNA. These RT-PCR products were sequenced and confirmed to represent nucleotides 1-532 and 1-247 of the reported human OCT-4A or OCT-4B cDNA sequences, respectively (data not shown). These results point to the existence of two isoforms of human OCT-4 differing in their N-terminal domain, as reported previously (36Takeda J. Seino S. Bell G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4613-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Using quantitative real time PCR, we were also able to quantify levels of mRNA for the human OCT-4 isoforms. In human ES cells (Miz-hES1) human OCT-4A mRNA was 8-fold more abundant than human OCT-4B (Fig. 1C, bars 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained in other human ES cell lines (SNU-hESC3 (Fig. 1C, bars 3 and 4) and Cha-hESC3 (Fig. 1C, bars 5 and 6)). Structural Feat"

However, we found that among many cancer cells human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells are markedly resistant to apoptosis induction by EGCG (even at 100 μm for 72 h). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induced by stress stimuli represents a prime cellular defense mechanism, but it may be associated with enhanced cell proliferation and chemoresistance in some cancer cells. Because we found that A549 cells constitutively overexpress HO-1 and its associated transcription factor Nrf2, we tested an hypothesis that EGCG resistance in these cells may be linked with Nrf2-mediated HO-1 overexpression. HO-1 inhibition with tin-protoporphyrin IX and silencing with RNA interference rendered cells more sensitive to apoptosis induction by EGCG and classical prooxidants. Interestingly, EGCG at high concentration (>200 μm) induced apoptosis by suppressing expression of HO-1 protein and mRNA, and this effect correlated with a decrease in both Nrf2-ARE binding and HO-1-ARE-luciferase activity, suggesting Nrf2-driven transcriptional activation of ho-1. Because we observed notably high levels of phosphorylated protein kinase Cα and its suppression by EGCG and deferoxamine (an iron chelator), a possible mechanism involving phosphorylated protein kinase Cα and iron in Nrf2-HO-1 activation was further investigated. Collectively, our findings suggest that Nrf2-mediated HO-1 overexpression confers resistance to apoptosis induction by EGCG; therefore, its inactivation may be a target for overcoming the resistance to chemoprevention and chemotherapy.

The major mechanism of EGCG-mediated anticancer effects is considered to be related to induction of apoptosis (1Ahmad N. Feyes D.K. Nieminen A.L. Agarwal R. Mukhtar H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 2Khan N. Afaq F. Saleem M. Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2500-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Studies have shown differential sensitivity among different tumor cells or tumor cells versus normal cells to EGCG (1Ahmad N. Feyes D.K. Nieminen A.L. Agarwal R. Mukhtar H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 2Khan N. Afaq F. Saleem M. Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2500-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In particular, in many cancer cells EGCG has been shown to modulate multiple and often different signal transduction pathways. The reason for these observed differences is not clear but may be because of the differential oxidative status imposed by EGCG in various cell types or cell type-specific expression of endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is known to be highly induced by a variety of stress stimuli and many cancer chemopreventive agents, and it represents a prime cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress via antioxidant function of its catalytic products like bilirubin and carbon monoxide (CO) with concomitant induction of iron sequestering ferritin (3Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 54Sikorski E.M. Hock T. Hill-Kapturczak N. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F425-F441Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). On the contrary, its overexpression in human cancers may offer cancer cells a growth advantage and cellular resistance against chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (4Fang J. Akaike T. Maeda H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Nowis D. Legat M. Grzela T. Niderla J. Wilczek E. Wilczynski G.M. Glodkowska E. Mrowka P. Issat T. Dulak J. Jozkowicz A. Was H.

Because the growth of most tumors depends on HO-1 (6Tanaka S. Akaike T. Beppu T. Beppu T. Ogawa M. Tamura F. Miyamoto Y. Maeda H. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it is also considered as a target for cancer therapy in humans. In this context, HO-1 induction by stress-related agents in several types of human cancer cells has been reported to play a role in chemoresistance to apoptosis (5Nowis D. Legat M. Grzela T. Niderla J. Wilczek E. Wilczynski G.M. Glodkowska E. Mrowka P. Issat T. Dulak J. Jozkowicz A. Was H. Adamek M. Wrzosek A. Nazarewski S. Makowski M. Stoklosa T. Jakobisiak M. Golab J.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of HO-1 has been shown to lead to reduced tumor growth and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy (9Fang J. Sawa T. Akaike T. Akuta T. Sahoo S.K. Khaled G. Hamada A. Maeda H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3567-3574PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fang J. Sawa T. Akaike T. Greish K. Maeda H. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence to show that Nrf2 is a key transcriptional factor that activates the antioxidant-reactive element (ARE) and in turn regulates the expression of antioxidant phase II detoxifying enzymes. It is interesting to note that the promoter region of ho-1 gene contains the ARE sequence (11Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Watai Y. Tong K.I. Shibata T. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 12Lee J.S. Surh Y.J. Cancer Lett. 2005; 28: 171-184Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Antioxid.

Chem. 2004; 279: 919-929Google Scholar). The mode of transcriptional activation of Nrf2 is not fully understood, but the available evidence points to two mechanisms. In the first, a sulfhydryl modification of its cytosolic sequestering protein Keap1 by chemical inducers leads to Nrf2 dissociation from Keap1 and subsequent translocation into the nucleus, thereby activating ARE (11Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Watai Y. Tong K.I. Shibata T. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, it is considered that several upstream signaling kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC), phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK), regulate Nrf2/ARE activity (12Lee J.S. Surh Y.J. Cancer Lett. 2005; 28: 171-184Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 14Martin D. Rojo A.I. Salinas M. Diaz R. Gallardo G. Alam J. De Galarreta C.M. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 919-929Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear which kinase acts as an upstream mediator of Nrf2. Histologically, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes ∼85% of all lung cancers and often shows intrinsic multidrug resistance, which is a major problem in its chemotherapy (15Seve P. Dumontet C. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2005; 5: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The expression levels of several factors such as p53, p-AKT, apoptosis-inducing factor, and multidrug resistance protein have been proposed recently to determine the chemoresistance against conventional treatment protocols (16Gallego M.A. Joseph B. Hemstrom T.H. Tamiji S. Mortier L. Kroemer G. Formstecher P. Zhivotovsky B. Marchetti P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6282-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Ikuta K. Takemura K. Sasaki K. Kihara M. Nishimura M. Ueda N. Naito S. Lee E. Shimizu E. Yamauchi A. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2005; 28: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While comparing EGCG-mediated cytotoxicity in various cancer cells, we observed that human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, which belong to NSCLC, were significantly resistant to the induction of apoptosis by EGCG. We then found that these cells express high levels of constitutive HO-1 and Nrf2, as compared with other human cancer cells. It has been shown that HO-1 expression can be elevated in the lung in response to oxidative stress associated with infection, hyperoxia, and inflammatory diseases or acute respiratory distress syndrome (18Carter E.P. Garat C. Imamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L24-L25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Mumby S. Upton R.L. Chen Y. Stanford S.J. Quinlan G.J. Nicholson A.G. Gutteridge J.M. Lamb N.J. Evans T.W. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 32: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although Nrf2 plays a critical role in protection against pulmonary fibrosis, presumably through enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity (53Cho H.Y. Reddy S.P. Yamamoto M. Kleeberger S.R. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), HO-1/Nrf2 activation as a defense mechanism in carcinoma cells during lung carcinogenesis may lead to their resistance to chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic regimens. Here we first show that constitutively overexpressed HO-1 in A549 lung cancer cells is strongly associated with resistance to apoptosis induction by EGCG. We further demonstrate that this overexpression is regulated by phosphorylation of PKCα and subsequent activation of Nrf2. We suggest that the PKCα-Nrf2-HO-1 pathway may be exploited for targeted therapy of lung cancer. Chemicals and Reagents—A purified preparation of EGCG (>98% pure) was procured from Sigma, and aliquots of stock solution (20 mm) prepared in Me2SO were stored at -80 °C for further use. Ro-317549, PD98059, LY294002, and triciribine were obtained from Calbiochem. Tin-protoporphyrin-IX (SnPPIX) was obtained from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT), and l-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and deferoxamine (DFO) were purchased from Sigma. Cell Treatment and Viability—The A549, LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, AsPC-1, HCC1419, SKOV-3, and HT-29, H196, and H441 human cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured according to the manufacturer's protocol. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) were procured form Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD) and cultured as per the manufacturer's instructions. For measurement of cell viability, cells (2-5 × 104 cells per well for 24-well plate) were seeded into plates, cultured overnight in complete medium, and then treated with EGCG (0-100 μm) or other agents for 24, 48, and 72 h. After appropriate time periods, cells were subjected to MTT assay as described earlier (20Kweon M.H. Jung M.J. Sung H.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to determine cell viability. DNA Fragmentation Assay—Following treatment of cells as described above, the cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, incubated with DNA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged. The supernatant obtained was incubated with RNase (0.2 mg/ml) at room temperature and then with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37°C. DNA was extracted and resolved as described previously (21Kweon M.H. Park Y.I. Sung H.C. Mukhtar H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA for Nrf2-ARE binding was performed as described previously (22Saleem M. Kaur S. Kweon M.H. Adhami V.M. Afaq F. Mukhtar H. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1956-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic double strand oligonucleotide corresponding to a human HO-1 ARE was biotinylated using the biotin 3′ end labeling kit (Pierce). Biotin end-labeled target DNA was incubated with anti-human Nrf2 antibody (1 μl) for 30 min to detect supershifted Nrf2, subjected to native gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a nylon membrane. ARE-Nrf2 binding was detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a chemiluminescent substrate followed by autoradiography. Binding specificity was tested by adding to nuclear extracts a 100-fold molar excess of cold ARE oligonucleotide. Transient Transfection of HO-1-ARE Reporter Vector and Luciferase Activity—HO-1/ARE reporter construct (hpHOpTi-Luc) provided by Dr. Jeffrey A. Johnson (University of Wisconsin, Madison) was made by inserting 34-bp DNA sequence (GAT CCT CTA GAG TCA CAG TGA CTT GGC AAA ATC AGA GAT CTC ACT GAA CCG TTT TAG TCT AG) located in 5′-flanking ARE region of human HO-1 gene into pTi-luciferase vector (23Chen C.Y.

Cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with ARE-luciferase reporter construct (0.25 μg/well) and β-galactosidase plasmid (0.1 μg/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI), and β-galactosidase activity was determined to normalize transfection efficiency. RNA Interference—The small interfering RNA (siRNA) against ho-1 was procured from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection was performed using Dharmafect transfection kit (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) and following the manufacturer's protocol (24Saleem M. Kweon M.H. Yun J.M. Adhami V.M. Khan N. Syed D.N. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11203-11213Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with ho-1 siRNA, duplex D-0063732-05-0005, human HMOX1 (sense, GGCAGAGGGUGAUAGAAGAUU, and antisense, PUCUUCUAUCACCCUCUGCCUU). The targeting site was pooled from open reading frame region of human ho-1 (NCBI accession number NM002133). Cells were also transfected with nontargeting, negative control siRNA (Dharmacon), which allows assessing target specificity and any nonspecific gene silencing effects. Briefly, A549 cells were transfected with 25-100 nmol/liter of siRNAs directed against the ho-1 (ho-1siRNA) for 6-48 h. The cells were harvested and processed for preparation of cell lysate or RNA for biochemical assays. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometry for apoptosis analysis was performed as described (20Kweon M.H. Jung M.J. Sung H.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cells transfected with siHO-1 RNA for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h were grown at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 100-mm culture dishes and treated with EGCG (80 μm) for 24 h or 0.5 mm H2O2 and 1 mm t-BHP for 6 h. The cells were trypsinized, processed for labeling with fluorescein-tagged dUTP nucleotide and PI by the use of an Apo-Direct apoptosis kit (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego), and analyzed by flow cytometry. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—Following 24 and 48 h of post-transfection with 25 nm HO-1 siRNA, cells were trypsinized and counted. A total of 5,000 cells in 0.7% agarose containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 2× RPMI medium were mixed with either EGCG solution (final concentration: 40 μm) or the same volume of PBS. The cells were poured onto 0.5% solidified agar in a 6-well plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2-humidified incubator for 14 days. The resulting plates were stained with 0.5 ml of 0.005% crystal violet for 2 h and observed under the microscope. Annexin V-Fluos-PI Staining—Annexin V-Fluos-PI staining for confocal microscopy was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) and as described previously (24Saleem M. Kweon M.H. Yun J.M. Adhami V.M. Khan N. Syed D.N. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11203-11213Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells were grown to about 60% confluency on cell culture slides and then treated with EGCG (0-300 μm) for 48 h. Apoptosis and necrosis were detected by using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Immunocytochemistry of Nrf2—A549 cells grown on culture slides and treated with EGCG as indicated were fixed in 100% methanol and incubated with monoclonal rabbit anti-Nrf2 antibody (2.5 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional 45 min in the dark. Stained cells were washed, mounted in an antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and examined with a fluorescence confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Thornwood, NY). RT-PCR and Northern Blotting—mRNA levels and expression were determined by RT-PCR and Northern blot as described (21Kweon M.H. Park Y.I. Sung H.C. Mukhtar H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Specific primers for human HO-1 (size of PCR product, 775 bp; sense, 5′-CAA GGA GGT GCA CAC GG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCT GGA TGT TGA GCA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a loading control (size of PCR product: 523 bp, sense, 5′-GAG TCG NCG CGG TTT CCT GC-3′, and antisense. 5′-CTG CTC CAA GCA CAG CTC AC-3′) were used for the first cDNA synthesis. For Northern blotting, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. Human HO-1 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the random hexamer priming system using a Rediprime™ II kit (Amersham Biosciences). Human Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells Are Highly Resistant to EGCG Cytotoxicity—Initially we compared in vitro cytotoxicity of EGCG on eight kinds of human epithelial cancer cells (see Fig. 1B). Treatment of all cells with EGCG (0-100 μm; 24, 48, and 72 h) generated varying degrees of dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic response with least effect in A549 cells (Fig. 1A). The treatment of all but A549 cancer cells with EGCG (>40 μm) for 24 h showed initial toxicity; A549 cells were highly resistant even up to 100 μm EGCG treatment for 24-48 h. At 40 μm of treatment for 48 h, significant cytotoxicity (p < 0.01-0.001) was noted for SKOV-3, HT-29, HCC1419, and PC-3 cells, whereas moderate toxicity at the same concentration of EGCG was observed for AsPC-1 and LNCaP cells. All cells except A549 were found to be sensitive to 10 μm EGCG at 72 h of exposure, where a significant cytotoxicity (42-76% cell viability, p < 0.01-0.001) was observed. Among all cells tested, A549 cells were highly resistant inasmuch as 85% cell viability was sustained for 72 h at 40 μm EGCG (Fig. 1A). The IC50 value at 72 h of exposure to EGCG was estimated to be in the following order: A549 > AsPC-1 > HCC1419 > LNCaP > DU145 > PC-3 > SKOV-3 > HT-29 (Fig. 1B). Expression of Redox-related Antioxidant Enzymes and Transcription Factors in Cancer Cells; Elevated Expression of HO-1, GCL, and Nrf2 in A549 Cells—Because EGCG has been known to generate (i) extracellular H2O2 in cell culture medium, (ii) intracellular ROS by the Fenton reaction upon cell entry, and (iii) subsequently to induce oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis (25Elbling L. Weiss R.M. Teufelhofer O. Uhl M. Knasmueller S. Schulte-Hermann R. Berger W. Micksche M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 26Nakagawa H. Hasumi K. Woo J.T. Nagai K. Wachi M. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we next determined the expression of HO-1, which is an inducible ROS-scavenging antioxidant, along with its constitutive isoform HO-2, to investigate its relevance to EGCG sensitivity and cellular antioxidant status. Strikingly, HO-1 was observed to be constitutively overexpressed in A549 cells as compared with other cancer cells tested (Fig. 2A). However, the expression level of HO-2 was almost similar in all cell lines. Because HO-1 is a representative Nrf2-mediated phase II detoxifying defense enzyme against oxidative stress, we also determined the expression level of other antioxidant phase II defense proteins. A549 cells were found to express high levels of GCL and thioredoxine (Trx) but not ferritin and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) as compared with other cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, wide variation in the expression level of other primary antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase was observed in most human epithelial cancer cells tested, which did not show any significant correlation to EGCG sensitivity (Fig. 2B). We further found that A549 cells, among all other cancer cells, express the highest amount of total Nrf2 along with a relatively low level of its cytosolic anchor Keap1 and repressor Bach 1 (Fig. 2C). On the contrary, noticeable differences in the level of other redox-related transcription factors, such as NF-κB, AP-1, or HIF-1, were not observed between A549 cells and other cancer cells. We therefore hypothesized that the constitutive high expression of HO-1 and its associated transcription factor Nrf2 in A549 cells may be associated with the observed high resistance to EGCG-caused cytotoxicity. To determine whether HO-1 overexpression is a general property of lung cancer cells or unique to NSCLC represented by A549 cells, and if EGCG resistance is specific to lung-derived cancer cells, we explored this possibility with additional lung cancer cells (NSCLC H441 cells and SCLC H196 cells) and primary NHBEs. A549 cells were found to be most resistant to EGCG treatment even than NHBEs cells (data not shown). Significant overexpression of HO-1 as well as higher expression levels of Nrf2 and GCL were observed only in A549 cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that EGCG resistance, HO-1, and Nrf2 overexpression are unique to A549 cells. But it was interesting to observe an unexpectedly low expression level of ferritin in A549 cells (Fig. 2, B and D), which is known to be concomitantly up-regulated with HO-1 induction (3Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 54Sikorski E.M. Hock T. Hill-Kapturczak N. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F425-F441Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Effect of SnPPIX and BSO on Resistance to EGCG-induced Apoptosis—To test our hypothesis, we first compared the effect of EGCG treatment (50 and 100 μm; 48 h) on the expression level of HO-1 and GCL in A549 cells and three kinds of EGCG-sensitive cells, SKOV-3, HCC1419, and HT-29 (Fig. 1B). Additionally, we performed DNA fragmentation analysis to confirm the apoptotic death caused by EGCG treatment. Although the levels of HO-1 and GCL in A549 cells were found to be decreased by EGCG treatment, this decrease was small when compared with other EGCG-sensitive cells (Fig. 3A). As expected, DNA fragmentation, which is an indicator of apoptosis, was not evident in A549 cells treated with EGCG (Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, DNA fragmentation was clearly evident in SKOV3, HCC1419, and HT29 cells treated with EGCG even at 50 μm of concentration. These results suggested that the high expression of HO-1 and GCL in A549 cells might be related to their resistance to EGCG-induced apoptosis. To verify the antiapoptotic role of HO-1 and GCL, we performed a combinatorial study of EGCG with specific inhibitors of HO-1 and GCL, SnPPIX (9Fang J. Sawa T. Akaike T. Akuta T. Sahoo S.K. Khaled G. Hamada A. Maeda H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3567-3574PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kweon M.H. Park Y.I. Sung H.C. Mukhtar H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and BSO, respectively (20Kweon M.H. Jung M.J. Sung H.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14573-14579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with SnPPIX (10 μm) and BSO (1 μm) for 2 h (nontoxic maximum effective concentrations), followed by treatment with EGCG (50-100 μm; 48 h). Both inhibitors rendered A549 cells more susceptible to EGCG treatment as assessed by the MTT (Fig. 3B) and DNA fragmentation assay (Fig. 3C), and this effect was found to be more pronounced (p < 0.01-0.001) by preincubation with SnPPIX than BSO (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting a pivotal role of HO-1 in EGCG resistance of A549 cells. Effect of HO-1 Silencing on Cell Growth and Chemoresistance of A549 Cells—To more directly assess involvement of constitutive overexpression of HO-1 in EGCG resistance, we performed siRNA-mediated silencing of the ho-1 gene. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of HO-1 protein (Fig. 4A) and mRNA (Fig. 4B) was effectively inhibited with all concentrations (25, 50, and 100 nm;48h) of ho-1 siRNA used. Nonsilencing siRNA did not exhibit any effect on HO-1 protein and mRNA. We next transfected cells with ho-1 siRNA (25 nm) for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, respectiv"
https://openalex.org/W2039395669,"Constitutively activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been associated with a variety of aggressive tumor types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, the mechanism of its activation is not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the molecular pathway that mediates constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in a series of HNSCC cell lines. We confirmed that NF-kappaB was constitutively active in all HNSCC cell lines (FaDu, LICR-LON-HN5 and SCC4) examined as indicated by DNA binding, immunocytochemical localization of p65, by NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression and its inhibition by dominant-negative (DN)-inhibitory subunit of NF-kappaB (IkappaBalpha), the natural inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation in HNSCC was found to be due to constitutive activation of IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK); and this correlated with constitutive expression of phosphorylated forms of IkappaBalpha and p65 proteins. All HNSCC showed the expression of p50, p52, p100 and receptor-interacting protein; all linked with NF-kappaB activation. The expression of constitutively active NF-kappaB in HNSCC is mediated through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, as NF-kappaB reporter activity was inhibited by DN-TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), DN-TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2, DN-receptor-interacting protein (RIP), DN-transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), DN-kappa-Ras, DN-AKT and DN-IKK but not by DN-TRAF5 or DN-TRAF6. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation was also associated with the autocrine expression of TNF, TNF receptors and receptor-activator of NF-kappaB and its ligand in HNSCC cells but not interleukin (IL)-1beta. All HNSCC cell lines expressed IL-6, a NF-kappaB-regulated gene product. Furthermore, treatment of HNSCC cells with anti-TNF antibody downregulated constitutively active NF-kappaB, and this was associated with inhibition of IL-6 expression and cell proliferation. Our results clearly demonstrate that constitutive activation of NF-kappaB is mediated through the TRADD-TRAF2-RIP-TAK1-IKK pathway, making TNF a novel target in the treatment of head and neck cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2121902604,"In a continuous T-maze alternation task, CA1 complex-spike neurons in the hippocampus differentially fire as the rat traverses overlapping segments of the maze (i.e., the stem) repeatedly via alternate routes. The temporal dynamics of this phenomenon were further investigated in the current study. Rats learned the alternation task from the first day of acquisition and the differential firing pattern in the stem was observed accordingly. More importantly, we report a phenomenon in which spatial correlates of CA1 neuronal ensembles gradually changed from their original firing locations, shifting toward prospective goal locations in the continuous T-maze alternation task. The relative locations of simultaneously recorded firing fields, however, were preserved within the ensemble spatial representation during this shifting. The within-session shifts in preferred firing locations in the absence of any changes in the environment suggest that certain cognitive factors can significantly alter the location-bound coding scheme of hippocampal neurons."

Dab1 is another adaptor protein that interacts with APP as well as with members of the apoE receptor family. We examined the effect of Dab1 on APP and apoEr2 processing in transfected cells and primary neurons. Dab1 interacted with APP and apoEr2 and increased levels of their secreted extracellular domains and their cytoplasmic C-terminal fragments. These effects depended on the NPXY domains of APP and apoEr2 and on the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Dab1 but did not depend on phosphorylation of Dab1.

Full-length Dab1 or its phosphotyrosine binding domain alone increased surface levels of APP, as determined by surface protein biotinylation and live cell staining. A ligand for apoEr2, the extracellular matrix protein Reelin, significantly increased the interaction of apoEr2 with Dab1. Surprisingly, we also found that Reelin treatment significantly increased the interaction of APP and Dab1.

The cytoplasmic domain of APP contains an NPTY sequence that serves as a binding motif for adaptor proteins that possess a phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB), such as members of the Fe65, X11, JIP, and Dab protein families. Such adaptor proteins play critical roles in tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction, protein trafficking and localization, phagocytosis, cell fate determination, and neuronal development (1King G.D. Turner R.S. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Most importantly for Alzheimer disease, interactions between these cytoplasmic proteins and APP also lead to altered processing of APP. The effects of several of these adaptor proteins on APP trafficking and processing have been studied. The Fe65 family (FE65, FE65L1 (2Guenette S.Y. Chang Y. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and FE65L2 (3Chang Y. Tesco G. Jeong W.J. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Guenette S.Y. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2002; 82: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, co-expression of FE65 and APP in HEK293 cells stabilizes immature APP and inhibits APPs formation and Aβ secretion (5Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The X11 family (X11α,-β, and -γ; also called Mint1, -2, and -3) are important in neuronal synaptic function (6Ho A. Morishita W. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). X11α slows cellular APP processing and reduces Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion, perhaps through preventing trafficking of APP to subcellular compartments containing active γ-secretase (7Mueller H.T. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39302-39306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). X11β reduces Aβ levels and amyloid plaque formation in the brains of transgenic APP mice (8Lee J.H. Lau K.F. Perkinton M.S. Standen C.L. Rogelj B. Falinska A. McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C. J. Biol.

Similar to X11α and -β, JIP-1b interaction with APP stabilizes immature APP and inhibits APPs, Aβ40, and Aβ42 secretion in vitro (9Taru H. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27567-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effects of the Dab family (Dab1 and Dab2) on APP processing are less well studied. Dab1 is important for nervous system development in mammals (10Bar I. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Eur. J. Morphol. 2000; 38: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Dab1 and Dab2 possess a PTB domain and have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of APP and apoE receptors (apoEr2, VLDLr, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) (11Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7507-7515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of apoEr2 and VLDLr interact with extracellular matrix protein Reelin during neuronal positioning (13Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Reelin induces Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation (13Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). If any of these components (Dab1, apoE receptors, or Reelin) is knocked out, a similar phenotype of impaired neuronal migration is observed. In this study, we demonstrate that Dab1 increases cell surface expression of APP and apoEr2, increases α-cleavage of APP and apoEr2, and decreases APP β-CTF and Aβ in transfected cells and in primary neurons. We found that Reelin treatment significantly increases co-immunoprecipitation of Dab1 with both APP and apoEr2. Moreover, Reelin, like Dab1, increases cleavage of APP and apoEr2 and decreases production of the β-CTF of APP and Aβ. Vector Construction—The following Dab1 constructs were produced by PCR and inserted into the PCMV-Tag4 expression vector (Stratagene) to FLAG tag the C termini (Fig. 1): Dab1-1 (residues 1-166), Dab1-2 (residues 167-555), and Dab1-3 (full-length, residues 1-555). ApoEr2 with a C-terminal HA tag was generated as described (14Hoe H.S. Rebeck G.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 137: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We produced an NPVY mutant of apoEr2 using site-directed mutagenesis, substituting alanine for asparagine. Wild-type APP770 and an APP NPTY mutant (APTY) with C-terminal Myc tags were the kind gifts of Dr. Brad Hyman. Recombinant DNA was confirmed by sequencing, and expression of correctly sized proteins was confirmed by Western blot. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—COS7 and HEK293 were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5-1 μg of plasmid in FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol and cultured 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. For co-transfections, cells were similarly transfected with 0.5-1 μg of each plasmid in FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. After 24 h the cells were transferred to Opti-MEM serum-free media (Invitrogen) and treated with indicated compounds. The Reelin-conditioned and control media were prepared and concentrated 10 times as described (15Pramatarova A. Ochalski P.G. Chen K. Gropman A. Myers S. Min K.T. Howell B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7210-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were incubated at a 1:10 dilution in serum-free media on primary neuronal cells for 30 min. Antibodies—We used antibodies anti-HA (Abcam), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-c-Myc (Abcam), and anti-Dab1 (from Dr. Andre Goffinet). Antibody 5810 (against the N terminus of apoEr2) was the kind gift of Dr. Uwe Beffert. For analysis of APP, we used 6E10 (identifying sAPPα) (Signet), 22C11 (Chemicon), and c1/6.1 (recognizing the C terminus of APP), provided by Dr. Anne Cataldo. Quantification of APP and ApoEr2 Proteolytic Fragments— Secreted fragments were identified by Western blot analysis of conditioned media (sAPPα, 6E10 antibody; sapoEr2, 5810 antibody). CTF were measured by Western blots of cell lysates (APP α-CTF, C1/6.1; APP βCTF, 6E10; apoEr2 CTF, HA antibodies). Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the conditioned media were determined by ELISA, using 1A10 (anti-Aβ40) or 1C3 (anti-Aβ42) as capture antibodies and 12B2, which recognizes both mouse and human Aβ as the detection antibody (Immuno-Biological Laboratories) (16Horikoshi Y.

Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Brain cortices were chopped and trypsinized for 10 min at 37 °C. After trypsinization, 0.4 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.025% DNase, and 12 mm MgSO4 were added and mixed until tissue was thoroughly homogenized. Cells were then transferred to Neurobasal medium containing B27 serum supplement, 1 mm glutamine, gentamycin, and Ara-C. Neurons (2 × 106 cells) were seeded on 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well tissue culture plates. For analysis of the APP-Dab1 interaction, cells were seeded on 35-mm tissue culture plates. Cells at 10 days in vitro were treated with either control or Reelin-containing medium for 30 min. For Dab1 knock-out primary neurons, brain cortices from mouse E16 embryos of Dab1+/- crosses were dissociated separately, and neurons were seeded from each embryo into the pre-coated 24-well tissue cultures. For experiments on the effects of Dab1, neurons derived from individual embryos were used as follows: Dab1+/+ (n = 12), Dab1+/- (n = 9), and Dab1-/- (n = 8). Reelin Treatment of APPsw-TG Primary Neurons—APPsw-TG mice (Tg2576) were obtained from Taconic. APPsw-TG (E16.5) cortices were dissected in Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS) and were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with HBSS and dissociated further with DNase with trypsin inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) with a glass pipette. The dissociated cells were washed again in HBSS twice and resuspended in Neurobasal defined media (Invitrogen/Invitrogen) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen) and 4% B-27 supplement. Primary neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well dishes and grown at 37 °C for 4-5 days. The media were changed for all neurons 1 h before stimulation, and then primary neurons were treated with either control or Reelin-conditioned media (10×) for 18 h. The supernatants were collected, and the levels of secreted Aβ40 were measured by ELISA (BIOSOURCE). Wild-type (n = 3) and APPsw-TG (n = 3) cortices were used, and three cultures from each animal were treated with Reelin or control media. Co-immunoprecipitations—Transfected COS7 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the anti-HA antibody or 6E10 antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were then washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated with antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized by ECL detection system and exposed to film. Biotin Labeling of Cell Surface Proteins—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with APP and Dab1 constructs or apoEr2 and Dab1 constructs in FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, and surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS under gentle shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. 50 μl of quenching solution was added to cells at 4 °C, which were washed twice with TBS. Cells were collected in 500 μl of lysis buffer, disrupted by sonication on ice, incubated for 30 min on ice, and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min). To isolate biotin-labeled proteins, lysate was added to immobilized NeutrAvidin™ gel (50 μl) and incubated 1 h at room temperature. Gels were washed five times with wash buffer and incubated 1 h with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, including 50 mm dithiothreitol. Eluants were analyzed by immunoblotting. Live Cell Surface Staining—Transfected HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibody diluted in ECS (containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/l phenol red, and 10 μm d-serine (all from Sigma), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) for 8 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in ECS and then incubated with 22C11 antibody for 8 min, washed with ECS, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) goat anti-mouse antibody for 8 min at room temperature. Final washes were carried out with ECS. After fixing the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were imaged on an Axioskop FS microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a ×63, 0.9 NA, Achroplan, water-immersion objective or with a Nikon E600 microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a ×60, 1.0 NA. FE65-dependent APP Luciferase Transactivation Assay—The FE65-dependent APP luciferase transactivation assay was performed by the method of Cao and Sudhof (18Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the APP-Gal4 construct, FE65-myc, and Dab1 constructs, as well as the pG5E1B-luciferase reporter plasmid (to measure activation) and a β-galactosidase plasmid (to normalize transfection efficiency). Luciferase activity from cell lysates was determined in triplicate using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) by VICTOR2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results were normalized to β-galactosidase expression levels by using aβ-galactosidase enzyme assay kit (Promega). Statistical Analyses—Experiments were repeated a minimum of four times unless otherwise noted. All data were analyzed using analysis of variance with Graphpad Prism 4 software, using Tukey's multiple comparison test for post hoc analyses with significance determined as p < 0.05. Student's t test was performed on Aβ measures from Reelin-treated primary neurons. Descriptive statistics were calculated with StatView 4.1 and displayed as an expressed mean ± S.E. Dab1 Interacts with ApoEr2 in COS7 Cells and Affects Its Processing—In order to examine the effects of Dab1 on processing of apoEr2, we generated FLAG-tagged constructs of full-length Dab1, Dab1 lacking the PTB domain, and the PTB domain lacking the C terminus of Dab1 (Fig. 1A). Proteins from each construct were successfully expressed in COS7 cells with full-length apoEr2 (data not shown). We tested for interactions between the PTB domain of Dab1 and apoEr2 by immunoprecipitating the Dab1 PTB domain with an anti-FLAG antibody and probing for apoEr2 with the anti-HA antibody. ApoEr2 co-precipitated with the PTB domain of Dab1 but did not precipitate in the absence of Dab1 (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Levels of total apoEr2 and Dab1 were consistent across transfections (Fig. 1B, middle and lower panels). We also immunoprecipitated apoEr2 with the anti-HA antibody and found that the Dab1 PTB construct co-precipitated (data not shown). We tested whether the interaction of Dab1 with apoEr2 affected processing of apoEr2. ApoEr2 is cleaved similarly to APP, with an α-secretase-like activity generating a secreted form of the receptor and a membrane-bound CTF (14Hoe H.S. Rebeck G.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 137: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, γ-secretase activity cleaves the apoEr2 CTF (14Hoe H.S. Rebeck G.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 137: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with full-length apoEr2 alone or apoEr2 with Dab1 constructs lacking the C terminus of Dab1 or lacking the PTB domain. Secreted apoEr2 was measured in conditioned media, and apoEr2 CTF was measured in cell lysates. Full-length Dab1 significantly increased secreted apoEr2 and apoEr2 CTF (Fig. 1C). Dab1 expression did not alter cell apoEr2 levels (Fig. 1C). We also found that the PTB domain of Dab1 increased secreted apoEr2 and apoEr2 CTF (Fig. 1D). The PTB domain of Dab1 expression also slightly increased cell apoEr2 levels (Fig. 1D). Because Dab1 interacts with apoEr2 through its PTB domain (19Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 126: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that constructs of Dab1 lacking the PTB domain would not affect apoEr2 processing. We found that PTB deletion construct of Dab1 did not affect sapoEr2 or apoEr2 CTF levels (Fig. 1E). Thus, Dab1 interactions with apoEr2 promote the cleavage of apoEr2, and this effect depends on the Dab1 PTB domain. To test the nature of soluble and cell-associated protein bands, we transfected apoEr2 and measured the cell-associated apoEr2 and secreted apoEr2. We found that the band for cell-associated apoEr2 migrated slightly higher than that for sapoEr2 (Fig. 1F). Dab1 Interacts with APP in COS7 Cells and Affects Its Processing— Dab1 was reported to interact with APP by glutathione S-transferase pulldown, yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and x-ray crystallography (11Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7507-7515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether Dab1 had a similar effect on APP processing as it had for apoEr2. We transfected COS7 cells with APP and the Dab1 PTB domain, immunoprecipitated Dab1 PTB with the anti-FLAG antibody, and probed for APP with the anti-Myc antibody. APP co-precipitated with the PTB domain of Dab1 but did not precipitate in the absence of Dab1 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). We made similar observations with full-length Dab1 (data not shown). Western blot analysis of COS7 cell extracts confirmed similar levels of cell APP and Dab1 across transfections (Fig. 2A, middle and lower panels). We tested whether the interaction of Dab1 with APP affected processing of APP in COS7 cells. Expression of full-length Dab1 significantly increased secreted APP and APP α-CTF levels but significantly decreased APP β-CTF levels (Fig. 2B). Thus, Dab1 co-expression promoted the α-cleavage of APP and decreased its β-cleavage. We also found that the PTB domain lacking the C terminus of Dab1 increased secreted APP and APP CTF (Fig. 2C). The PTB domain lacking the C terminus of Dab1 expression slightly increased cell APP levels (Fig. 2C). We also transfected COS7 cells with APP and the PTB deletion construct of Dab1, and we measured the amount of secreted APP and APP CTF. The PTB deletion construct of Dab1 did not affect levels of any APP proteolytic product as follows: secreted APP, APP α-CTF, or APP β-CTF (Fig. 2D). To test the nature of soluble and cell-associated protein bands, we transfected APP and measured the cell-associated APP and secreted APP. We found that the band for cell-associated APP is slightly higher than that for sAPP (Fig. 2F). Finally, because Dab1 affected APP processing, we examined whether it affected Aβ production in COS7 cells. Full-length Dab1 significantly decreased secreted Aβ40 levels (by 68%) and Aβ42 levels (by 44%) (Fig. 2E). APP-Dab1 Interactions Do Not Alter APP or Dab1 Phosphorylation—Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 is important for its signal-transducing effects in development (20Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To test whether the interaction of Dab1 with APP affects Dab1 phosphorylation, we expressed APP with Dab1 in COS7 cells as above. We included a form of Dab1 in which its five tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine (5F) as a negative control. As a positive control, we also included a constitutively active form of the kinase Fyn, which phosphorylates both Dab1 and APP (21Arnaud L. Ballif B.A. Forster E. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9293-9302Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated Dab1 and probed for phosphotyrosine. Both full-length and mutant 5F Dab1 did not show anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity (Fig. 3A). However, co-transfection with Fyn significantly increased anti-phosphotyrosine Dab1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3A, 1st panel). We also performed the reverse experiment, immunoprecipitating with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and probing with anti-Dab1 antibody (Fig. 3A, 2nd panel). Co-transfection with Fyn significantly increased anti-Dab1 immunoreactivity, but no phospho-Dab1 was observed in the presence of APP alone. To measure the expression levels of Dab1, we immunoprecipitated with an anti-Dab1 antibody, and we probed with a second anti-Dab1 antibody (Fig. 3A, 3rd panel). Strong Dab1 and Dab1 5F immunoreactivity were observed in all the transfected samples. Finally, we measured Fyn and APP levels in transfected cells via immunoblot to demonstrate their expression (Fig. 3A, 4th and 5th panels). We similarly asked whether the interaction of Dab1 with APP affected APP phosphorylation, using the same cells. We immunoprecipitated APP with an anti-c1/6.1 antibody, and probed for phosphotyrosine. COS7 cells transfected with Fyn had measurable levels of phospho-APP (Fig. 3B, 5th lane, 1st panel), but expression of full-length Dab1 or Dab1 5F constructs did not result in phospho-APP. Levels of full-length Dab1 and Dab1 5F were similar and levels of APP were consistent across transfections (Fig. 3B, lower panels). These results suggest that unphosphorylated Dab1 is capable of binding APP and altering its processing without affecting its tyrosine phosphorylation. Dab1 Affects APP and ApoEr2 Processing via Their NPXY Motifs—To test whether the NPTY motif of APP was important in the effect of Dab1 on processing of APP (as expected), we used a construct of APP where the NPTY sequence was changed to APTY. We transfected COS7 cells with full-length Dab1 and wild-type or mutant APP, and we measured the amount of APP CTF and secreted APP. Levels of cellular APP, APP CTF, and sAPP were similar in cells transfected with wild-type APP versus mutant APP (Fig. 4A, 1st and 3rd lanes). Dab1 co-expression increased APP CTF and sAPP from wild-type APP (Fig. 4A, 2nd lane). However, Dab1 co-expression did not alter levels of mutant APP CTF or sAPP (Fig. 4A, 4th lane). Levels of full-length cell-associated APP were not altered by Dab1 co-expression (Fig. 4A, middle panel). To similarly test whether the NPVY motif of apoEr2 was important in the effect of Dab1 on processing of apoEr2, we generated a construct of apoEr2 where the NPVY sequence was changed to APVY. We transfected COS7 cells with full-length Dab1 and wild-type or mutant apoEr2, and we measured the amount of apoEr2 CTF and secreted apoEr2. Levels of cellular apoEr2, apoEr2 CTF, and sapoEr2 were similar in cells transfected with wild-type apoEr2 versus mutant apoEr2 (Fig. 4B, 1st and 3rd lanes). Dab1 co-expression increased apoEr2 CTF and sapoEr2 from wild-type apoEr2 (Fig. 4B, 2nd lane), but Dab1 co-expression did not alter the levels of mutant apoEr2 CTF or sapoEr2 (Fig. 4B, 4th lane). Levels of total cell-associated apoEr2 were not altered by Dab1 co-expression. Thus, the NPXY sequences were important to the effects of Dab1 on both APP and apoEr2 processing. Dab1 Increases Levels of Cell Surface APP and ApoEr2—A recent study has shown that Dab1 regulates both cell surface expression and internalization of apoEr2 and VLDLr (22Morimura T. Hattori M. Ogawa M. Mikoshina K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16901-16908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of Dab1 on APP or apoEr2 cleavage could be caused by changes in APP and apoEr2 trafficking. To examine the effect of Dab1 on cell surface levels of APP or apoEr2, we co-transfected COS7 cells with APP or apoEr2 and the various constructs of Dab1 (Fig. 1A). We measured cell surface proteins by biotin-labeling live cells and isolated biotin-labeled proteins from lysates with avidin beads and immunoblotting apoEr2 or APP. Levels of cell surface apoEr2 and APP were increased by co-expression of full-length Dab1 (Fig. 5, A and B, upper panels) compared with Dab1 without the PTB domain (which did not affect APP or apoEr2 processing (Figs. 1 and 2)). Quantification of the Western blots showed a 340% increase in apoEr2 and a 270% increase in APP in the presence of full-length Dab1 (p < 0.01). Levels of total cell-associated APP or apoEr2 were similar among the transfected cells (Fig. 5, A and B, lower panels). We also found that levels of cell surface APP or apoEr2 were increased by constructs containing only the PTB domain of Dab1 (data not shown). As another measure of cell surface levels, we immunostained live cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with APP and either the PTB domain of Dab1, the PTB deletion construct of Dab1, or the full-length Dab1. We found that the PTB domain and full-length Dab1, which interact with APP, increased cell surface expression of APP compared with the PTB truncated Dab1, which does not interact with APP (Fig. 5C). Thus, both assays demonstrated that Dab1 constructs containing the PTB domain increased surface levels of APP. Dab1 Alters the Fe65-APP Interaction—Other adaptor proteins bind the APP intracellular domain, potentially affecting the interaction with Dab1. We asked whether Dab1 affects the interaction of Fe65 with the cytoplasmic product of γ-secretase cleavage of APP CTF, the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We used an Fe65-dependent APP luciferase transactivation assay to assess AICD in the presence of a Dab1 deletion mutant or full-length Dab1. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with APP-Gal4, Fe65, a luciferase reporter construct (G5E1B-Luc), and Dab1 constructs. Full-length Dab1 resulted in a 75% reduction in Fe65-dependent transactivation. However, the deletion mutant of Dab1 without the PTB domain did not affect the production of AICD (Fig. 6). Levels of Fe65 were similar among the transfected cells (Fig. 6, lower panel). Reelin Increases the Interaction between APP and Dab1 or ApoEr2 and Dab1—Dab1 is necessary for the regulation of neuronal positioning in the developing brain (12Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M.

All three known Akt family members, Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, are expressed in the myocardium, although Akt1 and Akt2 are most abundant. Previous studies demonstrated that Akt1 and Akt3 overexpression results in enhanced myocardial size and function. Yet, little is known about the role of Akt2 in modulating cardiac metabolism, survival, and growth.

In contrast, akt2-/- mice displayed normal cardiac growth responses to provocative stimulation, including ligand stimulation of cultured cardiomyocytes, pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction, and myocardial infarction. However, akt2-/- mice were found to be sensitized to cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to ischemic injury, and apoptosis was significantly increased in the peri-infarct zone of akt2-/- hearts 7 days after occlusion of the left coronary artery.

These results implicate Akt2 in the regulation of cardiomyocyte metabolism and survival. Cardiac growth and metabolism are coordinated through the integration of a complex array of extracellular and intracellular signals. Much recent work suggests that the Akt family of intracellular serine-threonine kinases regulates both cardiac growth and metabolism (1Dorn G.W. Force T. J. Clin.

Akt family members promote glycogen synthesis through phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which itself inhibits glycogen synthesis (11Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P.

In addition, Akt kinases inhibit fatty acid metabolism by phosphorylating and inhibiting FOXO-1, a forkhead family transcription factor that positively modulates fatty acid oxidative gene expression (13Southgate R.J.

Although the role of Akt family members in cardiac growth and metabolism has been widely studied, the role of Akt2 in the development of physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy is unknown. Additionally, the role of individual Akt family members in the regulation of cardiac metabolism remains unexplored. In the current study, an Akt2 loss-of-function murine model was utilized to assess the role of Akt2 in cardiac growth, metabolism, and cardiomyocyte survival. Here, we show that Akt2 is dispensable in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in response to a variety of physiological and pathological provocative stimuli. Conversely, we demonstrate that Akt2 is absolutely required for the maintenance of normal cardiac glucose metabolism and for cardiomyocyte survival in response to ischemic injury.

Cultures were isolated in the presence of butanedione monoxime and were switched to culture medium containing 10 μm blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to assay. 2-[3H]Deoxy-d-glucose Uptake Assays—Serum-deprived (16 h) adult male mouse cardiac myocyte cultures were incubated in mouse myocyte culture medium containing 1 μCi/ml 2DG (American Radiochemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in the presence or absence of 2 nm insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5′. 2DG uptake was determined to be linear with respect to time for up to 10-min 2DG pulse (data not shown). Non-carrier-mediated 2DG uptake was corrected by measuring 2DG uptake in AMCM cultures preincubated (15 min) with cytochalasin B (Sigma-Aldrich). Counts measured in these cultures were subtracted from experimental cultures as background. Uptake in each culture was normalized for total sample protein abundance by protein concentration determination using the Bradford Coomassie blue dye reagent. Results are expressed as cpm per μg of protein ± S.E. for n = 3 samples under each condition. Results are representative of a minimum of three experiments under each set of conditions. Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures as previously described. Total Akt2 antibodies and phospho-specific Akt, GSK3β, p70 S6 kinase (S6K), S6 ribosomal subunit, and ERK1/2 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Caspase-3, total ERK1/2, and total Akt1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Total GLUT1 antiserum was a kind gift from the laboratory of Kelle Moley, Washington University School of Medicine. Phospho-specific Akt, GSK3β, and S6 antibodies were probed simultaneously. Thereafter, membranes were stripped of bound antibody using 0.2 m NaOH prior to reprobing. Isolated Working Mouse Heart Perfusion—Isolated mouse working heart perfusions were based on a previously described procedure (17Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult male mice (8 weeks old) were heparinized (100 units, intraperitoneal) 10 min prior to anesthesia. Animals were then deeply anesthetized with 5-10 mg of Na+-pentobarbitol (intraperitoneal). Hearts were excised and placed in an ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) solution (118 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5.0 mm glucose, 30 microunits/ml insulin, pH 7.4). Hearts were cannulated first via the aorta and perfused retrogradely by the Langendorff method. Following left atrial cannulation, perfusion was switched to working heart perfusion with KHB solution containing 0.4 mm palmitate bound to 3% fatty acidfree bovine serum albumin with a preload pressure of 11.5 mmHg and an afterload pressure of 50 mmHg for 60 min with oxygenated buffer solution. To determine palmitate and glucose oxidation rates, trace amounts of [3H]palmitate (0.1 μCi/ml) and [U-14C]glucose (0.1 μCi/ml) were used, respectively. Samples were collected every 10 min for 14CO2 trapped in 1 m hyamine hydroxide solution as a result of glucose oxidation, 3H2O was released into the buffer as a result of palmitate oxidation, and the radioactivity was counted. Functional measurements like cardiac output and aortic flows, peak systolic pressure, and heart rate were acquired every 10 min for 10 s using in-line flow probes (Transonic Systems, Inc.), the MP100 system from AcqKnowledge (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.), and a pressure transducer (TSD 104A, BIOPAC Systems), respectively. Coronary flow was calculated as the difference between cardiac output and aortic flows. Cardiac work was calculated as the product of peak systolic pressure and cardiac output. At the end of each perfusion, hearts were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. A small piece of heart tissue was also used for determining dry to wet weight ratio. [3H]Palmitate Uptake Assays—Male AMCMs were isolated and serum-starved for 1 h prior to incubation with up to 100 nm insulin for 20 h. Following the incubation period, α minimal essential medium containing 2 mm unlabeled palmitate complexed with 20% bovine serum albumin (3:1 complex ratio) and 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cultures were pulsed (5 min) and washed extensively in ice-cold 10 mm phloretin in phosphate-buffered saline solution. Cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH/0.2% SDS, and 80% of the lysate was counted in 5 ml of Ultima Gold liquid scintillation counting fluid. Uptake in each culture was normalized for total protein amount as measured by Bradford protein concentration determination. Leucine Uptake Assays—Serum-deprived (16 h) adult mouse cardiac myocyte cultures were incubated in mouse myocyte culture medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 100 nm endothelin-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 nm IGF-1 for 16 h. Uptake was normalized for total protein abundance by Bradford protein concentration determination. Results are expressed as total cpm per μg of protein ± S.E. Transverse Aortic Constriction—TAC operations were performed on anesthetized akt2-/- and WT mice to induce cardiac pressure overload (18Harris I.S. Zhang S. Treskov I. Kovacs I. Weinheimer C. Muslin A.J. Circulation. 2004; 110: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sham-operated akt2-/- and their WT littermates were used as controls. The surgeon was blinded to the genetic status of the mice. Seven days after surgery, all groups were evaluated by echocardiography (18Harris I.S. Zhang S. Treskov I. Kovacs I. Weinheimer C. Muslin A.J. Circulation. 2004; 110: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mice with a Doppler gradient between 3.5 and 5.0 m/s were included in subsequent analyses. Mice were sacrificed, and postmortem and histological studies were performed as described below. Histology—Ventricular tissue was fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, microtome-sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin & eosin. Myocyte cross-sectional areas from three to five randomly selected high power fields from three to five different mice in each group were calculated on a Carl Zeiss, Inc. Axioskop microscope using ImageJ (version 1.34S) software. In some cases, myocardial tissue sections were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). TUNEL was performed on 5-mm paraffin sections with a TdT-FragEL DNA fragmentation detection kit (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA). Sections were mounted on coverslips and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Experimental Myocardial Infarction—Murine myocardial infarction surgery was performed as previously described (19Ren J. Zhang S. Kovacs A. Wang Y. Muslin A.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 617-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In brief, anesthetized and ventilated mice were subjected to thoracotomy, and a single 8-0 Prolene suture was tied around the proximal left coronary artery, ∼1 mm distal to the atrioventricular junction. Successful occlusion was confirmed by the appearance of pallor of the anterior left ventricular wall. The incision was closed, and the animal was allowed to recover on a heating pad. The surgeon was blinded to the genetic status of the mice. At 1 day and at 7 days post-myocardial infarction (MI), mice were evaluated by echocardiography. The initial infarct size, indicated by the segmental wall motion score index (SWMSI), was determined as previously described (20Kanno S. Lerner D.L. Schuessler R.B. Betsuyaku T. Yamada K.A. Saffitz J.E. Kovacs A. J. Am. Soc. Echocardiogr. 2002; 15: 601-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Only mice with a SWMSI between 0.2 and 0.5 were included in subsequent analyses. 7 days after surgery, mice were sacrificed and the hearts were dissected, weighed, and paraffin-embedded for histological examination. In Vitro Apoptosis Assay—Serum-deprived (3 h) AMCMs were incubated in the presence of 25 μm H2O2 for 16 h prior to lysis and evaluation of apoptosis by the Cell Death Detection Apoptosis ELISA Assay Kit (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) precisely according to manufacturer specifications. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated via TRIzol reagent from left ventricles obtained from sham and MI-operated WT and akt2-/- mice 7 days post-operation. TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was subsequently performed as previously described (18Harris I.S. Zhang S. Treskov I. Kovacs I. Weinheimer C. Muslin A.J. Circulation. 2004; 110: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All statistical relationships were determined by two-tailed, two-sample homoscedastic t test with Bonferroni post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake Depends on PI3K in Cultured Cardiomyocytes—Cardiomyocytes express two transmembrane glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT4, and insulin-dependent glucose transport depends on the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (21Cheatham B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previous work implicated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)-Akt pathway in cardiomyocyte glucose transport. Indeed, cultured cardiomyocytes lacking PDK1 are resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (22Mora A. Sakamoto K. McManus E.J. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3632-36238Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, other signaling pathways, including the p38 MAPK pathway, may be involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. To evaluate the role of various signaling pathways in cardiomyocyte metabolism, cultured AMCMs were stimulated with 2 nm insulin in the presence of various pharmacological agents, and 2DG uptake was evaluated. Treatment of cells with LY294002 (50 μm), an inhibitor of PI3K, completely blocked insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake (Fig. 1). However, treatment of cells with SB202190 (10 μm), a p38 MAPK inhibitor, did not affect 2DG uptake. Treatment of cells with PD98059 (50 μm), a MAPK kinase 1/2 (also called MEK) inhibitor, modestly reduced 2DG uptake in response to insulin, but 2DG uptake was significantly stimulated in comparison to cells treated with PD98059 alone. Insulin-stimulated Signal Transduction and Glucose Transport Was Blocked in akt2-/- AMCMs—Although pharmacological studies supported the role of the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway in insulin-stimulated cardiomyocyte glucose uptake, they did not specify whether a specific Akt family member was required for this process. To address this issue, AMCMs derived from akt1-/- and akt2-/- mice were analyzed for insulin-stimulated signal transduction and glucose uptake. Insulin-stimulated signaling via the canonical Akt pathway was impaired in akt1-/- and akt2-/- AMCMs incubated in 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Phosphorylation of Akt1-3 (Ser-473), GSK3β (Ser-9), p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389), and the S6 ribosomal subunit (Ser-235/236) was detected in WT AMCMs, but this response was reduced in both akt1-/- and akt2-/- cultures (Figs. 2A and 3A).FIGURE 3Akt2 is essential for normal cardiac glucose uptake. A, analysis of the insulin-stimulated Akt signaling pathway in WT and akt2-/- AMCMs. Serum-deprived AMCMs were stimulated with vehicle or with 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated forms of Akt, GSK3β, p70 S6K, and S6. Total ERK1/2 was probed to control for protein loading. B, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in akt2-/- AMCMs. Serum-deprived AMCMs from 8-week-old WT and akt2-/- mice were treated with vehicle or with 2 nm insulin in the presence of [3H]2DG for 5 min. The mean -fold 2DG uptake ± S.E. is graphed. 2DG uptake in parallel cultures preincubated with 10 μm cytochalasin B was uniformly subtracted from experimental groups to control for nonspecific 2DG transport. The following two-tailed, two sample t tests were performed with Bonferroni post-hoc correction (two hypotheses): WT-stimulated versus WT control, and WT-stimulated versus akt2-/--stimulated. *, p < 0.05 versus WT control; φ, p < 0.05 versus WT stimulated. C, impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in akt2 haploinsufficient AMCMs. WT and akt2+/- AMCMs were serum-deprived and stimulated with 2 nm insulin in the presence of [3H]2DG for 5 min as described in B. Graphed are the mean cpm per μg of sample protein in each group ± S.E. for n = 3 cultures per condition. The following two-tailed, two sample t tests were performed with Bonferroni post-hoc correction (two hypotheses): WT-stimulated versus WT control, WT-stimulated versus akt2+/--stimulated. *, p < 0.05 versus WT control; φ, p < 0.05 versus WT-stimulated. D, decreased glucose oxidation in akt2-/- mouse hearts. Ex vivo working heart perfusion preparations from WT and akt2-/- mice were analyzed in the presence of 10 microunits/ml insulin and [14C]glucose. Glucose oxidation was determined by measurement of [14C]CO2 appearance in the perfusate. Graphed is the mean nanomoles/min/g of dry heart weight ± S.E. for each genotype. ***, p < 0.001 versus WT cultures (two-tailed, homoscedastic t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether reduced insulin signal transduction in AMCMs correlated with abnormal physiology, the ability of WT, Akt1-deficient, and Akt2-deficient AMCMs to transport glucose across the plasma membrane was examined. Insulin-stimulated cardiac glucose transport was measured in serum-deprived AMCMs stimulated with or without 2 nm insulin (5 min) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml 2DG. 2DG uptake in response to insulin was not impaired in akt1-/- AMCMs when compared with WT AMCMs (Fig. 2B). However, basal 2DG uptake was modestly elevated in akt1-/- AMCMs, and this may be due to increased GLUT1 protein levels observed in these cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast to akt1-/- AMCMs, cardiomyocytes derived from akt2-/- mice displayed a marked defect in insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake (Fig. 3B). Indeed, 2DG uptake in WT AMCMs was stimulated by 139 ± 37% in response to insulin (Fig. 3B), but 2DG uptake in Akt2-deficient AMCMs increased by only 24% ± 8.9% after insulin treatment (p < 0.05 versus insulin-stimulated WT cultures). Basal 2DG uptake was normal in akt2-/- AMCMs, and this was associated with unchanged GLUT1 protein levels (supplemental Fig. S1). The glucose uptake defect in akt2-/- AMCMs was also observed in the presence of supraphysiological concentrations of insulin (100 nm, supplemental Fig. S2). AMCMs isolated from mice haploinsufficient for akt2 also showed a statistically significant defect in insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake (Fig. 3C), despite the fact that akt2+/- mice have normal total body glucose homeostasis (14Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). To test whether the decreased transport of glucose into cultured akt2-/- cardiomyocytes was associated with decreased cardiac glucose oxidation, ex vivo working heart experiments were performed in the presence of insulin (30 microunits/ml) and radiolabeled glucose. Isolated working hearts from akt2-/- mice exhibited glucose oxidation rates that were reduced by 47.2% relative to WT littermate control hearts (Fig. 3D, p < 0.001 versus WT control). Hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate, peak systolic pressure, cardiac output, coronary flow, cardiac work, stroke work, and cardiac power were also measured during working heart mode, and these were not statistically different in WT versus akt2-/- hearts (supplemental Fig. S3). Akt2 Deficiency Results in Enhanced Palmitate Uptake and Oxidation—Akt negatively regulates mediators of fatty acid uptake and metabolism, including FOXO-1, a key transcription factor regulating the expression of fatty acid oxidation pathway genes (13Southgate R.J. Bruce C.R. Carey A.L. Ateinberg G.R. Walder K. Monks R. Watt M.J. Hawley J.A. Birnbaum M.J. Febbraio M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2072-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FOXO-1 by Akt at serine 256 reduces its transcriptional activity by promoting its exclusion from the nucleus. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of FOXO-1 was reduced in akt2-/- AMCMs when compared with WT AMCMs (Fig. 4A). To examine whether reduced FOXO-1 phosphorylation was associated with enhanced fatty acid uptake, palmitate uptake assays were performed. Serum-starved WT and akt2-/- AMCMs were pulsed with [3H]palmitate in the presence of chronic (20 h) 100 nm insulin stimulation. Palmitate uptake was increased by 26% ± 8.0% in akt2-/- AMCMs when compared with WT cultures (Fig. 4B, p < 0.01 versus WT). To determine whether akt2-/- mice exhibited increased cardiac fatty acid oxidation, ex vivo working heart studies were performed. [3H]Palmitate oxidation was enhanced by 58.6% in Akt2-deficient mouse hearts when compared with WT controls (Fig. 4C, p = 0.013 versus WT). Normal Ligand-induced Growth in akt2-/- Cardiomyocytes—Cardiac-specific overexpression of mutant forms of Akt1 or Akt3 promotes cardiac hypertrophy that may progress to congestive heart failure (4Matsui T.

Because the kinase domains of Akt1 and Akt3 are >80% homologous to the Akt2 kinase domain, we examined the possibility that Akt2 is also involved in cardiac growth. The growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis is hypothesized to play a critical role in physiological cardiac hypertrophy secondary to exercise training (23Colao A. Vitale G. Pivonello R. Ciccarelli A. Di Somma C. Lombardi G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 151: S93-S101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Neri Serneri G.G. Boddi M. Modesti P.A. Cecioni I. Coppo M.

IGF-1-stimulated signaling was evaluated in WT and akt2-/- AMCMs. Treatment of WT AMCMs with 10 nm IGF-1 resulted in the phosphorylation of p70 S6K, GSK3β, and S6 that was blocked in akt2-/- AMCMs (Fig. 5, A and B). To assess the ability of Akt2-deficient AMCMs to undergo physiological hypertrophy, serum-deprived AMCMs from 8-week-old WT and akt2-/- mice were incubated with [3H]leucine for 16 h in the presence or absence of 10 nm IGF-1 (Fig. 5C). IGF-1-stimulated WT AMCMs incorporated leucine at a rate that was 20 ± 6% greater than that in untreated WT cultures (Fig. 5C, p < 0.05). IGF-1-stimulated akt2-/- AMCMs incorporated leucine to a similar extent (+23 ± 4%) when compared with untreated WT cultures (p < 0.01). Moreover, no difference in leucine incorporation was observed between IGF-1-stimulated WT and IGF-1-stimulated akt2-/- AMCMs. Normal ET1-induced Protein Synthesis in akt2-/- Cardia"

https://openalex.org/W2016211915,"Self-renewal is considered as a common property of stem cells. Dysregulation of stem cell self-renewal is likely a requirement for the development of cancer. Hiwi, the human Piwi gene, encodes a protein responsible for stem cell self-renewal. In this study, we investigated the expression of Hiwi at the RNA level by real-time quantitative PCR in 65 primary soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) and ascertained its impact on prognosis for STS patients. In a multivariate Cox's proportional hazards regression model, we found that an increased expression of Hiwi mRNA is a significant negative prognostic factor for patients with STS (P=0.017; relative risk 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-16.1) compared to medium expression of Hiwi transcript. However, a low expression of Hiwi transcript is correlated with a 2.4-fold (CI 0.7-8.0) increased risk, but this effect was not significant (P=0.17). Altogether, high-level expression of Hiwi mRNA identifies STS patients at high risk of tumour-related death. This is the first report showing a correlation between expression of a gene involved in stem cell self-renewal and prognosis of cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2085461231,"Survivin is a bifunctional protein that acts as a suppressor of apoptosis and has an essential role in mitosis. To date whether these two functions can be divorced has not been addressed. Here we show that the linker region between the BIR (baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repea115) domain of survivin and COOH-terminal α helix may be the key to separating its roles. When overexpressed survivin is present in interphase cells and shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Here we identify a rev-like nuclear exportation signal (NES) in the central domain of survivin and demonstrate that point mutations within this region cause accumulation of survivin in the nucleus. Interestingly cells expressing NES mutants exhibit reduced survival after X-irradiation. Moreover, cells expressing survivinL98A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-cleavage and caspase-3 activity after tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment compared with cells expressing full-length survivin-green fluorescent protein. These data suggest a direct link between the interphase localization of survivin and cellular responsiveness to apoptotic stimuli. Using a cell proliferation assay, we also found that ectopic expression of NES mutants can complement for depletion of endogenous survivin, indicating that they can execute the mitotic duties of survivin. Thus we demonstrate for the first time that 1) survivin has a functional NES; 2) nuclear accumulation of overexpressed survivin correlates with increased sensitivity of cells to ionising radiation; and 3) the anti-apoptotic and mitotic roles of survivin can be separated through mutation of its NES. Separating these two functions of survivin could open up new possibilities for therapeutic strategies aimed at eliminating cancer cells yet preserving normal cell viability.

Here we ask whether expression of survivin can directly affect cellular response to ionising radiation and whether the subcellular localization of survivin is important in this response. Excitingly we report that the cytoprotective and mitotic roles of survivin can be separated through mutation of the NES, which lack anti-apoptotic activity but still permit mitosis to proceed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Cell Culture—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Quikchange (Stratagene) on full-length human survivin with a COOH-terminal GFP tag in pBluescript, then constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 for expression in mammalian cells.HeLa and U2OS cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2,in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and fungizome. pcDNA3.1 constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). To create cell lines stably expressing the desired constructs, transfected cells were treated with 500 μg/ml G418, and GFP-positive colonies were selected 7-10 days post-transfection. To ensure homogeneity prior to analysis, clones were sorted by GFP-positive expression using an LSRII fluorescence activated cell sorter (BD Bioscience; see Ref. 1Noton E.A. Colnaghi R. Tate S.

Cells were viewed using an inverted Olympus microscope fitted with a ×63 (NA 1.35) oil immersion objective. Images were captured using a Hammamatsu CCD camera and DeltaVision Spectris software (Applied Precision), and snap shot jpeg images were prepared from three-dimensional projections of deconvolved stacks.Leptomycin B and TRAIL Treatments—To inhibit CRM1-mediated export from the nucleus, exponentially growing cultures were treated with 6 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB; LC Laboratories) for 2 h at 37°C. To induce apoptosis exponentially growing cells were treated for 75 min with 250 μg/ml recombinant human TRAIL (PeproTech EC Ltd.).Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described in Noton et al.

Installations Ltd., Reading, UK). 7 days post-irradiation cultures were stained with methylene blue (1 h, room temperature), dried, then rinsed with water. Colonies of >50 cells were counted.Quantitation of Caspase-3 Activity—Cell lysates were prepared by incubating 106 cells/ml in mammalian protein extraction buffer (Perbio Science), containing 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors, 1 μg/μl pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 1 h at room temperature. Lysates were then centrifuged and the supernatant snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Caspase-3 activity assays were carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate using the fluorogenic tetrapeptide, Ac-DEVD-AMC (Sigma) as substrate. The substrate (5 ng) was incubated at 37 °C with 20μl of cell lysate in 200 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5), in the presence or absence of the caspase-3 specific inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (0.5 μg; Biomol). Relative fluorescence produced by AMC release was measured at 30, 60, and 90 min using a SpectraMax Gemini Spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wave-lengths set at 380 and 440 nm, respectively.GST Pulldown—GST pulldown experiments were performed as described in Noton et al.

A silent mutation (C54G) was generated in the RNAi target region to confer resistance to RNAi-mediated depletion, using site-directed mutagenesis (described above).

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4033-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and this localization has been shown to be CRM1/exportin-dependent (9Rodriguez J.A. Span S.W. Ferreira C.G.M. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Rodriguez J.A. Lens S.M.A. Span S.W. Vader G. Medema R.H. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Oncogene. 2006; : 1-13Google Scholar). Using the web-based site NetNES 1.1 (11La Cour T. Kiener L. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), we found a sequence between the BIR domain and the COOH-terminal α helical coil of survivin that closely follows the rev-like NES consensus of LX(1-3)LX(2-4)LXL (where X is any residue and L = L, I, V, F, or M) and has high NES predicted scoring. This sequence 96LTLGEFLKL104 is also preceded by an acidic residue, Glu95,a feature that is common in rev-like NES consensus. Moreover, NES motifs are frequently positioned at transition points between different structural elements or sites of protein-protein interaction e.g. BRCA1 (12Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21315-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Thompson M.E. Robinson-Benion C.L. Holt J.T. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Again, residues 96LTLGEFLKL104 of survivin conform to this trend as they link the fourth beta sheet from the NH2-terminal half of the protein with the beginning of the COOH-terminal α helix. Finally, NES sequences can be regulated by phosphorylation, as is the case for cyclin B1 (15Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Within the identified sequence threonine 97 could be a phospho-target. Thus we propose that 96LTLGEFLKL104 is a rev-like NES in survivin. This sequence is present in the 2β isoform, which is also cytoplasmic, but not in survivin-DEx3, which localizes to the nucleus (1Noton E.A. Colnaghi R. Tate S. Starck C. Carvalho A. Ferrigno P.K. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1286-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).As reported previously (9Rodriguez J.A. Span S.W. Ferreira C.G.M. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Rodriguez J.A. Lens S.M.A. Span S.W. Vader G. Medema R.H. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Oncogene. 2006; : 1-13Google Scholar), overexpressed full-length survivin-GFP was predominantly cytoplasmic in interphase cells (Fig. 1, A and C) and treatment for 2 h with the CRM1 inhibitor LMB caused nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1B). To test whether 96LTLGEFLKL104 was a functional NES, we mutated the conserved hydrophobic residue with highest predictive NES participation scoring, leucine 98, and its adjacent threonine, Thr97. Interestingly while full-length survivin-GFP was almost exclusively cytoplasmic (Fig. 1, A and C), survivinL98A-GFP was predominantly nuclear (Fig. 1, D and F). Cells expressing survivinT97A-GFP (data not shown) or survivinT97E-GFP (Fig. 1, G and I) showed an intermediate localization with equal localization within the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and complete nuclear sequestration upon LMB treatment (Fig. 1H). These data demonstrate that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of full-length survivin is CRM1-dependent and that the predicted NES in the central linker region of survivin is functional.As CRM1 recognizes the NES of proteins, we asked whether CRM1 could interact directly with full-length survivin. Using anti-GFP antibodies we immunoprecipitated GFP or survivin-GFP from asynchronous U2OS cells stably expressing these proteins. CRM1 co-immunoprecipitated with survivin-GFP but not with GFP (Fig. 1J), demonstrating that CRM1 interacts with full-length survivin in vivo. This interaction was disrupted by 2 h pretreatment with LMB. Next we performed a pull down assay using GST or GST-survivin and in vitro translated CRM1 (Fig. 1K). CRM1 bound to GST-survivin indicating that the interaction between full-length survivin and CRM1 is direct. In this assay, however, we found that all the NES point mutants were still able to interact with CRM1; however, this is not surprising as in the crystal structure Leu98 is embedded in the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface rather than being exposed. Thus although mutation of these residues is sufficient to prevent or reduce nuclear exportation of survivin, other residues within this region probably contribute to its binding to CRM1.Overexpression of Full-length Survivin-GFP Confers Resistance to Ionizing Radiation, Which Is Abrogated by Mutation of the NES—As we now had cytoplasmic and nuclear versions of survivin, we next asked whether the subcellular localization of survivin affected the sensitivity of cells to X-irradiation. In Fig. 2, A and B, we used a clonogenic survival assay to demonstrate that HeLa cells expressing full-length survivin-GFP are more resistant to X-irradiation than cells expressing GFP. This cyto-protection was abolished in populations expressing the NES point mutations, survivinL98A-GFP or survivinT97E-GFP (Fig. 2B), rather than full-length survivin-GFP. Indeed, expression of survivinL98A-GFP and survivinT97E-GFP increased sensitivity to X-irradiation compared with the GFP control. The differences between the sensitivities of cell lines to X-irradiation was found to be significant at 2.5 and 5 Gy (Fig. 2C), but not at higher doses. In addition to showing greater clonogenic survival after irradiation we observed that the average number of cells per colony was greater for pooled populations of cells expressing survivin-GFP than for GFP or survivinL98A-GFP, suggesting that cells overexpressing survivin-GFP may proliferate more rapidly (Fig. 2D). Together these data suggest a direct link between subcellular localization of survivin and sensitivity to ionising radiation.FIGURE 2NES mutants abrogate the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin. A, pooled clones of HeLa cells expressing the GFP-tagged proteins indicated were exposed to X-irradiation as indicated. Expression of full-length survivin-GFP conferred a survival advantage over cells expressing GFP alone. This advantage was abrogated in cells expressing survivinL98A-GFP. Data shown are the average of three independent experiments; error bars represent the standard deviation. B, same as for A but using individual cell lines including one expressing survivinT97E-GFP. C, a representative experiment indicating the difference in X-irradiation response of cells expressing GFP, survivin-GFP, or survivin-L98A-GFP. The survival of cells expressing survivin-GFP versus GFP alone was significantly different at 2.5 and 5 Gy (p values 0.0197 (*) and 0.0365 (*), respectively), as was the case for survivin-GFP versus survivinL98A-GFP (p values 0.0138 (*) and 0.0139 (*), respectively). D, average number of cells per colony was counted at 0 and 5 Gy for cells expressing the various constructs and found to be higher for cells expressing survivin-GFP compared with GFP or survivinL98A-GFP. E, apoptosis was induced in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP, survivin-GFP, or survivinL98A-GFP using 250 μg/ml TRAIL and cell lysates prepared 75 min later. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were probed with anti-PARP antibodies to reveal full-length PARP and its 80-kDa apoptosis-related cleavage product (upper panel). Lower panel, probed with anti-GFP antibodies to demonstrate equal loading. Cells expressing GFP and survivin-GFP show some residual full-length PARP in the TRAIL-treated population, while PARP is fully cleaved in the cells expressing survivinL98A-GFP and survivinT97A-GFP. F, a quantitative fluorogenic caspase-3 activity assay was performed in triplicate using cell lysates prepared from cells incubated in the presence or absence of TRAIL. The assay was carried out at 37 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate using Ac-DEVD-AMC as substrate and fluorescence release measured at 30, 60, and 90 min. Cells expressing survivin-GFP and the Thr97 mutants showed decreased caspase activity compared with the control line, while activity remained high in cells expressing survivinL98A-GFP. This activity was abolished by incubation with Ac-DEVD-CHO, indicating that the activity was caspase-3-dependent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the localization of survivin was important for its anti-apoptotic function we induced apoptosis in HeLa cells expressing GFP, survivin-GFP, or survivin NES point mutants using TRAIL, and monitored PARP cleavage by immunoblotting (Fig. 2E). TRAIL, caused the appearance of an 80 kDa PARP cleavage product and reduced the amount of full-length PARP. Quantification of these bands revealed that the apoptosis-related PARP cleavage product represented 82.2% of total PARP for GFP expressing cells, 73.7% for survivin-GFP cells, and 93.9% for survivinL98A-GFP cells. PARP cleavage was less apparent in lines expressing Thr97 mutants. Next we prepared cell lysates from the lines indicated, in the presence and absence of TRAIL, and performed a quantitative caspase-3 activity assay using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (Fig. 2F). As indicated by the release of fluorescence, in control cells caspase activity was induced by TRAIL, increased over time, and was inhibited by the addition of the caspase-3-specific inhibitor, DEVD-CHO. In contrast, this activity was substantially reduced in lysates prepared from samples expressing survivin-GFP and survivinT97A/E-GFP but not survivinL98A-GFP. Together these data suggest that expression of survivin confers resistance against caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and this protection can be eliminated by a point mutation in the NES. We note that mutation of Thr97 did not abrogate the ability of survivin to inhibit caspase-3 activity after TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but cells expressing survivinT97E-GFP did show increased sensitivity to X-irradiation. The reason for the differences in the two assays is unclear but may reflect the intermediate localization of Thr97 mutants (Fig. 1G). Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that residue Leu98 is critical for the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin and further suggest that survivin may need to be cytoplasmic to be cytoprotective.Survivin NES Mutants Fulfil the Mitotic Role of Survivin— Next we asked whether the NES mutants that sensitize cells to X-irradiation and apoptosis affect survivin function during mitosis. Fluorescence analysis demonstrated that survivinL98A-GFP was distributed similarly to full-length survivin-GFP during mitosis, exhibiting a typical chromosomal passenger localization present at the centromeres, the midzone, and the midbody during prometaphase, anaphase, and telophase respectively (Fig. 3). However, binding of survivinL98A-GFP to the inner centromeres was reduced (pixel intensity: 308 ± 26.5, n = 36) and less variable than that of full-length survivin (pixel intensity: 791 ± 354, n = 36). In addition survivinL98A-GFP accumulated at the spindle poles to a similar level to its accumulation at the centromeres (Fig. 3B). Previously survivin has been reported to localize to the centrosome in interphase cells; however, in our experience centrosomal localization is only seen with certain mutant forms of the protein, and with survivinL98A-GFP, recruitment to the centrosome is confined to mitosis. Localization of Thr97 point mutants was similar at all stages to survivinL98A-GFP (Fig. 3C and data not shown). From these data we conclude that NES point mutants localize as chromosomal passengers during mitosis and have additional affinity for the centrosomes.FIGURE 3Survivin NES mutants localize as chromosomal passengers during mitosis. HeLa cells stably expressing the constructs indicated were fixed and stained with DAPI (blue) to reveal chromosome location. Similarly to survivin-GFP (A), survivinL98A-GFP (B), and survivinT97E-GFP (C) localized as chromosomal passengers during mitosis (green); however, additional accumulation occurred at the centrosomes in all NES mutants (arrows).

As NES point mutants localized normally during mitosis we asked whether they could substitute for loss of endogenous survivin after RNAi-mediated depletion. Endogenous survivin was effectively eliminated from cells 72 h post-transfection with survivin-specific (S) oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). By contrast exogenously expressed GFP-tagged versions of the protein rendered resistant (survivinR-GFP) to RNAi-mediated depletion were still present at similar levels to control (C) treated cells. Next we monitored cell proliferation over 72 h post-transfection. When transfected with survivin-specific oligonucleotides, cells expressing the non-resistant version of survivin-GFP did not grow (Fig. 2B), while those expressing the RNAi-resistant NES point mutants were able to proliferate, albeit less efficiently than controls. Comparison of cell number 72 h post-transfection with survivin-specific dsRNA indicated that NES mutants restored cell proliferation to a level similar to the wild type, survivinR-GFP control (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, cells complemented with NES mutants had predominantly mononucleated cells in the population 72 h post-RNAi transfection, as compared with the RNAi sensitive survivin-GFP line that became highly multinucleated (70%, n > 300, Fig. 4G). Together these data demonstrate that the essential mitotic activity of survivin is largely preserved in NES mutants.FIGURE 4NES mutants can substitute for endogenous survivin during mitosis. A, immunoblot analysis was performed on the cell lines indicated 72 h post-transfection with control (C) or survivin (S)-specific dsRNA. Membranes were probed with anti-survivin antibodies to reveal both exogenous survivin-GFP and endogenous survivin, then reprobed with anti-tubulin to indicate equality in loading (data not shown). Endogenous survivin was knocked down in each case with survivin-specific oligonucleotides, while resistant exogenous forms of survivinR-GFP were still abundantly present.

Cell Res. 1993; 204: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), with low and high levels of TGF-β having a stimulatory and inhibitory effect, respectively. TGF-β is also known to induce MGP expression in endothelial and other cell types (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Zhao J. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L282-L287PubMed Google Scholar). Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), also members of the TGF-β superfamily of growth factors, have been shown to stimulate vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (15Moser M. Patterson C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 713-718PubMed Google Scholar). BMP-4 is necessary for induction of mesoderm and endothelial progenitor cell differentiation (16Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L.

Furthermore, BMP-2, -4, and -6 stimulate VEGF secretion in preosteoblasts, and BMP-2 and -6 modulate capillary tube formation (20Deckers M.M. van Bezooijen R.L. van der Horst G.

Conversely, vascular formation is also affected by BMP inhibitors, including chordin, noggin, and the BMP-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) (15Moser M. Patterson C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 713-718PubMed Google Scholar, 22Moser M. Binder O. Wu Y. Aitsebaomo J. Ren R. Bode C. Bautch V.L. Conlon F.L. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5664-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that MGP binds and inhibits BMP-2 (23Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D.C. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Boström K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that MGP may affect endothelial cells through BMP inhibition. Our study shows that the effect of MGP on TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling and VEGF expression is dose-dependent in BAEC and that a progressive increase of MGP levels ceases to be stimulatory and turns inhibitory. We have identified a new regulatory pathway that may contribute to or explain this response. Our results show that BMP-2 and BMP-4 induce the expression of ALK1, which, when activated, induces expression of MGP and VEGF. Inhibition of either TGF-β or ALK1 abolishes BMP-induced expression of MGP and VEGF. MGP enhances ALK1 signaling, thereby providing positive feedback. However, MGP also binds and inhibits BMP-2 and BMP-4, thereby providing negative feedback for BMP signaling, which ultimately leads to a decline in ALK1 expression and activity. Together, this may lead to a differential effect on ALK1 signaling. Our findings suggest that the effects of BMP on endothelial cells and angiogenesis occur in part through induction of ALK1, an effect that may be limited by ALK1-induced MGP. Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—BAEC were purchased from VEC Technologies, Inc. (Rensselaer, NY) and cultured as described previously (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The BAEC were used between passages 2 and 15, except for transfection experiments when they were used between passages 2 and 6. Transient transfections of BAEC were performed with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 500 ng of DNA/well as described previously for 24-well plates (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and adjusted as needed for larger wells. The total amount of DNA used for each transfection was kept constant with parental expression vector. Recombinant human TGF-β1, BMP-2, BMP-4, and neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β (all from R&D Systems) were added at the time of transfection or plating. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), with normalization to β-galactosidase or Renilla (Promega). Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test as described previously (25Sugiyama S. Kugiyama K. Matsumura T. Suga S.-I. Itoh H. Nakao K. Yasue H. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) after treatment with BMP-2, BMP-4, TGF-β1, and N-terminally FLAG-tagged MGP (N-FLAG-MGP). Cells floating in the original medium were included in the test, and the result was given as the percentage of nonviable cells. Inhibition of ALK1 by siRNA—Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were used for siRNA experiments since the bovine ALK1 sequence was not available for siRNA design. The HAEC were cultured as described previously (26Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of HAEC were performed with Lipofectamine™2000 (Invitrogen) using 60 nm siRNA; the amount of siRNA had been optimized as per the manufacturer's instructions. Three separate ALK1 siRNAs (Silencer® predesigned siRNA, Ambion), and scrambled siRNA with the same nucleotide content were tested. When compared with unrelated control siRNA and scrambled siRNA, the ALK1 siRNA resulted in a 80–95% decrease in ALK1 mRNA and protein levels as determined by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. The siRNA that provided the most efficient inhibition (90–95%) was used for experiments. Vector Constructions—The ALK1- and BMP-responsive luciferase reporter gene (BRE-Luc) was obtained from Dr. Peter ten Dijke, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (27Goumans M.-J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Lebrin F. Larsson J. Mummery C. Karlsson S. ten Dijke P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The construct for constitutively active ALK1 was obtained from Dr. Karen Lyons, UCLA. To construct the N-terminally FLAG-tagged human MGP (hMGP) vector, a fragment containing the coding region for hMGP was amplified by PCR. The FLAG tag was placed in the N terminus of the secreted, mature protein by subcloning of a synthesized FLAG-coding DNA fragment between the coding regions for the signal peptide and the mature protein. The FLAG-containing hMGP DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) using restriction sites in the primers. The human MGP luciferase reporter genes (28Kirfel J. Kelter M. Cancela L.M. Price P.A. Schüle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2227-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Roland Schüle, University of Freiburg, Germany. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues or cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR assays were performed as described previously (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The following primers and probes were used: human MGP (hMGP) forward (5′-GGGAAGCCTGTGATGACTACAGA-3′), hMGP reverse (5′-CGATTATAGGCAGCATTGTATCCA-3′), hMGP Taqman probe (FAM-TTGCGAACGCTACGCCATGGTTT-TAMRA), bovine MGP (bMGP) forward (5′-GGGAAGCTTGTGATGACTTCAAA-3′), bMGP reverse (5′-CGCTGCCGGTCGTAGGCAGCATTGTATCCA-3′), bMGP Taqman probe (FAM-TTGCGAACGCTATGCCATGGTGT-TAMRA), bovine VEGF (bVEGF) forward (5′-CCCACGAAGTGGTGAAGTTCA-3′), bVEGF reverse (5′-CCACCAGGGTCTCGATGG-3′), bVEGF Taqman probe (FAM-TCTACCAGCGCAGCTTCTGCCGT-TAMRA), human ALK1 (hALK1) forward (5′-AGGGCAAACCAGCCATTG-3′), hALK1 reverse (5′-GGTTGCTCTTGACCAGCACAT-3′), hALK1 Taqman probe (FAM-CACCGCGACTTCAAGAGCCGC-TAMRA, bovine GAPDH (bGAPDH) forward (5′-GGCGCCAAGAGGGTCAT-3′), bGAPDH reverse (5′-GTGGTTCACGCCCATCACA-3′), and bGAPDH Taqman probe (FAM-TCTCTGCACCTTCTGCCGATGCC-TAMRA). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cellular protein or equal volumes of culture medium were compared. Blots were incubated with specific antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) (1 μg/ml; Cell Signaling), ALK1 (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, D-20), BMP-4 (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma), VEGF (2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or β-actin (0.6 μg/ml; Sigma). Immunocytochemistry—BAEC were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (24Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Boström K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MGP were provided by Dr. Reidar Wallin, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories) were used to detect antibody binding. Immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation of BMP-4 and N-FLAG-MGP was performed as described previously (24Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Boström K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). BMP-4 (100 ng) was added to 1 ml of culture medium from BAEC collected 24 h after transfection of the N-FLAG-MGP construct or empty plasmid. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-BMP-4 antibodies (2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immunoblotting was performed using anti-FLAG antibodies as described above. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using anti-FLAG and anti-BMP-4 antibodies, respectively. Quantification of N-FLAG-MGP—The concentration of N-FLAG-MGP in medium from BAEC transfected with the N-FLAG-MGP construct was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. N-terminal Met-FLAG-BAP™ fusion protein (Sigma) was used as a standard. To determine the N-FLAG-MGP concentration, 189 μl of sample (undiluted or diluted BAEC medium or standard protein dissolved in culture medium) was mixed with 21 μl of 10× coating buffer (1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.6) and used for coating of 96-well plates (3 wells, 70 μl/well). After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, remaining protein-binding sites were blocked with 200 μl/well of blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for another 1 h at 37°C. After repeated washes with PBS, the plates were ready for FLAG-protein determination. Fifty μl of anti-FLAG (1 μg/ml in PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk protein) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After three washing cycles with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the antibody bound to the plate was quantified by using a second antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 0.4 μg/ml in PBS with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk protein)); 50 μl was added per well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washing cycles with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the plates were stained with p-nitrophenyl phosphate liquid substrate system (Sigma), 150 μl/well, and read at 405 nm. Statistics—Data were analyzed for statistical significance by analysis of variance with post hoc Scheffe's analysis, unless otherwise stated. The analyses were performed using StatView, version 4.51 (Abacus Concepts). All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. MGP Has Dose-dependent Effects on ALK1 Signaling Activity and VEGF Expression—We have previously shown that an increase in MGP levels enhances angiogenesis, ALK1 signaling, and VEGF expression (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, since MGP expression is high in tube-forming EC (8Glienke J. Schmitt A.O. Pilarsky C. Hinzmann B. Weiβ B. Rosenthal A. Thierauch K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2820-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it may also be connected with resolution of angiogenesis. To determine whether the effect of MGP on ALK1 signaling is dose-dependent, we co-transfected BAEC with a constant amount of the BRE-Luc reporter gene and increasing amounts of an expression construct, N-FLAG-MGP. The transfected cells were treated with TGF-β1 (0.5 ng/ml) for 24 h, after which the level of N-FLAG-MGP was determined in the medium by FLAG-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the luciferase activity was determined and normalized to β-galactosidase. The results showed that low levels of MGP stimulated ALK1 signaling up to 5-fold (5.06 ± 0.48) (Fig. 1), similarly to previous results (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas high levels of MGP inhibited signaling. This suggested that the effect of MGP is dose-dependent in a biphasic fashion. In our previous studies, we found that MGP-enhanced VEGF expression induced by 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β1 (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since 0.5 and 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 increases MGP expression about 2- and 6-fold, respectively, in BAEC (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we predicted that combining MGP with 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 would no longer stimulate VEGF expression. To test this, we transfected BAEC with increasing amounts of N-FLAG-MGP construct and treated the cells with TGF-β1 (0.5 or 4 ng/ml). Cellular RNA was prepared after 24 h, and VEGF expression was determined by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. Secreted VEGF was visualized by immunoblotting. The results showed that VEGF expression was only stimulated by MGP at the lower concentration of TGF-β1 (Fig. 2A), supporting that the effects of TGF-β1 and MGP are dose-dependent. Expression of human and bovine MGP, respectively, was determined by real-time PCR to confirm the transfection (Fig. 2B). BMP-2 and BMP-4 Dose-dependently Induces Expression of ALK1, Which, When Activated, Induces Expression of MGP and VEGF—Since MGP is a BMP inhibitor that appears to regulate ALK1, we examined the effect of BMP-2 and BMP-4 on ALK1 expression. BAEC were treated for 24 h with BMP-2 or BMP-4 (0–100 ng/ml), and ALK1 expression was determined by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. The results showed that both BMP-2 and BMP-4 dose-dependently increased ALK1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion, with initial stimulation followed by inhibition at high BMP-4 levels (Fig. 3, A and B). BMP-4 gave the most dramatic ALK1 induction (16.55 ± 2.08) and was therefore used in subsequent experiments. To verify that ALK1 protein also increased after BMP treatment, the cells were treated with BMP-4 (0–100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting for ALK1. To verify that the ALK1 antibodies recognized the correct bands, we compared the ALK1 blots with blots from cells transfected with HA-tagged ALK1, which had been analyzed with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3C). Anti-HA antibodies recognized three bands, which were identical to the three bands recognized by the anti-ALK1 antibodies in BMP-4-treated cells. BMP-4 treatment resulted in a similar dose-dependent increase in ALK1 protein as was seen for ALK1 mRNA (Fig. 3D). We hypothesized that ALK1 induces MGP, which would be expected to enhance ALK1 activity (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and also provide negative feedback for BMP. To determine whether activated ALK1 induces MGP expression in addition to that of VEGF, we transfected BAEC with an expression vector for constitutively active ALK1 (0–100 ng/well) in the presence of neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies to inhibit endogenous TGF-β signaling. Constitutively active ALK1 does not require ligand for activity and is not sensitive to MGP. The transfection was verified with real-time PCR normalized to GAPDH and immunoblotting for ALK1 (Fig. 4A). Expression of MGP was determined 24 h later by real-time PCR with normalization to GAPDH and compared with VEGF expression. The results showed that expression of MGP increased 15-fold (14.62 ± 2.18) and that of VEGF increased 7-fold (6.97 ± 0.99) (Fig. 4B). Secreted VEGF was visualized by immunoblotting, which correlated with the increased expression. MGP protein was visualized by immunocytochemistry, which also correlated with the increased expression. The results support that ALK1 regulates MGP and VEGF expression. Cell viability was determined to assess for toxic the effects of BMP-2 (0–100 ng/ml), BMP-4 (0–100 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (0–4 ng/ml), and N-FLAG-MGP (0–100 ng/ml) using the trypan blue exclusion test. No significant change in cell viability was detected for any of the four factors at the concentrations used. The percentage of nonviable cells when combining all concentrations was 5.0 ± 0.5% for BMP-4, 5.3 ± 0.5% for BMP-2, 5.3 ± 0.4% for TGF-β1, and 5.4 ± 0.3% for N-FLAG-MGP. MGP Binds and Inhibits BMP-4—Although BMP-4 is closely related to BMP-2, it has not been shown that MGP inhibits BMP-4 activity. To determine the effect of MGP on BMP-4 activity in comparison with that of BMP-2, BAEC were transfected with increasing amounts of N-FLAG-MGP expression construct and a constant amount of the BRE-Luc reporter gene and treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) or BMP-4 (40 ng/ml) in the presence of neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies (300 ng/ml) to avoid the effects of TGF-β on endogenous MGP expression. The BMP concentrations were the lowest concentrations that gave maximal signaling activity in our system (data not shown). After 24 h, N-FLAG-MGP was visualized in the medium by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG-antibodies, and the luciferase activity was determined and normalized to β-galactosidase (Fig. 5A). The results showed that increased MGP levels progressively inhibited luciferase activity induced by both BMP-2 and BMP-4 (Fig. 5B). To determine whether MGP interacts with BMP-4, we used BAEC medium that contained both N-FLAG-MGP and BMP-4. We immunoprecipitated with antibodies to BMP-4 or to FLAG in the FLAG-tagged MGP. The BMP-4 immunoprecipitate was analyzed by immunoblotting for N-FLAG-MGP using the anti-FLAG-antibodies, and the FLAG immunoprecipitate was analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-BMP-4. The results showed that BMP-4 and N-FLAG-MGP co-precipitated in both cases (Fig. 6), suggesting that the two proteins interact. Interestingly, the anti-BMP-4 antibodies precipitated both high and low molecular weight forms of MGP detected in the medium. Other investigators have shown that the change in molecular weight of MGP is due to C-terminal truncation of seven amino acids (RKRRGTK) (29Hale J.E. Williamson M.K. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21145-21149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the reported truncation does not abolish MGP binding, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiments using a mutated form of N-FLAG-MGP lacking the seven amino acids. The results confirmed that BMP-4 and the truncated MGP co-precipitated (data not shown). Thus, the truncation does not abolish interaction with BMP. BMP-4 Effects on Expression of MGP and VEGF Are Dependent on TGF-β and ALK1—We predicted that inhibition of ALK1 signaling and MGP induction would allow continued BMP-4 stimulation of ALK1 expression at high BMP-4 levels. To test this, we first used neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β, the only known ALK1 ligand. (The BAEC expressed ∼0.3–0.5 ng/ml TGF-β per 24 h at baseline). We treated BAEC with BMP-4 (0–100 ng/ml) in the presence of anti-TGF-β antibodies (300 ng/ml) for 24 h and compared it with BMP-4 only treatments. The presence of anti-TGF-β antibodies did abolish the dose-dependent ALK1 response. Instead, expression of ALK1 continued to increase at high BMP-4 levels as determined by real-time PCR with normalization to GAPDH and ALK1 immunoblotting (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, we expected expression of MGP and VEGF to decrease when ALK1 signaling was inhibited. This was tested with real-time PCR with normalization to GAPDH. The results showed that expression of MGP and VEGF was abolished (Fig. 7B), which suggests that the BMP-4 effects on MGP and VEGF are TGF-β-dependent. The peak of BMP-4-induced ALK1 expression preceded that of MGP in these experiments. This may be a reflection of the ability of MGP to enhance ALK1 activity at low to intermediate levels (Fig. 1) (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which would enhance MGP expression despite gradually declining ALK1 expression. Ultimately, MGP expression would also start to decline. However, we cannot exclude additional signaling mechanisms decreasing ALK1 expression and increasing MGP expression at high BMP-4 levels. We further predicted that elimination of the ALK1 receptor would prevent BMP-4-induced expression of MGP and VEGF. Since the bovine ALK1 nucleotide sequence is not available, we used human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), which express ALK1. The HAEC were transfected with ALK1 siRNA and compared with unrelated control siRNA or scrambled siRNA. Transfection of ALK1 siRNA resulted in >90% decrease in ALK1 mRNA levels after 24 h as determined by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, whereas the two control siRNAs did not affect ALK1 expression (Fig. 8A). HAEC transfected with ALK1 siRNA or control siRNA were then treated with BMP-4 (0–100 ng/ml) starting 24 h after transfection. After 24 h of treatment, expression of MGP and VEGF was determined by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. The results showed that the ALK1 siRNA prevented BMP-4 induction of ALK1 expression (Fig. 8B) and abolished the stimulatory effect of BMP-4 on expression of both MGP and VEGF (Fig. 8C). Together, the results suggest that TGF-β and ALK1 mediates the effect of BMP-4 on MGP and VEGF expression. The MGP Promoter Is Induced by BMP-4 in a TGF-β-dependent Fashion—To determine whether BMP-4 stimulates the MGP promoter and whether such stimulation is TGF-β-dependent, we used luciferase reporter genes containing 3.6 or 1.8 kb of the MGP promoter (28Kirfel J. Kelter M. Cancela L.M. Price P.A. Schüle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2227-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Smad4 promoter elements involved in TGF-β signaling are predicted between –2.6 and –3kb by the Genomatix Software and would only be present in the 3.6-kb promoter fragment. BAEC were transfected with the luciferase reporter genes and treated with BMP-4 (0–100 ng/ml) only or in the presence of TGF-β1 (0.5 ng/ml) or anti-TGF-β antibodies (300 ng/ml). After 24 h, luciferase activity was determined and normalized to Renilla. The results for the 3.6-kb MGP promoter fragment showed that BMP-4 only increased promoter activity 2-fold (2.18 ± 0.04), whereas the addition of TGF-β to the BMP-4 increased promoter activity 8-fold (8.42 ± 0.10) (Fig. 9A). Anti-TGF-antibodies, on the other hand, decreased promoter activity by two-thirds (0.31 ± 0.02). The results for the 1.8-kb MGP promoter fragment showed that BMP-4 still had a mild effect on promoter activity (2.32 ± 0.11), whereas the addition of TGF-β to the BMP-4 only increased promoter activity 1.6-fold (1.61 ± 0.03). (Fig. 9B). Anti-TGF-antibodies decreased activity by about a fourth (0.77 ± 0.01). The results suggest that BMP-4 activation of the MGP promoter is TGF-β-mediated in a similar way to MGP expression. They also support the presence of a TGF-β-responsive element in the 3.6-kb promoter fragment only. We cannot exclude that BMP-4 also affects the MGP promoter through other signaling pathways. Our studies suggest that BMP-4, ALK1, and MGP are part of a regulatory circuit in vascular endothelium and that BMP-4 depends on TGF-β/ALK1 signaling to affect expression of MGP and VEGF. The regulatory circuit may in part explain the dose-dependent effect of MGP on TGF-β/ALK1 signaling and VEGF expression. Low to intermediate levels of MGP enhances ALK1 signaling and VEGF expression. MGP also provides a progressive negative feedback for BMP that ultimately curbs induction of ALK1 and subsequent VEGF expression (see proposed model, Fig. 10). This regulatory system may also explain the dose-dependent effect of TGF-β on angiogenesis (13Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.-D. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp.

Induction of ALK1 expression provides a way for BMP to affect angiogenesis and enhance VEGF secretion as seen in cells treated with BMP-2, -4, and -6 (19Vogt R.R. Unda R. Yeh L.C. Vidro E.K. Lee J.C.

A dysregulation of MGP and VEGF expression might contribute to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in ALK1-deficiency, characterized by arterio-venous malformations and defective recruitment of smooth muscle cell precursor cells (11Urness L.D. Sorensen L.K. Li D.Y. Nature. 2000; 26: 328-331Google Scholar, 12Carvalho R.L.C. Jonker L. Goumans M.-J. Larsson J. Bouwman P. Karlsson S. Ten Dijke P. Arthur H.M. Mummery C.L. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 6237-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Differences in MGP levels have been associated with different tumor characteristics. Less MGP was found in symptomatic lung tumors that were clinically detected than in asymptomatic tumors that were CT scan-detected (34Bianchi F. Hu J. Pelosi G. Cirincione R. Ferguson M. Ratcliffe C. Di Fiore P.P. Gatter K. Pezzella F. Pastorino U. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of MGP were also detected in colorectal adenocarcinomas when compared with normal tissue (35Fan C. Sheu D. Fan H. Hsu K. Allen Chang C. Chan E. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since high levels of MGP have been associated with tubular EC (8Glienke J. Schmitt A.O. Pilarsky C. Hinzmann B. Weiβ B. Rosenthal A. Thierauch K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2820-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and may regulate ALK1 expression, it is possible that a reduction of MGP results in a deregulation of angiogenesis. The dose dependence of BMP-induced ALK1 expression might be useful in developmental patterning involving BMP gradients (36Raftery L.A. Sutherland D.J. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 701-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Garfinkel et al. (37Garfinkel A. Tintut Y. Petrasek D. Boström K. Demer L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

ALK1 expression has been reported in vascular and pulmonary mesenchyme (38Panchenko M.P. Williams M.C. Brody J.S. Yu Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L547-L558PubMed Google Scholar, 39Roelen B.A.J. Van Rooijen M.A.V. Mummery C.L. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and might be important in the balance between BMP and MGP. Our studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of MGP is not limited to BMP-2 but also includes BMP-4. MGP and BMP-4 co-precipitate from culture medium, similarly to MGP and BMP-2 (24Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Boström K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BMP-4 also co-pre cipitated with a short form of MGP that lacks 7 amino acids, generated by C-terminal truncation of MGP (28Kirfel J. Kelter M. Cancela L.M. Price P.A. Schüle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2227-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It suggests that this particular modification of MGP does not regulate BMP-binding. However, it may affect localization or matrix association of BMP since the C-terminal of MGP has been implicated in binding to vitronectin (40Nishimoto S.K. Nishimoto M. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that MGP abolished binding of BMP-2 to cell surface receptors (24Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Boström K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), but MGP might still affect the receptor complex by interfering with other proteins that are recruited to the complex such as accessory receptors. Our results do not explain the stimulatory effect of low to intermediate levels of MGP on ALK1-induced VEGF expression (7Boström K. Zebboudj A.F. Yao Y. Lin T.S. Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52904-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). It is possible that MGP increases availability of ligand or type II receptor for ALK1. However, we have not found any significant differences in TGF-β expression during our experiments (data not shown), and the type II BMP receptor, which would be more available after an increase in BMP inhibition, has so far not been connected with ALK1 (41Harrison R.E. Berger R. Haworth S.G. Tulloh R. Mache C.J. Morrell N.W. Aldred M.A. Trembath R.C. Circulation. 2005; 111: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In summary, our studies have identified a new regulatory pathway involving BMP-2/4, ALK1, and MGP, allowing for a reciprocal regulation of BMP and MGP through ALK1 in a TGF-β-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2093453499,"Overexpressed or activated hepatocyte growth factor receptor, encoded by the MET proto-oncogene, was found in the majority of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), whose stepwise progression to malignancy requires transcriptional activation of β-catenin. We here demonstrate that a functional crosstalk between Met and β-catenin signaling sustains and increases CRC cell invasive properties. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation prompts β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociation from Met, and upregulates β-catenin expression via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in conditions that mimic those found by the invading and metastasizing cells. Additionally, a transcriptionally active form of β-catenin, known to be oncogenic, enhances Met expression. Furthermore, HGF treatment increases the activity of the β-catenin-regulated T-cell factor transcription factor in cells expressing the wild-type or the oncogenic β-catenin. In the mirror experiments, either Met or β-catenin knocking down also reduces their protein level. In biological assays, β-catenin knocking down abrogates the HGF-induced motile phenotype, whereas active β-catenin fosters ligand-independent cell scattering. Met and β-catenin also cooperate in promoting entry into the cell cycle and in protecting cells from apoptosis. In conclusion, Met and β-catenin pathways are mutually activated in CRC cells. This might generate a self-amplifying positive feedback loop resulting in the upregulation of the invasive growth properties of CRC cells."

The molecular mimicry model proposes that the tip of domain IV mimics the anticodon loop of tRNA.

ADP-ribosylation by these toxins inhibits eEF2 function causing cell death. Mutagenesis of the tip of domain IV was used to assess both functions. A H694A mutant strain was non-functional, whereas D696A, I698A, and H699N strains conferred conditional growth defects, sensitivity to translation inhibitors, and decreased total translation in vivo. These mutant strains and those lacking diphthamide modification enzymes showed increased -1 frameshifting. The effects are not due to reduced protein levels, ribosome binding, or GTP hydrolysis. Functional eEF2 forms substituted in domain IV confer dominant diphtheria toxin resistance, which correlates with an in vivo effect on translation-linked phenotypes. These results provide a new mechanism in which the translational machinery maintains the accurate production of proteins, establishes a role for the diphthamide modification, and provides evidence of the ability to suppress the lethal effect of a toxin targeted to eEF2.

These two proteins catalyze the translocation step of translation elongation after peptide bond formation occurs. The tRNAs located in the A- and P-sites are translocated to the P- and E-sites followed by the advancement of three bases of the mRNA to allow another round of translation elongation (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor2000: 89-125Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eEF2 is encoded by two genes, EFT1 and EFT2. The encoded proteins are identical, and one must be present for viability (2Perentesis J.P. Phan L.D. Gleason W.B.

Even though work on EF-G has proven to be invaluable in our understanding of the function of eEF2 on protein synthesis, marked differences are evident between the two homologous proteins. The most pronounced are the post-translation modifications that occur on eEF2. These modifications are the phosphorylation of Thr-57 and the diphthamide modification of His-699 in yeast and His-715 in mammals. S. cerevisiae eEF2 is phosphorylated by the Rck2p kinase (3Teige M.

The unique diphthamide modification is the result of a multistep conversion requiring several enzymatic activities performed by the DPH gene products in yeast (7Liu S. Milne G.T. Kuremsky J.G.

Although phosphorylation reduces the affinity for GTP, but not GDP, and decreases ribosome binding (10Dumont-Miscopein A. Lavergne J.P. Guillot D. Sontag B. Reboud J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a role for the diphthamide modification is unknown other than to serve as the site for ADP-ribosylation by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin (DT) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (11Oppenheimer N.J.

The action of either toxin inactivates the protein, whereas mutagenesis of His-699 demonstrated alterations of this residue are lethal or confer conditional growth defects and inhibit ADP-ribosylation (12Kimata Y.

Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This suggests a close proximity of the tip of domain IV, the anticodon mimicry site, to the decoding site. The cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction of the yeast ribosome with eEF2 stabilized by the fungicide sordarin, an inhibitor of translocation in fungi that prevents eEF2 release (17Justice M.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3148-3151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), shows the tip of domain IV of eEF2 is in close proximity with the tRNA in the P-site (18Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Residues 694-698 of eEF2 were modeled to be close enough to interact with the tRNA located in the P-site. Based on these results it was hypothesized that the tip of domain IV is involved in preventing errors in fidelity, in particular a -1 frameshift (18Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We previously identified a possible relationship between this region of eEF2 and fidelity, because the presence of the H699K eEF2 mutant in a strain of yeast with wild-type eEF2 shows dominant sensitivity to the translation inhibitor paromomycin (19Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5740-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Altered paromomycin sensitivity has been linked to errors in fidelity (20Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F. Nature. 1979; 277: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All these data support a role for the tip of domain IV, and likely the diphthamide modification, in eEF2 function. Utilizing the available structural data proposing an important role for the anticodon mimicry domain of eEF2 in fidelity, structure-based mutagenesis of residues 694, 696, 698, and 699 was performed. Mutants strains show increased sensitivity to translation inhibitors, a reduction of total translation, increased read-through of a programmed -1 frameshift signal, and resistance to diphtheria toxin. Strains with deletions in the DPH2 gene, which produces eEF2 with an unmodified His-699, or DPH5, which produces eEF2 with an intermediate modification, also show increased -1 frameshifting. Co-expression of the DT-resistant forms of eEF2 in the presence of the wild-type protein allows dominant prevention of the lethality conferred by the toxin expression. These results demonstrate the involvement of eEF2 preventing -1 frameshifting errors and provides an invaluable tool for the in vivo study of the consequences of ADP-ribosylation. Strains, Media, and Growth—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used for plasmid preparation. Standard yeast genetic methods were employed (22Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Yeast cells were grown in either YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or defined synthetic complete media (C) or complete media lacking amino acids or nucleotides (C-) supplemented with 2% dextrose or 2% galactose as the carbon source (23Ausubel F.M.

Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (24Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth was assayed by streaking on solid media or by growing 5-ml cultures of each strain overnight and diluting them to an A600 of 1.0. Temperature sensitivity was assayed by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions (10 μl each) of the strains on YEPD followed by incubation at 13, 24, 30, and 37 °C for 2-7 days.

All mutations were confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis. Protein Synthesis and Translation Inhibitor Sensitivity Assays—For in vivo [35S]methionine incorporation and halo assays for sensitivity to cycloheximide, paromomycin, and hygromycin B were performed as previously described (38Valente L. Kinzy T.G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2115-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Microtiter assays in liquid culture were performed for at least three independent colonies of each strain grown at 30 °C in liquid C-Leu media to mid-log phase, diluted to A600 of 0.1, and grown at 30 °C in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates with varying concentrations of the translation inhibitor. Growth was monitored on a Bio-Tek Elx 800 microtiter reader and reported as the mean of the triplicate A600 at 24 h. Western Blot Analysis and Ni-NTA Binding Assay—Cells extracts were prepared as previously described (35Dinman J.D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Total protein was determined by Bradford protein analysis (Bio-Rad), and 1 μg was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies to yeast eEF2 (1:20,000 dilution) or Pgk1p (1:10,000 dilution) and detected by a secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (1:7,500 dilution, Amersham Biosciences ECL plus). For the binding assay strains grown to mid log phase were lysed in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 10 mm imidazole and lysed with glass beads. 30 μg of extract was incubated with Ni-NTA beads at 4 °C for 90 min with constant rocking, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation. The beads were washed three times with buffer A with 20 mm imidazole, boiled in loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the eEF2 yeast polyclonal antibody. eEF2HIS Protein and 80 S Ribosome Purification—To purify eEF2HIS from yeast, 4 liters of each strain was grown in YEPD to an A600 of 1.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 m KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Tween 20) with 10 mm imidazole and lysed in a cell fluidizer (Microfluidics). After lysis the pH of the lysate was adjusted to 7.7 with 1 m Tris base and clarified by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and applied to a Amersham Biosciences Pharmacia His Trap Chelating Sepharose HP 3× 1 column using an AKTA fast-protein liquid chromatography system. After washing with 5 volumes of buffer B with 20 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with buffer B plus 500 mm imidazole. Pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight into buffer C (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Yeast 80 S ribosomes were purified as described previously (28Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Asano K. Nielsen K.H. Olsen D.S. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R.

Pellets (bound fraction) were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with gel code blue (Pierce). The amount of bound eEF2 was quantified with Image J software (National Institutes of Health). GTPase Assay—eEF2 GTP hydrolysis activity was monitored with the method of Ref. 30Cavallius J.

One milliliter of organic phase was mixed with EcoLume scintillation fluid (ICN), and the amount of released [γ-32Pi]GTP was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Translational Fidelity and Killer Virus Assays—Strains were transformed with the URA3 wild-type lacZ control plasmid pJD204.0 or URA3 plasmids containing lacZ with programmed in-frame -1 frameshift (pJD204.-1) or +1 frameshift (pJD204.+1) signals (31Harger J.W.

Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples were denatured in guanidine-HCl, reduced using DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, buffer exchanged into 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and digested with trypsin using conventional procedures. Chromatography was conducted using an ultimate nano-LC system (Dionex/LC Packings) and a fritless nanoscale column (75 μm × 15 cm) packed in-house with Poros 10, R2 (Applied Biosystems). The column was equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid (Solvent A), and samples were eluted using a linear gradient from 2% to 45% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 30 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min and analyzed by electrospray ionization-MS/MS using an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with a nanospray source (Proxeon Biosystems). Each MS scan was followed by subsequent zoom scans and MS/MS scans of the four most abundant multiply charged ions, with a dynamic exclusion time of 1 min. DTA files for MS/MS spectra were generated by Bioworks software (ThermoFinnigan) and searched against a yeast data base (NCBI nr) using Sequest (34Eng J. McCormack A. Yates J.r. J. Am. Soc.

Mutant Strains Expressing Forms of eEF2 with Alterations in the Tip of Domain IV Confer Growth Phenotypes—The anticodon mimicry domain IV of eEF2 is the site of the unique posttranslational modification of diphthamide. The tip of domain IV of eEF2 is in close proximity to the decoding site of the ribosome in the cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction of the yeast eEF2-ribosome complex in the presence of sordarin (18Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To address the functional significance of this region in vivo and in vitro we have targeted a series of residues for mutagenesis. The residues have been selected based on the x-ray crystal structure of eEF2 (8Jorgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction of the eEF2-ribosome complex (18Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Residues 694-698 (Fig. 1A) are on the tip of domain IV and close enough to interact with the tRNA on the P-site of the ribosome. This area is highly conserved between eukaryotes and bacteria (Fig. 1A), inferring an important role for the anticodon mimicry domain in eEF2 function. Residues His-694, Asp-696, and Ile-698 were mutated to alanine to remove the side chain (Fig. 1A). His-699 was also mutated due to its close proximity to the other residues and as the site modified to diphthamide (Fig. 1A). His-699 was mutagenized to Asp based on previous work showing this mutation is viable and confers a Ts-phenotype (12Kimata Y. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13497-13501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To differentiate between the wild-type and mutant eEF2 proteins, all mutants used in the work were expressed with a 6× His tag (eEF2HIS). eEF2HIS was previously shown to be functional as the only form of eEF2 in vivo (27Jørgensen R. Carr-Schmid A. Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the eEF2 mutations were transformed into yeast strain YEFD12h, and loss of the wild-type eEF2-encoding URA3 plasmid was monitored on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Only H694A failed to complement for the loss of wild-type eEF2 (Fig. 2A). The lack of function of H694A was not based on the lack of expression, as shown by Ni-NTA pull-down assay (Fig. 2B) performed due to the inability of an anti-His antibody to recognize eEF2HIS (19Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5740-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This result is not a surprise due to the identity of this residue in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of H694A with the wild-type protein resulted in a dominant negative growth phenotype (Fig. 2A), similar to the results seen for the co-expression of other non-functional forms of eEF2 that reduce the pool of functional eEF2 (19Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5740-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The D696A, I698A, and H699N forms of eEF2 allowed for the loss of a plasmid expressing wild-type eEF2 (Fig. 2C). A strain expressing D696A showed a slow growth phenotype at the permissive temperature (Fig. 2C, left panel). When growth was monitored at the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C, the I698A strain showed a slight decrease in growth, whereas D696A and H699N strains resulted in inviability (Fig. 2C, right panel). The growth defects were not due to a decrease in expression of the mutant proteins, as observed by Western blot analysis with the eEF2 antibody of extracts of cells grown at 30 or 37 °C (Fig. 2D). Domain IV Mutants Show Translational Defects—To determine if the observed growth phenotypes are linked to defects in total translation, a [35S]methionine incorporation assay was performed (Fig. 3). The analysis showed that the mutant strains that conferred a severe Ts-phenotype also reduced total translation at the permissive temperature by 35% (H699N) and 50% (D696A). Protein synthesis defects were further analyzed by utilizing the translation elongation inhibitors cycloheximide, paromomycin, and hygromycin B. Co-expression of wild-type and non-functional H694A (data not shown) or a strain with I698A alone (Table 2) showed no changes in sensitivity or resistance to the inhibitors as monitored by a halo assay. Mutant strains expressing the H699N or D696A forms of eEF2 showed paromomycin and cycloheximide sensitivity (Table 2). Paromomycin sensitivity was quantitated by a liquid microtiter growth assay in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. Consistent with the observation in the halo assay, eEF2I698A showed no change in the LC50 for paromomycin, whereas the LC50 observed for eEF2H699N and eEF2D696A was reduced 46 and 65%, respectively (Table 2). Altered paromomycin sensitivity correlates with altered translational fidelity in S. cerevisiae (20Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F. Nature. 1979; 277: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), indicating these strains may have a defect in their accuracy of protein synthesis.TABLE 2Drug sensitivities of strains expressing altered forms of eEF2StrainsParmoParomCycloHygro B800 mg/mlLC50 mg/ml1 mm100 mmeEF224 ± 1aSensitivity was determined by measuring the diameter of inhibition of growth (in millimeters) around a filter disk containing 10 μl of the indicated drug.

Open table in a new tab Domain IV Mutant Strains Show Decreased Translational Fidelity via a-1 Frameshift—Based on the sensitivity observed against paromomycin, translational accuracy of the mutants strains was assessed. Mutant strains were analyzed for effects on nonsense suppression at all three stop codons as well as programmed +1 and -1 frameshift signals. Mutant strains were transformed with control plasmids carrying a wild-type lacZ as well as constructs containing lacZ in-frame stop codons or programmed +1 and -1 frameshifts followed by analysis of the production of β-Gal. Nonsense and +1 frameshifting were unaffected (data not shown), whereas the frequency of a -1 frameshift was increased in all the mutant strains (Fig. 4A). The I698A mutation was found to most dramatically affect -1 frameshifting. This is to our knowledge the first mutation to confer a fidelity error without showing altered resistance or sensitivity to paromomycin. To determine if the increase in programmed -1 frameshifting observed in the lacZ constructs correlates with altered viral maintenance, we have taken advantage of the yeast L-A double-stranded DNA virus. The L-A virus has a satellite virus M1, which produces a toxin, but to propagate M1 efficiently the -1 frameshift must not be altered (35Dinman J.D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The L-A and M1 viruses were cytoduced into the wild-type and mutant strains such that they could produce the toxin and kill sensitive cells. The ability of the wild-type and mutant strains to propagate M1 was monitored by measuring the halo killing around spots of the eEF2 strains on a law"
https://openalex.org/W1973632024,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF)-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2), also known as Bcl11b, is a transcriptional repressor that functions by direct, sequence-specific DNA binding activity or by recruitment to the promoter template by interaction with COUP-TF family members. CTIP2 is essential for both T cell development and axonal projections of corticospinal motor neurons in the central nervous system. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism(s) by which CTIP2 contributes to either process. CTIP2 complexes that were isolated from SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were found to harbor substantial histone deacetylase activity, which was likely conferred by the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. CTIP2 was found to associate with the NuRD complex through direct interaction with both RbAp46 and RbAp48, and components of the NuRD complex were found to be recruited to an artificial promoter template in a CTIP2-dependent manner in transfected cells. Finally, the NuRD complex and CTIP2 were found to co-occupy the promoter template of p57KIP2, a gene encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and identified herein as a novel transcriptional target of CTIP2 in SK-N-MC cells. Therefore, it seems likely that the NuRD complex may be involved in transcriptional repression of CTIP2 target genes and contribute to the function(s) of CTIP2 within a neuronal context.

In addition to substantial expression in thymocytes, CTIP2/Bcl11b (CTIP2 hereafter) is also expressed at a high level in the central nervous system (CNS) of pre- and postnatal mouse brain, more specifically in developing cerebral cortex primarily in layer V, the striatum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, limbic system, basal ganglia, and also in the intermediate region of the spinal cord (10Leid M.

Although several lines of evidence have shown that CTIP2 is required for T cell and CNS development, little is known concerning the mechanism(s) by which CTIP2 may function in these processes, or transcriptional targets of CTIP2 in any cell or tissue. CTIP2, and the highly related protein CTIP1, are transcriptional repressors that are recruited to the template either by interaction with COUP-TFs (1Avram D. Fields A. Pretty On Top K. Nevrivy D.J.

Fields A. Senawong T. Topark-Ngarm A. Leid M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In both cases, CTIPs mediate transcriptional repression that has been found to be largely insensitive to reversal by trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs). SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), a class III HDAC, may underlie TSA-insensitive transcriptional repression mediated by CTIPs (15Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. J.

In the present report, we found that transcriptional repression mediated by CTIP2 was partially sensitive to inhibition by TSA in the context of a minimal promoter. Consistently, both ectopically expressed and endogenous CTIP2 complexes were found to harbor TSA-sensitive HDAC activity in vitro. We found that CTIP2 associated with the NuRD complex in both transfected HEK293T and in untransfected SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, and this appeared to be via direct interaction with RbAp46 and/or RbAp48. We also found that the NuRD complex was recruited to a CTIP2-responsive promoter template in a CTIP2-dependent manner in transfected HEK293T cells. Here we report a newly identified CTIP2 target gene, p57KIP2, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor. p57KIP2 plays important roles in control of cell cycle and neuronal differentiation, and was found herein to be repressed by CTIP2 in SK-N-MC cells. Subsequent ChIP and re-ChIP analyses of the p57KIP2 promoter demonstrated co-occupancy by CTIP2, MTA2, HDAC2, and RbAp46/48, suggesting that CTIP2-mediated repression of this target gene is likely to involve recruitment of the NuRD complex to the template. Together, these findings suggest that the NuRD complex may play a role in CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression, at least on a subset of genes, and in a neuron-like context.

The Gal4-CTIP2, FLAG-CTIP2, and deletion mutants of the latter were previously described (15Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. J. Biol.

FLAG-CTIP2-(129–350) was prepared by PCR amplification with primers containing appropriate restriction sites for insertion into pcDNA3.1/HisC (Invitrogen), and verified by complete DNA sequencing. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing Mi-2β, MTA2, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, and RbAp48 were kind gifts from Dr. Danny Reinberg (University of Medical and Dentistry of New Jersey; Ref 17Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HEK293T cells were cultured on 10-cm plates in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were grown under identical conditions except that 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) was added to the media. Transfection and Reporter Assays—At ∼60% confluence, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of the Lex-Gal-LUC reporter gene, 0.1 μg of an expression vector encoding the LexA-VP16 fusion protein, and 1 or 5 μg of either Gal4-DBD or Gal4-DBD-CTIP2 (Gal4-CTIP2), using the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with TSA (100 ng/ml) or vehicle, and harvested 24 h later. Whole cell lysates were subjected to a luciferase assay (Promega). Luciferase levels were measured using a LUMAT LB 9507 (EG&G Berthold) luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized across all samples by protein concentration as determined using the Bradford assay. Antibodies—Anti-acetylated-histone H3 and -H4 antibodies were purchased from Upstate. Anti-CTIP2 antisera was raised against CTIP2 peptide corresponding to amino acids 25–44 and purified on a peptide affinity column. Anti-Mi-2α/β and -FLAG M5 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences and Sigma, respectively. Anti-RbAp46/RbAp48, -CTIP2 (25B6), and -β-actin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Abcam. Anti-MTA2, -HDAC1, -HDAC2, and -HA polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Abcam, and anti-p57KIP2 was obtained from BD Pharmingen. Immunoprecipitation Analyses—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected as described above with 10 μg of an expression vector encoding FLAG-CTIP2 or the corresponding empty vector (pcDNA3.1). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed with NET-N buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and a protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing prior to centrifugation (16,000 × g for 15 min). Cell lysates (800 μg of protein per immunoprecipitation reaction) were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer IP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 60 min to reduce nonspecific protein binding. After centrifugation, the precleared samples were incubated with 2 μg of an anti-MTA2 or irrelevant (anti-HA) antibody on ice for 60 min, followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose. Samples were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with rocking. The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with buffer IP, and resuspended in denaturing sample buffer. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. For SK-N-MC cells, the nuclear extract was made as described previously (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar), except buffer C was modified to contain 0.72 m NaCl, and the pellet remaining after nuclear lysis was re-extracted with an equal volume of this buffer followed by brief sonication and centrifugation. Final nuclear extracts were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl), aliquoted, and quickly frozen or used directly in IP assays, which were performed as described above using 300 μg nuclear protein, and in buffer D containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. SF9 cells were infected with baculovirus individually directing expression of Mi-2β, MTA2, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, and RbAp48. Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and sonicated three times for 20 s to lyse cells, followed by centrifugation. Approximately 120–160 μg of total protein from cell lysates was used per IP reaction, which was performed in buffer IP using 1 μg of specific antibodies against individual NuRD complex proteins. GST Pull-down Experiments—GST pull-down experiments were conducted as described previously (29Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HDAC Activity Assays—Immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described above except that more protein was used (HEK293T, 2 mg/IP; SK-N-MC, 500 μg/IP). Immunoprecipitates obtained from SK-N-MC cells or transiently transfected HEK293T cells were analyzed for HDAC activity using an HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay kit (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc.), in the absence or presence of TSA (0.25 μm). The fluorophore produced from the reactions was excited at 360-nm light and emission was followed at 460 nm on a Gemini XPS microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Superose 6 Size Exclusion Column Chromatography—SK-N-MC nuclear extract was dialyzed against buffer D. Approximately 6 mg of nuclear protein was concentrated to 1 ml using a Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal filter apparatus (10 kDa nominal molecular mass limit), and then applied to an 850 × 20 mm Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer D containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, and calibrated with protein standards (blue dextran, 2000 kDa; thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; RNase A, 13.7 kDa, all from Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and fractions were collected for 5 min (2 ml). The chromatographic elution profiles of CTIP2 and the NuRD complex proteins were determined by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies and chemiluminescence detection. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were conducted as previously described (15Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43041-43050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Leid M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, HEK293T cells were washed sequentially after cross-linking with phosphate-buffered saline, buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and then lysed followed by brief sonication. The sonicated lysates were diluted 3.5-fold with ChIP dilution buffer, and 10% of the diluted lysates was reserved as an input sample to determine the total amount of reporter plasmid in transfected cells for subsequent normalization procedures. The remaining lysates were aliquoted equally and used for IP with and without the addition of 5 μg of anti-MTA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), -RbAp46/48 (Abcam), or -HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Chromatin complexes were subjected to reversal of protein-DNA cross-links at 65 °C overnight and proteinase K treatment at 45 °C for 2 h. DNA was recovered by using a Qiaquick Spin kit (Qiagen) and amplified using a forward primer (5′-GTCGAGGGGATGATAATGC-3′) upstream of the multimerized 17-mer, and a reverse primer (5′-ACAGTACCGGAATGCCAAG-3′) downstream of the promoter but upstream of a transcriptional start site of the luciferase gene. Amplification of GAPDH promoter region (negative control) was performed with a forward primer (5′-TCCTCCTGTTTCATCCAAGC-3′), and a reverse primer (5′-TAGTAGCCGGGCCCTACTTT-3′). Conditions of the amplification reactions were as follows; a predenaturation step of 2 min at 94 °C was followed by 23 (for the reporter) and 31 (for GAPDH) cycles of 94 °C (denaturation) for 40 s, 56 °C (annealing) for 45 s, 70 °C (elongation) for 1 min, and a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C. The resulting 210-bp PCR product of the reporter gene promoter region and 218-bp PCR product of the GAPDH promoter region were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Experiments were performed at least three times. ChIP assays in SK-N-MC cells were performed as described above except that the antibodies (anti-CTIP2 and RbAp46/48, respectively) were coupled to magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal/Invitrogen). Re-ChIP Assays—The 1st ChIP was performed as described above using anti-CTIP2 antibody. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads with 20 mm dithiothreitol. Eluates were then diluted 30-fold with ChIP dilution buffer, and subjected to the 2nd immunoprecipiation reaction using either anti-MTA2, -HDAC2, or -RbAp46/48 antibody. The final elution step was performed using 1% SDS solution in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. The enrichment of DNA template was analyzed by conventional PCR using primers specific for p57KIP2 proximal promoter (forward: 5′-GCCAATCGCCGTGGTTGTTGT-3′; reverse: 5′-GTGGTGGACTCTTCTGCGTC-3′). Amplification of HMOX-1 proximal promoter was performed using a forward primer 5′-GCCAGACTTTGTTTCCCAAGG-3′, and a reverse primer 5′-GAGGAGGCAGGCGTTGACTG-3′. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR)—Purified immunoprecipitated promoter fragments were analyzed by quantitative real time-PCR (DNA Engine Opticon® 2 Thermal Cycler, MJ Research, Inc.) using SYBR Green I methodology. Amplification reactions were performed as follows; a predenaturation step of 10 min at 95 °C was followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C (denaturation) for 10 s, 56 °C (annealing) for 20 s, 70 °C (elongation) for 20 s, and a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C. siRNA Transfection—Transfections of SK-N-MC cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and a siRNA pool targeting CTIP2 (custom synthesized by Dharmacon). Lipofectamine (60 μl) as well as siRNA (60 μl of 15 μm SMART-POOL or nonspecific siRNA) were preincubated in Opti-MEM media for 5 min. After preincubation, the two reagents were mixed together and allowed to incubate for additional 20 min. Immediately before transfection, SK-N-MC cells were transferred from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to Opti-MEM (without serum), and the transfection mix was added dropwise to the plates (siRNA final concentration 100 nm). Four independent plates were used for each condition (CTIP2 siRNA and nonspecific siRNA). After 24 h, the cells were transferred back to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and allowed to incubate for another 24 h prior to harvesting for either RNA preparation or protein isolation (see below). RNA Preparation and Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit, labeled using the ENZO RNA Transcript Labeling kit, and used to probe the Affymetrix human microarray chip HG-U133. Results were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.2 (Silicon Genetics) software, and genes that differed from the control by at least 2-fold (p < 0.05 as determined by one-way analysis of variance), such as p57KIP2, were identified, and confirmed to be regulated by CTIP2 by immunoblotting and/or RT-PCR. Whole Cell Extract Preparation—SK-N-MC cells (from a 100-mm plate at ∼80% confluence) were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Extracts were analyzed by Western blot. The Class I and Class II Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor TSA Partially Reverses Transcriptional Repression Mediated by Gal4-CTIP2 on a Minimal Promoter—Gal4-CTIP2 has been previously shown to possess strong, and predominantly TSA-insensitive transcriptional repression activity in the context of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (tk) promoter, which may be caused by CTIP2-mediated recruitment of the histone deacetylase SIRT1 to the template (15Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43041-43050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine if the TSA insensitivity of CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression generalizes to other promoter contexts, we assessed the ability of CTIP2 to mediate repression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a minimal promoter (Lex-Gal-LUC; Ref 27Christian M. Tullet J.M. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15645-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Expression of the reporter gene was stimulated by co-expression with LexA-VP16 to facilitate evaluation of GAL4-CTIP2-mediated repression. TSA-stimulated expression of the reporter gene over 7-fold in the presence of GAL4-DBD (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Gal4-CTIP2 strongly repressed expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 1A, lane 3), as previously described within the tk promoter (15Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43041-43050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, in the context of this minimal promoter, Gal4-CTIP2-mediated repression was found to be partially reversed by TSA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4), indicating the possible involvement of class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs). Deacetylation of Histone H3/H4 Associated with the Reporter Template in Cells Expressing Gal4-CTIP2—ChIP experiments were conducted to determine if transfection of Gal4-CTIP2 resulted in deacetylation of template-associated histones H3 and/or H4. Transfection of Gal4-DBD minimally reduced the level of acetylated H3/H4 associated with the template as determined by both conventional and quantitative PCR (qPCR; Fig. 1B, compare lanes 6 and 8). This effect was consistent with the lack of transcriptional repression activity of Gal4-DBD observed in reporter assays (data not shown). However, the level of acetylated H3/H4 associated with the template decreased by over 4-fold upon transfection with Gal4-CTIP2 as determined by both conventional and qPCR (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 6, 8, and 10). Together, these findings indicate that transfection of Gal4-CTIP2 resulted in deacetylation of H3/H4 on the template of the minimal promoter. CTIP2 Complexes Harbor TSA-sensitive HDAC Activity—To determine if TSA-sensitive histone deacetylase activity is associated with CTIP2 complexes in mammalian cells, histone deacetylase activity assays were performed in vitro using whole cell lysates from HEK293T cells, which had been transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding FLAG-CTIP2 or the corresponding empty vector. Immunoprecipitates of FLAG-CTIP2 complexes indeed harbored HDAC activity that was nearly 10-fold greater than that observed with control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). Inclusion of TSA in the in vitro assay completely abolished the in vitro HDAC activity of FLAG-CTIP2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1, 2, and 3). To investigate if complexes containing CTIP2 harbor TSA-sensitive histone deacetylase activity in a more natural cellular context, the HDAC activity assays were performed similarly as above on nuclear extracts derived from SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells, which like Jurkat cells (15Senawong T.

CTIP2 complexes from SK-N-MC cells possessed robust HDAC activity (Fig. 2B, lane 1). In contrast, the immun"

The ability of the EphB receptors to regulate cell migration and promote angiogenesis likely contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. Here we show that EphB receptors, and especially EphB4, regulate the migration of murine melanoma cells. Highly malignant melanoma cells express the highest levels of EphB4 receptor and migrate faster than less malignant melanoma cells. Furthermore, inhibition of EphB receptor forward signaling by overexpression of a form of EphB4 lacking the cytoplasmic portion or by treatment with competitively acting soluble EphB2-Fc results in slower melanoma cell migration. In contrast, overexpression of active EphB4 significantly enhances cell migration. The effects of EphB4 receptor on cell migration and cell morphology require its kinase activity because the inhibition of EphB4 kinase activity by overexpression of kinase dead EphB4 inhibits cell migration and affects the organization of actin cytoskeleton. Activation of EphB4 receptor with its ligand ephrin-B2-Fc enhances the migratory ability of melanoma cells and increases RhoA activity, whereas inhibiting EphB receptor forward signaling decreases RhoA activity. Moreover, expression of dominant negative RhoA blocks the effects of active EphB4 on cell migration and actin organization. These data suggest that EphB4 forward signaling contributes to the high migratory ability of invasive melanoma cells by influencing RhoA-mediated actin cytoskeleton reorganization.

In recent years significant progress has been achieved in the prevention and early detection of melanoma. Nevertheless, melanoma remains the most deadly type of skin cancer because of the lack of effective therapeutic treatments. Melanoma progression is a multistep process that begins with changes in melanocyte morphology and an increased migratory ability (1Bogenrieder T. Herlyn M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 44: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in melanoma progression. However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the progression of melanoma are not well understood. An increasing body of evidence suggests that Eph receptor-tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, may play an important role in the molecular events responsible for melanoma progression. There are numerous examples of misregulated expression of Eph receptors in tumors, including melanomas (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Lamorte L. Park M. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N Am. 2001; 10: 271-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EphA2 receptor, for example, is highly expressed in more than 90% of melanoma cell lines, with especially high levels in more malignant melanomas (4Easty D.J. Ganz S.E. Farr C.J. Lai C. Herlyn M.

EphA receptors have also been reported to be up-regulated during the development of breast and prostate carcinomas (9Walker-Daniels J. Coffman K. Azimi M. Rhim J.S. Bostwick D.G. Snyder P. Kerns B.J.

Besides the EphA/ephrin-A system, several studies have also reported the expression of B class Eph receptors and ephrins in different tumors, including melanomas, and suggested a functional relation between EphB/ephrin-B expression and tumor progression (12Nikolova Z.

The family is divided into two classes, A and B, on the basis of their sequence similarity and ability to bind ephrin-A or ephrin-B ligands, although some binding interactions between the two groups have also been reported (22Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 23Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The A class ephrins are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecules, whereas the B class ephrins are transmembrane proteins. The kinase activity of the Eph receptors is stimulated by binding to ephrin ligands. Eph receptor activation triggers forward signaling through interactions with cytoplasmic signaling proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins. Eph receptor-ephrin interactions also generate reverse signaling through the ephrin. The downstream signaling pathways that link Eph receptors to cell migration are beginning to be elucidated. Some signaling pathways target Rho GTPases leading to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that accompanies cell migration (24Noren N.K. Pasquale E.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent work has also highlighted the ability of Eph receptors and ephrins to affect cell-extracellular matrix adhesion by modulating integrin activity, which also plays an important role in cell migration (21Meyer S. Hafner C. Guba M. Flegel S. Geissler E.K. Becker B. Koehl G.E. Orso E. Landthaler M. Vogt T. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 1197-1206PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H.

Moreover, Eph receptors and ephrins can promote angiogenesis through their effects on endothelial cell migration as well as proliferation (30Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The EphA2 receptor has been reported to promote angiogenesis in a variety of tumor types and has also been implicated in vascular mimicry in aggressive melanoma tumors (36Ogawa K. Pasqualini R.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of the EphB4 receptor, on the other hand, promotes breast tumor growth by stimulating angiogenesis through reverse ephrin-B2 signaling (20Noren N.K. Lu M. Freeman A.L. Koolpe M. Pasquale E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5583-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The ability of EphB receptors to regulate cell migration and promote tumor angiogenesis might both contribute to melanoma progression. Here we examine the role of B class Eph receptors and ephrins in melanoma cell migration. Using a panel of murine melanoma cells with well defined metastatic properties in vivo and migratory abilities in vitro, we show that the EphB receptors enhance the migration of melanoma cells. Highly malignant melanoma cells that migrate rapidly express the highest levels of EphB receptors, including EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4. Our data reveal the involvement of EphB4 receptor forward signaling because EphB4 lacking the cytoplasmic domain slows melanoma cell migration, whereas overexpression of active EphB4 significantly enhances cell migration. Furthermore, the effects of EphB4 on melanoma cell migration and morphology depend on its kinase activity because expression of kinase-inactive EphB4 slows cell migration and also alters cell morphology and actin organization. Finally, our data suggest that the EphB4 receptor regulates the migration and morphology of melanoma cells by influencing Rho-mediated actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Antibodies—The primary antibodies were: goat anti-EphB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 2 μg/106 cells for flow cytometry); goat anti-EphB2, EphB3, EphB4, ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, and ephrin-B3 (R&D Systems; 2 μg/106 cells for flow cytometry and 0.2 μg/ml for Western blot); rabbit anti-EphB2 (0.2 μg/ml for Western blot (39Holash J.A. Soans C. Chong L.D. Shao H. Dixit V.M. Pasquale E.B. Dev.

The secondary antibodies were: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 0.08 μg/ml for Western blot); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 0.008 μg/ml for Western blot); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Molecular Probes, 0.5 μg/106 cells for flow cytometry). Cell Culture and Transfection—Murine melanoma cell lines K1735 SW1, M2, P, C19, and C23 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium with 2 mml-glutamine (Irvine Scientific), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 1× vitamin solution (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol with modifications. Briefly, cell cultures with 80% confluency grown on 35-mm plates were incubated with transfection solution containing 0.5-1.5 μg of plasmid DNA for 2-3 h. The transfection solution was then replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium. Expression Vectors—The DNA constructs used were: pEGFP-N1 (Clontech); pEGFP-F (Clontech); pEGFP-actin (Clontech); hemagglutinin-tagged dnRhoA N19 (a kind gift of Dr. Kathryn DeFea); EphB4ΔC-GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RhoGEF, Rho GTPase exchange factor; dn, dominant negative; kd, kinase dead. (consisting of a region of human EphB4 cDNA encoding amino acids 1-584 in pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech)); full-length EphB4 cDNA in pcDNA3 plasmid (20Noren N.K. Lu M. Freeman A.L. Koolpe M. Pasquale E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All single and double amino acid mutations in cytoplasmic domain of EphB4 receptor were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Ligand Induction of EphB Receptors—To activate EphB receptors in melanoma cells, we used 2 μg/ml ephrin-B2-Fc (R&D Systems) or control human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) preclustered with anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) before the application. For preclustering, ephrin-B2-Fc or Fc was incubated with anti-human Fc antibody at a 1:2 ratio on ice for 1 h before application to the cultured cells. To inhibit endogenous ephrin-B/EphB interaction, we used 4 μg/ml EphB2-Fc (R&D Systems). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Melanoma cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (Sigma), and 50 mm sodium pervanadate). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 13,400 rpm. The protein concentrations were measured by BCA kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of proteins were resolved on the 8-16% Trisglycine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The proteins of interest were probed with specific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, melanoma cells were treated with 2 μg/ml ephrin-B2-Fc, 4 μg/ml EphB2-Fc, or control human Fc for 15 or 30 min, and cell lysates were collected as described above. The lysates were then incubated with rabbit anti-EphB2 or goat anti-EphB4 and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the proteins bound to beads were resolved as previously described (40Ethell I.M. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R. Pasquale E.B. Yamaguchi Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 1001-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For quantification purpose, the densitometry values of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were normalized to the values of the corresponding total protein bands using Adobe Photoshop. RhoA Activity Assay—To assess RhoA activity, preclustered ephrin-B2-Fc (2 μg/ml, 15 min), EphB2-Fc (4 μg/ml, 30 min), or control human Fc was applied to melanoma cells as described above. After treatment, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (Sigma), and 50 mm sodium pervanadate) and collected as described above. The lysates of SW1 melanoma cells transiently transfected with GFP, EphB4ΔC-GFP, or kdEphB4 were also assessed for RhoA activity. A portion of the lysates was retained for use in the assessment of total RhoA, and GTP-RhoA (active RhoA) was precipitated from the remainder of the lysates using GST-RBD beads (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). After precipitation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, the bound material was eluted with Laemmli buffer, and Western immunoblot analysis was performed. The membranes were probed with anti-Rho antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The level of GTP-RhoA was quantified by densitometry and normalized to total RhoA levels in the lysates. Immunostaining—Melanoma cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. The transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. F-actin was labeled by incubation with rhodamine-coupled phalloidin (0.165 μm, Molecular Probes). Immunostaining was analyzed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (model LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) or a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent microscope with 20× air objective and recorded by a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG 12-bit CCD camera using Image-Pro Software. Live Imaging—We monitored the actin rearrangements in GFP-actin-expressing melanoma cells plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. Time-lapse imaging was performed under an inverted fluorescent microscope (model TE2000; Nikon) with a 40× air Fluor objective and monitored by a 12-bit CCD camera (model ORCA-AG; Hamamatsu) using Image-Pro software (Media Cybernetics). During imaging the melanoma cells were maintained in medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and images were captured at 2-min intervals for 1 h. Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by spinning down and were washed once in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2% fetal bovine serum, 2 μg/ml mouse IgG, and 0.02% sodium azide). The cells were resuspended in binding buffer at 106 cells/1 ml and divided into 100-μl aliquots with 2 μg of primary antibody (anti-EphB1, -B2, -B3, and -B4 and ephrin-B1, -B2, -B3 and goat IgG as negative control) added to each aliquot. The reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed in binding buffer twice and incubated with 0.5 μg secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed twice with binding buffer and assayed on the FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The values were calculated as F1-F2/F2, where F1 is the experimental value (immunofluorescent labeling with specific antibodies), and F2 is the control value (negative immunofluorescent control with unspecific goat IgG). Three independent experiments were performed for each condition. The statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Real-time PCR—mRNA samples were extracted from five murine melanoma cell lines, K1735 SW1, M2, P, C19, and C23, using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. mRNA concentrations were measured, and reverse transcription was performed. The concentrations of cDNA products were then measured, and equal amounts of cDNA samples from five melanoma cell lines (K1735 SW1, M2, P, C19, and C23) were used for real-time PCR against specific primers designed for EphB1, B2, B3, B4, B6, ephrin-B1, B2, B3, and actin. Three reactions were performed for each group. Actin was used as an internal standard. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition. The statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Scratch Assay—After melanoma cells were plated on fibronectin (BD Science)-coated dishes for 12 h (overnight), a thin strip of cells (∼1.5 mm2) was removed from the dish by scratching with a blue Eppendorf tip. Detached cells were removed, and cell migration into scratched area was monitored after 0, 3, and 6 h. The phase-contrast images were taken under a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent microscope with a 4× air objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG 12-bit CCD camera using Image-Pro Software. Fifty scratches (10/plate) were analyzed in each experimental group. The number of cells migrated into the scratched area were counted, and the area of the scratch was measured. The number of migrated cells/1 mm2 of scratch area was calculated. In experiments with transfected cells, the number of transfected migrating cells was normalized for transfection efficiency. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition (total 150 scratches/group). Experimental values represent the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft (Redmond, WA) Excel. The statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Cell Viability Assay—To assess cell viability in the scratch assay, live cells were labeled with calcein AM (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37 °C and dead cells with propidium iodide for 5 min at room temperature (Molecular Probes). The images were taken as described above. The number of calcein-positive cells (live cells) and propidium iodide-labeled cells (dead cells) were counted. The percentage of live cells was calculated for each cell line. Three independent experiments were performed. The statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Single Cell Motility Assay—The single cell motility assay was performed with Cell Motility Hitkit (Cellomics). Briefly, the blue fluorescent beads were resuspended in washing buffer M and plated on fibronectin-coated 96-well plates. Then GFP-transfected melanoma cells were plated on the plates coated with the beads and incubated for 5 or 8 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The M2 and P melanoma cells were treated with 2 μg/ml ephrin-B2-Fc (R&D Systems) or control human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 6 h. After the incubation, the melanoma cells were fixed in formaldehyde. The images were taken under a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent microscope with 20× air objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG 12-bit CCD camera using Image-Pro Software. As cells migrate, they push aside the beads, clearing tracks behind them. Approximately 500 cells were randomly selected and analyzed in each experimental group. The number of migrating cells and the track areas of migrating cells (migration area) were calculated to assess cell migration. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition (total 1500 cells/group). Experimental values represent the mean ± S.D. The results show low variability in number of migrating cells per group. The statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Expression of the EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 Receptors Is High in Fast Migrating Melanoma Cells—To investigate whether melanoma cells acquire increased expression of EphB receptors and ephrin-B ligands during malignant progression, we examined five murine melanoma cell lines with well defined metastatic properties: SW1, M2, P, C19, and C23. Four of these cell lines represent distinct clones (derived by in vitro cloning or in vivo selection) originating from a parental cell line induced by UV irradiation and croton oil promotion (41Kripke M.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1979; 63: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The parental cell line, designated K1735 P and hereafter referred to as P, shows low metastatic properties overall but has been shown to contain subpopulations of highly metastatic cells as well as essentially non-metastatic cells. The disparate biologic behavior of these sub-populations is represented in the four clones designated SW1 and M2, which are highly metastatic to the lung, and C19 and C23, which are essentially non-metastatic (42Fidler I.J. Gruys E. Cifone M.A. Barnes Z. Bucana C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar, 43Talmadge J.E. Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 69: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar). We have analyzed the migratory ability of these murine melanoma cell clones in vitro using two different migration assays, the scratch assay and the single cell motility assay (Figs. 1 and 2). The migratory ability of the melanoma cells was found to correlate with their metastatic properties (44Owen-Schaub L.B. van Golen K.L. Hill L.L. Price J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The highly metastatic SW1 melanoma cells migrated faster, whereas the least aggressive clones C19 and C23 migrated slower (Figs. 1 and 2). Analysis of cell viability by labeling live cells with calcein AM and dead cells with propidium iodide showed no significant difference between the different clones in scratch assay (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Migration of the melanoma cell lines SW1 and C19 by single cell migration assay. A and B, quantification of the migratory ability of melanoma cell lines SW1 and C19 in a single cell migration assay. The cells were plated on dishes coated with fluorescent beads. As cells migrate, they push aside the beads, clearing tracks behind them. The track areas of migrating cells (migration area; A) and the percentage of migrating cells (B) were calculated to assess cell migration. The histogram shows average values from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate S.D. (n = 1500 cells per group). ***, p < 0.001. C, immunofluorescence images show the track areas (black) of fast migrating SW1 and slow migrating C19 melanoma cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate whether the migratory ability of the different melanoma clones correlates with the levels of EphB receptors and their ephrin-B ligands, we examined cell surface expression of these molecules by flow cytometry. The results show that the cell surface levels of EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 correlate with the migratory ability of the melanoma cells, whereas EphB1 is not detectably expressed (Fig. 3). The highly metastatic SW1 cells migrate the fastest and have the highest levels of EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 on their surface, whereas these receptors are undetectable in the non-metastatic, slow migrating C19 and C23 clones (Fig. 3, A and C). Ephrin-B1 is expressed in all melanoma lines, with the highest cell surface levels in SW1 cells, whereas ephrin-B3 expression is low in clone M2 and undetectable in all other clones (Fig. 3, B and C). Ephrin-B2, the preferred ligand for EphB4, is present only on the surface of the highly migratory SW1 cells and the slow migrating C19 clone. The C19 cells, however, have low levels of EphB4 expression, suggesting that differences in EphB4 receptor levels might regulate ephrin-B2/EphB4 signaling in melanoma cells. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the flow cytometry results showing a correlation between EphB3 and EphB4 mRNA levels and protein expression levels on the cell surface. The highest EphB3 and EphB4 mRNA levels were detected in the fast migrating SW1 and M2 cells, whereas the slow migrating C19 and C23 cells showed the lowest expression (supplemental Fig. 2). The highest levels of EphB4 protein were also detected in the fast migrating SW1 and M2 cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A). The level of EphB4 protein was"
https://openalex.org/W1995675538,"Several somatic mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been identified that predict clinical response of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients to gefitinib. To test the hypothesis that these mutations cause constitutive EGF receptor signaling, and to investigate its mechanistic basis, we expressed representative examples in a null background and analysed their biochemical properties. Each mutation caused significant EGF-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, and allowed the receptor to promote Ba/F3 cell mitogenesis in the absence of EGF, arguing that these are oncogenic mutations. Active mutated receptors are present at the cell surface and are fully competent to bind EGF. Recent structural studies show that the inactive EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between its activation loop and αC helix. We find that mutations predicted to disrupt this autoinhibitory interaction (including several that have not been described in NSCLC) elevate EGF-independent tyrosine kinase activity, thus providing new insight into how somatic mutations activate EGFR and other ErbB family members."

In the preceding articles, we identified and characterized l-arabinose-1-dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the first and final reaction steps in this pathway, respectively (Watanabe, S., Kodaki, T., and Makino, K. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 2612-2623 and Watanabe, S., Kodaki, T., and Makino, K. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 28876-28888). We here report the remaining three enzymes, l-arabonate dehydratase, l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate (l-KDA) dehydratase, and l-arabinolactonase. N-terminal amino acid sequences of l-arabonate dehydratase and l-KDA dehydratase purified from A. brasiliense cells corresponded to those of AraC and AraD genes, which form a single transcriptional unit together with the l-arabinose-1-dehydrogenase gene. Furthermore, the l-arabinolactonase gene (AraB) was also identified as a component of the gene cluster. Genetic characterization of the alternative l-arabinose pathway suggested a significant evolutional relationship with the known sugar metabolic pathways, including the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and the several modified versions. l-Arabonate dehydratase belongs to the ILVD/EDD family and spectrophotometric and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed it to contain a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. Site-directed mutagenesis identified three cysteine ligands essential for cluster coordination. l-KDA dehydratase was sequentially similar to DHDPS/NAL family proteins. d-2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase, a member of the DHDPS/NAL family, catalyzes the equivalent reaction to l-KDA aldolase involved in another alternative l-arabinose pathway, probably associating a unique evolutional event between the two alternative l-arabinose pathways by mutation(s) of a common ancestral enzyme.

Many bacteria are able to grow with l-arabinose as the sole carbon and energy source, and the bacterial pathway of l-arabinose metabolism has been extensively investigated. Many bacteria including Escherichia coli depend on protein products of the araBAD operon, which contains araB (ribulokinase, EC 2.7.1.16), araA (l-arabinose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.4) and araD (l-ribulose-phosphate 4-epimerase, EC 5.1.3.4) to convert l-arabinose to d-xylulose 5-phosphate through l-ribulose and l-ribulose 5-phosphate (1Stryer L.

The lactone is cleaved by a lactonase to l-arabonate, followed by two successive dehydration reactions forming l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate (l-KDA) 2The abbreviations used are: l-KDA, l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate; αKGSA, α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde; ED pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway; EDD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase; KDPG, D-2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate; GDH, glucose dehydrogenase; KDG, D-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; DD pathway, De Ley-Doudoroff pathway; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Mr, molecular mass; ILVD, dihydroxyacid dehydratase; WT, wild-type enzyme; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; DHDPS, dihydrodipicolinate synthase; NAL, N-acetylneuraminate lyase; ORF, open reading frame. 2The abbreviations used are: l-KDA, l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate; αKGSA, α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde; ED pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway; EDD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase; KDPG, D-2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate; GDH, glucose dehydrogenase; KDG, D-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; DD pathway, De Ley-Doudoroff pathway; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Mr, molecular mass; ILVD, dihydroxyacid dehydratase; WT, wild-type enzyme; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; DHDPS, dihydrodipicolinate synthase; NAL, N-acetylneuraminate lyase; ORF, open reading frame. and α-ketoglutaricsemialdehyde(αKGSA).ThelaststepistheNAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenation of αKGSA to α-ketoglutaric acid (referred to as the first pathway). Alternatively, l-KDA is cleaved through an aldolase reaction to glycolaldehyde and pyruvate (referred to as the second pathway). It is note-worthy that the alternative pathway of bacterial l-arabinose metabolism (red-colored route in Fig. 1B), in particular the second pathway, seems equivalent to the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway (14Entner N. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 196: 853-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning the metabolism of sugars related to l-arabinose, the ED pathway is a general route for d-glucose catabolism in bacteria together with glycolysis (green-colored route in Fig. 1B). This pathway involves: (i) the initial phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate either by a glucokinase or by the action of a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, (ii) the oxidation to 6-phosphogluconate by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31), (iii) dehydration to d-2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate (KDPG) by 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (EDD, EC 4.2.1.12), and (iv) cleavage of the characteristic KDPG intermediate by KDPG aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14), yielding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is further metabolized via the glycolytic pathway, yielding a second molecule of pyruvate. Although the ED pathway seems to be restricted to bacteria, modifications have been identified in all three kingdoms of life: Eukaryota, Eubacteria, and Archaea (15Conway T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 9: 1-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The “non-phosphorylative ED pathway” (orange-colored route in Fig. 1B) is a modified version of the ED pathway and consists of (i) the oxidation of glucose to gluconate via glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), (ii) the conversion of gluconate by d-gluconate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.39) into d-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), (iii) the aldol cleavage of KDG by KDG aldolase (EC 4.1.2.20), forming glyceraldehyde and pyruvate. This pathway is operative in (hyper)thermophilic archaea (16Siebers B. Schönheit P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and a fungi of Aspergillus niger (17Elzainy T.A. Hassan M.M. Allam A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 457-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a set of metabolic genes was identified in archaeal Sulfolobus solfataricus (18Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Theodossis A. Walden H. Westwick E.J. Connaris H. Lamble H.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), revealing no evolutional relationship between the ED pathway and non-phosphorylative ED pathway despite similar schematic sugar conversions (16Siebers B. Schönheit P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Another ED modification is the so-called “semi-phosphorylative ED pathway” (21Ahmed H. Ettema T.J. Tjaden B. Geerling A.C. van der Oost J. Siebers B. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), in which KDG is subsequently phosphorylated by KDG kinase to form KDPG. Oxidization of d-glucose to d-gluconate is also the initial step in the “d-gluconate pathway” of bacteria (22Otani M. Ihara N. Umezawa C. Sano K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 148-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yeast (23Tsai C.S. Shi J.L. Ye H.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and A. niger (24Muller H.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (blue-colored route in Fig. 1B). In contrast with the semi-phosphorylative ED modification, d-gluconate is phosphorylated by gluconokinase, and the produced 6-phosphogluconate enters the ED pathway and/or pentosephosphate pathway. Similarly, an alternative pathway different from the well-known “Leloir pathway” for d-galactose metabolism (25Leloir L.F. Arch. Biochem. 1951; 33: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is known in some bacteria. In the so-called “De Ley-Doudoroff (DD) pathway” (26De Ley J. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 227: 745-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), d-galactose is metabolized through analogous conversion to the semi-phosphorylative ED pathway, to produce the same end products as the ED pathway (violet-colored route in Fig. 1B). Analogous to the non-phosphorylative ED pathway, the DD pathway involves no phosphorylation in Aspergillus fungi (27Elshafei AM. Abdel-Fatah OM Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Few metabolic genes involved in the DD pathway have been identified. Because no gene encoding the enzyme involved in the alternative pathways of l-arabinose metabolism has been identified, we are in the process of enzymatically and genetically characterizing the alternative l-arabinose pathway of Azospirillum brasiliense, in which the first pathway is operative (12Novick N.J. Tyler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 364-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently identified l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.46) and αKGSA dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.26) catalyzing the first- and final-step reactions, respectively (28Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the remaining enzymes, l-arabinolactonase (EC 3.1.1.15), l-arabonate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.25) and l-KDA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.43). Interestingly, these metabolic enzymes involved in the alternative l-arabinose pathway are evolutionally related to equivalent enzymes involved in the ED pathway, non-phosphorylative ED pathway, d-gluconate pathway, or DD pathway. Furthermore, unique catalytic insights into l-arabonate dehydratase and l-KDA dehydratase are discussed. General Procedures—Basic recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using a PCR Thermal Cycler PERSONAL (TaKaRa) for 30 cycles in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1.25 units of Ex Taq® DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), appropriate primers (10 pmol) and template DNA under the following conditions: denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for time periods calculated as an extension rate of 1 kbp/min. DNA sequencing was carried out using the Dual CyDye™ Terminator Sequencing Kit (Veritas) and appropriate primers with Long-Read Tower, UBC DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing PAGE was performed by omitting SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol from the solution used in SDS-PAGE. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Multi-Station LC-8020 model II system (TOSOH). Samples were applied at 35 °C to an Aminex HPX-87H Organic Analysis column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) linked to an RID-8020 refractive index detector (TOSOH) and eluted with 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. If necessary, 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to samples (0.1 volume) to remove proteins. After filtration, 100 μl of this solution was then analyzed. Assay of l-Arabonate Dehydratase—l-Arabonate (K+ salt) was prepared by the hypoiodite-in-methanol oxidization of l-arabinose (33Moore S. Link K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1940; 133: 293-311Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). l-Arabonate dehydratase activity was determined chemically using the semicarbazide method (34MacGee J. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 617-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the total reaction mixture of 400 μl was incubated at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm l-arabonate and a small volume of l-arabonate dehydratase. After 10 min, the enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 2 m HCl. To this solution, 300 μl of semicarbazide solution consisting of 1.0% (w/v) semicarbazide hydrochloride and 1.5% (w/v) sodium acetate was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Finally, the reaction mixture was diluted with 500 μl of distilled water and its absorbance was measured at 250 nm (molar absorption coefficient ϵ = 571 m-1·cm-1). d-Arabonate, d-xylonate, d-gluconate, and d-galactonate were prepared from the corresponding sugar as a K+ salt by the same procedure as l-arabonate. Assay of l-KDA Dehydratase—l-KDA dehydratase was assayed spectrophotometrically in the coupling system with l-arabonate dehydratase and αKGSA dehydrogenase. The recombinant αKGSA dehydrogenase of A. brasiliense was prepared by the method described previously (29Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (see lane 5 in Fig. 2C). The assay was performed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) buffer containing 10 mm l-arabonate, 1.5 mm NAD+. After the addition of each 1 unit of purified l-arabonate dehydratase andαKGSA dehydrogenase, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. No change in absorbance at 340 nm was found in this stage. The reaction was started by the addition of a small amount of l-KDA dehydratase, and the increasing absorption caused by NADH produced in the reaction was measured at 340 nm. Assay of l-Arabinolactone—Conversion of l-arabinolactone to l-arabonate by l-arabinolactonase was identified as a continuous reaction with l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase. Recombinant l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase was prepared by the method described previously (see lane 1 in Fig. 2C) (28Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 mm l-arabinose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of purified l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase, an appropriate amount of l-arabinolactonase, and 1 mm NADP+ in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The reaction was performed at 30 °C for the appropriate time and stopped by adding 12% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. After filtration, the amount of l-arabonate formed in the reaction mixture was determined by HPLC. Pure l-arabinolactone was chemically synthesized by boiling l-arabonate (K+ salt) in 0.2 m HCl for 5 min (34MacGee J. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 617-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of l-Arabonate Dehydratase from A. brasiliense—A. brasiliense ATCC 29145 was cultivated aerobically for 48 h at 30 °C in a synthetic medium containing 37 mm l-arabinose as described previously (28Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The grown cells were harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, washed with 50 mm Bicine buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2 (referred to as Buffer A) and stored at -35 °C until use. The washed cells were suspended in Buffer A, disrupted by sonication for 20 min with appropriate intervals on ice using ASTRASON® Ultrasonic Liquid Processor XL2020 (Misonix Inc.) and then centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain cell-free extracts. All purification steps were performed below 4°C. The cell-free extracts were fractionated between 50-60% saturation of (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of Buffer A, and the solution was then dialyzed overnight against a large volume of Buffer A containing 1.3 m (NH4)2SO4. All chromatography was carried out using an ÁKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). After insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a HiPrep 16/10 Butyl FF column (1.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1.3 m (NH4)2SO4 and washed with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted using a reversed linear gradient of 1.3-0 M (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A (300 ml). Fractions with high enzymatic activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against a large volume of Buffer A. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a column of HiPrep 16/10 DEAE FF (1.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A, and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. The column was developed with 200 ml of a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing l-arabonate dehydratase activity were combined and dialyzed overnight against a large volume of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2 (referred to as Buffer B). The enzyme solution was applied to a column of CHT Ceramic Hydroxyapatite Type I (1.6 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2 (referred to as Buffer C). The column was washed thoroughly with the same buffer and developed with 200 ml of a linear gradient of 0.01-0.3 M potassium phosphate in Buffer C. Fractions with high enzymatic activity were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore) at 18,000 × g for ∼2 h. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with Buffer A. Highly active fractions were pooled, concentrated and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -35 °C until use (referred to as Sample I). Purification of l-KDA Dehydratase from A. brasiliense—Procedures for the preparation of cell-free extracts and (NH4)2SO4 fractionation were similar to those described in the purification of l-arabonate dehydratase except that 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, (referred to as Buffer D) was used instead of Buffer A. Subsequently, Butyl FF chromatography was performed using a reversed linear gradient of 1.3-0 m (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer D. Fractions containing l-KDA dehydratase activity were combined and dialyzed overnight against Buffer D. The dialyzed enzyme preparation was applied to a column of DEAE FF equilibrated with Buffer D and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. The column was developed with 200 ml of a linear gradient 0-0.5 m NaCl in Buffer D. The active fractions were combined and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (referred to as Buffer E). The enzyme solution was applied to a CHT Ceramic Hydroxyapatite Type I column equilibrated with Buffer E and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.01-0.3 M potassium phosphate in Buffer E (200 ml). Fractions with high enzymatic activity were combined, concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated with Buffer D. Proteins in fractions containing high l-KDA dehydratase activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing a single protein were collected, concentrated, dialyzed against Buffer D containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -35 °C until use. Determination of N-terminal Sequence of Native Enzymes— As there was a little contamination in Sample I of the preparation of l-arabonate dehydratase, in-gel staining assay (35Gabriel O. Wang S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) was carried out to identify a polypeptide corresponding to this enzyme. Sample I was run on native-PAGE with 6% (w/v) gel that was then soaked in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm l-arabonate. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the gel was further soaked in the dark in 1 m NaOH containing 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Dehydratase activity appeared as a pink band. The active band that appeared in staining was cut out and broken in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) SDS. The protein was extracted from the gel by vigorous mixing overnight. A 4-fold volume of acetone chilled at -35 °C was then added to the extracts. After cooling for 1 h at -35 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 39,120 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The sample was dissolved in a small volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% (w/v) gel. This procedure revealed that a polypeptide with a molecular weight (Mr)of ∼62 kDa in Sample I corresponded to l-arabonate dehydratase. Therefore, Sample II was used to determine the N-terminal sequence of l-arabonate dehydratase. With l-KDA dehydratase, the purified enzyme was directly used to determine the N-terminal sequence. After SDS-PAGE, protein on the gel was transferred to Hybond™-P (Amersham Biosciences) at 3 mA/cm2 for 0.5 h in transfer buffer (10 mm cyclohexylaminopropane sulfonic acid, pH 11, containing 10% (v/v) methanol) with a horizontal electrophoretical blotting system (model AE-7500, Atto). After staining and destaining the protein, the area of the membrane corresponding to the l-arabonate dehydratase or l-KDA dehydratase band was excised and analyzed with a Procise™ 492 HT protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Cloning of l-Arabinose Operon from A. brasiliense—A. brasiliense genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (28Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To clone the l-arabinose operon of A. brasiliense, four synthetic oligonucleotide primers (UP-S, UP-AS, DOWN-S, and DOWN-AS) were designed (Table 1); UP-S and DOWN-AS were derived from the genome sequence of Burkholderia cepacia strain R18149, and UP-AS and DOWN-S were derived from that of A. brasiliense. Genomic PCR was carried out separately using a pair of UP-S/UP-AS and DOWN-S/DOWN-AS as primers and 300 ng of A. brasiliense genomic DNA as a template. Single PCR products of ∼2.7-kbp and ∼4.3-kbp were purified, cloned into a pGEM®-T vector (Promega) (referred to as pGEM1 and pGEM2, respectively) and sequenced. We designated the deduced open-reading frame (ORF) in the l-arabinose operon, as described in Fig. 3, in which a functional l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene (AraA) is contained (28Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol.

Each amplified DNA fragment was introduced into BamHI-PstI sites (for AraB and AraD) or BamHI-KpnI (for the AraC gene) in pQE-80L (Qiagen), a plasmid vector for conferring N-terminal His6 tag on expressed proteins, to obtain pHISAraB, pHISAraC and pHISAraD, respectively. E. coli DH5α harboring the expression plasmid for His6-tagged enzymes was grown at 37 °C to a turbidity of 0.6 at 600 nm in Super broth medium (pH 7.0, 12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 3.81 g of KH2PO4, and 12.5 g of K2HPO4 per liter) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. After the addition of 1 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was further grown for 6 h to induce the expression of His6-tagged protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer X (pH 7.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole). The cells were then disrupted by sonication, and the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer X, which is linked to an ÁKTA purifier system. The column was washed with Buffer Y (pH 7.0, Buffer X containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm imidazole instead of 10 mm imidazole). The enzymes were then eluted"

https://openalex.org/W1986149851,"The free-living soil protozoon Acanthamoeba castellanii synthesizes a range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the balance of which can be altered by environmental changes. We have isolated and functionally characterized in yeast a microsomal desaturase from A. castellanii, which catalyzes the sequential conversion of C(16) and C(18) Delta9-monounsaturated fatty acids to di- and tri-unsaturated forms. In the case of C(16) substrates, this bifunctional A. castellanii Delta12,Delta15-desaturase generated a highly unusual fatty acid, hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3Delta(9,12,15)(n-1)). The identification of a desaturase, which can catalyze the insertion of a double bond between the terminal two carbons of a fatty acid represents a new addition to desaturase functionality and plasticity. We have also co-expressed in yeast the A. castellanii bifunctional Delta12,Delta15-desaturase with a microsomal Delta6-desaturase, resulting in the synthesis of the highly unsaturated C(16) fatty acid hexadecatetraenoic acid (16:4Delta(6,9,12,15)(n-1)), previously only reported in marine microorganisms. Our work therefore demonstrates the feasibility of the heterologous synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-1 series. The presence of a bifunctional Delta12,Delta15-desaturase in A. castellanii is also considered with reference to the evolution of desaturases and the lineage of this protist."

PC2 is a TRP-type Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel, which is expressed in kidney and other organs. PC2 is present and functional in microtubule-containing primary cilia of renal epithelial cells. However, no information is yet available as to whether PC2 interacts with microtubules. Here, we assessed the role of microtubular dynamics in regulating PC2 channel function in primary cilia. Isolated ciliary membranes from LLC-PK1 epithelial cells were reconstituted in a lipid bilayer system. The acute addition of the microtubular disrupter colchicine (15 μm) rapidly abolished, whereas the addition of the microtubular stabilizer paclitaxel (taxol, 15 μm) increased ciliary PC2 channel activity. The further addition of α-tubulin plus GTP also stimulated PC2 channel activity in ciliary membranes. However, α-tubulin and GTP had no effect on in vitro translated PC2. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that PC2 interacts with the microtubule-dependent motor kinesin-2 subunit KIF3A, a protein involved in polycystic kidney disease. The interaction occurred through the carboxyl termini domain of both proteins, which was further confirmed by in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and dot blot overlay assays. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PC2 and KIF3A are in the same complex in native HEK293, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), and LLC-PK1 cells. Immunofluorescent staining also showed substantial PC2 and KIF3A co-localization in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells. The data indicate that microtubular organization regulates PC2 function, which may explain, among others, the regulatory role of PC2 in the sensory function of primary cilia.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common and lethal disease inherited as a dominant trait in humans, with an incidence of about one per 500-1000 in the population (1Wilson P.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene responsible for 85% of cases in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is PKD1, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1), 5The abbreviations used are: PC1, polycystin-1; PC2, polycystin-2; PC2N, amino terminus of PC2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PKD, polycystic kidney disease; TRP, transient receptor potential; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct. whereas most of the remaining cases are ascribed to mutations in the PKD2 gene, encoding polycystin-2 (PC2). PC2 is a TRP-type Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel that interacts with PC1 in a functional complex often implicated in a common signaling pathway. Recent studies demonstrated that actin cytoskeletal structures associate with PC2 (2Gallagher A.R. Cedzich A. Gretz N. Somlo S. Witzgall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Karpinski E. Wu G. Cantiello H.F. Chen X.Z. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1587-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is implicated in cell adherence and proliferation (7Gluck U. Ben Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also determined that the actin-severing protein, gelsolin, regulates PC2 channel function by remodeling cytoskeletal structures in a Ca2+-dependent manner (5Montalbetti N. Li Q. Timpanaro G.A. González-Perrett S. Dai X.Q. Chen X.Z. Cantiello H.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 566: 309-325Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In comparison, whether PC2 has a connection to microtubules remains unknown. Nonetheless, recent evidence strongly suggests potential links between renal cystic diseases and microtubular structures, in particular, the microtubule-enriched organelle known as the primary cilium. Interestingly, recent observations support the idea that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease cyst formation implicates specific structural/functional abnormalities in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells (8Pazour G.J.

The primary cilium is a solitary, usually non-motile, organelle projecting from the apical surface of mammalian cells. The primary cilium is supported by an array of nine doublets of peripheral microtubules (9 + 0) known as an axoneme and a surrounding membrane (10Qin H.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 457-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Praetorius H.A. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Spring K.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Most renal tubular epithelial cells of the mammalian nephron, with the exception of intercalated cells in the collecting duct, express a single primary cilium, which protrudes into the tubular lumen of the nephron and responds to fluid flow or mechanical bending by eliciting cytosolic calcium signals. Thus, primary cilia play an important role in mechano-sensation (10Qin H.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 457-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Praetorius H.A. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Spring K.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that both PC1 and PC2 are expressed in renal primary cilia (9Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y.

Guay-Woodford L.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Further, renal epithelial cells expressing a dysfunctional PC1 or PC2 have morphologically normal cilia but an impaired calcium response to fluid flow, suggesting that the PC1/PC2 complex contributes to fluid-flow sensation by renal primary cilia (9Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E.H. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Various forms of cystic kidney disease not directly linked to mutations in the PKD genes have been associated with microtubular-associated ciliary proteins (8Pazour G.J. San Agustin J.T. Follit J.A.

Treatment of homozygous cpk/cpk mice with the microtubular stabilizer paclitaxel (taxol) (18Woo D.D. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Wang C.J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1613-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) dramatically moderates progression of the disease. The Tg737 gene affected in the orpk PKD mouse encodes another ciliary protein, polaris, which localizes to the ciliary basal body and the microtubular axoneme (16Yoder B.K. Tousson A. Millican L. Wu J. Bugg Jr., C.E. Schafer J.A. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F541-F552Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Orpk mice display shortened cilia, left-right symmetry defects (15Murcia N.S. Richards W.G. Yoder B.K. Mucenski M.L. Dunlap J.R. Woychik R.P. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2347-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increased ciliary PC2 (8Pazour G.J. San Agustin J.T. Follit J.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R378-R380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The closest microtubular connection to PC2 to date is provided by recent work by Rundle et al. (19Rundle D.R. Gorbsky G. Tsiokas L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29728-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), who found that mDia1/Drf1 interacts with PC2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The mDia1/Drf1 is a member of the RhoA GTPase-binding formin homology protein family, which participates in signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cilia are assembled and maintained by a process called intraflagellar (or intraciliary) transport in which the ciliary axoneme is assembled into large raft structures, the intraflagellar transport particles at the basal bodies (10Qin H.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 457-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Li Q. Liu Y. Shen P.Y. Dai X.Q. Wang S. Smillie L.B. Sandford R. Chen X.Z.

Intraflagellar transport rafts are then transported from the basal bodies to the distal tip of the primary cilium (21Ong A.C.M. Wheatley D.N. Lancet. 2003; 361: 774-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein motor proteins mediate the anterograde and retrograde traffic of proteins along the axoneme, respectively. Kinesin-2 forms a heterotrimeric complex composed of two similar (but not identical) motor subunits KIF3A and KIF3B or KIF3C and a tail-associated non-motor accessory subunit KAP3 (22Takeda S. Yonekawa Y. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Nonaka S. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice lacking either KIF3A or KIF3B fail to synthesize cilia in the embryonic node and exhibit randomization of left-right asymmetry and structural abnormalities of the neural tube, pericardium, branchial arches, and somites (22Takeda S. Yonekawa Y. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Nonaka S. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Harada A. Kanai Y. Kido M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 95: 829-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice with either disrupted PC2, polaris, and KIF3A or disrupted KIF3B showed similar phenotypes, including defects in left-right asymmetry and other abnormalities during embryogenesis (15Murcia N.S.

Thus, herein, we hypothesized co-localization and functional regulation of the PC2 channel by microtubular structures of primary cilia. This interaction may be an important component of the novel sensory properties of the primary cilium. Here, we determined that maneuvers that induce microtubular reorganization or stabilization activate, whereas disruption of endogenous microtubules inhibits, the channel activity of PC2 from the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells. Interestingly, however, tubulin itself was incapable of regulating the isolated PC2 channel, suggesting that immediate anchoring proteins mediate this interaction. In search for such molecular linkage, we identified a physical interaction between PC2 and KIF3A and observed their colocalization in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells. We further observed that the addition of exogenous KIF3A itself was sufficient to activate both ciliary and isolated PC2 channel activity. Thus, structural changes in microtubule-PC2 connections act as a regulatory mechanism of channel function and probably trafficking of the channel protein to the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells. Cell Culture—Several renal cell lines, including HEK293, MDCK, IMCD, and LLC-PK1 cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, with or without 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells of fewer than 25 passages were cultured to full confluence before collection. For visualization of primary cilia, cells were typically grown for 3-7 days after confluence. Reagents and Immunochemistry—Anti-PC2 mouse monoclonal 1A11, goat polyclonal G-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (6Li Q. Montalbetti N. Shen P.Y. Dai X.Q. Cheeseman C.I. Karpinski E. Wu G. Cantiello H.F. Chen X.Z. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1587-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal ZMD.28 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) were used in this study. Rabbit polyclonal anti-KIF3A and mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma Canada (Oakville, ON). Secondary antibodies included donkey anti-mouse/rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-goat IgG when conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon International) for Western blotting or conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) for immunofluorescence. To immunolocalize PC2 and microtubular structures in primary cilia, cells were grown to confluence and fixed for 10 min in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (4%) and 2% sucrose. Cells were rinsed (three times) with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and permeabilized with either 1% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40. Some cells were immunolabeled without permeabilization. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin or Image-it (Molecular Probes) for 30 min prior to exposure to the primary antibody. Cells were immunolabeled with anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody 2.8 μg/ml and/or anti-PC2 antibody ZMD.28 (0.2 μg/ml). For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After washing, cells were blocked in PBS containing 5% skim milk (1 h) and incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated with either fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies and mounted with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were captured with either a Zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscope or a motorized Olympus IX81 microscope connected to a CCD cooling RT SE6 monochrome camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Final composite images were created using either Adobe PhotoShop 5.5 or Image-Pro Plus 5.0 (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Isolation of Primary Cilia from LLC-PK1 Cells—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as reported (25Raychowdhury M.K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.

Primary cilia were isolated as follows. Cells were grown to confluence for 2-3 weeks. Confluent monolayers were scraped with Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 52 × g. The cell pellet was suspended in a high Ca2+ “deciliation” solution containing (in mm): 112 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 2.4 NaHCO3, 2 HEPES, pH 7.0. Resuspended cells were shaken for 10 min at 4 °C. Ciliary membranes were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 7,700 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 45% sucrose solution in high Ca2+ saline solution and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The sucrose-supernatant interface band was collected and diluted nearly 10-fold and again centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in normal saline solution adjusted to pH 7.0 and supplemented with 2.0 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm sucrose. The resuspended pellet was aliquoted and stored frozen at -80 °C until further use. Protein content was assessed by the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ion channel reconstitution of ciliary membranes was conducted as reported (27González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E.

Briefly, isolated cilia were mixed and sonicated in the lipid mix (27González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc.

Microtubular Components for Functional Assays—α-Tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was prepared in buffer containing (in mm): 2.0 Tris-HCl, 0.5 ATP, 0.2 CaCl2, and 0.5 β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. At the time of the experiment, GTP was added to the solution from a stock solution (100 mm) to reach a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Colchicine (Sigma) was dissolved in water and used at concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 μm in “trans” buffer solution (see below). Paclitaxel (taxol, 1 mg/ml, Sigma) was used at a 15 μm final concentration. Poly-His-tagged human KIF3AC (amino acids 407-702) was expressed in bacterial BL21 (DE3) cells induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The full-length human KIF3A (amino acids 1-702) was stably expressed in MDCK cells and purified using a modified tandem affinity purification. 6Q. Li and X.-Z. Chen, unpublished data. Ion Channel Reconstitution—Lipid bilayers were formed with a mixture of synthetic phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) in n-decane as reported (27González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The lipid mixture was made of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl-choline and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine in a 7:3 ratio. The lipid solution (∼20-25 mg/ml) in n-decane was spread in the aperture of a polystyrene cuvette (CP13-150) of a bilayer chamber (model BCH-13, Warner Instruments Corp.). Both sides of the lipid bilayer were bathed with a solution containing MOPS-KOH, 10 mm, MES-KOH, 10 mm, pH 7.40, and 10-15 μm Ca2+. The final K+ concentration in the solution was ∼15 mm. KCl was further added to the cis compartment to reach 150 mm. Data Acquisition and Analysis—Electrical signals were obtained with a PC501A patch-clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with a 10 gigaohms feedback resistor. Output (voltage) signals were low pass-filtered at 700 Hz (-3 db) with an eight-pole, Bessel type filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Signals were displayed on an oscilloscope. Single channel current tracings were further filtered for display purposes only. Unless otherwise stated, pCLAMP Version 5.5.1 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for data analysis, and Sigmaplot Version 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) was used for statistical analysis and graphics. Single channel conductances were calculated as reported (27González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Most studies were normalized to Npo by dividing the mean current by the maximal single channel current obtained at a given holding potential. Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance was obtained by unpaired Student's test comparison of sample groups of similar size. Average data values were expressed as the mean ± S.E.

Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—To detect protein-protein interactions, the in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, dot blot overlay, yeast two-hybrid assay, and co-immunoprecipitation were conducted as recently described (4Li Q.

Microtubular Regulation of PC2 Function from Primary Cilia— To assess a functional interaction between PC2 and microtubular structures, we explored the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells, where functional PC2 has recently been observed (29Raychowdhury M.K.

PC2 was localized to the primary cilium of confluent LLCPK1 cells (Fig. 1a) and co-localized with acetylated α-tubulin (29Raychowdhury M.K. McLaughlin M. Ramos A. Montalbetti N. Bouley R.

Primary cilia were isolated (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1) (29Raychowdhury M.K. McLaughlin M. Ramos A. Montalbetti N. Bouley R. Ausiello D.A. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol.

PC2-like cation channel activity was observed in 19 out of 19 reconstituted membranes, which were recognized by their large conductance, presence of substates (Fig. 1c), and inhibition by amiloride and anti-PC2 antibodies (29Raychowdhury M.K.

The addition of the microtubular disrupter colchicine (15 μm) inhibited by 93% (from 2.9 ± 0.7 pA to 0.2 ± 0.1 pA, n = 7, p < 0.01) ciliary PC2 channel activity within a minute (Fig. 1, b and c), a time domain under which no spontaneous PC2 inactivation was observed. The addition of α-tubulin (5 mg/ml) plus GTP (500 μm), in contrast, dramatically increased (from 0.4 ± 0.2 pA to 7.9 ± 2.3 pA, n = 4, p < 0.02) ciliary PC2 channel activity (Fig. 2a, top). For these experiments, it was customary to “voltage-inactivate” PC2 function by switching the holding potential to negative values as reported previously (30Xu G.M. González-Perrett S. Essafi M.

The effect of tubulin manifested as an increased open time of the channel in its maximal conductance (Fig. 2b). The addition of GTP alone, however, was without effect (Fig. 2, a-c).FIGURE 2Effect of tubulin and GTP on ciliary PC2. a, ciliary PC2 channel activity was reconstituted in the presence of a KCl chemical gradient, with 150 mm KCl in cis and 15 mm trans compartments, respectively. Channel activity was either spontaneously inactivated (top) or inactivated by applying a negative holding potential (middle) prior to addition of the microtubular components allowed to spontaneously inactivate. Addition of GTP (500 μm) was without effect. However, further addition of tubulin (15 μm) restored channel function to ciliary PC2. Data are representative of seven experiments. Bottom, average channel activity expressed as Npo for experiments where channel activity was voltage-inactivated.

Despite multiple Gα subunits functioning in fungi, only a single Gβ subunit per species has been identified, suggesting that non-conventional G protein signaling exists in this diverse group of eukaryotic organisms. Using the Gα subunit Gpa1 that functions in cAMP signaling as bait in a two-hybrid screen, we have identified a novel Gβ-like/RACK1 protein homolog, Gib2, from the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Gib2 contains a seven WD-40 repeat motif and is predicted to form a seven-bladed β propeller structure characteristic of β transducins. Gib2 is also shown to interact, respectively, with two Gγ subunit homologs, Gpg1 and Gpg2, similar to the conventional Gβ subunit Gpb1. In contrast to Gpb1 whose overexpression promotes mating response, overproduction of Gib2 suppresses defects of gpa1 mutation in both melanization and capsule formation, the phenotypes regulated by cAMP signaling and associated with virulence. Furthermore, depletion of Gib2 by antisense suppression results in a severe growth defect, suggesting that Gib2 is essential. Finally, Gib2 is shown to also physically interact with a downstream target of Gpa1-cAMP signaling, Smg1, and the protein kinase C homolog Pkc1, indicating that Gib2 is also a multifunctional RACK1-like protein.

Similar to other fungi, there exists an elaborate G protein-signaling network in Cryptococcus neoformans that senses the environmental and host-imposed cues to regulate growth, differentiation, and virulence (26Alspaugh J.A.

Previous studies have shown that the Gα subunit Gpa1 functions in a conserved cAMP-dependent signaling pathway and this pathway regulates a variety of cellular functions, including specialized processes such as the production of the antioxidant melanin pigment and the antiphagocytic capsule, two well established virulence factors in this pathogen (30Alspaugh J.A.

In contrast to Gpa1, the Gβ subunit Gpb1 functions to regulate pheromone-responsive mating and haploid differentiation upstream of a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and Gpb1 is not involved in virulence (9Wang P. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The completed C. neoformans genome project has revealed two additional Gα subunits, Gpa2 and Gpa3, whose functions have not yet been elucidated (33Loftus B.J. Fung E. Roncaglia P. Rowley D. Amedeo P.

Science. 2005; 307: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Whereas either Gpa2 or Gpa3 could couple to Gpb1 and a Gγ subunit(s) to form a functional heterotrimeric G protein complex, no Gβ subunit that could couple to Gpa1 in cAMP signaling was found. Thus, answering whether G protein signaling is indeed unique and thereby explaining the presence of a single Gβ subunit would represent a significant achievement in the understanding of G protein signaling in this or other fungal organisms. We now report that a novel Gβ-like/RACK1 protein, Gib2, functions as an atypical Gβ in Gpa1-cAMP signaling. We also show that Gib2 encodes RACK1-like multifunctions, including an essential one in C. neoformans. Our studies suggest that a similar signaling mechanism could exist in other organisms where multiple Gα subunits but only a single Gβ subunit has been found. Strains and Media—C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) MATα strains H99 and F99 (H99 ura5), MATa strains KN99a and F99a (KN99a ura5), var. neoformans (serotype D), MATα strains JEC21 and JEC43 (JEC21 ura5), MATa strains JEC20, JEC34 (JEC20 ura5), BAC20-1 (gpa1 ura5), and a laboratory derived diploid strain, RAS009 (a/α ade2/+ ura5/ura5 lys1/+ lys2/+), were from the laboratory of J.

Standard yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD), yeast minimal medium (YNB), synthetic medium (SD), 10% V8 agar (pH 5.0), 5-fluoroorotic acid, Niger seed agar, and filament agar were prepared as previously described (9Wang P. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Southern, Northern, and Western blotting analysis were performed according to standard protocols (36Sambrook J. Russell D.G. Expression of Cloned Genes in Escherichia coli, A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The total cellular cAMP level was measured as previously described (32D'Souza C.A. Alspaugh J.A. Yue C. Harashima T. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Mol. Cell.

Two-hybrid Interaction—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, GPA1 cDNA was synthesized using primers PW99 (5′-AAGGAATTCATGGGCGGCTGTATGTCT-3′) and PW100 (5′-GAACTGCAGCCTTATAAGATACCAGAGTC-3′) and cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech) at the EcoRI-PstI sites to create pGBKT7-GPA1, expressing the fusion protein GAL4 (BD)-Gpa1. pGBKT7-GPA1 was used to screen a cDNA library of H99 using the yeast AH109 strain. Candidate colonies expressing interacting proteins were screened by plating on SD-Leu-Trp-His-Ade plus X-α-Gal. DNA plasmids were purified from positive yeast cultures, recovered through transformation of Escherichia coli, and inserts were sequenced. The GPA1Q284L was synthesized using primers PW99, PW100, JH12499 (5′-CATTCATATGTTCGATGTCGGTGGACTGAGAAGCGAGAGAAAGAAGTGG-3′), and JH12500 (5′-CCACTTCTTTCTCTCGCTTCTCAGTCCACCGACATCGAACATATGAATG-3′), inserted into pGBKT7, and verified by sequencing. GPA2 (GenBank™ AY357297) and GPA3 (GenBank AY371698) cDNA encoding Gα subunits Gpa2 and Gpa3 were also synthesized with primers PW138 (5′-AAGGATCCCCATGGGCTGCACTCAATCTACC-3′) and PW139 (5′-AACTGCAGGGATTAGAGAAGACCGCAGTC-3′), and PW140 (5′-AAGGATCCCCATGGGCGGATGTATGTCTTCG-3′) and PW141 (5′-AACTGCAGTTATAAGATGGCCATATCTCTC-3′), cloned into pGBKT7 at the BamHI-PstI sites, respectively, and were verified by sequencing. The full-length GIB2 open reading frame encoding Gib2 was identified from the genome of the prototypic strain H99 using the cDNA clone as trace and was obtained by PCR amplification with primers PW168 (5′-AAGAATTCATGGCCGAGCACCTCATGTTCA-3′) and PW169 (5′-AACTGCAGCTAAGCAACGACAGCCCAGACT-3′). Transcription initiation sites were determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen). GIB2 cDNA was also cloned into pGAD424 at the BamHI-PstI sites and pGADT7 at the BamHI site to create plasmids pGAD424-GIB2 and pGADT7-GIB2. pGBKT7-GIB2, pGADT7-GPA1, and pGADT7-GPB1 were constructed similarly. Two putative Gγ subunits, Gpg1 (GenBank AY907677) and Gpg2 (AY907678), were identified from the H99 genome and cDNA was synthesized with primers PW237 (5′-AAGAATTCATGTCCATACGCACAACAAAGG-3′) and PW238 (5′-GACTGCAGTCACATGACGGAACAGCAGACAGCT-3′), and PW241 (5′-AAGAATTCATGTCCCATCTCGCCCCCGCTT-3′) and PW242 (5′-GACTGCAGCTACATGATGGTGCAGCACCCAG-3′). cDNA was then cloned into pGBKT7 at the EcoRI-PstI sites to create pGBKT7-GPG1 and pGBKT7-GPG2. Standard yeast transformation protocols were performed (Clontech). The β-galactosidase activity was also measured as described previously (38Cardenas M.E. Muir R.S. Breuder T. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). pGBKT7-GIB2 was used to screen the H99 cDNA library by the same method described above. Full-length SMG1 cDNA was identified from the H99 data base using positive cDNA as trace and amplified by PCR with primers PW357 (5′-AAGAATTCATGGTTCACGCTGCTACTCACCCC-3′) and PW358 (5′-AAGGATCCTTACTTTGTCTCTTTGTAAAGGTC-3′). The sequence was cloned into pGADT7 at EcoRI-PstI sites, creating pGADT7-SMG1. Protein Structures Modeling—The protein modeling tool SWISS-MODEL was used to model the structures of Gpb1 and Gib2. Gpb1 and the partial Gib2-1 clone containing five C terminus WD repeats were analyzed through the “first approach mode” using bovine Gβ as the model template (39Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), whereas the full-length Gib2 was analyzed by comparative modeling using Schizosaccharomyces pombe Git5 (GenBank AAD09020) and Candida albicans Tup1 (AAB63195) as additional templates (40Steele M.R.

Disruption of the GIB2 Gene—Because of sequence divergence between serotype A and D strains, two serotype-specific gib2::URA5 gene knock-out alleles were constructed by a two-step process. For serotype A, a 1.6-kb region encompassing the GIB2 gene was first amplified from H99 by PCR into two partially overlapping fragments that were each ∼0.8 kb in length. The first fragment was amplified using primers PW166 (5′-CTTCGTTCATCTTTCACTGTTC-3′) and PW226 (5′-TGGAAAAGTTGGTCTCATCCCGGGTCTGTTTCACCCCTCT-3′), and the second fragment was amplified using primers PW225 (5′-AGAGGGGTGAAACAGACCCGGGATGAGACCAACTTTTCCA-3′) and PW167 (5′-ACGAGACGACTCTGATTCTGAC-3′). A SmaI restriction site was incorporated into primers PW225 and PW226, and a second PCR amplification with primers PW166 and PW167 resulted in a 1.6-kb fragment containing the SmaI restriction site. This fragment was cloned into the TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). The URA5 gene was inserted into the SmaI site generating a gib2::URA5 disruption allele. The mutant allele was introduced into the F99 strain by biolistic transformation according to the published protocol (46Toffaletti D.L. Rude T.H. Johnston S.A. Durack D.T. Perfect J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same primer set was used to create the serotype D-specific gib2::URA5 disruption allele using JEC21 as the template. This allele was also transformed into JEC34, JEC43, and RAS009 strains by biolistic transformation. All resulting transformants were screened by PCR. Heterozygous RAS009 transformants (gib2/GIB2) were verified by Southern hybridization analysis before subjecting to ploidy reduction. The smg1::URA5 knock-out allele was generated by overlapping PCR (47Davidson R.C. Blankenship J.R. Kraus P.R. de Jesus Berrios M. Hull C.M. D'Souza C. Wang P. Heitman J.

Overexpression and Suppression of Gib2—The GIB2 gene was inserted into the pCnTel1 vector containing the C. neoformans galactose inducible GAL7 promoter (48Wickes B.L. Edman J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI site, and the resulting construct (sense orientation) was introduced into JEC43, JEC34, and BAC20-1 (gpa1 ura-) strains by biolistic transformation. The BAC20-1 strain was also transformed with the GAL7-GIB2 construct in which the orientation of GIB2 was reversed (antisense construct). Transformants were verified by PCR, diluted serially, and spotted on YPD, YNB, and YNB containing either 2% galactose or 2% glucose. Cells were grown on filament agar to promote conjugation tube formation and on Niger seed agar for melanin pigmentation. Cells grown on Niger seed medium were also collected and stained with India ink to observe the capsule. RNA and protein were extracted from cells first grown overnight in YPD and then re-suspended in minimal YNB medium containing 2% galactose for up to 4 h (36Sambrook J. Russell D.G. Expression of Cloned Genes in Escherichia coli, A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). RNA and protein were also extracted from strains grown continually in YNB containing 2% galactose, or otherwise as stated. The GIB2 transcript and Gib2 protein were detected by Northern and Western blot analysis accordingly (36Sambrook J. Russell D.G. Expression of Cloned Genes in Escherichia coli, A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). A Gib2-specific oligopeptide, PW3 (N′-CPDFDGLSDKARKPE-C′), was synthesized and the affinity purified Gib2-specific antibody was obtained through a commercial source (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Gib2 Essentiality Assessment—A serotype D GIB2/gib2:: URA5 heterozygous transformant, number 65, was incubated on 10% V8 mating agar at room temperature to allow basidiospore production and reversion into the haploid state through meiosis (35Sia R.A. Lengeler K.B. Heitman J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2000; 29: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After 10 days of incubation, basidiospores were dissected using a micromanipulator-equipped microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 40 Tetrad) following the published method (35Sia R.A. Lengeler K.B. Heitman J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2000; 29: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surviving basidiospores were screened for the presence of the GIB2 gene using primers PW166 and PW167. Mating types were determined by genetic cross and verified by PCR with mating type-specific STE20α primers PW394 (5′-GTGTCTCTGGAGGACATACAA-3′) and PW395 (5′-CAGTATCAAACGATGGCCGAACA-3′), and STE20a primers PW360 (5′-AAATGGCTTTCAATGGGTCATCTCTC-3′) and PW361 (5′-AAAAGAAGGTGGATTAGATAGATGAT-3′) (34Wang P.

Protein “Pulldown” Assays—The Gpa1 protein was expressed by an in vitro transcription and translation kit using the TnTT7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The Gib2 protein was produced in E. coli (Rosetta DE3, Novagen) as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein using pET-41a(+) also from Novagen. Expression of the GST fusion protein was induced for 5 h at room temperature and extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycophosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche) and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (36Sambrook J. Russell D.G. Expression of Cloned Genes in Escherichia coli, A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 49Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Gpa1 protein (10 μl) was conditioned in lysis buffer with 10 μm GDP for 1 h at room temperature. Bacterial extracts containing GST-Gib2 were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose resin (Pierce) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed four times with lysis buffer and mixed with Gpa1 in the same lysis buffer plus 10 μm GDP overnight at 4 °C. The gel was precipitated, washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-c-Myc peroxidase conjugates (Roche, number 1814150) and anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz, SC-138). The GPG2 gene was inserted in pET-41a and the GST-Gpg2 fusion protein was expressed similarly as above. Gib2 was also expressed in S. cerevisiae using the pYES2NT vector (Invitrogen). The pYES2NT-GIB2 plasmid was transformed into yeast strain INVS.c1 (Invitrogen), transformants were selected on SD-ura agar plates, and grown in liquid SD-ura medium containing 2% glucose for 24 h at 30 °C. Cells were precipitated, washed with induction medium (SD-ura medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose), and grown in the same medium overnight in a 30 °C shaker, cells were then collected and stored at -80 °C. To extract proteins, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) and homogenized in a Fast-Prep cell disrupter (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA) six times for 40 s at 4 °C, with an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were recovered. For protein purification, cell extracts were incubated with Co2+ affinity resins (TALON, Clontech) for 1.5 h, washed, and proteins eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Proteins were then concentrated, buffer exchanged using a centrifugal filter device (Millipore), and concentration determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). The pulldown assay was carried out similarly as above (Gpa1-Gib2) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After precipitation, resin was washed five times and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-Gib2 or anti-GST antibodies. The pulldown assay between the GST-Gib2 fusion protein and C. neoformans Pkc1 was carried out also similarly in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and the protease inhibitor mixture and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with or without the PKC activator 200 mm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. The Pkc1 protein was expressed and affinity purified from a yeast strain (KD9-3α) containing the pYES2/Gal1::Xpress::PKC1 construct (50Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The anti-Xpress-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Invitrogen (R911-25). Identification of Gib2—The completed genome of C. neoformans var. neoformans has confirmed the presence of three Gα subunits in C. neoformans: Gpa1, Gpa2, and Gpa3. Whereas Gpa1 is known to function in a conserved cAMP signaling pathway, functions of Gpa2 and Gpa3 remain unreported. We have recently identified a regulator of the G protein signaling protein, Crg1, as one of the key regulators for mating and virulence in C. neoformans (51Nielsen K. Cox G.M. Wang P. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J. Heitman J. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 52Wang P. Cutler J.E. King J. Palmer D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and have shown that Crg1 functions as a GTPase activating protein specific to Gpa2. 4L. Li and P. Wang, unpublished observation. To expand our studies on regulators of G protein signaling, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Gpa1 as bait. Among 12 positive clones of 1 × 108 yeast transformants, a single clone was found to contain, in pGADT7-REC, an insert of 743 nucleotides predicted to encode a peptide of 227 amino acids (GenBank AY954369). This clone, designated as GIB2-1 for Gpa1-interacting-β, allowed interaction-dependent growth of host strain AH109 only in the presence of Gpa1, but not Gpa2 or Gpa3 (Fig. 1A). Examination of the peptide sequence encoded by GIB2-1 revealed five WD repeats, and using the sequence to search C. neoformans sequence databases, an open reading frame containing an additional 87 N-terminal amino acids, for a total of 314 amino acids, was identified. The deduced amino acid sequence of Gib2 contains seven WD-40 repeats and shares 78% amino acid identity with the Gβ subunit Gβ1 of shiitake mushroom Lentinula edodes (AAP13580), 72% identity with Neurospora crassa Cpc2 protein (CAA57460), and 70% identity with mammalian Gβ-like/RACK1 protein GNB2L1 (AAH32006). In comparison, Gib2 shares 25% amino acid sequence identity with Gpb1 and 27% with S. pombe Git5 (supplementary Fig. S1). Apparently, Gib2 is more related to Gβ-like/RACK1 proteins than Gβ subunit proteins (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Phylogenetic analysis of Gib2, Gβ, and Gβ-like/RACK1 proteins.

In these studies we show that transcriptional co-repression of the two lipid transfer proteins, liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) and MTP, which cooperatively shunt fatty acids into de novo synthesized glycerolipids and the transfer of lipids into VLDL, respectively, act together to maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis. FAO rat hepatoma cells express L-FABP and MTP and demonstrate the ability to assemble and secrete VLDL. In contrast, L35 cells, derived as a single cell clone from FAO cells, do not express L-FABP or MTP nor do they assemble and secrete VLDL. We used these hepatoma cells to elucidate how a conserved DR1 promoter element present in the promoters of L-FABP and MTP affects transcription, expression, and VLDL production. In FAO cells, the DR1 elements of both L-FABP and MTP promoters are occupied by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), with which PGC-1β activates transcription. In contrast, in L35 cells the DR1 elements of both L-FABP and MTP promoters are occupied by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II, and transcription is diminished. The combined findings indicate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-RXRα and PGC-1β coordinately up-regulate L-FABP and MTP expression, by competing with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II for the DR1 sites in the proximal promoters of each gene. Additional studies show that ablation of L-FABP prevents hepatic steatosis caused by treating mice with an MTP inhibitor. Our findings show that reducing both L-FABP and MTP is an effective means to reduce VLDL secretion without causing hepatic steatosis.

The inability to produce apoB of sufficient size (∼35 kDa) is associated with an inability of both the liver and intestine to assemble and secrete VLDL (18Veniant M.M. Kim E. McCormick S. Boren J. Nielsen L.B. Raabe M. Young S.G. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: S451-S455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, hepatic expression of apoB is constitutive; changes in hepatic secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins are the result of variation in the amount of de novo synthesized apoB that is either secreted or degraded within hepatocytes (1Davis R.A.

In contrast, L35 cells derived as a single cell clone from FAO cells express neither L-FABP nor MTP and lack the ability to assemble and secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins. Our combined data support the proposal that L-FABP and MTP were derived from a common ancestral lipid-binding protein (40Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P. Forafonov F. Bot N. Maclean M.

Retention of the DR1 site in the promoter allowed the distinct lipid transfer functions of L-FABP and MTP to evolve while retaining a common mechanism to ensure that their expression varied concomitantly, and their concerted function is readily adaptable to fatty acid substrate supply.

L35 cells were obtained as described (31Leighton J.K. Joyner J. Zamarripa J. Deines M. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1663-1668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol, with minor modifications (37Kang S. Spann N.J. Hui T.Y. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30478-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One day prior to transfection, L35 and FAO cells (2 × 105) were seeded on 12-well plates. On the day of transfection, cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of promoter/luciferase reporter construct and with 6 ng of pRL-CMV plasmid as an internal control for normalization of L-FABP and MTP promoter activities. The normalized pRL-CMV activities are reported relative to activity of the empty vector from parallel experiments. Varying doses of COUP-TFII expression vector was added as indicated in figure legends. The total DNA concentration for each assay was maintained constant by the addition of empty expression vector pCR 3.1 (Invitrogen). Upon transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h and harvested using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The PPARα and RXR agonists, WY-14,643 (WY) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), respectively (A.G. Scientific, Inc.), were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, 0.15% v/v) and used at working concentrations of 10 μm (WY) and 1 μm (9-cis-RA). Briefly, upon transfection cells were treated for 48 h with agonists or Me2SO alone as indicated. Cells were harvested and promoter activity assayed as described above. Reporter Gene Constructs and Expression Vectors—The wild type and mutant rat MTP reporter vectors (–135/+66) were as described previously (37Kang S. Spann N.J. Hui T.Y. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30478-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To generate the wild type rat L-FABP reporter vector (–141/+66), genomic DNA was isolated and purified from FAO cells using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). The promoter fragment was generated by PCR using the primers with indicated restriction enzyme sites as follows: forward, 5′(KpnI)-GAA CAA ACT TCT GCC GGT ACC ATT CTG ATT TTT A-3′, and reverse, 5′(BglII)-TTC ATG GTG GCA ATG AGA TCT CCT TTC CAC AGC TGA-3′. The promoter fragment was then cloned into KpnI and BglII sites of the empty luciferase reporter vector PGL3Basic (Promega). To generate the mutant L-FABP reporter vector, a specific mutation in the proximal DR1 sequence was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For the in vitro mutagenesis, the wild type rat L-FABP (–141/+66)-luciferase reporter vector was used as the template along with two oligonucleotide primers (mutated bases underlined), each complementary to opposite strands of the vector as follows: forward, 5′-AAT CGA CAA TCA CTG TGC TAT GGC CTA TAT TT-3′; reverse, 5′-AAA TAT AGG CCA TAG CAC AGT GAT TGT CGA TT-3′. The site-specific mutant construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmid for COUP-TFII was a gift from Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts from L35 and FAO cells were prepared as described previously (37Kang S. Spann N.J. Hui T.Y. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30478-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed with the use of a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Subsequently, the high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) was added dropwise with stirring. The resulting suspension was rocked gently for 30 min to allow extraction of nuclear proteins. The nuclei were centrifuged again for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed for 1 h against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—All oligonucleotides used for EMSAs were synthesized by IDT. The following oligonucleotides (sense strands) were used in gel mobility shift assays: MTP-DR1, 5′-TGA CCT TTC CCC TAT AGA TAA ACA CTG TTG-3′; mutant MTP-DR1, 5′-TGT GCT TTC CCC TAT AGA TAA ACA CTG TTG-3′; L-FABP-DR1, 5′-TGA CCT ATG GCC TAT ATT TGA GGA GGA AGA-3′; mutant L-FABP-DR1, 5′-TGT GCT ATG GCC TAT ATT TGA GGA GGA AGA-3′. The probes were prepared by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides and by end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), followed by purification on a G-50 column. For binding reactions, 15 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 3 × 104 cpm probe on ice for 20 min in a total volume of 15 μl of solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 °C, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)). For supershift experiments, 1 μl of specific antibodies were added to preincubated DNA-protein complexes for an additional 20 min on ice. Antibodies against COUP-TFII (sc-6576X), RXRα (sc-553X), and PPARα (sc-9000X) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% native PAGE containing 0.5× TBE buffer. cDNA Synthesis and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from either frozen liver using the Versagene RNA tissue kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.) or from cells using the Versagene RNA cell culture kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.) with on-column DNA removal per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometer at 260 nm. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of total RNA using the Bio-Rad iScript for reverse transcription (BioRad). Specific primers for each gene (supplemental Table 1) were designed using gene sequences from GenBank™. To avoid amplification of genomic DNA, the primers were positioned to span exon junctions. All primers were synthesized by IDT. Real time PCR analysis was performed with the iCycler using SyBr Green supermix according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The reactions were analyzed in triplicate with specific product monitored using meltcurve analysis. The expression data were normalized to an endogenous control, either 18 S ribosomal RNA or acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (36B4). The level of both 18 S RNA and 36B4 was invariable among samples of all experiments. The relative expression levels were calculated according to the formula 2–ΔCt, where ΔCt is the difference in threshold cycle (Ct) values between the target and either the 18 S or 36B4 endogenous control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay and Relative Quantitation—Cells were cultured in complete medium in 150-mm dishes until ≈70–80% confluent. Where indicated the agonists WY (10 μm) and 9-cis-RA (1 μm) were added to cell culture medium for 48 h prior to harvesting. The cells were then fixed by the addition of 280 μl of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma) to 10 ml of culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C, harvested, and processed for immunoprecipitation using the ChIP-IT shearing kit (Active Motif) and ChIP-IT chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif) for chromatin immunoprecipitation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immune complexes were eluted, reverse cross-linked using 5 m NaCl at 65 °C, treated with proteinase K, and purified using mini-columns provided with ChIP-IT kit. Specific genomic DNA fragments from immunoprecipitated samples and inputs were quantitated by real time PCR with SyBr Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) as indicated above. As a control for region selectivity of immunoprecipitation-specific enrichment differences, amounts of noncoding distal untranslated regions were determined for each sample. The antibodies used were against COUP-TFII (a gift from Dr. S. Karathanasis), PPARα (sc-9000X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and control IgG (Active Motif). Primer sets were designed to amplify the following rat genomic DNA regions: MTP-DR1 (forward, 5′-TAG TGA GCC CTT CCA TGA AC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAG AAT CTG CGA CAA CAG TG-3′), L-FABP-DR1 (forward, 5′-GAG TTA ATG TTT GAT CCT GGC C-3′; reverse, 5′-CCA CCC ACT GTT GGC TAT TTT-3′); and L-FABP 3′-untranslated region (forward, 5′-GTC TTC CGC TAC CTA AGA GG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG TCA TCT GAC CAG CTC TC-3′). All values were normalized to values from both input DNA and immunoprecipitations with IgG using the ΔΔCt method. Briefly, for every promoter studied, a ΔCt value was calculated for each sample by subtracting the Ct value for the input DNA from the Ct value obtained for the immunoprecipitated sample. A ΔΔCt value was then calculated by subtracting the ΔCt value for the sample immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody (PPARα or COUP-TFII) from the ΔCt value for the corresponding sample immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (IgG). Fold differences (factor-specific ChIP relative to control IgG ChIP) were then determined by raising 2 to the ΔΔCt power. RNA Interference—Knockdown of PPARα in FAO cells was achieved by using the Smartpool siRNA (Dharmacon) specific for rat PPARα. The sequence for siRNA directed against rat PGC-1β was selected as described previously (41Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 120: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The rat PGC-1β siRNA (sense sequence, 5′-GAT ATC CTC TGT GAT GTT A-3′) was synthesized by Dharmacon as a 21-nucleotide duplex, using option A4, with 3′-dinucleotide (TT) overhangs. The species-specific siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA number 1 (Dharmacon) was utilized as a negative control sequence to monitor nonspecific targeting. Cells were plated in 12-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 104/well 24 h prior to the experiment. Prior to transfection, siRNAs were resuspended in 1× siRNA buffer (Dharmacon) to a concentration of 20 μm. All siRNAs were transfected into FAO cells using the Dharma-FECT™ 4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FAO cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 48–72 h at working concentrations of 100 nm as indicated in the figure legends. For the knockdown of PGC-1β, cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 72 h; cells were exposed to the agonists WY-14,643 (10 μm) and 9-cis-RA (1 μm) 24 h post-transfection and treated for 48 h prior to harvesting. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real time PCR expression analyses were performed as described above. Animal Studies—Male PPARα–/– mice and age-matched WT littermates (on SV/129 background) were fed a standard chow diet, supplemented with either the PPARα agonist GW-7647 (2.5 mg/kg/day) or equivalent amount of solvent vehicle (Me2SO), for 7 weeks. All animals had ad libitum access to water. Mice were weighed every 2 weeks, and drug intake was adjusted according to mean weight. Upon end of treatment the animals were sacrificed; the liver was isolated, and total RNA was extracted using Versagene RNA tissue kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.). First-strand cDNA synthesis and real time PCR expression analyses were performed as described above. For MTP inhibitor (8aR) studies, male L-FABP–/– mice and age-matched WT controls (C57BL/6) were fed a standard chow diet and then administered the 8aR compound orally each day for 7 days at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. At the end of treatment the animals were sacrificed the plasma and livers were isolated, and the various hepatic and plasma lipid levels were determined by using commercially available kits as described previously (9Newberry E.P.

Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Livers were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, and protein concentration was determined. 300 μl of homogenate was extracted with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 0.5 ml of 0.1% sulfuric acid. An aliquot of the organic phase was collected, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 2% Triton X-100. Hepatic free fatty acids, triglyceride, and cholesterol content were determined using commercially available kits as described previously (9Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S. Han X. Buhman K.K. Luo J. Gross R.W. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51664-51672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Data were normalized for differences in protein concentration. Adenovirus Experiment—Adenoviral vectors expressing either PGC-1β (Ad-PGC-1β) or GFP (Ad-GFP) were generous gifts from Dr. B. Spiegelman. L35 cells were infected with either the Ad-PGC-1β or Ad-GFP for 2 h in serum-free media and then treated for 48 h with the complete media with the agonists WY-14,643 (10 μm) and 9-cis-RA (1 μm). Cells were infected ∼75–85% as determined by GFP expression. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real time PCR expression analyses were performed as described above. Immunoprecipitation of Secreted ApoB—Secreted apoB was immunoprecipitated as described previously (23Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hui T.Y. Olivier L.M. Kang S. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 785-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, L35 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes in the absence or presence of WY-14,643 (10 μm) and 9-cis-RA (1 μm) for 72 h. Cells were then switched to methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h and then labeled with 3 ml of [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Media were collected and incubated with polyclonal anti-apoB antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the mixture was further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate complex was washed three times with TETN buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) and once with phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel by electrophoresis. Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography.

In recent years, interest in COX-2 has significantly increased since it has been a target for the development of specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report that COX-2 expression is up-regulated in phorbol ester (phorbol myristate acetate, PMA)-differentiated human U937 macrophage-like cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas COX-1 is not up-regulated. We show that the LPS-induced up-regulation of COX-2 depends on the activity of the Mg+2-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP-1). Inhibition of PAP-1 by bromoenol lactone, propranolol, or ethanol resulted in a decrease in LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA transcript production, COX-2 protein expression, and prostaglandin E2 release from U937 macrophages. To ensure that these results did not arise because of PMA treatment of the U937 cells, similar experiments were conducted with the P388D1 cell line, which does not require PMA differentiation. LPS increased the levels of endogenous cellular diacylglycerol (DAG) within 2 min of stimulation. This increase was observed to be sensitive to the PAP-1 inhibitors. Furthermore, phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity assays showed that the bromoenol lactone-sensitive PAP-1 activity was translocated from the cytosolic fraction to the membrane fraction within 2 min of LPS exposure. Finally, DAG add-back experiments demonstrate that LPS-induced COX-2 expression is enhanced by the addition of exogenous DAG.

Bacterial sepsis and septic shock result from the overproduction of inflammatory mediators as a consequence of the interaction of the immune system with bacterial cell components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 3The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PG, prostaglandin; PLA2, phospholipase A2; AA, arachidonic acid; COX-1, -2, cyclooxygenase 1 and 2; PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 1; LPP, lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; BEL, bromoenol lactone; PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PKC, protein kinase C; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluoro-phosphonate; PLD, phospholipase D. (1Van Amersfoort E.S. Van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 379-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). LPS-activated macrophages produce and release a host of cytokines and eicosanoids in response to inflammatory stimulation, including prostaglandins (PGs). PGs are involved in a number of physiological processes, including inflammation, pain, and vascular permeability while also acting as major contributors of endotoxic shock (2Bos C.L. Richel D.J. Ritsema T. Peppelenbosch M.P. Versteeg H.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1187-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) comprises a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond in phospholipids, producing free fatty acid and lysophospholipid (3Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). PLA2s regulate inflammation and intracellular signal transduction cascades by liberating arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. The AA that is released is subsequently metabolized by COX, producing prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). There are two known isoforms of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is usually a constitutively expressed enzyme that primarily plays a housekeeping role and has been implicated in a number of physiological functions, including platelet aggregation and parturition (4Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), whereas COX-2 is usually not expressed under basal conditions in macrophages but is highly inducible by a number of pro-inflammatory agonists, such as LPS, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (5Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Murakami M. Kudo I. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 3-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition to inflammation, COX-2 expression is necessary for uterine contractions during the birthing process and has been further implicated in a number of pathological conditions, including fever, pain, and cancer (4Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 6Murakami M. Kudo I. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 3-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The PGH2 produced by COX is further metabolized by specific downstream enzymes into prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes, which are then subsequently secreted (7Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). When released, eicosanoids function as ligands in receptor-specific autocrine and paracrine signal transduction pathways leading to a diverse range of physiological effects (8Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). Two forms of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) have been identified, a magnesium-independent transmembrane isoform, lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase (LPP), and a cytosolic magnesium-dependent isoform that translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum when it hydrolyzes its substrate, known as phosphatidic acid phophohydrolase-1 (PAP-1). LPP is known to hydrolyze a host of substrates besides phosphatidic acid, including lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and ceramide 1-phosphate, whereas PAP-1 has been observed to have a preference for phosphatidic acid as substrate (9Kai M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PAP-1 enzymatic activity requires magnesium and is sensitive to the inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), propranolol, and bromoenol lactone (BEL), whereas LPP has no divalent cation requirements for activity and is not inhibited by these agents (11Jamal Z.

Agonist stimulation has been previously shown to induce the translocation of PAP-1 to the endoplasmic reticulum where it hydrolyzes phosphatidic acid (PA) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) (17Nanjundan M. Possmayer F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L1-L23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented that both the substrate and product of PAP-1, PA, and DAG, respectively, may be essential signaling molecules in normal macrophage function (17Nanjundan M. Possmayer F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L1-L23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee Y.N. Lee H.Y. Kang H.K. Kwak J.Y. Bae Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, George Carman had succeeded in the partial purification and characterization of PAP-1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Lin Y.P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lin Y.P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 166-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, his laboratory has sequenced and cloned S. cerevisiae-derived PAP-1, identifying it as the homologue of mammalian Lipin 1, which has been associated with adipocyte development (21Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In the present work, we will demonstrate that PAP-1 is necessary for the LPS-induced expression of COX-2 in the human U937 cell line. The human U937 macrophage-like cell line has been a widely characterized model of the mammalian cellular response to various inflammatory stimuli. It has been shown that U937 cells respond to the presence of LPS with a marked increase in the rate of cellular AA metabolism and cytokine release into the extracellular space (22Balboa M.A. Perez R. Balsinde J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

Cell Culture and Stimulation Protocol—The normal growth medium of the U937 cells contained RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For experiments the cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates (Corning Inc.), and differentiation was initiated by the addition of PMA into the cellular medium at a final concentration of 100 nm and allowed to proceed for 48 h (23Hass R. Bartels H. Topley N. Hadam M. Kohler L. Goppelt-Strube M. Resch K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 282-293PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed once and incubated in normal growth medium for an additional 24 h prior to the addition of LPS (1 μg/ml). When inhibitors were used, they were added to the medium 30 min before LPS was added. When DAG was added to the cells, it was added immediately after the addition of the LPS. The DAG was initially dissolved in Me2SO, and then further diluted into cellular medium contained prior to being dispensed into the medium of the cultured cells. Control cells were administered equivalent concentrations of Me2SO. Cell viability was assessed visually by the Trypan Blue Dye exclusion assay (Invitrogen) and by using the CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, WI). P388D1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 90% air and 10% CO2 IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids. Cells were plated at a confluency 106/well in 12-well tissue culture plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and then used for experiments the following day. All experiments were conducted in serum-free IMDM medium. Preparation of RNA and Reverse Transcription—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), as described by the manufacturer's procedure. Any remaining DNA in the extract was removed with the DNA-free kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). The cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's printed protocol. Oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) were used during the reaction to produce cDNA. The remaining RNA was removed from the cDNA by incubating the samples with 20 units of RNase H from Invitrogen at 37 °C for 20 min. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Primers used for the PCR are as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward primer (5′-CCACCCAGAAGACTGTGGAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TTCAGCTCAGGGATGACCTT-3′); Group IVA PLA2 forward primer (5′-ACTGCACAATGCCCTTTACC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGGGAGCCATAAAAGTACCA-3′); COX-1 forward primer (5′-CAGTGGCTCGTATCCCAAAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AGGCACAGATTCAGGGAATG-3′); and COX-2 forward primer (5′-CAGCACTTCACGCATCAGTT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGCAGTTTACGCTGTCTAGC-3′). All of the primers were selected using the Primer 3 software (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) and synthesized by Genset Corp. (La Jolla, CA). All primers were tested by conventional PCR and shown to give only one product visually on 4% agarose gels. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on the ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix detection as described in the manufacturer's procedure. The quantitative PCR consisted of an initial hold at 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The amount of template cDNA used for each sample was 10 ng and 100 nm primer. Gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. PGE2 Assay—The cellular media was cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and then the PGE2 release was quantitated using a monoclonal PGE2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and scraped free with a rubber policeman in 75 μl of Complete Mini protease mixture solution (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined and normalized using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. 35 μg of total protein was loaded onto 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. When blotting for the Group IVA PLA2 the membrane was blocked with 5% milk protein in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h before being probed with a Group IVA PLA2 specific antibody overnight. The membrane was then washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 before addition of a rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) for 1 h. The membrane was then washed three additional times and then developed using the Western Lightning ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). When blotting for COX-2 the membrane was blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 1% casein (Vector, Burlingame, CA) in Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h before being probed with a COX-2 specific antibody overnight. The membrane was then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 before the addition of a rabbit biotinylated IgG (Vector) secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was again washed three times and exposed to a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Vector) for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three additional times and then developed using the Western Lightning ECL kit. When blotting for the Lipin 1, 2, or 3 proteins the membrane was blocked with 5% milk protein in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h before being probed with a specific Lipin 1, 2, or 3 antibody (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX) overnight. The membrane was then washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 before addition of a rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Alpha Diagnostic) for 1 h. The membrane was then washed three additional times and then developed using the Western Lightning ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). PA Phosphohydrolase Activity Assay—PA phosphohydrolase activity was determined from U937 and P388D1 cellular lysates according to the method of Day and Yeaman (14Day C.P. Yeaman S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as modified by Balboa et al. (25Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11738-11740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The substrate [14C]glycerol-labeled PA was presented as mixed micelles with Triton X-100 at a detergent/phospholipids molar ratio of 10:1. Assays were conducted at 37 °C for 1 h. The assay mixture contained 100 μm PA substrate (0.025 μCi/assay), 1 mm Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the lysate to a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a chloroform/methanol system (60:40) to the reaction mixture. The organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase, placed into fresh microcentrifuge tubes, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The subsequent pellet was reconstituted in 20 μlof the (60:40) chloroform/methanol system, the resulting [14C]PA and [14C]DAG were then separated by TLC using an n-hexane/ether/water mixture (70:30:1). The TLC plate was then developed in an iodination chamber, and the DAG and PA spots were scraped and subsequently quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Additionally, to distinguish between the PAP-1 and LPP activities, the PAP-1-specific inhibitor, NEM, was added (8 mm) for a period of 10 min prior to addition of the substrate (11Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When PAP-1 assays were performed on the cytosolic or membrane fraction of lysates, lysate preparations were centrifuged at a speed of 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the cytosolic and membrane fractions were then separated. When quantifying the endogenous production of DAG, cells were incubated in 10% fetal calf serum RPMI medium supplemented with [9–10-3H]palmitic acid (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h, the cells were washed, and serum-free media was added for 1 h prior to beginning the experiment. Lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The extraction solution was placed into fresh microcentrifuge tubes and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The resulting pellet was reconstituted in 20 μl of the (60:40) chloroform/methanol system, and the resulting [3H]DAG was separated by TLC using n-hexane/ether/water (70:30:1). The TLC plate was then developed in an iodination chamber, and the DAG and PA spots were scraped and subsequently quantified by liquid scintillation counting. LPS Up-regulates Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression and Induces PGE2 Production in a Time-dependent Manner—Because LPS-induced PGE2 release is known to be dependent on the function of the PLA2 and COX enzymes, we measured their expression over time with LPS stimulation to determine whether changes in their levels are a mechanism for controlling PGE2 production. As has been previously described in the U937 cells (27Jiang Y.J. Lu B. Choy P.C. Hatch G.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 246: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the levels of COX-2 mRNA transcript increased dramatically during the first 4 h of LPS stimulation, reaching maximal levels at 4 h, and then waning afterward (Fig. 1A). This result is corroborated by the LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression profile, in which the protein was undetectable until 2 h after LPS stimulation and then increased steadily until 20 h (Fig. 1B). Neither COX-1 nor Group IVA PLA2 were up-regulated on the protein or messenger RNA levels in response to the addition of 1 μg/ml LPS agonist (data not shown). Furthermore, 1 μg/ml LPS increased PGE2 release from U937 macrophages in a time-dependent manner. The PGE2 release started between 2 and 4 h after LPS stimulation and continued to increase with time for 20 h, as shown in Fig. 1C. There was no change in PGE2 production in control cells that were not exposed to LPS. Inhibition of LPS-induced PGE2 Production and COX-2 Expression by BEL—U937 cells that had been preincubated with 25 μm BEL, a dual Group VI PLA2/PAP-1 inhibitor, prior to the addition of LPS had reduced COX-2 mRNA transcript levels relative to uninhibited cells (Fig. 2A). The inhibition by BEL was observed to affect not only the levels of COX-2 transcript, but also the amount of COX-2 protein being expressed (Fig. 2B) and the amount of PGE2 being produced by the cells in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 2C). Because the BEL inhibitor is known to inhibit not only PAP-1, but also Group VI PLA2, it was imperative to discern which enzyme was responsible for the aforementioned phenomena. To clarify this issue, the chemical inhibitor MAFP, which inhibits the function of Group VI PLA2 but not PAP-1, was added to cell experiments as had been done with the BEL inhibitor. As can be seen in Fig. 2 (A and B), MAFP had no effect on the induction of COX-2, at both the mRNA transcript and protein levels. It should be noted that PGE2 release could not be determined for experiments conducted with MAFP, because addition of MAFP to the immunoassay gives a false-positive measurement. To ensure that PAP-1 is present in this cell line, U937 cell lysates were checked for the presence of Lipin 1 by Western blot. Lipin 1 is reported to run at a molecular mass of 140 kDa on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (28Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and we observed a band at this molecular size (Fig. 2D). Additionally, U937 cell lysates were checked for the presence of the other two reported Lipin isoforms, Lipin 2 and Lipin 3 (28Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), although neither protein was detected by Western blot (data not shown). Inhibition of LPS-induced PGE2 Production and COX-2 Expression by Propranolol, Ethanol, and n-Butanol—To further confirm the role of PAP-1 in the LPS-induced up-regulation of COX-2 and subsequent release of PGE2, U937 cells were cultured in the presence of another known inhibitor of PAP-1, propranolol. Addition of 150 μm propranolol to cells resulted in the reduction of LPS-induced COX-2 transcript levels by 60% (Fig. 3A), an equally pronounced reduction of COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 3B), and near total abatement of PGE2 release into the media (Fig. 3C). Addition of short chain, primary alcohols into the media results in their uptake by the cultured cells and subsequent participation in the PLD-mediated transesterification of phospholipids, resulting in the production of the respective phosphatidylalcohols, which are not PAP-1 substrates (29Pai J.K. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By competing with water, which is the normal PLD-mediated reaction nucleophile, the primary alcohol inhibits PAP-1 cellular activity by reducing the availability of the substrate phosphatidic acid. Cells were preincubated for 30 min in the presence of 2% (v/v) ethanol, 0.6% n-butanol, and 0.6% t-butanol, prior to the addition of LPS. The purpose of the tertiary alcohol, t-butanol, is to serve as a negative control, because it is not incorporated in PLD-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis due to steric hindrance. Fig. 4A demonstrates that the addition of ethanol or n-butanol to the supernatant resulted in a 50% reduction of COX-2 mRNA transcript levels in response to LPS stimulation. Importantly, t-butanol had no effect on the level of LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA transcript levels relative to that of the uninhibited cells. The LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression data corroborated the mRNA transcript results, as both ethanol and n-butanol were observed to reduce COX-2 protein expression by ∼50% while t-butanol had no effect (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the release of PGE2 from LPS-stimulated macrophages was blocked in cells in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas n-butanol reduced PGE release comparably to that of 0.5% ethanol and t-butanol had no effect (Fig. 4C). Doses higher than 0.6% v/v of butanol were not utilized in cellular experiments due to lethal cytotoxicity to the macrophages at elevated concentrations. DAG Production and PAP-1 Activity Are Reduced in PAP-1-inhibited U937 Cells—To ensure that the chemical inhibitors had the desired effect of inhibiting PAP-1 activity in the cultured U937 cells, cells were tritium-radiolabeled with palmitic acid to study the production of endogenous DAG in response to LPS, in the presence and absence of BEL. DAG production increased by 20% to 50% within the first 2 min of LPS stimulation, and then gradually returned to basal levels over 30 min following LPS stimulation (Fig. 5A). However, the addition of BEL to cells resulted in a dramatic reduction of the DAG spike 2 min after LPS stimulation, while having an insignificant effect on the basal DAG levels. These results suggest that the LPS-induced DAG spike can be attributed to the BEL-sensitive PAP-1, whereas the basal DAG level is not due to the activity of PAP-1. Presumably, this pool of DAG arises as a result of LPP activity associated with the basal metabolism of the cell or de novo DAG synthesis. To confirm that the LPS-induced increase in DAG was due to PAP-1 activity, in vitro PAP assays of the cytosolic component of cellular lysates were performed to determine whether the levels of PAP-1 activity change after LPS stimulation. The PAP in vitro assay measures total PAP activity, which is the sum of all DAG produced from PA hydrolysis by PA-dephosphorylating enzymes, including PAP-1 and LPP. Furthermore, in an effort to distinguish PAP-1 activity from the total PAP activity, we have taken advantage of the fact that PAP-1 requires the presence of Mg+2 for full enzymatic activity and is inhibited by the addition of the chemical inhibitors BEL and NEM. It is known that LPP is a transmembrane protein localized to the membrane fraction of the cellular lysate; therefore, the only remaining PA-dephosphorylating enzyme present in the cytosolic component of the cellular lysate is PAP-1. Cells that had been stimulated with LPS were subsequently lysed, and the cytosolic and membrane components were separated and isolated by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). Because PAP-1 translocates from the cytosol to phospholipid membrane surfaces when it becomes activated, it was essential to first identify which time point following the addition of LPS agonist would yield the most pronounced change in PAP-1 activity. In Fig. 5B, the change in total PAP-1 activity that was observed in the cytosolic fraction of the cell lysate in response to the addition of LPS is shown relative to basal levels in the cytosolic fraction over the course of 30 min. The amount of total cytosolic PAP activity decreased by ∼50% with LPS stimulation relative to basal activity during the first 2 min of stimulation and was not observed to return to basal activity levels over the 30-min time course of the experiment. Because 2 min of LPS stimulation was observed to yield the most dramatic DAG production and was seen to yield PAP-1 translocation, it was chosen as the representative time point from which to study chemical inhibition of PAP-1 activity in Fig. 5C. To confirm that the"
https://openalex.org/W2076413581,"We previously showed that mice with a null mutation in syndecan-1 (Sdc1; CD138) were resistant to Wnt1-induced mammary tumor initiation. The absence of Sdc1 inhibited the increase in the mammary stem cell fraction that is characteristic of preneoplasia in this model. As the tumor precursor cells are recruited from the stem/progenitor cell compartment, tumor development was also inhibited (Liu et al., 2004; PNAS 101, 4158). Although Sdc1-/- mice are grossly normal, they are systemically smaller, suggesting that developmental abnormalities may extend further than their mammary glands. We have therefore evaluated the multi-organ response of Sdc1-/- mice to carcinogen-induced tumor development (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, DMBA), and find these mice to be resistant to tumorigenesis in all the predominant carcinogen-susceptible lineages. Thus, Sdc1-/- mice administered DMBA during juvenile development are resistant not only to epithelial tumors, including liver (60-80%) and lung tumors (C57BL6 mice, 60-80%), but also to lymphoma (over 70%, depending upon strain and carcinogen dose). We demonstrate that CD138 is expressed (heterogeneously) in the hematopoietic stem cell fraction (and not only in pre-B and plasma cells), and that tumors arise in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Furthermore, carcinogen-induced mammary tumors are bilineal, implying a bipotent precursor cell. Both observations imply that the DMBA-induced tumor precursor cells are drawn from the stem/progenitor fraction, and we suggest that pathogenic activation of these cells could be abnormal in Sdc1-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W2078130872,"RIZ1 is a histone methyltransferase whose expression and activity are reduced in many cancers. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), blastic transformation is associated with loss of heterozygosity in the region where RIZ1 is located and with decreased RIZ1 expression. Forced RIZ1 expression in model CML blast crisis (BC) cell lines decreases proliferation, increases apoptosis and enhances differentiation. We characterized molecular mechanisms that may contribute to potential CML tumor suppressor properties of RIZ1. Several RIZ1-regulated genes involved in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling were identified using cDNA microarrays. RIZ1 was shown to associate with promoter regions of IGF-1 and to increase histone H3 lysine 9 methylation using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. IGF-1-blocking antibody was used to demonstrate the importance of autocrine IGF-1 signaling in CML-BC cell line viability. Forced RIZ1 expression in CML-BC cell lines decreases IGF-1 receptor activation and activation of downstream signaling components extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of inhibiting IGF-1 pathway in the acute phase of CML."
https://openalex.org/W1982742890,"The C1 domain zinc finger structure is highly conserved among the protein kinase C (PKC) superfamily members. As the interaction site for the second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and for the phorbol esters, the C1 domain has been an important target for developing selective ligands for different PKC isoforms. However, the C1 domains of the atypical PKC members are DAG/phorbol ester-insensitive. Compared with the DAG/phorbol ester-sensitive C1 domains, the rim of the binding cleft of the atypical PKC C1 domains possesses four additional positively charged arginine residues (at positions 7, 10, 11, and 20). In this study, we showed that mutation to arginines of the four corresponding sites in the C1b domain of PKCδ abolished its high potency for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in vitro, with only marginal remaining activity for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in vivo. We also demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that the loss of potency to ligands was cumulative with the introduction of the arginine residues along the rim of the binding cavity rather than the consequence of loss of a single, specific residue. Computer modeling reveals that these arginine residues reduce access of ligands to the binding cleft and change the electrostatic profile of the C1 domain surface, whereas the basic structure of the binding cleft is still maintained. Finally, mutation of the four arginine residues of the atypical PKC C1 domains to the corresponding residues in the δC1b domain conferred response to phorbol ester. We speculate that the arginine residues of the C1 domain of atypical PKCs may provide an opportunity for the design of ligands selective for the atypical PKCs.

Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The family is divided into three subfamilies: 1) the conventional PKCs (cPKCs) α, β I, β II, and γ; 2) the novel PKCs (nPKCs) δ, ϵ, η, and θ; and 3) the atypical PKCs (aPKCs) ζ and ι/λ (human PKCι and mouse PKCλ are orthologs). These three subfamilies share a common requirement for phospholipids for their kinase activity but differ in their dependence on other activators (3Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The cPKCs (α, β I, β II, and γ) meet the original definition of PKC as a Ca2+ and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase. Indeed, they require phosphatidylserine (PS), Ca2+, and diacylglycerol (DAG) (or phorbol esters) for their activation. The nPKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) require only DAG/phorbol ester and PS. The activation of aPKCs (ζ and ι/λ) is much different from that of the cPKCs and nPKCs. They require only PS but not Ca2+ and DAG/phorbol ester (4Violin J.D. Newton A.C. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As an important second messenger, DAG plays the major role in transducing cellular signals to the PKC molecules (5Brose N. Rosenmund C. Rettig J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A highly conserved cysteine-rich motif (the so-called “C1 domain”) in the regulatory region of the PKCs acts as the specific receptor for the DAG signal (6Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Hall C. Lim L. Leung T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 169-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All of the three PKC subfamilies contain this C1 domain. The cPKCs and nPKCs have two tandem C1 domains in their N termini, the C1a and C1b domains. They both showed high binding affinities for DAG or phorbol esters in vitro as isolated fragments (8Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Slater S.J. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Larkin J.D. Taddeo F.J. Yeager M.D. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4627-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, although the aPKCs, PKCζ as well as PKCι/λ, also possess a C1 domain at their N termini, these atypical C1 domains are not sensitive to either DAG or phorbol esters (10Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4799-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation mechanisms for the cPKCs and nPKCs have been well studied. Briefly, ligand binding to many receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors leads to phospholipase C activation and the consequent production of the DAG second messenger at the plasma membrane. The DAG binds to the C1 domains of cPKC and nPKC, inducing the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane (3Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The C1-DAG interaction and membrane association trigger a conformational change of the PKC molecule, leading to the release of the pseudosubstrate domain from the catalytic site and the final activation of the enzyme. The activation of the aPKCs also involves the release of the pseudosubstrate domain from the catalytic site of the kinase domain (11Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Ohno S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how their activation process is regulated is not clear. Likewise, little is known about whether the C1 domain plays any role in the activation of the aPKCs. Among its multiple roles in various physiological processes, the important role of the PKC family in tumorigenesis has attracted much attention (14Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Kazanietz M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Many recent studies have found that the atypical PKCs are essentially involved in tumorigenesis. For example, PKCι has recently been found overexpressed in human non-small cell lung cancer cells (16Regala R.P. Weems C. Jamieson L. Copland J.A. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

It has also been proposed to be an attractive target to develop novel therapeutics against colon cancer (20Murray N.R. Jamieson L. Yu W. Zhang J. Gokmen-Polar Y. Sier D. Anastasiadis P. Gatalica Z.

PKCζ has been reported recently to be associated with chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells (22Sun R. Gao P. Chen L. Ma D. Wang J. Oppenheim J.J. Zhang N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The atypical PKC is thus viewed as a new promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. An underlying problem with the inhibition of PKC kinase activity as a therapeutic strategy is achievement of sufficient selectivity among serine/threonine-specific protein kinases with homologous catalytic sites. A complementary strategy that we are pursuing has therefore been to design modulators targeted to the C1 domains (23Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using DAG derivatives in which the flexibility of the structure has been constrained to reduce the entropic loss due to binding, we have actually developed a novel DAG lactone derivative, 130C037, which displayed marked selectivity among the recombinant C1a and C1b domains of PKCα and -δ as well as substantial selectivity for RasGRP (another family of the C1 domain-containing proteins) relative to PKCα (24Pu Y.

By combining the techniques of computational chemistry and molecular biology, we have also successfully modified the structure of some potent DAG lactones and obtained novel compounds (named dioxolanes), which gained an additional point of contact in their binding with the C1b domain of PKCδ. 4Y.

These previous studies provide encouraging evidence that by manipulating the interactions between the C1 domains and the ligands, we might be able to design DAG derivative compounds that can specifically recognize different C1 domains of different PKC isoforms. The atypical C1 domains are DAG/phorbol ester-insensitive. Although the sequence identity between the PKCδ C1b domain and the atypical C1 domain of PKCζ is only 32%, we can feel confident that these domains adopt the same fold, because the zinc-binding residues (His1, Cys14, Cys17, Cys31, Cys34, His39, Cys42, and Cys50) are conserved, as are critical structural residues Phe3, Gln27, and Val38. Many of the ligand binding residues are also conserved: Trp22, Gly23, and Leu24, along with a conservative substitution of isoleucine for leucine at position 21 (25Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All of the PKC C1 domains carry a net positive charge, but an interesting characteristic of the atypical C1 domains is that they have an overall positive charge of +9, which is more than twice the average charge of the conventional and novel C1 domains. This is mainly due to four extra arginine residues that line the edges of the binding site: Arg7, Arg10, Arg11, and Arg20. No charged residues are found at these positions in the conventional or novel C1 domains. Do these arginine residues interfere with ligand binding? Can we take advantage of these positively charged arginine residues to design compounds that form specific contacts with them? In this study, using the C1b domain of PKCδ as a template, we mutated the residues Asn7, Ser10, Pro11, and Leu20 in the binding cleft into arginines corresponding to those in the atypical C1 domains. We wanted to study the roles of these arginine residues in phorbol ester binding both in vivo and in vitro, to broaden our general understanding of ligand-C1 domain interactions as well as to develop insights into the unique properties of the C1 domains of the atypical PKCs. We expect that with these atypical C1-like mutants, which still maintain some binding activity for the phorbol esters, we will be able to screen DAG analogue compounds that have been specifically designed for interaction with the arginine residues of the atypical PKC C1 domains. Materials—[20-3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer. PDBu and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). PS and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Reagents for purification of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were obtained from Pierce. Cell culture medium and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The LB broth and agents used for bacteria culture were from K. D. Medical, Inc. (Columbia, MD). The DNA primers were obtained from Invitrogen. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the C1b Domain of PKCδ—Site-directed mutagenesis of the Asn7, Ser10, Pro11, and Leu20 residues was performed in both the GST-δC1b and GFP-δC1b fusion proteins using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The δC1b domain containing-pGEX plasmid and pEGFP plasmid, which had been constructed previously in this laboratory (24Pu Y. Perry N.A. Yang D. Lewin N.E. Kedei N. Braun D.C. Choi S.H. Blumberg P.M.

For generation of mutants at multiple sites, the mutagenesis was performed stepwise. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Minicore, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Construction of the GFP-fused C1 Domains of PKCζ and PKCι—The C1 domains of the atypical PKCζ and -ι were generated by PCR using the Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNA clones of human PKCζ and -ι (obtained from OriGene (Rockville, MD)) were used as the templates. The blunt-ended PCR products were ligated into a pCR®-Blunt vector using the Zero Blunt® PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). The pCR®-Blunt vector was digested with EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) to produce adhesive ends of the C1 fragments. These fragments were then ligated into the appropriate pEGFP vectors (Clontech) using the EcoRI restriction sites with the sequence of the insert in the intended reading frame. The DNA sequence of the constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the C1 Domains of PKCζ and PKCι—Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate the back mutants of the atypical C1 domains of PKCζ and -ι. Briefly, the arginine residues at positions 7, 10, 11, and 20 were mutated back to the corresponding residues of Asn7, Ser10, Pro11, and Leu20, as in the binding cleft of the δC1b domain. The mutagenesis was performed in the GFP-tagged PKCζ and -ι C1 domains using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit. For generation of the quadruple back mutants at multiple sites, the mutagenesis was performed stepwise. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins from Escherichia coli—The recombinant plasmids containing the arginine mutants of the GST-δC1b domains were expressed and purified from BL-21 E. coli as described elsewhere (24Pu Y. Perry N.A. Yang D. Lewin N.E. Kedei N. Braun D.C. Choi S.H. Blumberg P.M. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Duan D. Marquez V.E. J. Biol.

[3H]PDBu Binding Assays—Scatchard analysis was performed in this study to determine the dissociation constant (Kd values) of the arginine mutants in binding to [3H]PDBu as described elsewhere (26Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 129-156PubMed Google Scholar). Competitive binding assays were also performed in this study to determine Kd values of some mutants with weak potencies for PDBu binding as described elsewhere (27Wang Q.J. Fang T.W. Nacro K.

Expression and Imaging of the Fluorescent Protein-labeled C1 Domains in Live LNCaP and CHO Cells—LNCaP and CHO-K1 cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium or F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.05 mg/ml) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The plasmids of GFP-fused C1 proteins were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of the fluorescent protein was detected 24 h after transfection. Confocal fluorescent images were collected with a Zeiss MRC 1024 confocal scan head (Zeiss) mounted on a Nikon microscope with a ×60 planapochromat lens as described before (24Pu Y. Perry N.A. Yang D. Lewin N.E. Kedei N. Braun D.C. Choi S.H. Blumberg P.M. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Duan D. Marquez V.E. J. Biol.

Molecular Modeling—Structures for the single mutants N7R, S10R, P11R, and L20R were generated from the crystal structure of the PKCδ C1b domain (28Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) by mutating the selected residue to arginine while preserving the backbone and χ1 angles. A conformational search was performed on the four χ angles of each new arginine residue using 5000 steps of systematic torsional sampling in Macromodel 9.1 (29Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. J. Comp. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar). The search used the OPLS 2005 force field with implicit water solvent. Each arginine structure in the resulting set was energy-minimized to convergence at a gradient of 0.05, while fixing the rest of the protein structure in place. Duplicate structures, defined as those with less than a 0.5 Å difference in the arginine side chain atoms, were deleted. Structures for the double, triple, and quadruple mutants were built using the lowest energy conformer found for each single arginine side chain. A structure for a phorbol-binding quadruple mutant was built in the same way, with an alternate conformer of Arg20. A homology model for the PKCζ C1 domain was built on the backbone coordinates of the crystal structure of the PKCδ C1b domain (28Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Side chains were constructed using the program SCWRL (30Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), which uses a backbone-dependent rotamer library to place residues in their most likely conformation given the backbone φ-ψ angles at that position. Residues homologous to δC1b were left unchanged from their crystallographic positions, and the binding site arginine residues at positions 7, 10, 11, and 20 were given the same lowest energy conformation found in the conformational search above. The model was energy-minimized with harmonic positional restraints on the backbone atoms to eliminate steric clashes in the side chains without inducing deformations in the backbone. The resulting structure was inspected carefully by hand to ensure that residue packing was reasonable and that the orientations of conserved but nonidentical charged residues were similar to the crystal structure of δC1b. Electrostatic potentials were calculated for the wild-type δC1b, ζC1, and all of the arginine mutants in Grasp (31Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar), using an interior dielectric of 2, an exterior dielectric of 80, a solvent radius of 1.4 Å, an ionic strength of 0.145 m, and an ionic radius of 2.0 Å. PARSE3 atomic charges and radii were used (32Sitkoff D. Sharp K.A. Honig B. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 1978-1988Crossref Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), modified slightly to include values for zinc (+2 charge, 0.74 Å radius) and to modify the values for the eight zinc-coordinating residues, which were each given a partial charge of -0.5 to set the net charge for each zinc-binding motif to zero. Compared with the DAG/phorbol ester-responsive PKC C1 domains, one of the most striking characteristics of the atypical PKCs (PKCζ as well as PKCι) is that there are several positively charged arginine residues located in the loops that make up the binding site. As shown in Fig. 1, the Arg residues that line the binding cleft in the atypical C1 domains of the human are Arg7, Arg10, Arg11, and Arg20, whose corresponding residues in the PKCδ C1b domain are Asn7, Ser10, Pro11, and Leu20 (see the three-dimensional structure in Fig. 1B). Arg7 in the atypical C1 domain is polar in other C1 domains (Asn, Thr, and Tyr) and in fact the adjacent residue 6 is positively charged in many C1 domains. In the folded structure, Arg7 is also close to Arg26, which is a conserved positively charged residue across all PKC C1 domains. Thus, this region of the structure is generally already positively charged. Arg10 is at the apex of the first loop and points out away from the binding site. Some non-PKC C1 domains (protein kinase D C1b and RasGRP) also have positively charged Arg or Lys at position 10. We expected that this residue was probably the least likely to interfere with natural ligand binding. According to previous studies (25Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), Pro11 and Leu20 are partially relevant for binding. Mutating these two residues into glycine caused 100- and 15-fold reductions, respectively, in the in vitro binding affinity for PDBu. However, it was not known whether the introduction of Arg residues at these two positions, such as is found in the atypical C1 domains (Arg11 and Arg20), would cause any change in the ligand binding affinity. To explore the role of these Arg residues experimentally, we used the potent phorbol ester-sensitive C1b domain of PKCδ as the template, and we mutated the four residues Asn7, Ser10, Pro11, and Leu20 in the binding cleft into Arg, generating all possible combinations of 1-4 mutated residues. The rationale for our approach was that the δC1b domain is biochemically well behaved and extensively characterized by us both structurally and with regard to its ligand interactions. The site-directed mutagenesis was carried out stepwise. The single-site mutations yielded N7R, S10R, P11R, and L20R; the double-site mutations provided N7R/S10R, N7R/P11R, N7R/L20R, S10R/P11R, S10R/L20R, and P11R/L20R; the triple-site mutations yielded N7R/S10R/P11R, N7R/S10R/L20R, N7R/P11R/L20R, and S10R/P11R/L20R; and finally the quadruple-site mutation yielded N7R/S10R/P11R/L20R. These mutants were fused with GST or GFP for use in either in vitro binding assays or in vivo translocation assays. With the GST-tagged mutants, we determined how the binding affinity for [3H]PDBu in vitro was affected by the Arg residues. Then, with the GFP-tagged mutants, we evaluated the effect of the introduction of the Arg residues on the subcellular distribution of the C1 domain in living cultured mammalian cells in the absence of PMA and its response as a function of time upon the addition of PMA. The Single-site Mutations Showed No to Moderate (24-Fold) Reduction in the Binding Affinity for PDBu; the Dependence of Binding on PS Was Differentially and Significantly Increased—We first examined whether the binding affinity for [3H]PDBu was affected by the introduction of an Arg residue along the rim of the binding cleft. The GST-tagged δC1b mutants were expressed and purified from E. coli. A Scatchard assay was employed to measure the binding affinities (represented by Kd values) of these mutants for [3H]PDBu. Under these in vitro assay conditions, binding is evaluated in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine. Our results demonstrated that all the single mutants N7R, S10R, P11R, and L20R maintained considerably potent binding affinities for the phorbol ester PDBu (Table 1).TABLE 1Binding affinities for PDBu of δC1b and the arginine mutantsReceptorKdΔGΔGiΔG+nmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molWild type0.33 ± 0.05−12.97N7R1.18 ± 0.07−12.210.76S10R0.32 ± 0.10−12.98−0.01P11R1.19 ± 0.19−12.210.76L20R8.0 ± 1.8−11.071.90N7R/S10R1.58 ± 0.04−12.040.18S10R/P11R1.22 ± 0.17−12.010.21S10R/L20R7.67 ± 0.20−11.10−0.02N7R/P11R33.8 ± 1.8−10.221.23N7R/L20R480 ± 44−8.641.67P11R/L20R374 ± 20−8.791.52N7R/S10R/P11R19.6 ± 2.3−10.540.92N7R/S10R/L20R1360 ± 290−8.032.29S10R/P11R/L20R380 ± 45−8.781.54N7R/P11R/L20RNAN7R/S10R/P11R/L20RNA Open table in a new tab As we expected, the mutation at Ser10 (S10R) had no effect on ligand binding. It showed a Kd value (0.32 ± 0.10 nm) similar to that of the wild-type δC1b (0.33 ± 0.05 nm). Strikingly, the P11R mutant retained potent binding affinity for [3H]PDBu with a Kd value of 1.19 ± 0.19 nm. This Kd was thus only 4-fold weaker than that for the wild-type (Kd = 0.33 ± 0.05 nm). Pro11 is highly conserved across all the typical DAG/phorbol ester-responsive C1 domains but not the atypical C1 domains. Previous studies had shown that mutation of the Pro11 residue into glycine (P11G) reduced the binding affinity for PDBu more than 100-fold (25Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated here that replacing the proline with a positively charged Arg residue at this site did not significantly interfere with the phorbol ester interaction. This suggests that it may be the increased flexibility of glycine at this site that interferes with binding rather than a change in the overall structure of the loop. In fact, the backbone angles of this proline in the PKCδ C1b crystal structure (28Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) are φ =-58.6, ψ = 118.0, ω =-176.7, which is a β-turn conformation that is compatible with any amino acid. Like Ser10, Asn7 is located in a region of the binding site that can be positively charged. However, unlike Ser10, the replacement of Asn7 with an Arg residue (N7R) slightly decreased the binding affinity (4-fold) for PDBu. The most significant change in PDBu binding occurred with the mutation at site 20. The introduction of an Arg residue to this site caused a 24-fold decrease in the binding affinity for PDBu. The Kd was increased from 0.33 ± 0.05 nm (for the wild type) to 8.0 ± 1.8 nm (for the L20R mutant). In general, we conclude that none of the individual Arg residues along the binding cleft of the atypical C1 domain by itself can account for the loss of the potency of the atypical C1 domains for phorbol ester binding. The binding of phorbol ester to the C1 domain represents a ternary interaction between ligand, C1 domain, and phospholipid. We therefore also examined the effect of the introduction of Arg residues along the rim of the binding cleft on the ability of phospholipid to support phorbol ester binding. We found that the dependence of binding on the proportion of PS in the phospholipids was significantly increased when either Asn7, Pro11, or Leu20 was replaced with an Arg, which is positively charged. The total lipid concentration was fixed at 100 μg/ml,"

Human Spy1 was subsequently shown to enhance cellular proliferation through the direct activation of CDK2. Moreover, RNA interference knockdown of Spy1 prevented cellular proliferation by inhibiting efficient S-phase entry (2Porter L.A. Dellinger R.W. Tynan J.A. Barnes E.A. Kong M. Lenormand J.L.

BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Spy1 can also activate CDK2 in the absence of the Thr160 activating phosphorylation (8Cheng A. Gerry S. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event is mediated by the CDK-activating kinase, which is known to be regulated by p53 in response to DNA damage (9Schneider E. Montenarh M. Wagner P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2733-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, Spy1 and its homologs can prevent CDK inhibition by CDK inhibitors, such as p21 and p27 (5Karaiskou A. Perez L.H.

Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Various checkpoints exist to ensure that cells replicate without genetic errors and repair damaged DNA, to avoid both the uncoupling of replication from cell cycle control and the transmission of genetic mutations (12Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 13Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar, 14Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrates that DNA damage responses are activated in early premalignant tissue but not in normal tissue (15Bartkova J. Horejsi Z. Koed K. Kramer A. Tort F. Zieger K. Guldberg P. Sehested M. Nesland J.M. Lukas C. Orntoft T. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nature. 2005; 434: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). Checkpoints are often the targets for oncogenic mutation, thereby uncoupling proliferation from apoptosis while enhancing proliferation itself during transformation and tumorigenesis (11Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar, 16Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G.

In addition to evasion of checkpoints, cancer cells must also inactivate the apoptotic pathways (18Brown J.M. Attardi L.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptotic mechanisms exist to protect cells against the loss of checkpoints, irreparable DNA damage, and sustained oncogenic stimuli.Significantly, a correlation between Spy1 and breast cancer was recently published (19Zucchi I. Mento E. Kuznetsov V.A. Scotti M. Valsecchi V. Simionati B. Vicinanza E. Valle G. Pilotti S. Reinbold R. Vezzoni P. Albertini A. Dulbecco R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18147-18152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This study examined the altered regulation of genes in nodal metastatic and invasive ductal breast carcinomas, identifying Spy1 as one of the 50 most upregulated genes (19Zucchi I. Mento E. Kuznetsov V.A. Scotti M. Valsecchi V. Simionati B. Vicinanza E. Valle G. Pilotti S. Reinbold R. Vezzoni P. Albertini A. Dulbecco R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18147-18152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These data suggest that deregulation of Spy1 expression plays a key role in oncogenesis.In this study, we have investigated the role of Spy1 expression in apoptosis and checkpoint activation to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms by which Spy1 may contribute to oncogenesis as reported for breast cancer (19Zucchi I. Mento E. Kuznetsov V.A. Scotti M. Valsecchi V. Simionati B. Vicinanza E. Valle G. Pilotti S. Reinbold R. Vezzoni P. Albertini A. Dulbecco R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18147-18152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Spy1 expression enhances cell survival in response to UV irradiation by preventing the activation of caspases and apoptosis in a U2OS osteosarcoma cell line. Interestingly, Spy1 expression suppresses the activation of both an S-phase/replication checkpoint and a G2/M checkpoint. In addition, Spy1 expression prevents the activation of checkpoint proteins, such as Chk1 and the histone variant H2A.X, in response to UV irradiation and prevents other ATR-mediated signaling events, such as the phosphorylation of RPA32 on its N terminus. Furthermore, mutations within the S/R box of Spy1, known to mediate the interaction with and activation of CDK2 (6Dinarina A. Perez L.H. Davila A. Schwab M. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 386: 349-355Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Cheng A. Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Solomon M.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), prevent these effects of Spy1. Expression of this mutant does not suppress the phosphorylation of Chk1 or RPA32 in response to UV-induced DNA damage, indicating a specific role for Spy1 and Spy1-associated CDK2 activity in the regulation of the DNA damage response. The expression of Spy1 thus facilitates the evasion of checkpoints and apoptotic pathways that are activated in response to DNA damage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Creation of Inducible Cell Lines, and UV Irradiation Conditions—U2OS human osteosarcoma cells with wild type p53 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and all derivatives were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1.5 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Inducible U2OS cell lines were created using the ecdysone system (Invitrogen) (20No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) as follows. U2OS cells were transfected with pVgRXR regulatory vector and selected for 14 days with Zeocin. Subsequently, Myc-Spy1 and the Myc-SpyS/R box mutant were cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pIND vector and transfected into pVgRXR-expressing U2OS cells. Cells were selected with G418 and Zeocin (Invitrogen) for 14 days, and colonies were isolated and then tested for expression of Myc-Spy1 or the Myc-Spy1S/R box mutant induced by ponasterone A (20No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Induction conditions were determined to be maximal with 1.25 nm ponasterone A (subsequently referred to as induction medium). Cell culture conditions were as above with the inclusion of 0.48 mg/ml G418 and 0.5 mg/ml Zeocin.For UV irradiation, medium was aspirated, and plates were washed twice with PBS. After removing as much PBS as possible, the cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UVC (254 nm) using a Stratalinker1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Induction medium was then added back, and plates were returned to the incubator until processed. Where indicated, the human pRcCMV-CDK2 expression plasmid was transfected into cells with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Creation of Spy1 S/R Box Mutant—To create the S/R box mutation of Spy1, BglII and MluI sites were cloned into wild type pIND-Myc-Spy1, flanking the acidic region of the S/R box at residues 458 and 525, respectively, using QuikChange (Stratagene), using the following primers: for BglII, GGGCTAAATTTACTATAAGTGAGCATACCAGATCTAATTTCTTTATTGCTCTGTATCTGC; for MluI, ACCAAGTACGCGTTTTTTCCATGGGCTTTAGGG. The region flanking the mutation sites was then excised using BglII and MluI. A short oligonucleotide containing the mutations E134Q, E135Q, E137Q, E138Q, E139Q, and D136N was then ligated into these sites (GATCTAATTTCTTTATTGCTCTGTATCTGGCTAATACAGTTCAACAAAATCAACAACAAACCAAGTA).Antibodies—Anti-caspase-3 (FL) rabbit antibody (9662), anti-cleaved caspase-3 Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated rabbit antibody (9669), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) rabbit antibody (2341), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) (133D3) rabbit monoclonal antibody (2348), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser317) rabbit anti-body (2344), and anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit antibody (9708) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-Myc (9E10) (sc-40) mouse antibody, anti-Chk1 (G4) (sc-8408) mouse antibody, anti-CDK2 (D12) (sc-6248) mouse antibody, anti-RPA32 (C16) (sc-14692) goat antibody, anti-CDK2 (M2) (sc-163) rabbit antibody, and anti-β-tubulin (H235) (sc-9104) rabbit antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphohistone H2A.X (Ser139; γH2AX) clone JBW301 mouse antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-RPA32 (Ser4 and Ser8) (BL647) (A300-245A) was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX).Detection of Apoptosis—To determine apopotosis in response to UV, 5 × 105 pIND:U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were seeded on 10-cm plates, induced for 24 h, and then irradiated with UV. Cells were allowed to recover in induction medium until the indicated time points. Floating and adherent cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 95% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. After fixation, cells were washed twice with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Cells were then stained with a propidium iodide solution (0.25 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.01% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml RNase A in PBS) and analyzed for sub-G1 DNA content by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences).To detect apoptosis by Annexin V binding to the outer cell membrane, 5 × 105 cells were seeded on 10-cm plates and induced for 24 h. Cells were then irradiated with UV and incubated for 24 h in induction medium. Floating and adherent cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer (BD Biosciences). 1 × 105 cells were stained with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 7-amino-actinomycin D (to detect necrotic cells) as per the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed for apoptosis by flow cytometry.Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein for each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% SDS-PAGE except for caspase-3 experiment at 17.5%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antiserum, followed by secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate; GE Healthcare) or anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (GE Healthcare), followed by ECL (GE Healthcare).Detection of Cleaved Caspase-3 by Intracellular Staining and Flow Cytometry—To detect cleaved caspase-3 in response to UV irradiation, pIND:U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were induced for 24 h with ponasterone A and then irradiated with UV. Cells were allowed to recover in induction medium, and at the indicated time points postirradiation, floating and adherent cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were put on ice for 1 min and then permeabilized with methanol so that the final concentration of methanol is 90%. Cells were kept in methanol at -20 °C until all time points were collected. Cells were then washed with 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS by centrifugation and stained with anti-cleaved caspase-3 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of cleaved caspase-3.UV Irradiation-resistant DNA Synthesis Assay (UVDS)—The UVDS assay was performed as previously described (21Tsao C.C. Geisen C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, pIND:U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were induced for 24 h, followed by incubation in induction medium containing 20 nCi/ml [14C]thymidine (Applied Biosystems, Chicago, IL) for a subsequent 24 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh normal induction medium and incubated for another 24 h. Cells were then irradiated with UV and incubated in normal induction medium for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min, followed by a 15-min incubation with 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Applied Bio-systems). Cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in 70% methanol. Cells were transferred to Whatman filters and rinsed sequentially with 70% methanol then 90% methanol. Filters were allowed to dry, and radioactivity was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. The ratio of 3H cpm to 14C cpm, corrected for channel crossover, was a measure of DNA synthesis.G2/M Checkpoint Assay—A G2/M checkpoint assay was performed, similar to previous descriptions (22Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, pIND: U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were induced for 24 h, irradiated with UV, and allowed to recover in induction medium. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested by trypsinization/centrifugation and stained with phosphohistone H3 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The percentage of phosphohistone H3-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and induced for 24 h followed by irradiation with UV. 2 h post UV irradiation, coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with either mouse antiphosphohistone H2A.X (Ser139) at 1:2500 or rabbit antiphospho-Chk1 (Ser317) at 1:1000. After extensive washing, cells were counterstained with anti-mouse IgG (fab-specific)-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antiserum (Sigma) at 1:500 or goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Flour (488)-conjugated antiserum (Molecular Probes) at 1:5000, respectively. Hoechst dye 33342 (1 μg/ml) was used to detect nuclei. For γH2AX, images were acquired using a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C5810 camera. For phospho-Chk1, images were acquired using an Applied Precision Delta Vision Deconvolution Microscope System (Nikon TE-200 Microscope) at the Digital Imaging Core University of California San Diego Cancer Center.Isolation of Chromatin—To isolate chromatin-bound RPA, cells were removed from plates and preextracted with a chromatin isolation buffer (23Syljuasen R.G. Sorensen C.S. Hansen L.T. Fugger K. Lundin C. Johansson F. Helleday T. Sehested M. Lukas J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3553-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors on ice for 5 min. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation, sheared with a 23-gauge needle, and treated with DNase (0.1 units/ml) to extract chromatin-bound proteins.RESULTSConstruction of Spy1-inducible and Control Cells in the U2OS Osteosarcoma Cell LineTo investigate the role of Spy1 in apoptosis and checkpoint activation, we created U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines allowing inducible expression of Spy1 using the ecdysone-inducible system (Fig. 1A). In brief, this expression system uses the steroid hormone ponasterone A, an analog of ecdysone, to activate expression of the inserted gene via a heterodimeric nuclear receptor. The gene of interest is cloned into the vector pIND and transfected into cells stably expressing pVgRXR. The pVgRXR vector encodes the heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor (VgEcR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) that binds a hybrid ecdysone response element (E/GRE) in the presence of ponasterone A (20No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar).Fig. 1B presents an analysis of the U2OS-derived cell lines used in this study. The control cell line, designated pIND: U2OS, contains an empty expression vector and does not express protein in response to ponasterone A induction. A matched cell line, designated Spy1:U2OS, exhibits inducible expression of Myc-Spy1 in response to ponasterone A. Previously, our work and that of others has demonstrated that Spy1 is a potent regulator of CDK2 (and Cdc2), activating the kinase through direct binding of the two proteins. The domain of Spy1 required for this interaction and subsequent activation of CDK2 is a central region containing an acidic stretch, known as the S/R box (6Dinarina A. Perez L.H. Davila A. Schwab M. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 386: 349-355Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Cheng A. Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Solomon M.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To examine whether Spy1 requires CDK2 binding to mediate responses to UV irradiation, we created a construct based on mutations previously shown to prevent CDK2 binding and activation (6Dinarina A. Perez L.H. Davila A. Schwab M. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 386: 349-355Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Cheng A. Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Solomon M.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), mutating the five glutamate residues and the one aspartate residue within the Speedy/Ringo box to glutamine and asparagine, respectively (Spy1S/R box). We also constructed a matched cell line, Spy1S/R box:U2OS, allowing inducible expression of Myc-Spy1S/R box in response to ponasterone A. Following induction with ponasterone A, the inducible expression of Myc-Spy1S/R box was detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates with the Myc (9E10) antibody (Fig. 1B). To confirm the inability of the Spy1S/R box mutant protein to bind CDK2 efficiently (7Cheng A. Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Solomon M.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in Fig. 1C we compared CDK2 immunoprecipitates prepared from induced Spy1:U2OS cells and from induced Spy1S/R box:U2OS cells. Due to low levels of endogenous CDK2 expression (second panel, lanes 1 and 3), CDK2 was overexpressed by transfection in this experiment. Under these conditions, binding of Myc-Spy1 to CDK2 was readily detected, whereas binding of the mutant Myc-Spy1S/R box protein to CDK2 was barely detectable (third panel, lanes 2 and 4).Spy1 Prevents Apoptosis in U2OS Cells and Requires Interaction with CDK2 through the Speedy/Ringo BoxTo examine the effect of Spy1 expression on UV-induced apoptosis, control pIND and Spy1:U2OS-inducible cell lines were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UVC after being induced for 24 h. At the indicated time points after UV irradiation, cells were collected, and apoptosis was determined by staining for DNA content using propidium iodide. The percentage of cells containing Sub-G1 DNA was determined and identified as apoptotic by flow cytometry. As seen in Fig. 2A, Spy1 expression drastically decreases apoptosis in U2OS cells at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after UV irradiation by ∼13, 20, 55, and 50%, respectively. In the experiment presented, pIND:U2OS cells served as the negative control in comparison with Spy1:U2OS cells, both treated with ponasterone A. As an additional negative control, Spy1:U2OS cells were examined in the absence of ponasterone A and exhibited UV-induced apoptosis similar to pIND: U2OS cells (Fig. 2D). For the remainder of the paper, pIND: U2OS cells are used as the negative control, whereas Spy1:U2OS cells without induction were omitted.FIGURE 2Spy1 prevents apoptosis in U2OS cells and requires the CDK2-interacting, Speedy/Ringo box domain. A, pIND:U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were induced with ponasterone A for 24 h, irradiated with UV, and harvested at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postirradiation. Cells were fixed with ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed for DNA content. Apoptotic cells were identified by the presence of sub-G1 DNA content. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from at least three separate experiments and is presented as the mean ± S.D. normalized to unirradiated samples. B, pIND:U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were induced for 24 h and then irradiated with 50 J/m2 UV. 24 h after irradiation, cells were harvested, fixed, and stained with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate to detect apoptotic cells. Quadrants to the right of the bar indicate Annexin V-positive cells indicative of apoptosis. Cells in the upper quadrants have begun to lose membrane integrity. The results from one representative experiment are shown. C, pIND: U2OS, Spy1:U2OS, and Spy1S/R box:U2OS were induced for 24 h, irradiated with UV, and analyzed for apoptosis as in A. D, as an additional negative control, Spy1:U2OS cells in the absence or presence of ponasterone A (24-h treatment) were irradiated with UV and harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h postirradiation and analyzed as in A. 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm that Spy1 prevents apoptosis, an Annexin V binding assay was used. In response to apoptotic stimuli, cells lose the asymmetry of the cell membrane as indicated by flipping of phosphatidylserine from the inner membrane leaflet to the outer leaflet (24Flores E.R.

Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4546) Google Scholar). Annexin V is a protein that specifically binds phosphatidylserine. Staining with an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate allows for the detection of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. After 24 h of induction, pIND:U2OS and Spy1:U2OS cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UVC and allowed to recover for 24 h. Spy1-expressing cells have only small amounts of Annexin V-positive staining (∼7.5%) in response to UV, compared with control cells (∼60%), further demonstrating that Spy1 expression is able to prevent apoptosis (Fig. 2B).When challenged with UV irradiation, Spy1S/R box-expressing cells underwent apoptosis to a similar extent as the control cells (20-25% at 24 h post-UV and ∼60% at 48 h), whereas the Spy1-expressing cells did not (less than 20% at either time point) (Fig. 2C), indicating that Spy1 must interact with and activate CDK2 in order to suppress apoptosis. This suggests that non-cyclin-mediated CDK2 activity may play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis in response to DNA damage.Spy1 Expression Prevents the Activation of the Effector Caspase, Caspase-3Caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases that serve as major regulators of apoptosis (28Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases, such as caspase-8, -9, -10, and -12, are activated by proapoptotic signals. Once activated, these caspases cleave and activate downstream effector caspases (including caspase-3, -6, and -7), which,"
https://openalex.org/W2087511655,"The tumor suppressor Smad4 is involved in carcinogenesis mainly of the pancreas and colon. Functional inactivation of Smad4 is a genetically late event that occurs upon transition from premalignant stages to invasive and metastatic growth. Smad4 encodes an intracellular messenger common to all signalling cascades induced by members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of cytokines. Despite extensive knowledge about the mechanisms of TGF-β/Smad signal transduction, little is known about Smad4 targets involved in the transition to malignancy. The hallmark of invasive growth is a breakdown of the basement membrane (BM), a specialized sheet of extracellular matrix produced through cooperation of epithelial and stromal cells. Laminin-5, a heterotrimeric epithelial-derived BM component, is commonly lost in carcinomas but not in premalignant tumors. Herein, we report that in human colon and pancreatic tumor cells, Smad4 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of all three genes encoding laminin-5. Coordinate re-expression of the three laminin-5 chains induced by reconstitution of Smad4 leads to secretion and deposition of the heterotrimeric molecule in BM-like structures. These data define the expression control of an essential BM component as a novel function for the tumor suppressor Smad4."

https://openalex.org/W2105728173,"Signaling from G protein-coupled receptors to phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) is regulated by coordinate interactions among multiple intracellular signaling molecules. Phosphatidic acid (PA), a signaling phospholipid, binds to and stimulates PLC-β1 through a mechanism that requires the PLC-β1 C-terminal domain. PA also modulates Gαq stimulation of PLC-β1. These data suggest that PA may have a key role in the regulation of PLC-β1 signaling in cells. The present studies addressed the structural requirements and the mechanism for PA regulation of PLC-β1. We used a combination of enzymatic assays, PA-binding assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy to evaluate the interaction of PA with wild-type and mutant PLC-β1 proteins and with fragments of the Gαq binding domain. The results identify a region that includes the αA helix and flexible loop of the Gαq-binding domain as necessary for PA regulation. A mutant PLC-β1 with multiple alanine/glycine replacements for residues 944LIKEHTTKYNEIQN957 was markedly impaired in PA regulation. The high affinity and low affinity component of PA stimulation was reduced 70% and PA binding was reduced 45% in this mutant. Relative PLC stimulation by PA increased with PLC-β1 concentration in a manner suggesting cooperative binding to PA. Similar concentration dependence was observed in the PLC-β1 mutant. These data are consistent with a model for PA regulation of PLC-β1 that involves cooperative interactions, probably PLC homodimerization, that require the flexible loop region, as is consistent with the dimeric structure of the Gαq-binding domain. PA regulation of PLC-β1 requires unique residues that are not required for Gαq stimulation or GTPase-activating protein activity. Signaling from G protein-coupled receptors to phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) is regulated by coordinate interactions among multiple intracellular signaling molecules. Phosphatidic acid (PA), a signaling phospholipid, binds to and stimulates PLC-β1 through a mechanism that requires the PLC-β1 C-terminal domain. PA also modulates Gαq stimulation of PLC-β1. These data suggest that PA may have a key role in the regulation of PLC-β1 signaling in cells. The present studies addressed the structural requirements and the mechanism for PA regulation of PLC-β1. We used a combination of enzymatic assays, PA-binding assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy to evaluate the interaction of PA with wild-type and mutant PLC-β1 proteins and with fragments of the Gαq binding domain. The results identify a region that includes the αA helix and flexible loop of the Gαq-binding domain as necessary for PA regulation. A mutant PLC-β1 with multiple alanine/glycine replacements for residues 944LIKEHTTKYNEIQN957 was markedly impaired in PA regulation. The high affinity and low affinity component of PA stimulation was reduced 70% and PA binding was reduced 45% in this mutant. Relative PLC stimulation by PA increased with PLC-β1 concentration in a manner suggesting cooperative binding to PA. Similar concentration dependence was observed in the PLC-β1 mutant. These data are consistent with a model for PA regulation of PLC-β1 that involves cooperative interactions, probably PLC homodimerization, that require the flexible loop region, as is consistent with the dimeric structure of the Gαq-binding domain. PA regulation of PLC-β1 requires unique residues that are not required for Gαq stimulation or GTPase-activating protein activity.

The importance of PA in the regulation of cellular effectors is shown by in vivo studies that demonstrate loss of cellular regulation in cells overexpressing mutant PA-impaired effectors (6Ghosh S.

Intracellular PA levels are low under resting conditions but increase rapidly upon activation of a number of receptor signaling pathways, including GPCR-PLC-β signaling (11Litosch I. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GPCR-PLC-β signaling is mediated both by the Gq/11 family of GTP-binding proteins acting through the Gα subunit and by Gβγ subunits supplied primarily by Gi family members. Rapid hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by PLC-β generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate increases the levels of regulatory Ca2+. DAG activates the protein kinase Cs and other effectors, including DAG kinases, which convert DAG to PA. Increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels and protein kinase C activity stimulate phospholipase D (PLD) activity, which generates PA from phosphatidylcholine. PLD is also stimulated in response to GPCR-G12/13 signaling and activation of monomeric GTP-binding proteins, including RhoA. Nine DAG kinase isoforms and two major PLD isoforms have been identified; they differ in subcellular localization and regulation (12Luo B. Regier D.S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Jenkins G.M. Frohman M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2305-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The contribution of the DAG kinase- and PLD-generated pools of PA in the GPCR regulation of cellular function, and the mechanism for PA regulation of effectors remains poorly understood. In addition to the role of PLC-β1 in mediating GPCR-dependent increases in PA levels, PLC-β1 is also regulated by PA in vitro. These data suggest a potential role for PA in the feedback modulation of GPCR-PLC-β1 signaling (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Litosch I.

PLC-β is a member of a large family of PIP2-specific PLC enzymes that include PLC-β1–4, PLC-γ1–2, PLC-δ1–4, PLC-ϵ, PLC-ζ, and PLC-η1–2 (17Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIP2-PLCs are grouped by sequence homology and coupling to specific receptor-delineated mechanisms, including those mediated by GPCR and tyrosine kinase receptors. The mechanisms that regulate many of these enzymes are still not well understood, and both specific signaling phospholipids and small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins have recently been implicated in regulation. PLC-β enzymes share many of the structural features present in other members of the PIP2-PLC family, including conserved catalytic X and Y boxes as well as two membrane-phospholipid binding regions, the pleckstrin homology and C2 domains. PLC-β enzymes, however, are distinguished by the presence of an elongated C terminus consisting of ∼450 residues, which contains many of the determinants for interaction with Gαq (22Rebecchi M. Pentyala S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). GPCR stimulation of PLC-β1 activity is tightly regulated at the G protein level by cycling of Gαq between inactive and active states (23Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, Gαq exists in the relatively inactive GDP-bound state. Agonist binding to GPCR activates Gαq by promoting exchange of GTP for bound GDP. The active Gαq-GTP stimulates PLC-β1 activity. The duration of the Gαq-GTP state is determined by its intrinsic GTPase activity, which hydrolyzes Gαq-bound GTP to GDP and thereby terminates activity. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), including regulators of G protein signaling and PLC-β, stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gq, accelerating deactivation (24Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 695-827Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). PLC-β thus functions as both an effector of Gαq and a GAP specific for the Gαq family of G proteins (24Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 695-827Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The intracellular mechanisms that regulate and integrate these dual functions of PLC-β are not fully understood. We have shown that PA stimulates PLC-β1 activity through a mechanism that requires PA binding (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unlike other PA-regulated effectors, PA also modulates PLC-β1 activation in response to known cellular mediators, suggesting that PA targets a mechanism common to both basal and regulated PLC-β1 activity. PA stimulation of PLC-β1 activity is synergistic with Gαq stimulation in vitro (16Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The combination of PA and Gαq-GTPγS results in greater stimulation of PLC-β1 activity than that due to either PA or Gαq-GTPγS alone. PA also potentiates GPCR stimulation of PLC-β1 activity in membranes, consistent with a role for PA in enhancing receptor-Gαq stimulation (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Litosch I. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PA antagonizes net inhibition of PLC-β1 activity by protein kinase Cα, suggesting a potential role for PA in the regulation of negative feedback inhibition by protein kinase Cα (16Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two observations suggest that PA regulation occurs through binding to a site within the PLC-β1 C terminus and that it is isoform-dependent. First, a calpain-generated 100-kDa PLC-β1 fragment, which lacks 336 residues C-terminal to His880, does not bind PA and is insensitive to stimulation by 7–15 mol % PA. Stimulation of the 100-kDa fragment requires >15 mol % PA and is not coupled to measurable PA binding (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Second, PA stimulation of the PLC-β3 isoform requires >15 mol % PA and is also not associated with PA binding (16Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sequence diversity within the C-terminal domain of PLC-β isoforms is thought to contribute to isoform differences in sensitivity to stimulation by G protein subunits and regulation by protein kinases (21Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain contains determinants for αq stimulation (25Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J.

J. 1997; 326: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Isolated PLC-β1 C-terminal tails show complex GAP behavior, which suggests that dimerization/oligomerization has an important role in the regulation of PLC-β1 function (27Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the crystal structure of the turkey PLC-β2 C-terminal domain shows it to be a homodimer of three-stranded coiled coils in an antiparallel orientation (30Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The dimer interface includes the αB and αC helices, and Gαq is predicted to bind to the dimer interface, further implicating dimerization in Gαq interaction (31Ilkaeva O. Kinch L.N. Paulssen R.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4294-4300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further delineate the role of PA in the modulation of GPCR-Gαq-PLC-β1 signaling, the present studies used trun-cated PLC-β1 C-terminal fragments and corresponding PLC-β1 C-terminal mutants (31Ilkaeva O. Kinch L.N. Paulssen R.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4294-4300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to localize the determinants for PA binding and to address the mechanism for PA regulation of PLC-β1 activity. The data show that the region mapping to the αA helix and flexible αA-αB loop of the Gαq binding domain is required for both PA binding and stimulation of PLC-β1 activity. This loop is conserved among mammalian PLC-β1s but diverges in the other isoforms. In addition, our data suggest a mechanism for PA regulation of PLC-β1 that involves cooperative interactions, probably homodimerization. Regulated homodimerization is a potential novel mechanism for the integration of signaling from multiple cellular networks to the regulation of GPCR-Gαq-PLC-β1 signaling. Expression and Purification of C-terminal Fragments—PLC-β1 exists as two alternatively spliced variants, 150-kDa PLC-β1a and 140-kDa PLC-β1b, that are comparably stimulated by Gαq. The PLC-β1b variant replaces the 75 C-terminal residues of PLC-β1a with 32 residues unique to PLC-β1b (32Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PLC-β1 C-terminal sequence common in both variants, Ala878–Lys1141, PLC-(878–1141) was amplified from rat PLC-β1 cDNA by PCR using primers 5′-TACCATGGCTCCACACAGCCAGCCTGC-3′ and 5′-CTGGATCCTCAATGGTGATGGTGGTGATGCTTGGGCTTCTCATCCAGGATCTG-3′. These primers introduce methionine at the N terminus, a His6 tag at the C terminus, and NcoI and BamHI sites (underlined). The PCR product was ligated into pET-3d (Novagene). Protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 in enriched media (30 g of peptone/tryptone, 20 g of select yeast extract/liter) plus M9 salts. Expression was induced with 400 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were harvested after 3 h. Cells were thawed in 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor; Roche Applied Science), lysed by sonication on ice, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Recombinant protein was purified from the supernatant to 80% purity with Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech), as described by the manufacturer. The recombinant protein was identified by its molecular mass, induction of protein expression by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and reactivity of the His6 tag with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen) by Western blot. PLC-(873–1030), PLC-(878–1010), PLC-(878–980), and PLC-(878–950) were produced similarly. PLC-(1–880) was produced by calpain-1 cleavage of PLC-β1 as described (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Replacement PLC-β1 Mutants—PLC-β1 mutants were made by PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Wild-type PLC-β1 and PLC-β1 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli SG13009/pREP4 and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described (31Ilkaeva O. Kinch L.N. Paulssen R.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4294-4300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Binding Assay—Binding to phospholipids was performed essentially as described (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) except that large multilamellar vesicles (liposomes) were used that can be efficiently sedimented by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 60 min at 5 °C (34Davletov B. Perisic O. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19093-19096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Karathanassis D. Stahelin R.V. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C.M. Cho W. Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). PLC fragments or PLC-β1 were added to a 100-μl assay mixture (liposomes consisting of 400 μm 100 mol % PC or 25 mol % PA/75 mol % PC or, as indicated, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 μg of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin plus 0.1 m KCl or, as indicated, final concentration). The lipid-bound protein was separated from free protein by centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.0) diluted with 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10–20% SDS-PAGE (for C-terminal fragments) or 7.5% SDS-PAGE (for PLC-(1–880) and PLC-β1). Load and internal protein concentration standards were included in each gel. PLC fragments were detected by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. PLC-β1 was detected by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot using anti-PLC-β1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), as indicated. Protein bands were quantitated by ScionImage. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of PLC-(878–980) (10 μm in 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaF) were recorded at ambient temperature on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm cell. Spectra were recorded at 200–250 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min with a resolution of 0.2 nm. Ten scans were averaged without smoothing. Small unilamellar liposomes (400 μm) consisting of 100 mol % 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and either 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (DPPA) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phospho-l-serine (DPPS) in DPPC were prepared as described (36Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PLC Assay—PLC activity was measured as described (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PLC-β1 was incubated in 50 μl of buffer (0.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0)) and 150 μm phospholipid vesicles consisting of 50 μm [3H]PIP2 in combination with PC and PA to achieve the appropriate mol % PA. Vesicles were prepared by drying the lipids under a stream of nitrogen followed by the addition of 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) and sonication. Free Ca2+ concentration was maintained at 33 nm or as indicated with a Ca-EGTA buffer. Incubation was at 30 °C for 10–20 min. Other Materials—[3H]PIP2 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PIP2 was from Sigma. Brain PC and dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid, from Sigma or Avanti Polar Lipids, were used in the binding and PLC studies. DPPC, DPPA, DPPC, and Di6-PA were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Calpain-1 was from EMD (Calbiochem). Statistical Analysis—Paired Student's t tests were performed as indicated. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Localization of PA Binding Determinants in PLC-β1 C-terminal Fragments—Calpain cleaves PLC-β1 after His880 to generate a 100-kDa PLC-β1 fragment, PLC-(1–880), that lacks the 336 C-terminal residues (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of PLC-(1–880) is not stimulated by low mol % PA, and PLC-(1–880) does not bind PA, indicating that high affinity PA regulation requires the PLC-β1 C terminus (14Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The binding of full-length PLC-β1 to PA is salt-resistant, consistent with binding mechanisms other than electrostatic (16Litosch I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To directly address the involvement of the PLC-β1 C terminus in salt-resistant PA binding, we measured PA binding to a purified recombinant PLC C-terminal fragment corresponding to residues 878–1141 of PLC-β1, PLC-(878–1141), under highly stringent conditions that included 0.4 m KCl. As shown in Fig. 1, the phospholipid binding profile of PLC-(878–1141) was comparable with that of full-length PLC-β1. Binding of both PLC-(878–1141) and full-length PLC-β1 to liposomes that contain PA was resistant to displacement by 0.4 m KCl, indicating that residues 878–1141 contain determinants for salt-resistant PA binding. In contrast, binding of either protein to PS-containing liposomes was inhibited 100% by 0.4 m KCl, showing that PS binds through a predominantly electrostatic mechanism. Less than 5% of either protein bound to PC liposomes. To further localize the determinants for salt-resistant PA binding, we studied the PA binding of PLC-(1–880) and a series of PLC C-terminal fragments corresponding to residues 878–1030, 878–1010, 878–980, and 878–950 (Fig. 2). Neither PLC-(1–880) nor PLC C-terminal fragments bound appreciably to PC liposomes, less than 5% binding. The binding profile for PLC-(1–880) and PLC C-terminal fragments to PA is shown in Table 1. PLC-(1–880) did not bind to PA in the presence of either 0.1 or 0.3 m KCl. Binding of PLC C-terminal fragments was comparable with PLC-(878–1141) in the presence of 0.1 m KCl. PA increased the binding of all C-terminal fragments to a similar extent. Significant differences in PA binding, however, were apparent in the presence of 0.3 m KCl. PLC-(878–1141), PLC-(878–1030), PLC-(878–1010), and PLC-(878–980) retained 50, 80, 95, and 90% of their total PA binding in the presence of 0.3 m KCl. The increase in KCl-insensitive PA binding in PLC-(878–1030) and PLC-(878–1010) relative to PLC-(878–1141) probably reflects the loss of two α helices, 1055–1072 and 1109–1126, which mediate salt-sensitive electrostatic binding (26Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PLC-(878–950), however, retained less than 10% binding to PA in 0.3 m KCl, indicating that PLC-(878–980) contains determinants essential for salt-resistant PA binding.TABLE 1Binding of PLC fragments to PAFragmentBinding to PA liposomes0.1 m KCl0.3 m KClpmolPLC-(1-880)8 ± 210 ± 4PLC-(878-1141)210 ± 42108 ± 24PLC-(878-1030)216 ± 60180 ± 42PLC-(878-1010)225 ± 33216 ± 30PLC-(878-980)210 ± 60195 ± 51PLC-(878-950)150 ± 3014 ± 3 Open table in a new tab PA binding to the PLC-β1 C-terminal domain was also demonstrated by measurement of PA-promoted changes in secondary structure using far UV CD. Phospholipid binding frequently alters the secondary structure of proteins, and this effect provides a complementary measure of binding. DPPC and corresponding phospholipid analogs produce less light scattering than other lipids (36Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and were therefore used. As shown in Fig. 3A, the secondary structure of PLC-(878–980) was mostly random coil in the presence of DPPC vesicles, as is evident from the single minimum at ∼200 nm. DPPA at 25 mol % induced a significant increase in secondary structure, as shown by a pair of minima at ∼222 and ∼208 nm and a maximum near 190 nm. The increase in α helical content was saturable, with half-maximum at 15 mol % and maximum at ∼25 mol % DPPA (Fig. 3B). In contrast to PA, 25 mol % DPPS had little effect on secondary structure, showing that structural changes were specific for DPPA. Binding of PLC-(878–980) to DPPA vesicles was verified by sedimentation of the reaction mixture and quantitation of protein associated with the phospholipid pellet. There was little binding of PLC-(878–980) to DPPC vesicles, but 90% of the PLC-(878–980) bound to the DPPA-containing vesicles. DPPS promoted binding by only 30%. Electrostatic binding of the sort driven by PS is thus not sufficient to cause a structural change in this region. Localization of Determinants for PA Regulation of PLC-β1—Residues 878–980 in PLC-β1, which confer salt-resistant PA binding, include part of the flexible linker that connects the C2 and the Gαq-binding GAP domains, the first α helix of the GAP domain, and part of the following loop. We further localized the structures in this region that are important for PA binding and stimulation of PLC activity using a series of previously characterized mutants with runs of multiple alanine/glycine replacements in or adjacent to the αA-αB loop (31Ilkaeva O. Kinch L.N. Paulssen R.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4294-4300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 2, PA binding to the mutant A-(944–957) was reduced by 45% in the presence of 0.3 m KCl and statistically significant. Binding to the A-(944–957) mutant was equivalent to wild-type PLC-β1 in 0.1 m KCl, suggesting that electrostatic binding mediates a greater proportion of total A-(944–957) binding to PA relative to wild-type PLC-β1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Binding to mutant A-(965–975) was marginally reduced, and binding to the other mutants was unaltered. The low affinity, salt-sensitive binding was not altered in any of the mutants (data not shown). The sequences of the alanine/glycine PLC-β1 mutants are summarized (supplemental Table 1).TABLE"
https://openalex.org/W2060093152,"Kinectin is an integral membrane protein with many isoforms primarily found on the endoplasmic reticulum. It has been found to bind kinesin, Rho GTPase, and translation elongation factor-1δ. None of the existing models for the quaternary organization of the elongation factor-1 complex in higher eukaryotes involves kinectin. We have investigated here the assembly of the elongation factor-1 complex onto endoplasmic reticulum via kinectin using in vitro and in vivo assays. We established that the entire elongation factor-1 complex can be anchored to endoplasmic reticulum via kinectin, and the interacting partners are as follows. Kinectin binds EF-1δ, which in turn binds EF-1γ but not EF-1β; EF-1γ binds EF-1δ and EF-1β but not kinectin. In vivo splice blocking of the kinectin exons 36 and 37 produced kinectin lacking the EF-1δ binding domain, which disrupted the membrane localization of EF-1δ, EF-1γ, and EF-1β on endoplasmic reticulum, similar to the disruptions seen with the overexpression of kinectin fragments containing the EF-1δ binding domain. The disruptions of the EF-1δ/kinectin interaction inhibited expression of membrane proteins but enhanced synthesis of cytosolic proteins in vivo. These findings suggest that anchoring the elongation factor-1 complex onto endoplasmic reticulum via EF-1δ/kinectin interaction is important for regulating protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.

Kinectin has initially been proposed to be a membrane anchor for kinesin on intracellular organelles (1Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J.

Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of the 160-kDa polypeptide consists of a trans-membrane domain that anchors kinectin to organelle membranes, potentially with the help of the seven myristoylation sites throughout the molecule (3Yu H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of kinectin consists of the kinesin-binding domain, which can interact with the cargo-binding site of the conventional kinesin and enhance the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of kinesin (5Ong L.L.

Different kinectin isoforms with combinations of variable domains (vds) have been reported in human, mouse, and fox genomes (6Print C.G. Leung E. Harrison J.E. Watson J.D. Krissansen G.W.

At least two alternatively spliced forms have been detected in chicken, whereas eight more multiple variants and a differential splicing pattern of kinectin are found in human hepatocellular carcinoma (11Wang H.C. Su Y.R. Han K.J. Pang X.W. Peng J.R. Liang B. Wang S. Chen W.F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Five partial kinectin splice variants with alternative COOH termini in spleen and testis were identified in mouse (7Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and at least two isoforms have been observed in different fox tissues (8Xu J. Bird P.H. Bradley M.P. Janssens P.A. Hardy C.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recently, 15 novel kinectin isoforms have been isolated from mouse nerve tissues, such as embryonic/adult hippocampus and cultured astrocytes (9Santama N. Er C.P.N. Ong L.L. Yu H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4537-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There are at least five small (23-33 amino acid residues) variable domains scattered throughout the COOH terminus of kinectin (7Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two variable domains (vd3 (amino acid residues 1177-1200) and vd4 (amino acid residues 1229-1256)) overlap the kinesin-binding domain on kinectin (5Ong L.L. Lim A.P. Er C.P. Kuznetsov S.A. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32854-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The role of kinectin as a universal membrane anchor for kinesin has been questioned when the restricted intracellular and phylogenetic distributions of kinectin were discovered. Kinectin is not detected in axons of cultured neurons, where kinesin is the major motor responsible for fast anterograde transport (12Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 211: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The kinectin gene is not found in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila genomes, where conserved conventional kinesin heavy chain gene is present (13Goldstein L. Gunawardena S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F63-F68Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinectin isoforms without vd3 or vd4 have indeed been identified in cells (7Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Santama N. Er C.P.N. Ong L.L. Yu H. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32115-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), implying that the kinectin isoforms lacking either vd3 or vd4 (overlapping the kinesin-binding domain) cannot serve as the membrane anchors for kinesin (10Ong L.L. Er C.P. Ho A. Aung M.T. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32115-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that kinectin should have additional or alternative functions other than interacting with kinesin for organelle motility. In the search for interacting partners for kinectin isoforms lacking the kinesin-binding domain, translation elongation factor-1δ (EF-1δ) was identified as a major kinectin-binding protein (10Ong L.L. Er C.P. Ho A. Aung M.T. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32115-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both kinectin and EF-1δ were found predominantly in the same cell compartment (i.e. ER), and the latter has shown to be a stronger binding partner to kinectin than even kinesin (3Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M. Dijk J. Moller W. J.

The minimal EF-1δ-binding domain on kinectin resides within a conserved region present in all of the kinectin isoforms. Overexpression of the kinectin fragments in vivo disrupted the intracellular localization of EF-1δ proteins (10Ong L.L. Er C.P. Ho A. Aung M.T. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32115-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that the EF-1δ/kinectin interaction might be important for anchoring the EF-1 complex onto ER. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 consists of four subunits, EF-1α,-β,-δ, and -γ, forming a quaternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA. During the elongation steps of the protein synthesis, EF-1α is responsible for delivering the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome and requires the concomitant binding of GTP (16Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Upon correct codon-anticodon interaction, GTP hydrolysis is triggered. EF-1β and EF-1δ facilitate the exchange of GDP-bound EF-1α for GTP, initiating another round of elongation (17Riis B. Rattan S.I. Clark B.F. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 420424Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The precise mode of the interaction of the EF-1αβγδ complex with ER is still unknown (14Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on both in vitro and in vivo experiments, such as reconstitution of purified subunits, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, limited proteolysis, analysis of the isolated native complex, in vitro phosphorylation, and yeast two-hybrid method, five different models have been proposed for the quaternary organization of the EF-1 complex in various higher eukaryotes (18Mansilla F. Friis I. Jadidi M. Nielsen K.M. Clark B.F.C. Knudsen C.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol.

Although some discrepancies were present, all of these models agree on the tight binding of EF-1β and EF-1γ through their respective amino terminus. EF-1β and EF-1γ are known to form a tight binary complex that only becomes dissociated by strong denaturing agents like urea or guanidine hydrochloride (23Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, no direct interaction between β and δ was observed by gel filtration (24Sheu G.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three of the models also include the valyl-tRNA synthetase, which is unique among the mammalian aminoacyl synthetases in its propensity to interact with EF-1δ and form a stable complex (19Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Minella O. Mulner-Lorillon O. Bec G. Cormier P. Belle R. Biosci.

The existence of EF-1δ homodimers has been proposed, based on the presence of leucine zipper at the NH2 terminus of EF-1δ (18Mansilla F. Friis I. Jadidi M. Nielsen K.M. Clark B.F.C. Knudsen C.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only one model proposed EF-1γ as a candidate to anchor the entire elongation complex to ER together with ribosomes, which give rise to rough membranes (20Janssen G.M. van Damme H.T. Kriek J. Amons R. Moller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31410-31417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-1γ was found to have specific affinity for membranes and tubulin (23Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Janssen G.M. Moller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we have discovered that kinectin interacts with EF-1δ to anchor it to ER (10Ong L.L. Er C.P. Ho A. Aung M.T. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32115-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we propose here that the anchorage of the entire EF-1βγδ complex to ER is via EF-1δ/kinectin interaction. EF-1δ was found to co-elute with the heterodimer EF-1βγ during purification (23Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and contains two internal repeats (VFGEXNXS) at amino acid residues 35-42 and 355-362 that could be part of a binding motif for EF-1β and EF-1δ, respectively; there is evidence indicating that EF-1γ resides between the EF-1β and EF-1δ in the complex (26Van Damme H.T. Amons R. Karssies R. Timmers C.J. Janssen G.M. Moller W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since kinectin is an integral membrane protein on ER, it should interact with EF-1δ, which in turn binds other subunits and anchors the entire EF-1βγδ complex onto ER. The carboxyl terminus of the EF-1β then interacts with EF-1α to support the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the EF-1α in protein synthesis (27Van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We present here evidence from a series of in vitro and in vivo assays in support of this model and further characterize the functional roles of the EF-1 complex anchorage onto ER via EF-1δ/kinectin interaction. Overexpression of the kinectin fragments and in vivo splice-blocking of the exons containing the EF-1δ binding domain disrupted the membrane localization of EF-1δ, EF-1γ, and EF-1β on endoplasmic reticulum. In cells with disruption of the EF-1δ binding domain on kinectin, we observed inhibition in expression of membrane proteins but enhancement of cytosolic protein synthesis. These findings suggest that anchoring the elongation factor-1 complex onto ER via EF-1δ/kinectin interaction is important and potentially plays a role in regulating synthesis of the membrane/secretory and cytosolic proteins in eukaryotic cells, apart from the involvement of kinectin in organelle motility. The restriction enzymes used were from Promega (Madison, WI), and all of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Construction of Kinectin Baits and EF-1 Subunits—Human kinectin (GenBank™ accession number Z22551) bait A (amino acids 46444), bait B (amino acids 444-1049), and bait D (amino acids 1024-1356) were constructed by cloning in frame into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) of the pAS2-1 vector (Clontech) as described previously (10Ong L.L. Er C.P. Ho A. Aung M.T. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32115-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Standard PCR was carried out to amplify full-length EF-1α (GenBank™ accession number X03558), EF-1β (GenBank™ accession number X60489), EF-1δ (GenBank™ accession number NM001960), and EF-1γ (GenBank™ accession number X63526) from human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech). Their sequences were verified by sequencing and subcloned in frame to both GAL4 DNA-BD of pAS2-1 vector and GAL4 DNA activation domain (AD) of pACT2 vector (Clontech). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A thorough pairwise interaction analysis of kinectin bait A, B, and D and EF-1α,-β,-δ, and -γ were carried out using a yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed according to the supplied protocol. The constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain Y190 (Clontech) using the lithium acetate method (28Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were assayed for their expression of the histidine (HIS3) reporter gene by plating them onto the synthetic medium deficient in tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. A 25 mm concentration of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was included to limit the number of false HIS3 positives (29Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Colonies that grew successfully in the selective medium were further screened for their expression of the lacZ reporter gene by colony lift assay (30Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). False positives were further eliminated by testing whether the clones could activate both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes with controls (BD and AD vector alone). In Vitro GST Pull-down Assay—The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs with the kinectin bait D and EF-1γ were made by subcloning the corresponding cDNA into the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). His6-tagged fusion with bait D, EF-1δ, and EF-1β were constructed by subcloning the respective cDNA into pET32 expression vector (Novagen). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21/pLysS (DE3) (a generous gift from Niovi Santama, Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, University of Cyprus). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Intact bacterial cells containing the expressed fusion proteins were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Protein extracts were obtained by freezing and thawing the cell pellet and resuspending the pellet in GST purification buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) plus 5 mm dithiothreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of the GST fusion proteins with bait D and EF-1γ were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads by end-over-end mixing in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with GST purification buffer to remove unbound proteins. The expressed His6-bait D (58 kDa), His6-EF-1δ (52 kDa), and His6-EF-1β (46 kDa) fusion protein extract was allowed to interact with the GST-tagged protein-coated beads for 2 h at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. Any unbound proteins were removed through extensive washings. The proteins that remained bound to the immobilized GST-bait D or GST-EF-1γ were released by boiling in SDS-gel sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting with mouse RGS-His antibody (Qiagen). Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, coupled to horseradish peroxidase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Anti-EF-1β and EF-1γ Polyclonal Antibody Preparation—The first 90 amino acids of both EF-1β and EF-1γ were expressed in E. coli BL21 using pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The specificities of the sequences were confirmed by a BLAST 2.0 search against National Center for Biotechnology Information data bases (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59437) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified using the glutathione-agarose bead affinity column. The purified proteins were injected into rabbits by standard protocol (32Harlow E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antisera were affinity-purified using His6-tagged first 90 amino acids of the EF-1β coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (14Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding of the Endogenous Kinectin and EF-1βγ with EF-1δ—Bacterially expressed GST-tagged EF-1δ was coupled onto glutathione-agarose beads as described above. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were harvested and resuspended with 1 volume of the GST purification buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was prepared as described above and was added to the beads coated with GST-EF-1δ and incubated with end-over-end mixing for 2 h at 4°C. Proteins eluted from the beads were detected by immunoblotting with antikinectin CT-1 monoclonal antibody (generous gift from Prof. Martin Krönke, University of Cologne, Germany) and anti-EF-1β and anti-EF-1γ polyclonal antibodies. Antibody binding was detected as described above. Immunostaining of Cultured Cells—Cells cultured on coverglasses were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h prior to incubation with appropriate primary antibodies, anti-EF-1δ, anti-EF-1β, anti-EF-1γ, anti-calnexin (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), anticalreticulin (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), or anti-β tubulin overnight. The cells were washed three times, followed by a 1-h incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/anti-mouse IgG. The coverglasses were washed thoroughly, mounted in FluorSave™ (Calbiochem), and imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. Overexpression Studies—The EF-1δ binding domains on kinectin, baits D (amino acids 1024-1356) and D12 (amino acids 1116-1175), were subcloned into the pEGFP-C vector (Clontech) for optimal expression in mammalian cells. The pEGFP-C vector alone was used as a control. HeLa cells were seeded on a coverglass and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin overnight. Both kinectin constructs were transfected into the HeLa cells using Trans-Fast™ transfection reagent (Promega). 48 h post-transfection, cells were subsequently fixed and stained with appropriate antibodies as described above. Transfected cells were identified by green fluorescence protein expression and scored either with ER-like network or disrupted EF-1β and EF-1γ distributions. A total of 30 cells were observed for each clone during each experiment. The data tabulated were based on three independent experiments. Morpholino Antisense Studies—Two 25-nucleotide morpholino oligonucleotides were synthesized by Gene Tools (Philomath, OR) targeting the exon-intron boundaries of exons 36 (positions 3415-3504) and 37 (positions 3505-3597) of the human kinectin gene. The morpholinos HS1 (5′-ATCATTTCCTACTGTTTCTGCAAGG-3′), HS2 (5′-TCTTTTGTAAATACCTGTTTAATAG-3′), and Std Ctrl (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were delivered into HeLa cells using EPEI special delivery solution according to the manufacturer's protocol (Gene Tools). The delivery of morpholinos was repeated at 72 h to sustain the splice blocking for an additional 48 h. For RNA analysis, total RNA was isolated from cells at 24 and 48 h post-transfection with morpholinos using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). The RNAs were analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using spliced primers (position 3244-3754), which flanked the splice-blocked regions (exons 36 and 37), for not more than 20 cycles. A set of control primers (positions 3244-3415), which amplify outside the spliced region, was used as control. For immunolocalization analysis, the cells were immunostained with antibodies against EF-1δ, EF-1β, EF-1γ, ER (calreticulin), and microtubules (β-tubulin) at 48 h postretransfection. The average staining signal was quantified using ImagePro™ Plus (MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) to determine the mean intensity per pixel for each cell. A total of 30 cells were observed for each staining in each experiment. The data tabulated were based on mean percentage intensity ± S.E. of cells in each category normalized against the untransfected cells from three independent experiments. The confocal microscope was calibrated using intensity calibration beads (Molecular Probes) during each experiment to ensure consistency in the microscope, laser, and detector settings. For total protein analysis, the cells were lysed with GST purification buffer plus 5 mm dithiothreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors prior to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The immunoblot was detected by EF-1δ, EF-1β, EF-1γ, and actin antibodies. Microinjection Studies—Full-length chromogranin B (GenBank™ accession number BC000375) cDNA was cloned in frame into pEGFP-N vector (Clontech). 48 h postretransfection with morpholinos, pEGFP-chromogranin B (50 ng/ml) and pEGFP (5 ng/ml) plasmids were microinjected into the cells using Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171 and Transjector 5246 coupled to an Olympus IX70 microscope. After microinjection, the cells were returned to the incubator for 2 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and mounted with FluorSave™ (Calbiochem) for confocal imaging. The expression of pEGFP-chromogranin B and pEGFP was quantified using ImagePro™ Plus as described above. Luciferase Studies—A cytosolic luciferase (cLuc) construct was generated by cloning the firefly luciferase cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AY738225) in frame into both pEGFP-C and pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen). A membranous luciferase (mLuc) construct was generated by cloning into both pEGFP-C and pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector with an endoplasmic reticulum-targeting sequence of calreticulin (33Fliegel L. Burns K. MacLennan D.H. Reithmeier R.A. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fused to the 5′ end of firefly luciferase cDNA and the ER retention sequence, KDEL, fused to the 3′ end (34Munro S.

Funct. 1996; 21: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 48 h postretransfection with HS1 plus HS2 morpholinos, pcDNA3.1/myc-His-tagged mLuc or cLuc plasmid clones were transiently transfected into the cells. 7 h post-transfection, triplicate wells were used for luciferase activity analysis, and the other triplicate wells were used for mRNA isolation. For luciferase protein activity analysis, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then lysed with luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). The cell lysate was mixed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and allowed to react for 10 s. The luciferase activity was measured for another 10 s using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). For luciferase mRNA analysis, the total mRNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. The luciferase mRNA was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR using primers flanking a region of the luciferase for not more than 20 cycles. The PCR products were quantified using molecular analyst software (Bio-Rad). The data tabulated represent mean percentage luciferase activity per mRNA ± S.E."

Although many sites of mitotic phosphorylation have been identified in core components of the APC/C, the consequence of any individual phosphorylation event has not been elucidated in vivo. In this study, we show that Hcn1 is an essential core component of the fission yeast APC/C and is critical for maintaining complex integrity. Moreover, Hcn1 is a phosphoprotein in vivo.

Although mitotic phase cyclins were the first targets known, many other APC targets have been identified subsequently (4Pines J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), including securin, the destruction of which is required for chromosome segregation (5Cohen-Fix O.

Substrates are recognized by the APC/C based on the presence of short consensus motifs within them, such as the D-box, the KEN motif, and the A-box (8Zachariae W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 2-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The majority of APC/C subunits (at least 13 in yeast) are stably associated throughout the cell cycle in an inactive core complex. The addition of transiently expressed CDC20 protein family members and phosphorylation events contribute to APC/C activation during mitosis and G1 phase. Although active APC/C preparations treated with phosphatase lose activity (9Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.-M. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), it remains unclear which phosphorylation event(s) on which subunit(s) are responsible for this observation. It is also possible that no individual phosphorylation event alone has much effect, but rather it is the combination of many phosphorylation events that serves to alter complex activity. In this regard, it is clear that both CDC20 and core APC/C components are phosphorylated during mitosis. Recently, roles of CDC20 phosphorylation in both positive and negative APC/C regulation have emerged (12Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14D'Angiolella V. Mari C. Nocera D.

Hardwick K.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 231-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several components of the core APC/C are phosphoproteins (18Peters J.-M.

Cullen C.F. Yanagida M. Ohkura H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and in vitro, the purified mitotic protein kinases Cdk1 and Plk (Polo in Drosophila, Cdc5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Plo1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) phosphorylate multiple subunits (1Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To begin tackling the contribution of Cdk1 phosphorylation to APC/C function, all consensus Cdk1 phosphorylation sites in Cdc27 (APC3), Cdc16 (APC6), and Cdc23 (APC8) were altered to alanines (21Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). There were some defects in mitotic exit and Cdc20 binding and increased sensitivity to the spindle checkpoint in cells expressing the APC/C complex missing these serine and threonine residues (21Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the lack of significant defects in the context of previous data indicating an essential role of APC/C phosphorylation argues that critical phosphorylation events were not identified. Indeed, phosphorylation of other subunits in vitro and residual phosphorylation of the subunits targeted for mutagenesis in vivo were detected. A recent investigation of human APC/C phosphorylation by mass spectrometry was more comprehensive in terms of site identification and reported that there are >43 sites of phosphorylation within the human APC/C, 34 of which are specific to mitosis (23Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J. Peters J.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that Cdk1 is able to phosphorylate many of the identified sites on more than three subunits; Plk is able to phosphorylate others, and still other sites are not generated by either of these protein kinases in vitro, suggesting the involvement of additional protein kinases in APC/C regulation. Despite the wealth of data from this study on APC/C phosphorylation sites, the picture is still incomplete, as three APC/C subunits were not identified in the mass spectrometric analysis (23Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J. Peters J.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In terms of the role of these phosphorylation events in APC/C regulation, Cdk1 and Plk phosphorylation increases APC/C activity in vitro in a CDC20-dependent manner (21Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J. Peters J.-M.

Commun. 1999; 260: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the roles of particular phosphorylation events in particular core subunits have not been determined. Interestingly, the timing of phosphorylation events in different subunits was found to vary during mitosis, raising the possibility that distinct phosphorylation events might have different functional consequences (23Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J. Peters J.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We purified the S. pombe APC/C previously using tandem affinity purification and identified a total of 13 core components, including Hcn1, by mass spectrometry (26Yoon H.-J. Feoktistova A. Wolfe B.A. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2048-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hcn1 had been identified previously as a high copy suppressor of a cut9-665 mutant (27Yamashita Y.M. Nakaseko Y. Kumada K. Nakagawa T. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 445-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was assumed to be an APC/C component because of its homology to the S. cerevisiae APC/C component (Cdc26) and because Cdc26 can also suppress cut9 (27Yamashita Y.M. Nakaseko Y. Kumada K. Nakagawa T. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 445-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it had not been shown previously to co-purify with bona fide APC/C components. Here, we have extended our analysis of the role of Hcn1 within the S. pombe APC/C and addressed the role of Hcn1 phosphorylation in cell cycle progression. We found that Hcn1, unlike S. cerevisiae Cdc26, is an essential core APC/C component. It binds Cut9 directly and is required to link different APC/C subcomplexes together. We have mapped the single site of phosphorylation within Hcn1 to Ser48, a consensus site for Cdk1. Mutational analysis indicated that Hcn1 phosphorylation is not an essential modification, but mutation of Ser48 to alanine induced a novel S. pombe APC/C phenotype. hcn1-S48A cells displayed a pronounced delay in the final stages of cell division because of a reduction in the amount of the Ace2 transcription factor. Strains, Media, and Molecular Biology Methods—The S. pombe strains used in this study (Table 1) were grown in yeast extract medium or Edinburgh minimal medium with the appropriate supplements (28Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). Expression of constructs under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt promoter system was performed as described previously (29Siam R. Dolan W.P. Forsburg S.L. Methods (Amst.). 2004; 33: 189-198Google Scholar). Standard genetic and recombinant DNA methods were used except where noted. Gene fragments were obtained by PCR amplification from S. pombe genomic DNA. Yeast transformations were performed using either a lithium acetate method (30Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D.

The isolated small cells were filtered immediately and resuspended in yeast extract medium at the indicated temperatures and allowed to progress through the cell cycle. Samples were collected every 10 or 15 min. Cell cycle synchrony was then monitored by counting the number of nuclei and the septation index. In Vivo Tagging and Gene Deletion—Strains expressing epitope-tagged versions of wild-type and mutant Hcn1 were constructed using a PCR-based approach as described previously (33Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). hcn1+ was tagged at its endogenous locus at its 3′-end with a variety of tag-KanR cassettes, including enhanced green fluorescent protein and Myc13. Appropriate tagging was confirmed by PCR and immunoblot inspection as appropriate. All tagged strains were viable at temperatures ranging from 25 to 36 °C. The hcn1+ coding sequences were replaced with the ura4+ gene using a one-step PCR-based approach as described previously (33Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). The appropriate deletion was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers inside the ura4+ gene and primers outside the disruption cassette. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer, followed by anti-hemagglutinin (HA), anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP), or anti-Myc immunoprecipitations as described previously (32Gould K.L.

Sugnet C.W. Ares Jr., M. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) or Immobilon (Millipore). Immunoblotting was done with anti-HA (12CA5; 0.3 μg/ml), anti-Myc (9E10; 1.1 μg/ml), anti-PSTAIRE peptide (1:5000; Sigma), or anti-GFP (0.2 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) monoclonal antibody. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-IgG secondary antibodies (0.4 mg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:50,000, followed by ECL visualization. Alternatively, affinity-purified Alexa Fluor 680- or IRDye800-conjugated goat anti-IgG antibodies were used as secondary antibodies, followed by scanning and quantitation with Odyssey (LI-COR Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation/Phosphatase Assay—Following immunoprecipitation from denatured cell lysates, Sepharose-bound proteins were washed two times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer and four times with 1 ml of phosphatase buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), divided in half, and pulsed down, and the supernatant was aspirated off. 10-μl reactions composed of 1× phosphatase buffer, 2 mm MnCl2, and 1 μl of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) or 1 μl of H2O were then incubated at 30 °C for 45 min with gentle mixing. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and resuspended in 25 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer. Sucrose Gradient Analysis—For sucrose gradient analysis, cells were grown to mid-log phase in yeast extract medium at 32 °C. Approximately 2 × 108 cells were collected by centrifugation, and native lysates in Nonidet P-40 buffer were prepared as described above. Lysates were layered on 10–30% sucrose gradients prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Gradients were ultracentrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 21 h in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. Sedimentation markers (thyroglobulin for 19 S and aldolase for 11.3 S) were fractionated on gradients prepared and spun in parallel. Fractions were collected, run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, and then immunoblotted as described above. Purification and Analyses of Lid1-TAP Complexes—8-liter cultures of lid1-TAP and lid1-TAP hcn1::ura4+ leu1-32:: nmt81hcn1cDNA were grown to log phase, and the tagged proteins were isolated as described (36Gould K.L. Ren L. Feoktistova A.S. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Methods (Amst.). 2004; 33: 239-244Google Scholar). The TAP complex was analyzed by direct analysis of large protein complexes/tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (37Ohi M.D. Link A.J. Ren L. Jennings J.L. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2011-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, the TAP complexes prepared from lid1-TAP hcn1-S48A and cut9-TAP were analyzed differently in that they were run by three-phase multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) on an LTQ instrument (Thermo Electron Corp.). The three-phase MudPIT was set up as described (38McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Miyamoto D.T. Mitchison T.J. Yates III, J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 219: 245-251Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, 12 elution steps were included in the three-phase MudPIT experiments. For each salt elution, 2 μl of ammonium acetate was injected through an autosampler (FAMOS). The concentration of salt used for each step was 0 mm, 10 mm, 25 mm, 50 mm, 100 mm, 200 mm, 300 mm, 400 mm, 600 mm, 800 mm, 1 m, and 5 m, respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study was described previously (39James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs of APC subunits were cloned into the bait plasmid pGBT9 and/or the prey plasmid pGAD424 and sequenced to ensure the absence of PCR-induced mutations and that the correct reading frame had been retained. To test for protein interactions, both bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into S. cerevisiae strain PJ69-4A. β-Galactosidase reporter enzyme activity in the two-hybrid strains was measured using a Galacto-Star™ chemiluminescent reporter assay system (Tropix Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception that cells were lysed by glass bead disruption. Each sample was measured in triplicate. Reporter assays were recorded on a Mediators PhL luminometer (Aureon Biosystems). Phosphoamino Acid Analysis and Tryptic Peptide Mapping—32P-Labeled Hcn1-Myc13 or Hcn1-GFP (bound to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane) was used for phosphoamino acid analysis or tryptic peptide mapping as described previously (40Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 41Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—All bacterially produced recombinant proteins were purified on amylose beads (for maltose-binding protein (MBP)). Approximately 100 ng of recombinant Cdk1 kinase complex, purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described (26Yoon H.-J. Feoktistova A. Wolfe B.A. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2048-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was used to phosphorylate ∼1 μg of bacterially produced MBP-Hcn1 in HB15 buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 10 μm unlabeled ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of sample buffer. Samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography were performed for the detection of proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Gene Replacement—Serines within Hcn1 were changed to alanines using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate a gene replacement strain, the hcn1-S48A mutation in a genomic clone contained in pIRT2 was transformed into the heterozygous hcn1+/ hcn1::ura4+ diploid strain. Leu+ diploids were allowed to sporulate, and Leu+ Ura+ haploid progeny were isolated. These were grown overnight in minimal medium containing uracil and leucine. The following day, 3 × 107 cells were plated on minimal medium containing uracil, leucine, and 1 mg/ml 5-fluroorotic acid. Ura– Leu– colonies were then selected. To confirm that the correct gene replacement was present within these cells, the relevant genomic DNA of hcn1 was amplified by whole cell PCR using oligonucleotides hcn1-For2 (5′-cctctcttgctttttcatccttg-3′) and hcn1-Rev (5′-cagcagtatggaggcaggtgtg-3′). The PCR product was sequenced directly using oligonucleotide hcn1-For1 (5′-catgttacgaagaaatcctacg-3′). To confirm that Hcn1 is a constitutive APC component, the locus encoding hcn1+ was modified to produce Hcn1-GFP or Hcn1-Myc13, and the Myc-tagged allele was combined with cut9-HA3. In an anti-HA immunoprecipitate from hcn1-Myc13 cut9-HA3, both Hcn1-Myc13 and Cut9-HA3 were detected, and conversely, in an anti-Myc immunoprecipitate, both Hcn1-Myc13 and Cut9-HA3 were detected (Fig. 1A). We next tested whether the association between these proteins is constant during the cell cycle. Small G2 phase cells of the hcn1-Myc13 cut9-HA3 strain were collected by centrifugal elutriation and released into fresh medium to obtain a synchronous cell population. Samples were taken every 15 min and used for anti-Myc immunopurification. The amount of Hcn1-Myc13 from every time point was constant, and the amount of co-purified Cut9-HA3 was constant through the entire cell cycle, although its phosphorylation state changed as evidenced by lower mobility forms (Fig. 1B) (20Yamada H. Kumada K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Hcn1-Myc13 co-sedimented in a sucrose gradient with Cut9-HA3 (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that Hcn1 is a core component of the APC/C. To determine whether Hcn1 is essential for viability, hcn1+ was deleted by replacing it with the ura4+ gene in a diploid. Tetrad analysis of the correct heterozygous diploids gave rise to two viable Ura– colonies and two nonviable colonies (data not shown), indicating that hcn1+ is essential. To examine the consequence of Hcn1 loss to APC/C function, a conditional null allele of hcn1+ was constructed by placing it under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt81 promoter (42Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) in the hcn1::ura4+ mutant background. The resultant strain was normal when grown in the absence of thiamine, but depletion of hcn1+ through the addition of thiamine led to cell death. These cells failed to segregate their DNA properly, displaying a “cut” phenotype (Fig. 1D) typical of APC/C mutants (43Yanagida M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 144-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Hcn1 is essential for S. pombe viability most likely because of a lack of APC/C activity. Because Hcn1 loss resulted in a phenotype similar to those of other mutants that affect assembly of the APC/C (20Yamada H. Kumada K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yoon H.-J. Feoktistova A. Wolfe B.A. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Gould K.L. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2535-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the integrity of the APC/C complex in the absence of Hcn1 was examined by sucrose gradient sedimentation. When hcn1+ was normally expressed, both Lid1-Myc13 and Cut23-Myc13 sedimented in a peak at ∼20 S as expected (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Lid1-Myc13 and Cut23-Myc13 shifted into smaller complexes when expression of hcn1+ was repressed (Fig. 2A). Because Cut23-Myc13 sedimented in a smaller complex than the subcomplex containing Lid1-Myc13, it seemed possible that the loss of Hcn1 split the APC/C into at least two distinct parts. To determine which APC/C subunits remained in the Lid1 subcomplex, we purified Lid1-TAP from the conditional hcn1+ shutoff strain. Compared with the wild-type complex on a silver-stained gel, significant numbers of proteins were diminished in abundance or were absent (Fig. 2B). Mass spectrometric analysis of this complex revealed that Cut4, Apc2, Lid1, Apc5, Apc11, and perhaps Apc15 were present at at least 25% the recovery in hcn1+ cells, but the recovery of other components was reduced more significantly (Table 2). Although this technique is not quantitative, it does suggest that specific components remain associated with Lid1 in the absence of Hcn1, whereas others do not. We concluded that Hcn1 helps link the Lid1-containing subcomplex to other APC/C subunits.TABLE 2Effect of Hcn1 on Lid1-TAP compositionComponentMasslid1-TAP mts3-1lid1-TAP mts3-1 hcn1::ura4 leu1-32::nmt81hcn1lid1-TAP mts3-1 hcn1-S48AaThese data were acquired on the more sensitive LTQ mass spectrometer.kDaCut4165.4412380Apc280.5201443Nuc276.232651Lid182.6191044Apc585.3321943Cut975.922153Cut2360.418433Apc1021.54010Apc1110.5525Hcn19.1418Apc1315.64010Apc1412.15010Apc1515.7216a These data were acquired on the more sensitive LTQ mass spectrometer. Open table in a new tab To determine which component(s) interacted directly with Hcn1 to bridge the Lid1-TAP subcomplex to other subunits, we performed a series of directed two-hybrid analyses between Hcn1 and other APC/C components with only Cut4 and Apc15 not included in the analyses. Hcn1 interacted with only Cut9 (Fig. 2C), offering an explanation for the isolation of hcn1+ as a high copy suppressor of the cut9-665 mutation (20Yamada H. Kumada K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to testing Hcn1 two-hybrid interactions, we examined pairwise interactions among other APC/C subunits, again with the exception of Cut4 and Apc15. The following interactions were the only ones detected: Apc2 showed a strong interaction with Apc11; Nuc2 interacted with Apc10; Lid1 interacted with Apc5; and Cut23 interacted with Apc13 (Fig. 2C). These interactions are consistent with the mass spectrometric data of the Lid1-TAP complex obtained above, as well as with other data regarding subcomplexes of the APC/C observed in other organisms (45Vodermaier H.C.

https://openalex.org/W2168618218,"Tel-Abl and Tel-Jak2 are fusion proteins associated with human haematologic neoplasms. They possess constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and activate common downstream signalling pathways like Stat-5, PI3-K/Akt, Ras/MapK and NF-κB. In this study, we showed the specific requirement of Src family members for the Tel-Abl-mediated cell growth, activation of Stat5, PI3-K/Akt and Ras/MapK while dispensable for Tel-Jak2. Hck was found strongly phosphorylated in Tel-Abl-expressing Ba/F3 cells and sensitive to imatinib mesylate treatment, providing evidence that Hck is a target of Tel-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Overexpression of a kinase dead form of Hck inhibits the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing Tel-Abl as the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2. These results argue for an important role of Hck in Tel-Abl oncogenic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2124906250,"Telomeres of tumor cells form telomeric aggregates (TAs) within the three-dimensional (3D) interphase nucleus. Some of these TAs represent end-to-end chromosomal fusions and may subsequently initiate breakage–bridge–fusion cycles. Wild-type (wt) and myc box II mutant (mt) Myc induce different types of genomic instability when conditionally expressed in mouse proB cells (Ba/F3). Only wt Myc overexpressing Ba/F3 cells are capable of tumor formation in severe combined immunodeficient mice. In this study, we investigated whether telomere dysfunction leading to TA formation is linked to the genetic changes that permit wt c-Myc-dependent transformation of Ba/F3 cells. To this end, we examined the 3D organization of telomeres after the deregulated expression of deletion myc boxII mutant (Δ106) or wt Myc. Δ106-Myc overexpression did not induce TAs, whereas wt-Myc deregulation did. Instead, Δ106-Myc remodelled the 3D telomeric organization such that telomeres aligned in the center of the 3D interphase nucleus forming a telomeric disk owing to a Δ106-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest. In contrast, wt-Myc overexpression led to distorted telomere distribution and TA formation. Analysis of chromosomal alterations using spectral karyotyping confirmed Δ106-Myc and wt-Myc-associated genomic instability. A significant number of chromosomal end-to-end fusions indicative of telomere dysfunction were noted in wt-Myc-expressing cells only. This study suggests that TAs may play a fundamental role in Myc-induced tumorigenesis and provides a novel way to dissect tumor initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2070006343,"High-Mr thioredoxin reductase from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfTrxR) contains three redox active centers (FAD, Cys-88/Cys-93, and Cys-535/Cys-540) that are in redox communication. The catalytic mechanism of PfTrxR, which involves dithiol-disulfide interchanges requiring acid-base catalysis, was studied by steady-state kinetics, spectral analyses of anaerobic static titrations, and rapid kinetics analysis of wild-type enzyme and variants involving the His-509-Glu-514 dyad as the presumed acid-base catalyst. The dyad is conserved in all members of the enzyme family. Substitution of His-509 with glutamine and Glu-514 with alanine led to TrxR with only 0.5 and 7% of wild type activity, respectively, thus demonstrating the crucial roles of these residues for enzymatic activity. The H509Q variant had rate constants in both the reductive and oxidative half-reactions that were dramatically less than those of wild-type enzyme, and no thiolateflavin charge-transfer complex was observed. Glu-514 was shown to be involved in dithiol-disulfide interchange between the Cys-88/Cys-93 and Cys-535/Cys-540 pairs.

Thus, the function of the thioredoxin system is crucial for cell proliferation, protection against reactive oxygen species, and signal transduction.

Tumor cells and malarial parasites have many common features, including high metabolic rates and rapid cell division. Approximately 500 million cases of malaria caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium are reported annually, resulting in up to 3 million deaths, 75% of them being African children. Malaria not only has major health implications, but also causes substantial economic losses running into the billions of dollars in endemic areas. Because of increasing resistances of the parasites against antimalarial drugs, new and better chemotherapies are urgently required (9Maitland K. Makanga M. Williams T.N. Curr. Opin. Infect.

Plasmodium lacks both glutathione peroxidase and catalase, indicating that the thioredoxin system is particularly important for multiple roles, including reduction of glutathione, protection against oxidative stress, and biosynthesis of thymine. Indeed, TrxR has already been genetically validated in Plasmodium as a drug target (11Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Cowman A.F. Müller S. J. Biol.

These homodimeric proteins contain three redox-active centers that are in redox communication: a tightly bound FAD, a pair of redox-active cysteines on one of the subunits that we will refer to as the N-terminal pair (Cys-88 and Cys-93 in Scheme 1, for PfTrxR), and a pair of redox-active cysteines or a cysteine-selenocysteine pair that we will refer to as the C-terminal pair (Cys-535′ and Cys-540′, for PfTrxR) located on the second subunit (15Williams C.H.

The reductive and oxidative half-reactions of Drosophila melanogaster TrxR (DmTrxR) have been examined in some detail to obtain a better understanding of the underlying catalytic mechanism of high-Mr TrxRs. Scheme 1, which outlines the various intermediates and redox reactions, resulted from these studies (25Bauer H. Massey V. Arscott L.D. Schirmer R.H. Ballou D.P. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33020-33028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In catalysis, reducing equivalents are transferred through the active site redox centers of the homodimeric protein to effect reduction of thioredoxin disulfide (Scheme 1). NADPH reduces the FAD on the re side of the isoalloxazine ring to form the FADH– to NADP+ charge-transfer complex (CTC). The reduced flavin is reoxidized by the N-terminal disulfide on the si side of the flavin ring to form a thiolate-flavin charge-transfer complex between Cys-93 (flavin-interacting thiol) and the FAD. The nascent interchange thiol (Cys-88) reacts with the C-terminal disulfide (Cys-535-Cys-540) in a dithiol-disulfide interchange reaction, and finally, the C-terminal dithiol reduces Trx (a 13-kDa protein) in another dithiol-disulfide interchange. These intermediates can be observed by analyses of spectral changes at diagnostic wavelengths (see Table 1). From this description and Scheme 1, it can be seen that catalysis involves cycling between the EH2 and EH4 redox states. The reduction of Eox by NADPH is a priming reaction.TABLE 1Spectral properties of selected P. falciparum TrxR enzyme speciesEnzyme speciesaFor nomenclature of the enzyme species, see text and Scheme 1.Characteristic wavelengthϵ at the characteristic wavelengthϵ at distinct wavelengths440 nm540 nm670 nmnmmm-1 cm-1mm-1 cm-1Eox46211.38.7∼0.4∼0.2EH2A or EH4A462bWhen enzyme-bound FAD is reduced to FADH-, a large fraction of the visible absorbance is lost.

Dithiol-disulfide interchange reactions, such as that between the N-terminal dithiol and the C-terminal disulfide, require the assistance of an acid-base catalyst, as shown for disulfide oxidoreductases such as glutathione reductase. Structural studies of human glutathione reductase revealed that two amino acid residues, histidine and glutamic acid, are juxtaposed to the N-terminal disulfide; these residues are present in a highly conserved HPXXXE motif. The NE2 of the imidazole ring of this histidine is near the interchange-thiol of the N-terminal pair, while the epsilon carboxyl of glutamic acid appears to be hydrogen bonded to ND1 of this same histidine (28Pai E.F.

Therefore, this His-Glu dyad is ideally positioned to promote dithiol-disulfide interchange between the active site cysteines and glutathione during catalysis by glutathione reductase. In addition to the structural results, rapid kinetics analyses of glutathione reductase and the highly related dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase showed that an acid-base catalyst is necessary for full catalytic activity (31Benen J. van Berkel W.

In TrxR from P. falciparum, which has considerable sequence homology to mouse TrxR, His-509 and Glu-514 comprise the analogous His-Glu dyad. The properties of site-directed variants of the residue analogous to His-509 have been studied in most of the members of this enzyme family. However, the conserved glutamate has only been experimentally examined previously in lipoamide dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase (31Benen J. van Berkel W. Dieteren N. Arscott D.

The role of the glutamate in the acid-base dyad has also been studied by molecular dynamics and density functional calculations, which predict its importance in making histidine a better catalyst (26Brandt W. Wessjohann L.A. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The role of acid-base catalysis in the mechanism of high-Mr TrxRs has not been completely addressed. Therefore this study focuses on acid-base catalysis in the reaction cycle of the high-Mr TrxR from the malaria parasite, P. falciparum. Knowledge of the precise roles of individual active site residues of the Plasmodium enzyme will increase our understanding of differences in the catalytic mechanisms between parasite and mammalian TrxR. This knowledge will, together with the known structural differences, be useful for the design of inhibitors that selectively act against the Plasmodium protein (see below).

NADPH was from Melford and 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), methyl viologen, sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite), and sodium borohydride were from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis—P. falciparum TrxR wild-type cloned in pJC40 (19Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. J. Biol.

Recombinant Expression and Purification of TrxR Wild-type and Variant Proteins—After the sequences of all PfTrxRs expression constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (The Sequencing Service, University of Dundee), they were transformed into E. coli BLR (DE3), and expression of recombinant proteins was performed as previously described (19Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29584-29589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified in a batch procedure using Ni-NTA agarose according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen).

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE before the PfTrxR proteins were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate for long term storage at 4 °C. Before use, the proteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6 containing 1 mm EDTA. PfTrxR was isolated in the oxidized state, in contrast to DmTrxR that was partially reduced when isolated and required oxidation with ferricyanide prior to use (25Bauer H. Massey V. Arscott L.D.

The integrity of the variant proteins was verified by circular dichroism analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—The steady-state kinetic parameters of PfTrxR with NADPH and thioredoxin or DTNB were analyzed by two different spectrophotometric assay systems: (i) DTNB-reduction was measured in an assay mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, with varying concentrations of NADPH (0.5–200 μm), 1–20 μg of TrxR (wild-type or variants) to determine the Km for NADPH. The increase of absorbance at 412 nm was followed spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu UVPC 2501), and the specific activities of PfTrxR wild-type or variants were determined using the molar extinction coefficient of TNB– released during the reaction (13,600 m–1 cm–1 per TNB– released) (39Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The reduction of thioredoxin was assayed according to Luthman and Holmgren (40Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg ml–1 insulin, 0.5 to 20 μg of TrxR (wild-type and variants) and varying concentrations of Trx (2–50 μm) at 200 μm NADPH to determine the Km values for Trx. The change in absorbance because of the oxidation of NADPH was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, and the specific activities were calculated using the extinction coefficient of 6,220 m–1 cm–1. Static Anaerobic Titrations with NADPH or Dithionite—Wild-type or variant PfTrxR (10–15 μm in 1 ml), freshly dialyzed (against 50 mm potassium phosphate containing 1 mm ETDA, pH 7.6) was transferred into an anaerobic cuvette and made anaerobic using ∼10 cycles of argon/vacuum before 2-μl additions of anaerobic NADPH (1.5 mm) were titrated into the protein solution as described previously (23Wang P.F. Arscott L.D. Gilberger T.W. Müller S. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After each addition of NADPH, spectra of the proteins between 350 nm and 700 nm were recorded in a Cary 300 spectrophotometer (Varian). The proteins were also anaerobically reduced with sodium dithionite (41Prongay A.J. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25181-25188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium dithionite was dissolved in anaerobic 50 mm pyrophosphate, pH 9.0 to give a final concentration of ∼1.5 mm. Additions of this stock solution (5 μl) were titrated into the anaerobic wild-type PfTrxR or variant proteins and spectra between 350 nm and 700 nm were recorded in a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. Reductive Half-reactions, Stopped-flow Rapid Kinetics—The reactions of PfTrxR wild-type and variants with NADPH at pH 7.6 were recorded using a SF-61 DX2 double mixing stopped-flow system (Hi-Tech). Anaerobic wild-type or variant PfTrxR (30 μm) was mixed with 0.5 to 6 (for Kd calculations) equivalents of anaerobic NADPH at 5 °C, and the reductive half-reactions were followed using either the photodiode array mode, when changes of the complete spectra of the proteins were followed (between 300 nm and 700 nm), or the photomultiplier mode when changes at single diagnostic wavelengths (355, 440, 540, and 670 nm, see Table 1) were analyzed. Effect of pH on the Reductive Half-reaction of Wild-type and H509Q PfTrxR—The effect of increasing pH on the reductive half-reaction was analyzed by dialyzing the protein into a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.0, 7.6, and 8.2 before reacting it with 0.5–12 equivalents of anaerobic NADPH in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Oxidative Half-reactions, Stopped-flow Rapid Kinetics—Wild-type or variant PfTrxR (40 μm) were anaerobically reduced either with 2.2 equivalents of dithionite or 2.2 equivalents of NADPH to produce EH4. The reduced enzymes were then mixed with 3–20 equivalents of PfTrx in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer and the reactions were followed until comple"

The mutated gene, Bloom protein (BLM), encodes a DNA helicase that functions in genome maintenance via roles in recombination repair and resolution of recombination structures. We designed substrates representing illegitimate recombination intermediates formed when a displaced DNA flap generated during maturation of Okazaki fragments escapes cleavage by flap endonuclease-1 and anneals to a complementary ectopic DNA site. Results show that displaced, replication protein A (RPA)-coated flaps could readily bind and ligate at the complementary site to initiate recombination. RPA also displayed a strand-annealing activity that hastens the rate of recombination intermediate formation. BLM helicase activity could directly disrupt annealing at the ectopic site and promote flap endonuclease-1 cleavage. Additionally, BLM has its own strand-annealing and strand-exchange activities. RPA inhibited the BLM strand-annealing activity, thereby promoting helicase activity and complex dissolution. BLM strand exchange could readily dissociate invading flaps, e.g. in a D-loop, if the exchange step did not involve annealing of RPA-coated strands. Use of ATP to activate the helicase function did not aid flap displacement by exchange, suggesting that this is a helicase-independent mechanism of complex dissociation. When RPA could bind, it displayed its own strand-exchange activity. We interpret these results to explain how BLM is well equipped to deal with alternative recombination intermediate structures.

Additionally, BLM has been proposed to promote proper intermediate resolution and suppress crossovers in the homologous recombination pathway (14Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). BLM potentially assists in resolution of illegitimate recombination intermediates through the utilization of three main enzymatic activities. BLM possesses a helicase function, driven by a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, observed in the presence of single-stranded DNA (15Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Its helicase activity is structure-specific, preferentially unwinding substrates that simulate replication and recombination intermediates such as forked duplexes and four-way junctions with Holliday structure (10Karow J.K.

Always displaying a 3′ to 5′ polarity, it prefers to unwind partial duplex substrates that are <71 nucleotides long and has difficulty with both substrates longer than 259 nucleotides and with blunt-ended DNA duplexes (10Karow J.K.

BLM helicase activity is also stimulated by ssDNA-binding protein RPA in a length-dependent manner (19Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). BLM stimulates topoisomerase IIIα to relax negatively coiled DNA, a DNA configuration that may affect the maximum length of DNA substrates that BLM can unwind (20Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two proteins can also form a complex that helps to suppress inadvertent recombination and breaks up DNA base mismatches while facilitating the resolution of recombination intermediates (14Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). BLM and other RecQ family members can also utilize a recently discovered strand-pairing activity to promote the annealing of complementary DNA (21Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Matson S.W. Orren D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23397-23407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Cheok C.F. Wu L. Garcia P.L. Janscak P. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3932-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Like RecQ family member Werner protein, BLM contains a conserved domain called RQC (RecQ C-terminal) that forms a winged-helix structure exploited to bind DNA (23Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Additionally, BLM contains a motif called HRDC (helicase and RNase D C-terminal) that when folded creates another DNA binding site (24Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The multiple DNA binding domains allow BLM to bind two or more single-stranded DNA oligomers simultaneously, bringing them together and facilitating strand annealing. This property of BLM would seem counteractive of its role in breaking up recombination intermediates, because with the annealing property BLM can actually promote the binding of short (<50 nt) uncleaved DNA flaps to complementary regions, thus creating illegitimate recombination intermediates. The strand-annealing property has been reported to work in conjunction with helicase activity in the presence of ATP to promote strand exchange (21Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Matson S.W. Orren D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23397-23407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been shown that BLM possesses the ability to catalyze branch migration unidirectionally through long stretches of DNA and act on recombination intermediates containing a Holliday junction in an ATP-dependent manner (10Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). BLM binds and stimulates cleavage activity of the flap endonuclease (FEN1) (26Wang W. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5391-5399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The primary role of FEN1 is thought to be removal of the RNA primer of Okazaki fragments by flap cleavage. This suggests that BLM is a component of the DNA replication machinery. Current models of Okazaki fragment processing suggest that a subset of flaps becomes 20–40 nucleotides long prior to cleavage (27Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). At that length, single-stranded binding protein RPA can bind to the flap and inhibit FEN1 cleavage. The helicase/nuclease Dna2, having a cleavage activity that is stimulated by RPA, will bind and cleave the long flap (27Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This will leave a flap of ∼5–7 nucleotides, which FEN1 will subsequently cleave to form a ligatable nick (28Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A likely role of BLM is to prevent these longer single-stranded flaps from forming productive recombination intermediates at ectopic sites before they are correctly processed by Dna2. We show that BLM can disrupt recombination intermediates by helicase function. Further, we demonstrate that these intermediates can be disrupted in an ATP and helicase-independent manner by BLM strand-annealing activity and promotion of branch migration. The presence of RPA adds another dimension because it has its own strand-annealing activity that can promote flap annealing to form recombination intermediates. This activity suggests a need for BLM to inhibit illegitimate recombination during Okazaki fragment processing. Materials—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were bought from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The T4 polynucleotide kinase (labeling grade), the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ATP were from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were of the best available commercial grade. Enzyme Expression and Purification—Recombinant human FEN1 was expressed with the T7 expression plasmid pET-FCH and purified as described previously (29Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recombinant human BLM was expressed in yeast strain JEL1 transformed with pJK1. BLM was purified as described previously (15Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Recombinant human DNA ligase I was cloned into T7 expression plasmid pET-15B (Novagen, WI) and was purified as described previously (30Henricksen L.A. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant human RPA was provided by Dr. Mark Wold and had been purified as described previously (31Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Substrates—Oligomer sequences are listed in Table 1. Sequences were designed to represent a long flap Okazaki fragment maturation intermediate that annealed to complementary ssDNA to form an illegitimate recombination intermediate. Labeling and purification of substrates were performed as described below. Using standard procedures, substrates U2 and T2 were radiolabeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To 3′-end-label flap substrates F0, F3, and F20, 20 pmol of each substrate was annealed to 50 pmol of template T2 modified with a 5′-G overhang. Each flap substrate was extended by adding Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. Both the 5′- and 3′-end radiolabeled substrates were purified on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences (5′-3′)Upstream primers U126-mersCGA CCG TGC CAG CCT AAA TTT CAA TA U220-mersGTC GTA TTG TAC GCT ACG CATemplates T151-mersGCA GGA GGT GGC GTC GGG TGG ACG GGA TTG AAA TTT AGG CTG GCA CGG TCG T257-mersTCG AGA CCT CTG TTT CCA AGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT GTG CGT AGC GTA CAA TAC GACFlapsFunction as T1 downstream primers and T2 upstream primers F2063-mersCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TAC GGT CGT GAC TGG GAA AAC CA C CCG TCC ACC CGA CGC CAC CTC CTG F346-mersCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TAC GGA CCC GTC CAC CCG ACG CCA CCT CCT G F043-mersCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TAC CCC GTC CAC CCG ACG CCA CCT CCT G Exchange substratesC157-mersGTC GTA TTG TAC GCT ACG CAC ACT GGC CGT CGT TTT ACT TGG AAA CAG AGG TCT CGAC237-mersCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TAC TTG GAA ACA GAG GTC TCG A Open table in a new tab The recombination intermediate complex containing T1, U1, F, U2, and T2 was constructed in two consecutive steps. When any F-strand was the radiolabeled substrate, T1, U1, and F were annealed together at a molar ratio of 2:4:1, whereas U2 and T2 were annealed together separately at a ratio of 4:2. For annealing, the oligomers were placed in 50 μl of annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixture was then placed at 70 °C and allowed to cool down to room temperature over the course of 2 h. The separate reactions (T1: U1:F and T2:U2) were then mixed together, placed at 37 °C for 1 h, and then allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight to achieve full annealing. Using this method, 80% of the labeled substrate was consistently incorporated into the desired complex. When U2 was the radiolabeled substrate, the molar ratios were 3:4:2:3:1 (T1:U1:F:U2:T2), respectively. When T2 was the radiolabeled substrate, the molar ratios were 3:4:2:2:1 (T1:U1:F:U2:T2), respectively. Enzyme Assays—Reactions were performed in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4 mm MgCl2 with or without 2 mm ATP. Enzyme stocks were diluted in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each reaction contained 5 fmol of radiolabeled substrate in a 20-μl reaction mixture with varying amounts of the enzymes as indicated in the figure legends. All assays were incubated at 37 °C for the specified times. Any assays that required dissociation of the complex for analysis (ligase assays, etc.) were stopped by the addition of 2× termination dye (95% formamide v/v with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole) followed by 5 min at 95 °C, and then resolved on 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels, run at 80 watts for 90 min. Any assays that required the complex to remain intact were stopped by the addition of 2× helicase dye (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanole). These were immediately run on a native 12% polyacrylamide gel at 25 watts for 3 h. Each gel was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software from Amersham Biosciences. In all studies, the quantitated amounts of substrates and products were utilized to calculate the percentage of product formation from the product/(product plus substrate) ratio. This method allows for the correction of any loading errors among lanes. The graphed data points were calculated by quantifying the pixel density of each band and subtracting the measurable background pixel density. The percentages of strand annealing, strand exchange, and helicase activities were calculated as the amount of labeled DNA in the final product band divided by the total amount of DNA from all bands in the gel lane. In most assays, 100 fmol of BLM was found to be sufficient for demonstrating BLM-related activities. At 50 fmol, RPA is approximately equimolar to the recombination intermediate complex because of all of the excess DNA needed to ensure that all (or almost all) of the labeled substrate is in complex. Because each assay contained ∼50 fmol of single-stranded DNA, 50 fmol of RPA was used in all non-titration assays to maintain the 1:1 RPA:ssDNA ratio. Creating Illegitimate Recombination Intermediates—We hypothesize that normal eukaryotic DNA replication produces intermediates that can lead to illegitimate recombination. Here we examine the functional activities of BLM and how they work on such intermediates to promote genome stability. The creation of a long flap during Okazaki fragment processing and participation of the flap in recombination are diagramed (Fig. 1A). We designed a series of complexes that simulate this illegitimate recombination intermediate (Fig. 1B). The basic structure consists of two templates (T); T1, which is the template for Okazaki fragment synthesis, and T2, the alternative template to which the displaced flap can anneal. The primer U1, upstream with respect to synthesis, represents the newly synthesized Okazaki fragment displacing the flap. It is annealed to the 3′-end of template T1 and forms a 1-nucleotide 3′ overhang flap at the annealing point of the downstream flap substrate F, creating the favored FEN1 cleavage substrate. The upstream primer U2 represents the newly synthesized DNA from utilization of template T2. This has been included in the complex such that, when the flap substrate (F) is annealed, U2 and F can be ligated together to represent an additional step in the recombination reaction. Although flaps processed during Okazaki fragment maturation contain small RNA primers at their 5′-ends, the F flap DNA oligonucleotides were designed as we would presume the recombined flap structure to be prior to ligation in vivo. Even though annealing of the flap inhibits FEN1 endonucleolytic cleavage, RNase H or FEN1 exonucleolytic activity should degrade the RNA at the end of the flap. The resulting DNA terminus would then be free for ligation to create a stable recombination intermediate. Substrates F20, F3, and F0 annealed to T1 are designed to represent un-cleaved flaps created during Okazaki maturation. When also inappropriately annealed to T2 they form crossovers with ∼20, 3, and 0 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA between the two templates, respectively, depending on whether partial melting occurs in complexes with flap substrates F3 and F0. These central nucleotides were not complementary to any part of the templates, allowing them to remain single-stranded. For flap substrates, the 3′-end was complementary to the 5′-end of the template T1. The 5′-end that forms the flap can be annealed to template T2 to form the illegitimate recombination intermediate. There are two substrates used for strand exchange experiments. Exchange substrate C1 is the complementary sequence to template T2. When utilized during strand exchange, it will anneal to cause the dissociation of both the flap and U2 from template T2. C2 represents the correct pairing partner for the section of T2 encompassing the downstream ssDNA portion as well as the annealing region of the flap substrates. If annealed, C2 would displace the flap substrates only, leaving U2 bound to T2 and creating a ligatable substrate. The sequences of the strands used to produce all of these structures are given in Table 1. Long Flaps Can Readily form Recombination Intermediates—Okazaki fragment flaps exceeding 27 nucleotides in length are proposed to be coated by the single-stranded binding protein RPA (27Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 32Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We assessed whether an RPA-coated flap would anneal to an ectopic site and ligate to an adjacent primer. For the measurement, we formed two different structures. The annealing of these structures is the readout of the experiment. The first was composed of oligomers T1, U1, and F20, to simulate the dsDNA Okazaki fragment/template DNA with the ssDNA unprocessed flap. The second was composed of oligomers U2 and T2 representing the complementary ssDNA to which the unprocessed flap might bind. We found that RPA possesses its own strand-annealing activity and will promote annealing of the flap complex to the complementary template in the absence of BLM (Fig. 2A). This is seemingly contradictory to earlier reports that RPA disrupts the formation of recombination intermediates by both actively promoting strand unwinding after their formation, and by preventing the annealing of single-stranded DNA in the presence of annealing advocates Werner protein and BLM (34Machwe A. Lozada E.M. Xiao L. Orren D.K. BMC Mol. Biol. 2006; 7: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that RPA promotes strand unwinding as well. The combined effects should produce an equilibrium in which the rate of RPA-induced ssDNA strand annealing is equivalent to the rate of RPA-induced dsDNA dissociation (Fig. 2B). In the absence of BLM, only 5.8% of the labeled flap F20 annealed to template T2 after 120 min without RPA present, whereas 35.7% of the flap annealed with 50 fmol of RPA present (1:1 ratio with DNA), a 6-fold increase. Conversely, 23% of the normally stable complex was deconstructed in 120 min in the presence of RPA. However, over 73% of the fully annealed complex was also ligated by human DNA ligase I, showing that RPA-coated strands are readily ligatable (data not shown). This observation is consistent with earlier reports showing that RPA stimulates the activity of DNA ligase I (35Ranalli T.A. DeMott M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1719-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that RPA-coated flaps, expected to be produced during Okazaki fragment processing, can equilibrate with an ectopic site to readily form recombination intermediates. BLM Strand-annealing activity Promotes Recombination—Three RecQ members, including BLM, possess a strand-pairing activity in which they promote single-stranded DNA annealing (21Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Matson S.W. Orren D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23397-23407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 36Cheok C.F. Bachrati C.Z. Chan K.L. Ralf C. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because our recombination intermediate complex model is derived from an unprocessed ssDNA flap binding to a complementary ssDNA strand, we wanted to test whether the addition of BLM would actually accelerate the formation of the intermediate. This action would counteract BLM helicase activity, which works to disrupt the complex. For the measurement, we utilized the same structures that were used to measure RPA strand annealing (flap substrate T1:U1:F20 and complementary template U2:T2). We found that BLM greatly accelerated the formation of the recombination intermediate complex compared with the formation in the absence of enzyme. Specifically, 73% of the label, which was on F20 of the unprocessed flap complex, was found in the recombination intermediate complex after 10 min, compared with only 1.1% in the reaction without BLM (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001; data not shown). Over 8 h were necessary for the unassisted reaction to approach the level of strand annealing seen in the presence of BLM (data not shown). ATP was then added to the reaction to ascertain the simultaneous effects of the helicase and annealing activities. After an early spike in the formation of the recombination intermediate, equilibrium between BLM helicase activity and BLM strand annealing was achieved at ∼10 min, as the amount of formed recombination intermediate leveled off at ∼30% of the labeled DNA (Fig. 3A). A slow increase in the intermediate over the next 2 h may have been due to some depletion of ATP by BLM helicase activity. Alternatively, the helicase activity may be less stable than the annealing activity. RPA Directly Blocks BLM Strand-annealing Activity—Others have found that RPA inhibits the strand-annealing property of BLM family members RECQ4 (37Macris M.A. Krejci L. Bussen W. Shimamoto A. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and RECQ5β (38Garcia P.L. Liu Y. Jiricny J. West S.C. Janscak P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, RPA also prevents the re-annealing of ssDNA substrates after BLM helicase activity dissociates them, presumably by binding the ssDNA and blocking re-annealing (34Machwe A. Lozada E.M. Xiao L. Orren D.K. BMC Mol. Biol. 2006; 7: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because we found that RPA actually facilitates annealing of ssDNA in the absence of BLM, we decided to test whether the effect seen previously was due to RPA blocking BLM strand annealing directly rather than the indirect effect of slowing the annealing of ssDNA. We found that addition of RPA causes a reduction in BLM strand annealing (Fig. 3B). In the absence of RPA, 100 fmol of BLM promoted the annealing of 75% of the labeled flap substrate (T1:U1:F20*) to the complementary template (U2:T2) after 30 min. A titration of RPA revealed a progressive decrease in BLM strand-annealing activity such that, at 250 fmol of RPA, BLM strand-annealing activity was completely blocked (Fig. 3C). Because the level of BLM strand annealing decreased to the level of RPA strand annealing, we suggest that the results seen previously were not due to RPA inhibiting the re-annealing of ssDNA substrates after BLM helicase activity, but rather RPA blocking the robust strand-annealing activity of BLM. This interpretation suggests that BLM strand annealing does not c"

Plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase-3 generate breakdown products of matrix-bound plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). We produced a truncated form of PAI-1, rPAI-1<sub>23</sub>, that possesses significant anti-angiogenic activity and stimulates high levels of apoptosis in quiescent arterial endothelial cells. Quiescent endothelial cells are less susceptible to apoptosis than angiogenic endothelial cells. The present study was designed to determine the mechanism of the rPAI-1<sub>23</sub> effects in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Apoptosis was measured in annexin V and caspase 3 assays. Expression of death and survival signaling molecules were examined by Western blot and kinase activity. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) functions were analyzed in angiogenesis assays. The early response to rPAI-1<sub>23</sub> was an increase in annexin V-positive cells and phosphorylated (p) JNK isoform expression followed by an increase in p-Akt and p-c-Jun expression. Caspase 3 was activated at 4 h, whereas p-Akt was reduced to control levels. By 6 h of rPAI-1<sub>23</sub> treatment cell number was reduced by 35%, and p-c-Jun and p-JNK were degraded by proteasomes. Confocal microscopic images showed increased amounts of FGF2 in the extracellular matrix. However, rPAI-1<sub>23</sub> blocked FGF2 signaling through FGF receptor 1 and syndecan-4, inhibiting cell migration, tubulogenesis, and proliferation. Exogenous FGF2 stimulation could not reverse these effects. We conclude that rPAI-1<sub>23</sub> stimulation of apoptosis in BAEC triggers a cascade of death <i>versus</i> survival events that includes release of FGF2. The rPAI-1<sub>23</sub> anti-angiogenic activity inhibits FGF2 pro-angiogenic functions by blocking FGF2 signaling through FGF receptor 1 and syndecan-4 and downstream effectors p-Akt, p-JNK, and p-c-Jun."

These domains have been proposed to act as “hot spots” of signal transduction, but other presumed functions include membrane trafficking of proteins, participation in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and pathogen entry as well as acting as lateral sorting platforms for various membrane proteins that associate with them (1Brown D.A.

Cholesterol is considered to play a central role in maintaining the raft structures by keeping them in a tightly packed liquid-ordered phase. It thus follows that changes in the cholesterol content are likely to affect the raft function (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 3Lai E.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Simons K.

The high lipid content makes these microdomains poorly dissolvable in non-ionic detergents, which quality is utilized in partitioning of the biological membranes into detergent-resistant versus detergent-soluble membrane fractions when defining association of a given protein with these membrane microdomains. Based on the differential solubility to various detergents, membrane microdomains have been proposed to make a heterogenous group as far as their composition is concerned (3Lai E.C. J.

Controlled cleavage of ectodomains of membrane-spanning proteins is an important regulatory process whereby a cell can optimize its plasma membrane protein content and, in response to external stimuli, produce functionally active cleavage products in the neighboring microenvironment (11Werb Z.

Type XIII collagen (COLXIII), belonging to the subfamily of transmembrane collagens, was initially found as a membrane-bound variant in focal adhesions on plasma membranes (19Hägg P. Rehn M.

In this study we show that the shedding of COLXIII ectodomain is dependent on the partial localization of COLXIII in the lipid-enriched membrane microdomains. Also, we show here that in addition to the cell surface, the ectodomain of COLXIII is also processed intracellularly, supporting our earlier hypothesis of dual cleavage sites.

In each experiment, equal numbers of cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with Complete™ EDTA-free inhibitor mix and either 1% TX-100, 1% CHAPS, 1% Brij96, or 1% Brij35 as a detergent, and kept on ice for 45 min. The cell samples without detergents were resuspended in 150 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, containing 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (29Song K.S. Li S.

The cell suspensions were homogenized, sonicated (detergent-free samples), and sheared by passing through hypodermic needles. Equal volumes were mixed with lysis buffer containing 90% sucrose. The resulting 2-ml 45% sucrose layer was overlaid with 2 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose in an appropriate lysis buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 22 h at +4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. All of the steps were carried out at +4 °C. Fractions of 500 μl were collected from the top of the gradient and boiled after the addition of reducing sample buffer and β-mercaptoethanol. Western blotting with equal sample volumes was performed on 8% (COLXIII, furin, CD71) or 12% (caveolin-1, Lyn) SDS-PAGE gels. In additional experiments the cells were treated for 30 min with 20 mm MCD prior to membrane fractionation with various detergents. The unspecific effects of MCD were excluded by treatment of cells with 20 mm MCD-cholesterol complex (1:1) (30Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole Cell Shedding Assay—Equal numbers of HT-1080 cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with MCD, MCD-cholesterol complex (1:1) (30Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), filipin, or Lovastatin-mevalonate-MCD at concentrations presented in Fig. 3 for 30 min. The Lovastatin-mevalonate-MCD treatment was preceded by preincubation of the cells with Lovastatin (2 or 4 μm, depending on the assay) and 0.25 mm mevalonate in 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. After overnight shedding, the cleaved ectodomain was precipitated from the medium at -20 °C by adding an equal volume of ice-cold methanol, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a reducing sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting (22Väisänen M.-R. Väisänen T. Pihlajaniemi T. Biohem. J. 2004; 380: 685-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Cellular Cholesterol Content—The procedure for the determination of cellular cholesterol has been described elsewhere (31Folch J. Lees M. Stanley S.G.H. J. Biol.

Virol. 2004; 78: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 3 × 106 cells were taken for the isolation of cellular cholesterol in each assay. They were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication, and cholesterol was extracted from the lysates with chloroform and methanol by rotation for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the organic solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen flow. The residual cholesterol was dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol, of which 40 μl was used for the determination of cholesterol content by means of the enzymatic colorimetric test (Roche Applied Science). Filipin Staining of Cultured Cells—The immunofluorescent staining method has been described elsewhere (33Keller P. Simons K. J.

The cells were grown on coverslips; treated with 5 mm MCD, 5 mm MCD-cholesterol complex (1:1), or a combination of 2 μm Lovastatin, 0.25 mm mevalonate, and 5 mm MCD for 30 min; rinsed with PBS; fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min on ice; and washed with PBS. The cellular cholesterol was stained with 125 μg/ml filipin in PBS for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were mounted with ImmuMount™. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Streptavidin Pull-down Assays—Cell surface biotinylation was performed for equal cell numbers in every experiment. After treatment with either 5 mm MCD, 100 ng/ml PMA, 100 μm CMK, or 15 μg/ml α1-PDX, the media were centrifuged and subjected to streptavidin pull-down with avidin-conjugated protein A-Sepharose as described elsewhere (22Väisänen M.-R.

The samples were dissolved in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Detection of Cell Surface Furin—Cell surface furin was detected using immunopatching technique. Subconfluent HT-1080 cell cultures were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with anti-furin antibody for 45 min at +4 °C to prevent internalization. After thorough washing with PBS, patching was performed by incubating cells with anti-rabbit-Cy2 secondary antibody for 30 min again at +4 °C, followed by washing with PBS and fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. As a control, anti-furin or anti-rabbit Cy2 secondary antibodies were omitted from the patching. Cell surface biotinylation was also used to detect furin at the plasma membrane. Identical cultures of HT-1080 cells were biotinylated according to the manufacturer's instructions, lysed, and subjected to streptavidin pull-down with avidin-conjugated protein A-Sepharose as described elsewhere (22Väisänen M.-R. Väisänen T. Pihlajaniemi T. Biohem. J. 2004; 380: 685-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Vesicle Secretion Assays—Recovery and analysis of the secreted vesicles have been described elsewhere (37Gutwein P. Mechtersheimer S. Riedle S. Stoeck A. Gast D. Joumaa S. Zentgraf H. Fogel M. Altevogt P. FASEB J. 2002; 17: 292-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of cells were first either biotinylated or left unbiotinylated, depending on the assay. The cells were treated with either by 5 mm MCD, 100 ng/ml PMA, 100 μm CMK, or 15 μg/ml α1-PDX. Detached cells were separated by centrifugation, after which the collected media were centrifuged in a Beckman Ti55.2 rotor at 74,000 × g for 3 h. The vesicle pellets were recovered in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% TX-100, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6. In the case of biotinylated cells, the vesicle suspensions were directed to the streptavidin pull-down. The cell lysates were produced by scraping the cells from the plates and suspending them in the lysis buffer. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. TX-114 Phase Partitioning—TX-114 phase partitioning has been described elsewhere (38Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Holm C. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15659-15661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, culture medium was centrifuged to remove detached cells and chilled to +4 °C. TX-114 was added and dissolved at +4 °C to a final concentration of 1% by agitation. Detergent was condensed at +37 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 1700 × g for 20 min; the aqueous phase was removed and cooled; and partitioning was repeated with an addition of fresh TX-114. The aqueous and detergent phases were pooled and precipitated at -20 °C with equal volumes of ice-cold methanol or acetone, respectively. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in a reducing sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Cellular Fractionation—The methods employed for cellular subfractionation and sucrose density gradient fractionation have been described elsewhere (40Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Subramamiam V.N. bin Mohd. Yusoff A.R. Wong S.H. Lim G.B. Chew M. Hong W. J. Biol.

When treated with BFA, the cells were preincubated in 30 μm BFA for 6 h prior to fractionation. For the subcellular fractionation, the cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, with a glass-Teflon homogenizer and centrifuged in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged with a Beckman Ti55.2 rotor at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The total membrane pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer, the sucrose content of which was adjusted with 2 m sucrose stock solution to 1.25 m, equivalent to a refractive index of 1.395. This was centrifuged in a discontinuous sucrose gradient in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h. The Golgi and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fractions were defined as materials at the 0.25/1.1 m and 1.1/1.25 m interfaces, respectively. The microsomal fraction in the pellet representing the rough ER was resuspended in the homogenization buffer. The Golgi fraction was diluted to a sucrose concentration of 0.25 m and pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti55.2 rotor at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was incubated in 10 mm EGTA for 30 min on ice and centrifuged as before. The supernatant fraction represented the peripheral Golgi proteins. The pellet was resuspended in 150 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged as before. The supernatant contained the luminal Golgi proteins, and the pellet contained the Golgi membranes. For the sucrose density gradient fractionation, the cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 620 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged in a discontinuous sucrose gradient in a Beckman Ti55.2 rotor at 74000 × g for 2.5 h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top of the gradient, precipitated at -20 °C with an equal volume of ice-cold methanol, resuspended in reducing sample buffer and β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled. All of the samples and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting on 8% (COLXIII, GM130, calnexin) or 12% (Rab-5) SDS-PAGE gels. COLXIII in the Membrane Microdomains—We used detergent extraction and isopycnic density gradient centrifugation to study whether COLXIII is associated with DRMs. In detergent-free high pH/carbonate conditions membrane-bound COLXIII and furin of the proprotein convertases were found to subfractionate partially into the lipid-enriched light density membrane fractions, positive for caveolin-1 and Src kinase Lyn, and enriched with cholesterol (Figs. 1 and 2A). However, because detergent-free conditions are regarded as nonselective for isolating membrane microdomains and because resistance to solubilization in non-ionic detergents at +4 °C is considered indicative of an association of a given protein with DRMs, various detergents were tested. Detergents are recognized to vary in their ability of solubilizing membrane proteins and of enriching cholesterol and glycerophospholipids (43Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Extracted with TX-100, caveolin-1 and the noncaveosomal Src kinase Lyn, both used as raft markers (10Radeva G. Perabo J. Sharom F.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4924-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), floated in the low density fractions 2 and 3, showing enrichment of cholesterol and low cellular protein content. However, the association of COLXIII and furin with DRMs did not withstand extraction by cold TX-100 (Figs. 1 and 2B). A flotation difference between COLXIII and Lyn/caveolin-1 was observed when extracted with detergents Brij96 and CHAPS. In CHAPS, a significant amount of Lyn was found in fractions of the lowest density, which also contained the highest amount of cholesterol, whereas COLXIII, furin and caveolin-1 were found to be present in the intermediate density fractions 3 and 4 (Figs. 1 and 2C). Also, when extracted with Brij96, Lyn and caveolin-1 subfractionated exclusively in the low density fractions with a peak concentration of cholesterol (Figs. 1 and 2D), whereas COLXIII and furin were present in the intermediate density fractions 3-5. In less selective Brij35, COLXIII, furin, caveolin-1, and Lyn all resided in the same fractions 3 and 4, containing the highest cholesterol content (Figs. 1 and 2E). In all of the extractions, transferrin receptor (CD71), used as a nonraft marker, was correctly subfractionated in the low cholesterol/high protein membrane fractions of the highest density (25Claas C.

Equal numbers of HT-1080 cells were taken for the determination of the cholesterol/total protein ratios of fractions from the isopycnic density centrifugation following various detergent treatments. A, detergent-free (high pH/carbonate); B, 1% TX-100; C, 1% CHAPS; D, 1% Brij96; E, 1% Brij35. A high cholesterol/protein ratio was shown for the light/intermediate density fractions (fractions 1-4), whereas cellular proteins were concentrated in the high density fractions of the gradient (fractions 7-10). The protein content is shown as absorbance value A540 nm. Cholesterol is shown as percentage values where the fraction with the highest amount of cholesterol is marked as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cholesterol is required for the stabilization of the structural integrity of membrane microdomains. Depletion of cellular cholesterol leads to disintegration of these domains and subsequent loss of associated proteins. Hence, sensitivity to cholesterol deprivation leading to solubilization from the light density fractions suggests association of a given protein with cholesterol-enriched microdomains (25Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We first depleted HT-1080 cells of the cellular cholesterol with MCD, followed by extraction of the membrane fractions in either detergent-free conditions or with CHAPS, Brij96, or Brij35. In all cases, the association of COLXIII with the DRMs was lost or greatly reduced. Most prominent with Brij96 and CHAPS, cholesterol depletion caused COLXIII to disappear from the light density fractions totally, and especially with Brij96, furin was also solubilized from the light density fractions. In Brij35, only remnants of COLXIII remained in the light density fractions (Fig. 1). As a control, replenishment of the membrane cholesterol with the MCD-cholesterol complex restored COLXIII in the light density fractions (data not shown). Sensitivity of COLXIII Ectodomain Shedding to Cholesterol Deprivation—Next we studied whether the ectodomain shedding of COLXIII is dependent on the partial localization of COLXIII and furin in the DRMs. This was determined in a whole cell shedding assay following disruption of the raft structures by manipulation of the cellular cholesterol level. The methods most frequently used to achieve this include lowering of the cholesterol content by sequestration with β-cyclodextrins, aggregation of cholesterol to larger complexes by filipin, and inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis with Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (17von Tre"
