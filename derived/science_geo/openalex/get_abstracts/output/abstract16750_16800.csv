https://openalex.org/W2041576624,"In this paper, we describe a phospholipid transmission pathway mediating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Central to this TNF signaling route is the second messenger-like molecule ceramide, which is generated by sphingomyelin (SM) breakdown catalyzed by a sphingomyelinase (SMase). SMase activation is secondary to the generation of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) produced by a TNF-responsive PC-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). The functional coupling of these two C type phospholipases is revealed by D609, a selective inhibitor of PC-PLC. SMase itself, or SMase-inducing regimens such as exogenous PLC or synthetic DAGs, induces NF-kappa B activation at pH 5.0, suggesting the operation of an acidic SMase. A model is proposed in which a TNF-responsive PC-PLC via DAG couples to an acidic SMase, resulting in the generation of ceramide, which eventually triggers rapid induction of nuclear NF-kappa B activity."
https://openalex.org/W1979483810,"The myogenic basic HLH transcription factor family of genes, composed of MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and Myf-6, are thought to regulate skeletal muscle differentiation. To understand the role of MyoD in myogenesis, we have introduced a null mutation of MyoD into the germline of mice. Surprisingly, mice lacking MyoD are viable and fertile. Histological examination of skeletal muscle failed to reveal any morphological abnormalities in these mice. Furthermore, Northern analysis revealed normal levels of skeletal muscle-specific mRNAs. Significantly, Myf-5 mRNA levels are elevated in postnatal mutant mice. Normally, Myf-5 expression becomes markedly reduced at day 12 of gestation when MyoD mRNA first appears. This suggests that Myf-5 expression is repressed by MyoD. Our results indicate that MyoD is dispensable for skeletal muscle development in mice, revealing some degree of functional redundancy in the control of the skeletal myogenic developmental program."

Cyclin E was discovered in the course of a screen for human complementary DNAs that rescue a deficiency of G1 cyclin function in budding yeast. The amounts of both the cyclin E protein and an associated protein kinase activity fluctuated periodically through the human cell cycle; both were maximal in late G1 and early S phases. Cyclin E-associated kinase activity was correlated with the appearance of complexes containing cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2. Thus, the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex may constitute a human G1-S phase-specific regulatory protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2031452885,"Both MAP kinases and the protein kinase p74raf-1 are activated by many growth factors in a c-ras-dependent manner and by oncogenic p21ras. We were therefore interested in determining the relationship between MAP kinases and raf. The MAP kinase ERK2 is activated by expression of oncogenically activated raf, independently of cellular ras. Overexpressed p74raf-1 potentiates activation of ERK2 by EGF and TPA. MAP kinase kinase inactivated by phosphatase 2A treatment is phosphorylated and reactivated by incubation with p74raf-1 immunoprecipitated from phorbol ester-treated cells. We conclude that raf protein kinase is upstream of MAP kinases and is either a MAP kinase kinase kinase or a MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2017311565,"In this paper, we show that both NF-kappa B and the high mobility group protein I(Y) (HMG I(Y)) are required for virus induction of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene. NF-kappa B binds to the terminal regions of a 10 bp regulatory sequence through contacts in the major groove. while HMG I(Y) recognizes the central region of the same sequence through contacts in the minor groove. Mutations that interfere with binding of either protein decrease the level of virus induction, and activation of the gene can be blocked by either NF-kappa B or HMG I(Y) antisense RNA. HMG I(Y) stimulates the binding of NF-kappa B to the IFN-beta promoter, and it may also function as a promoter-specific accessory factor for NF-kappa B transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2036213823,"A silicon-based device, dubbed a microphysiometer, can be used to detect and monitor the response of cells to a variety of chemical substances, especially ligands for specific plasma membrane receptors. The microphysiometer measures the rate of proton excretion from 10(4) to 10(6) cells. This article gives an overview of experiments currently being carried out with this instrument with emphasis on receptors with seven transmembrane helices and tyrosine kinase receptors. As a scientific instrument, the microphysiometer can be thought of as serving two distinct functions. In terms of detecting specific molecules, selected biological cells in this instrument serve as detectors and amplifiers. The microphysiometer can also investigate cell function and biochemistry. A major application of this instrument may prove to be screening for new receptor ligands. In this respect, the microphysiometer appears to offer significant advantages over other techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2009809272,"Dopamine-containing neurons of the mammalian midbrain are required for normal behavior and movements. In vivo they fire action potentials in bursts, but in vitro they discharge regularly spaced action potentials. Burst firing in vitro has now been shown to be robustly induced by the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) although not by the non-NMDA agonists kainate or quisqualate. The hyperpolarization between bursts of action potentials results from electrogenic sodium ion extrusion by a ouabain-sensitive pump. This mechanism of burst generation in mammalian neurons may be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1992889417,"Mutants in bacterial topoisomerase (topo) IV are deficient in chromosomal partitioning. To investigate the basis of this phenotype, we examined plasmid DNA topology in conditionally lethal topo IV mutants. We found that dimeric catenated plasmids accumulated in vivo after topo IV inhibition. The catenanes were supercoiled, contained from 2 to > 32 nodes, and were the products of DNA synthesis. Electron microscopy and recombination tests proved that the catenanes have the unique structure predicted for replication intermediates. These data provide strong evidence for a model in which unlinking of the double helix can occur in two stages during DNA replication and for the critical role of topo IV in the second stage. The interlocks in the catenanes appear to be sequestered from DNA gyrase, perhaps by compartmentalization in an enzyme complex dedicated to partitioning."
https://openalex.org/W2052759356,"The binding of linear and circular forms of DNA to yeast DNA topoisomerase II or its complex with AMPPNP, the nonhydrolyzable beta,gamma-imido analog of ATP, was carried out to probe the ATP analog-induced conformational change of the enzyme. Binding of the ATP analog is shown to convert the enzyme to a circular clamp with an annulet, through which only a linear DNA can pass; subsequent circularization of the bound linear DNA forms a salt-stable catenane between the protein circular clamp and the DNA ring. Analysis of catenane formation between a small DNA ring originally bound to the topoisomerase and a large DNA ring subsequently added, under conditions such that the two do not exchange, supports a model in which a second DNA double-helix can enter the open jaws of a DNA-bound protein clamp, and the closure of the jaws upon ATP-binding traps the second duplex and transports it through an enzyme-operated gate in the first DNA duplex."

https://openalex.org/W1605393199,"The human beta 2 adrenergic receptor is a type IIIb membrane protein. It has a putative seven-transmembrane topology but lacks an amino-terminal cleavable signal sequence. The mechanism by which the amino terminus of the beta 2 receptor is translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is unknown. Furthermore, it is not known if translocation as a type IIIb protein is essential for the proper folding. Our studies indicate that conversion of beta 2 receptor from a type IIIb to a type IIIa membrane protein by introducing an NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence enhances translocation of the receptor into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, thereby facilitating expression of functional receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1575679245,"Abstract Arachidonic acid (AA) increased, at constant Ca2+, the levels of force and 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) phosphorylation in permeabilized smooth muscle, and slowed relaxation and MLC20 dephosphorylation. The Ca(2+)-sensitizing effect of AA was not inhibited by inhibitors of AA metabolism (indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or propyl gallate), of protein kinase C (pseudopeptide) or by guanosine-5'-O-(beta-thiodiphosphate) and was abolished by oxidation of AA in air. A non-metabolizable AA analog, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid) also had Ca(2+)-sensitizing effects. Extensive treatment with saponin abolished the Ca(2+)-sensitizing effects of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and guanosine-5'-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate), but not that of AA. A purified, oligomeric MLC20 phosphatase isolated from gizzard smooth muscle was dissociated into subunits by AA, and its activity was inhibited toward heavy meromyosin but not phosphorylase. We conclude that AA may act as a messenger-promoting protein phosphorylation through direct inhibition of the form of protein phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate MLC20 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1570165358,"The CRABP-I and CRABP-II proteins are high affinity cytoplasmic retinoic acid-binding proteins. In undifferentiated F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, only the CRABP-I protein is expressed at detectable levels. We have previously shown that overexpression of the CRABP-I protein in stably transfected F9 stem cell lines results in a lower sensitivity to a given external concentration of retinoic acid relative to that of untransfected F9 cells; in contrast, reduced CRABP-I expression in CRABP-I cDNA anti-sense transfected lines is associated with increased sensitivity of these lines to retinoic acid. These three types of cell lines were cultured in the presence of 50 nM [3H]retinoic acid, and the metabolism of retinoic acid was followed over the next 24 h. The results demonstrate that CRABP-I has the ability to alter both the levels and types of RA metabolites produced in the cytoplasm of differentiating embryonic stem cells. Moreover, the level of CRABP-I determines the rate of RA metabolism to 4-oxo-RA such that the higher the CRABP-I level, the faster the metabolism of [3H]retinoic acid. This is the first reported connection between the level of CRABP-I expression and intracellular RA metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2066893493,"Evidence is presented that suggests a role for transmembrane domain interactions in the assembly of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Mutations in the transmembrane domains of the class II MHC alpha or beta chains resulted in proteins that did not generate complexes recognized by conformation-dependent antibodies and that were largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Insertion of the alpha and beta transmembrane domains into other proteins allowed the chimeric proteins to assemble, suggesting a direct interaction of the alpha and beta transmembrane domains. The interactions were mediated by a structural motif involving several glycine residues on the same face of a putative alpha helix."
https://openalex.org/W2012302327,"Previous work demonstrating the presence and differential distribution of Ca2+-binding proteins in the CNS has led to the proposal that cytosolic proteins, such as calbindin-D28k (CB), may play a pivotal role in neurons. We have used a retrovirus containing the full-length cDNA for CB to transfect the pituitary tumor cell line GH3, to generate CB-expressing GH3 cells and to investigate whether ionic channel activities as well as the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis could be altered by the presence of this Ca2+-binding protein. We show that CB-transfected GH3 cells exhibited lower Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and were better able to reduce [Ca2+]i transients evoked by voltage depolarizations than the wild-type parent cell line. These observations provide a mechanism by which CB may protect tissues against Ca2+-mediated excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1592441314,"The palmitoylation of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR) was studied in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells. At 48 h post-infection, a high level expression of an epitope-tagged beta 2-AR (10-25 pmol/mg protein) was detected by [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) binding assays. The identity of the receptor was confirmed both by photoaffinity labeling and immunoblotting. The fusion receptor displayed typical beta 2-AR pharmacological properties and conferred a beta-adrenergic sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity to the Sf9 cells. Moreover, exposure of the Sf9 cells to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced a rapid desensitization of the receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Purification of the epitope-tagged beta 2-AR by immunoprecipitation as well as by alprenolol-Sepharose affinity chromatography revealed that the receptor is covalently modified with palmitic acid in the insect cells as is observed in mammalian cells. In addition, short-term incubation of the cells with isoproterenol led to a specific increase in the incorporation of [3H]palmitate in the receptor, consistent with a rapid agonist-modulated turnover of the beta 2-AR-attached palmitic acid. These results suggest that agonist-mediated regulation of beta 2-AR post-translational palmitoylation could represent an other regulatory process for G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1526092273,"alpha 1-Adrenergic receptors (ARs) are members of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The genes for all ARs described thus far are intronless. We report here the cloning and the nucleotide sequence of the gene for the human alpha 1B-AR. It consists of two exons and a single large intron of at least 20 kilobases which interrupts the coding region at the end of the putative sixth transmembrane domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded receptor has a high degree of homology to the cloned hamster, rat, and dog alpha 1B-ARs. To characterize the encoded protein, a fusion gene constructed by splicing together exon 1 and exon 2 was expressed transiently in COS-1 cells. The transfected gene fusion product resulted in the production of an alpha 1B-AR with ligand binding characteristics indistinguishable from those of the expressed hamster alpha 1B cDNA. Evidence that the human alpha 1B-AR gene we have isolated is indeed transcribed is the finding of similar sized (2.8-kilobase) transcripts in human heart and other tissues by Northern blot analysis when either exon 1 or exon 2 is used as a probe. Moreover, using primers designed to span the exon 1/exon 2 boundary, a polymerase chain reaction product generated from single-stranded DNA prepared from human heart mRNA had the exact size and nucleotide sequence predicted for a transcript in which exon 1 is spliced to exon 2. The 5'-flanking region (924 base pairs (bp)) of exon 1 contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box but is high in GC content (70%) and contains several Sp1 binding sites (GC boxes), consistent with promoters described for housekeeping genes. The 5'-untranslated region also contains a putative cyclic AMP response element. Primer extension studies and RNase protection assays suggested that there are several potential transcription start sites in most tissues with a predominant site located 173 bp upstream from the translation start site. The 3'-flanking region contains a putative polyadenylation signal (ATTAAA) 492 bp downstream from the stop codon. The genomic organization of the human alpha 1B-AR with a single large intron interrupting its coding region differs from those of other ARs as well as muscarinic and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine receptors, which are intronless. The location of the intron in the human alpha 1B-AR gene is also unique among those members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family that do possess introns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2004515244,"Hemodynamic shear stress affects endothelial cell structure and function, but little is known about the signal transduction mechanisms involved in these processes. The effect of laminar shear stress on cytosolic pH (pHi) was examined in rat aortic endothelial cells cultured in glass capillary tubes. Shear stress forces led to a rapid decrease in pHi (maximal effect 0.09 pH unit at 13.4 dynes per square centimeter). Removal of specific ions or addition of exchange inhibitors suggests that in vascular endothelial cells shear stress forces activate both an alkali extruder, sodium ion-independent chloride-bicarbonate ion exchange, and an acid extruder, sodium-hydrogen ion exchange; the net effect in physiologic buffer with the bicarbonate ion is a decrease in pHi."
https://openalex.org/W1584302732,"Milk xanthine oxidase (XO) has been prepared in a dehydrogenase form (XDH) by purifying the enzyme in the presence of 2.5 mM dithiothreitol. Unlike XO, which reacts rapidly only with oxygen and not with NAD, the XDH form of the enzyme reacts rapidly with NAD. XDH has a turnover number for the NAD-dependent conversion of xanthine to urate of 380 mol/min/mol at pH 7.5, 25 degrees C, with a Km = < or = 1 microM for xanthine and a Km = 7 microM for NAD, but has very little O2-dependent activity. There is evidence that the two forms of the enzyme have different flavin environments: XDH stabilizes the neutral form of the flavin semiquinone and XO does not. Further, XDH binds the artificial flavin 8-mercapto-FAD in its neutral form, shifting the pK of this flavin by 5 pH units, while XO binds 8-mercapto-FAD in its benzoquinoid anionic form. XDH can be converted back to the XO form by the addition of three to four equivalents of the disulfide-forming reagent 4,4'-dithiodipyridine, suggesting that, in the XDH form of the enzyme, disulfide bonds are broken; this may cause a conformational change which creates a binding site for NAD and changes the protein structure near the flavin."

Among these superantigens is the long known, but previously uncharacterized, Mls-1a product, encoded by Mtv-7. Using a monoclonal antibody, we detect the Mtv-7 superantigen on the surface of activated B cells, but not on T cells or resting B cells. The superantigen is synthesized as a 45 kd transmembrane glycoprotein precursor, but is proteolytically processed to yield an 18.5 kd surface protein that we suggest is the functional form of the superantigen."
https://openalex.org/W2139038016,"PP(i)-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFP) activity, measured in the forward direction, increased approximately 19-fold when suspension cell cultures of black mustard (Brassica nigra) were subjected to 18 days of P(i) deprivation. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (2 microM) elicited a 10-fold activation of PFP from P(i)-deficient cells, compared to only a 2-fold activation of the enzyme from nutrient-sufficient cells. Also, PFP from P(i)-starved cells exhibited a greater affinity for the activator (Ka = 0.09 microM) than the enzyme from nutrient-sufficient cells (Ka = 0.32 microM). Western blots of extracts from P(i)-deficient cells were probed with rabbit anti-(potato tuber PFP) immune serum and revealed equal intensity staining immunoreactive polypeptides of M(r) 66,000 (alpha-subunit) and 60,000 (beta-subunit) that co-migrated with the alpha- and beta-subunits of homogeneous potato tuber PFP. By contrast, only the M(r) 60,000 beta-subunit was observed on immunoblots of extracts prepared from nutrient-sufficient cells. Quantification of immunoblots indicated that in black mustard cells experiencing transition from P(i) sufficiency to deficiency or vice versa, the relative amount of immunoreactive alpha-subunit correlated with the degree of activation of PFP by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. These observations provide additional evidence that (i) plant PFP is an adaptive enzyme that may function in glycolysis during P(i) deprivation, and (ii) the alpha-subunit acts as a regulatory protein in controlling the catalytic activity of the beta-subunit and its regulation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1490973221,"The alpha form of the A subunit of human protein phosphatase 2A was expressed in insect cells following infection with a recombinant baculovirus. A alpha was expressed as a soluble protein that comprised approximately 10% of total cellular protein. The expressed A alpha subunit was purified by chromatography on amino-hexyl-Sepharose and Mono Q with a yield of 2 mg/500-ml culture. The recombinant protein had the same apparent molecular mass as the bovine cardiac protein and was devoid of myosin light chain phosphatase activity. Biological activity of expressed A was assessed by assays of complex formation with the catalytic (C) and B subunits, purified from bovine cardiac tissue, and by inhibition of phosphatase activity. Purified A alpha had a high apparent affinity for C (IC50 = 0.10 nM) and bound with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of A/mol of C. Interaction of A alpha with the catalytic subunit caused a maximal inhibition of myosin light chain and phosphorylase phosphatase activities of 50 and 79%, respectively. The AC complex prepared by reconstitution of recombinant A alpha with C had the same electrophoretic mobility in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and the same elution volume when chromatographed on a size exclusion column as the native AC complex purified from cardiac muscle. Similar chromatographic profiles were also observed for the heterotrimer reconstituted from recombinant A alpha, purified B and C, and the native bovine cardiac heterotrimeric holoenzyme. Cross-linking of the native enzyme and the reconstituted heterotrimer generated the same pattern of high molecular weight species. Immunological analyses of these complexes demonstrated that distinct cross-linked forms composed of ABC, AC, AB, and BC were obtained. These results suggest that each of the three subunits of protein phosphatase 2A forms direct contacts with both of the others."
https://openalex.org/W1488367823,"The generation of the physiological response of a retinal rod cell to an incident photon involves activation of a cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by a GTP-binding protein, transducin (T). This activation has been shown to occur by formation of a membrane-bound T alpha GTP-PDE complex (Clerc, A., and Bennett, N. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6620-6627; Catty, P., Pfister, C., Bruckert, F., and Deterre, P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem 267, 19489-19493). The recovery of the response involves turning-off of T by its intrinsic GTPase activity. We show here that the formation of the membrane-bound T alpha GTP-PDE complex correlates with an enhanced rate of GTP hydrolysis. In vivo, this would provide an appropriate mechanism for fast turn-off of cGMP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1997991106,"When alpha factor binds to the yeast alpha factor receptor a signal is transmitted via a tripartite G protein that prepares the cell for conjugation. As a result of alpha factor binding the receptor also undergoes a regulated internalization and hyperphosphorylation. Using cells that lack activity of this tripartite G protein, we show that G protein-mediated pheromone signal transduction is not necessary for regulation of receptor internalization or hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, the processes of signal transduction and down regulation can be uncoupled. We propose that binding of alpha factor to its receptor results in a receptor conformation change that permits receptor hyperphosphorylation and interaction with the endocytic machinery."

We have used a novel mutagenesis approach to identify intramolecular interactions.

These studies provide the first experimental evidence defining spatial relationships that exist in the three-dimensional structure of adrenergic receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1536645610,"In order to study the regulatory mechanisms of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) via the intrinsic SH2/SH3 region (Z region), two recombinant Z proteins, rP45Z and rP38Z, derived from rat PLC-gamma 1 and PLC-gamma 2, respectively, were purified from the inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli. We examined their direct effects on phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by four different PLC isoforms purified from bovine brain and thymus, and found that both of these Z proteins suppress the enzyme activity of all four PLC isoforms in a dose-dependent manner. This suppressive effect is very potent and stoichiometric. The kinetics studies indicate that the suppression is non-competitive. This suppression is eliminated by treatment with proteases but is not affected by heat treatment at 95 degrees C for 15 min, indicating that the primary structure might be important for the action of Z proteins. Comparative studies suggested that two Z proteins but not Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase possess, adjacent to their SH2 and SH3 motifs, a phospholipase C inhibitor (PCI) region that strongly suppresses their phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-hydrolyzing activity. A series of synthetic peptides identical with the sequence of the proposed PCI region, including an octamer, YRKMRLRY, inhibited PIP2 hydrolysis induced by four different phospholipase C isoforms. These results demonstrate that both types of phospholipase C-gamma contain the PCI sequence which is responsible for the inhibition of PIP2 hydrolysis, indicating that phospholipase C-gamma is a self-regulating enzyme."

(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10184-10192). The identity in the amino acid sequences of these enzymes is 52%. As an initial step to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of the thermophilic RNase H, we examined whether certain regions in its amino acid sequence confer the thermostability. A variety of mutant proteins of E. coli RNase HI were constructed and analyzed for protein stability. In these mutant proteins, amino acid sequences in loops or terminal regions were systematically replaced with the corresponding sequences from T. thermophilus RNase H. Of the nine regions examined, replacement of the amino acid sequence in each of four regions (R4-R7) resulted in an increase in protein stability. Simultaneous replacements of these amino acid sequences revealed that the effect of each replacement on protein stability is independent of each other and cumulative. Replacement of all four regions (R4-R7) gave the most stable mutant protein. The temperature of the midpoint of the transition in the thermal unfolding curve and the free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant of this mutant protein were increased by 16.7 degrees C and 3.66 kcal/mol, respectively, as compared to those of E. coli RNase HI. These results suggest that individual local interactions contribute to the stability of thermophilic proteins in an independent manner, rather than in a cooperative manner."
https://openalex.org/W1555985092,"From the systematic replacements of amino acid residues of Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI with those of its thermophilic counterpart, the basic protrusion domain including region 6 (R6) from residues 91 to 95 was found to increase the structural stability of the mutant protein (Kimura, S., Nakamura, H., Hashimoto, T., Oobatake, M., and Kanaya, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21535-21542). Further mutagenesis concentrating in the R6 region has revealed that replacements of Lys95 at the left-handed structure with Gly or Asn essentially enhances the protein stability. Gly and Asn substitutions stabilize the protein up to 1.9 kcal/mol and 0.9 kcal/mol in the free energy changes of unfolding, respectively. We propose that the amino acid substitution of left-handed non-Gly residue with Gly or Asn residue can be used as one of the general strategies to enhance protein stability, when such a non-Gly residue itself does not seriously contribute to protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1513910831,"The binding of thyroid hormone receptors to DNA is enhanced by heterodimerization with nuclear proteins. One such heterodimerization partner has recently been characterized as the retinoid X receptor. 9-cis-Retinoic acid has been identified as a natural ligand for retinoid X receptors, suggesting a potential receptor-mediated interaction between thyroid hormone and 9-cis-retinoic acid in the regulation of thyroid hormone-responsive genes. A transient cotransfection assay was used to test for such an interaction. When a complex thyroid hormone response element composed of both direct and inverted repeat hexamers was tested, these two ligands activated gene expression synergistically. In contrast, when the response element consisted only of directly repeated hexamers, unliganded retinoid X receptors enhanced thyroid hormone responsiveness, but 9-cis-retinoic acid induced no additional activation. The results suggest a unique mechanism to achieve differential suggest a unique mechanism to achieve differential thyroid hormone sensitivity of thyroid hormone-responsive genes within a cell. Genes with appropriate response elements will show amplification of the thyroid hormone response by 9-cis-retinoic acid in the presence of retinoid X receptors; other thyroid hormone-responsive genes will be influenced by retinoid X receptors, but not 9-cis-retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1599237496,"Type IV collagen (Coll IV), a component of the extracellular matrix, stimulates motility in the A2058 human melanoma cell line, a response that is inhibited by pertussis toxin (PT). Fibronectin (FN)-induced chemotaxis in this cell line is not affected by PT. To understand the mechanism of cellular signaling, single cell intracellular Ca2+ responses to Coll IV and FN were studied using Fura-2 and digital imaging fluorescence microscopy. Coll IV, at a dose that stimulates motility (100 micrograms/ml, 185 nM), induces a significant rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) within 100 s. This response is not inhibited by PT. Treatment of the cells with FN 30 micrograms/ml (70 nM), a dose that stimulates near-maximal chemotaxis, does not increase [Ca2+]i appreciably. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ fails to inhibit the Coll IV-stimulated rise in Ca2+ in all cells. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ and pretreatment of cells with Ca2+ channel blockers only partially inhibits Coll IV-induced motility. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ inhibits both chemotaxis and the Coll IV-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+. Coll IV does not stimulate membrane phosphoinositide hydrolysis. We conclude that Coll IV treatment induces an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-independent release of intracellular Ca2+ stores which appears to play a necessary role in the chemotactic response of A2058 cells but is not mediated by a PT-sensitive G-protein. This response is not seen in cells exposed to FN, suggesting different intracellular signaling mechanisms for stimulated motility between these two extracellular matrix molecules."

However, to date, metabolism of IP5 by cell-free preparations has resulted in the formation of only inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate ((1,4,5,6)IP4). Thus, the metabolic relationships of IP5 with various inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4) isomers have been investigated in both intact cells and cell homogenates of the rat pancreatoma cell line, AR4-2J. The steady-state concentration of IP5 was estimated to be 65 microM, while the combined concentration of (3,4,5,6)IP4 and (1,4,5,6)IP4 was approximately 1.0 microM. AR4-2J cell homogenates converted (1,3,4,6)IP4, (3,4,5,6)IP4, and (1,4,5,6)IP4 to IP5. (1,4,5,6)IP4 previously has not been demonstrated to be a precursor of IP5. To alter steady-state levels of inositol phosphates that were maintained by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles, intact cells were treated with 10 microM antimycin A which reduced ATP levels by > 90% within 10 min. Following 2 h of treatment with antimycin A, there was a 6-fold increase in both (3,4,5,6)IP4 and (1,4,5,6)IP4, presumably derived from IP5. Experiments with cell-free systems determined that IP5 was dephosphorylated to (1,4,5,6)IP4 by a predominantly particulate Mg(2+)-independent, Li(+)-insensitive IP5 3-phosphatase. However, in the presence of 5 mM MgATP, IP5 also was metabolized to (3,4,5,6)IP4. Therefore, our data demonstrate novel and complex relationships between IP5, (3,4,5,6)IP4, and (1,4,5,6)IP4."
https://openalex.org/W1600654640,"The dephosphorylation of the mouse small heat shock protein hsp25 within an extract obtained from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells is inhibited by the calcium chelator EGTA and at concentrations of microcystin-LR which are characteristic for inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent (2B type) protein phosphatases. Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of hsp25 in the cell-free system derived from Ehrlich ascites tumor could be increased specifically by addition of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent (2B type) protein phosphatase calcineurin. Dephosphorylation of the heat shock protein hsp25 is also obtained in an in vitro system containing phosphorylated recombinant hsp25, 1 mM Ca2+, calmodulin, and calcineurin specifying hsp25 as the direct substrate for this enzyme. The expression of two isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the mouse calcium/calmodulin-dependent (2B type) protein phosphatases in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells is demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide primers to the catalytic and calmodulin-binding domain, respectively. Northern blot analysis using the amplified fragments as probes shows that the mRNA of one isoform of the mouse calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase is of medium abundance in EAT cells. These data suggest a calcium/calmodulin-dependent dephosphorylation of the small stress protein in EAT cells also in vivo. Since it is known that heat shock increases the intracellular calcium level and that thermotolerance is influenced by calcium chelators, ionophores, and anti-calmodulin drugs, the changes in the degree of hsp25 phosphorylation induced by thermal stress resulting in an altered thermoresistance could be explained at least partially by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent dephosphorylation through protein phosphatases 2B."
https://openalex.org/W1491407070,"The mechanism of inhibition of the veratryl alcohol oxidase activity of lignin peroxidase H2 (LiPH2) by EDTA was investigated. It was found that EDTA was decarboxylated and that cytochrome c, nitro blue tetrazolium, ferric iron, and molecular oxygen were reduced in a reaction mixture containing LiPH2, H2O2, veratryl alcohol, and EDTA. The reductive activity observed with LiPH2 followed first order kinetics with respect to the concentration of EDTA. Stoichiometry studies showed that in the presence of sufficient EDTA, 1.7 mol of ferric iron were reduced per mole of H2O2 added to the reaction mixture. Superoxide- and EDTA-derived radicals were detected by ESR spin trapping upon incubation of LiPH2 with H2O2, veratryl alcohol, and EDTA. The Km values of veratryl alcohol and H2O2 remained the same for both the oxidative and reductive activities of LiPH2. Reductive activity was also observed with LiPH2 and EDTA using other free radical mediators in the place of veratryl alcohol, such as 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzenes, and 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene. EDTA reduced the cation radical of 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene formed by LiPH2 in the presence of H2O2. Hence, it is proposed that the apparent inhibition of the veratryl alcohol oxidase activity of LiPH2 by EDTA is due to the reduction of the veratryl alcohol cation radical intermediate back to veratryl alcohol by EDTA. The reduction of cytochrome c, nitro blue tetrazolium, ferric ion, and molecular oxygen appears to be mediated by the EDTA radical formed by reduction of the veratryl alcohol cation radical."
https://openalex.org/W1488891465,"A procedure for reconstitution of the transport function of the vacuolar H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase; EC 3.6.1.1) prepared from etiolated hypocotyls of Vigna radiata (mung bean) is described. The method entails sequential extraction of isolated vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) vesicles with deoxycholate and CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), combination of CHAPS-solubilized protein with phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures, dialysis, and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The final proteoliposome preparation is 9-fold enriched for PPase activity and active in pyrophosphate (PPi)-energized electrogenic H(+)-translocation. Since both PPi hydrolysis and PPi-dependent H(+)-translocation by the proteoliposomes are indistinguishable from the corresponding activities of native tonoplast vesicles, the functional integrity of the H(+)-PPase appears to be conserved during solubilization and reconstitution. The high transport capacity and amenability of the reconstituted enzyme to both radiometric membrane filtration and fluorimetric H(+)-translocation assays, on the other hand, demonstrate its applicability to a broad range of transport studies. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteoliposomes reveals selective enrichment of the M(r) 66,000, substrate-binding subunit of the H(+)-PPase and two additional polypeptides of M(r) 21,000 and 20,000. Although the M(r) 21,000 and 20,000 polypeptides have not been described previously, all attempts to reconstitute H(+)-PPase lacking these components were unsuccessful. It is therefore tentatively proposed that the M(r) 21,000 and 20,000 polypeptides, as well as the M(r) 66,000 subunit, are required for the productive reconstitution of PPi-dependent H(+)-translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1946916319,"The rat cDNA for the muscle-type (M) isozyme of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) contains two putative translation initiation sites. To determine whether the M isozyme expressed in rat skeletal muscle corresponds to the short (PFK2M-sf) or the long (PFK2M-lf) isoform, we have expressed them in Escherichia coli. A third construction was also expressed in which the second ATG codon was deleted (PFK2M-lf delta ATG) to ensure that initiation started at the first ATG. The properties of these recombinant proteins were compared with those of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 present in rat skeletal muscle and liver. The recombinant proteins displayed PFK-2 and FBPase-2 activities and the M(r) values of the subunits measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were compatible with the calculated ones. The purified recombinant lf form contained not only the expected lf band (54,500 M(r)) but also the sf band (52,000 M(r)), indicating that the expression system could synthesize the long and the short isoforms from the same mRNA. The kinetic properties of the recombinant sf form were not different from those of the rat muscle enzyme. By contrast, lf delta ATG PFK-2 displayed a higher Km for its substrates and a lower Vmax. Immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the long isoform revealed a 54,500 M(r) band both in the lf and the lf delta ATG recombinant, but no band in rat skeletal muscle extracts. In these extracts, one band of 52,000 and a minor one of 54,500 M(r) were detected by an anti PFK-2/FBPase-2 antibody. The 54,500 M(r) band was recognized by an antibody directed against the L isozyme, suggesting that a small amount of the latter is expressed in skeletal muscle. Thus, the M isozyme differs from the L isozyme by replacement of the first 32 amino acids of the L isozyme by an unrelated nonapeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1497262800,"Lys-356 has been implicated as a critical residue for binding the C-6 phospho group of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Li, L., Lin, K., Correia, J., and Pilkis, S. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16669-16675). To ascertain whether the three other basic residues (Arg-352, Arg-358, and Arg-360), which are located in a surface loop (residues 331-362) which contains Lys-356, are important in substrate binding, these arginyl residues were mutated to Ala, and each arginyl mutant was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The far UV circular dichroism spectra of the mutants were identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. The kinetic parameters of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase of the mutants revealed only small changes. However, the Km for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, Ki for fructose 6-phosphate, and Ka for inorganic phosphate of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase for Arg352Ala were, respectively, 2,800-, 4,500-, and 1,500-fold higher than those for the wild-type enzyme, whereas there was no change in the maximal velocity or the Ki for inorganic phosphate. The Km for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and Ki for inorganic phosphate of Arg360Ala were 10- and 12-fold higher, respectively, than those of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the maximal velocity and Ki for fructose 6-phosphate were unchanged. In addition, substrate inhibition was not observed with Arg352Ala and greatly reduced with Arg360Ala. The properties of the Arg358Ala mutant were identical to those of the wild-type enzyme. The results demonstrate that in addition to Lys-356, Arg-352 is another critical residue in fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase for binding the C-6 phospho group of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and that Arg-360 binds the C-2 phospho group of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in the phosphoenzyme.fructose 2,6-bisphosphate complex. The results also provide support for Arg-352, Lys-356, and Arg-360 constituting a specificity pocket for fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase."

https://openalex.org/W1556346025,"Responses of bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells (BACE) on treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) have been characterized and tested for sensitivity to inactivation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. TGF-beta 1 elicited growth inhibition, monolayer remodeling, elevation of steady state mRNA levels for collagen type 1 (alpha 1(1) and alpha 2(1)) and TGF-beta 1, and inhibition of p34cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity in BACE cells. Pertussis toxin treatment enhanced both inhibition of BACE cell [3H]methylthymidine uptake and remodeling of BACE monolayers by TGF-beta 1. These findings contrast with studies of mink lung epithelial cells, in which TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition has been shown to be pertussis-sensitive. Further investigation revealed that pertussis toxin treatment of BACE cells had no effect on TGF-beta 1-stimulated elevation of steady state mRNA levels for collagen type 1 (alpha 1(1) or alpha 2(1)) or for TGF-beta 1. Analysis of p34cdc2 activity in BACE cells revealed potent inhibition of p34cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity by TGF-beta 1. Pertussis toxin treatment also abolished the increase in p34cdc2 activity, however, precluding the determination of the pertussis toxin sensitivity of this response to TGF-beta 1. Consistent with suppression of p34cdc2 activation, pertussis toxin also caused substantial inhibition of mitogen-stimulated BACE cell [3H]methylthymidine uptake. It is concluded that TGF-beta 1 signal transduction in this cell type does not involve G-proteins of the pertussis toxin-sensitive class and that, in view of its potent effects on DNA synthesis and p34cdc2 activation, the use of pertussis toxin to determine G-protein involvement in cytokine signalling pathways should be approached with caution."

https://openalex.org/W1581392518,"The role of glucosylated oligosaccharides in the biogenesis of the glycoprotein (G protein) of vesicular stomatitis virus was studied in PhaR2.7, a mouse lymphoma cell line deficient in glucosidase II activity. As expected, the great majority of cell-associated G protein remained glucosylated in PhaR2.7, and the G protein was rapidly deglucosylated in BW5147, the parental cell line. Despite these differences in glucosylation, the rates of G protein trimerization and transport to the cell surface were as rapid and efficient in the PhaR2.7 mutant as in BW5147. Surprisingly, greater than 73% of the oligosaccharides on G proteins recovered from released virions were complex-type units. The efficient processing of the G protein oligosaccharides coincided with the efficient removal of glucose residues from its oligosaccharides. After treatment with deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glucosidases I and II, the total percentage of G protein-associated high mannose-type oligosaccharides increased more in the parental cells than in the mutant cells. Furthermore, when the G protein was retained in the ER of PhaR2.7 cells by depletion of the cellular ATP pools with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, its oligosaccharides remained glucosylated. Under identical conditions, BW5147 cells removed the glucose residues from > 90% of the retained G protein's oligosaccharides. Thus, PhaR2.7 cells efficiently remove glucose residues from high mannose-type oligosaccharides of selected proteins using a deoxynojirimycin-insensitive enzyme located in a post-ER compartment. The existence of a second mechanism for the deglucosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides provides evidence for the important role of glucose removal in glycoprotein maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1536703673,"To elucidate the role of the COOH-terminal region of antithrombin III, we studied the effects of synthetic peptides corresponding to its sequence on the amidolytic and proteolytic activities of thrombin and Factor Xa in the presence or absence of the inhibitor, antithrombin III. The peptides ANRPFLVFI and IIFMGRVANP corresponding to residues Ala404 to Ile412 and Ile420 to Pro429, respectively, blocked the inhibition by antithrombin III. The effect of IIFMGRVANP was reduced in the presence of heparin. Both peptides at a concentration of 1 mM blocked complex formation between antithrombin III and thrombin or Factor Xa. The two peptides, particularly IIFMGRVANP, directly enhanced the amidolytic activity of thrombin and Factor Xa on the synthetic substrate Boc-Ala-Gly-Arg-MCA (where Boc is t-butoxycarbonyl and MCA is 4-methylcoumarin), which corresponds to residues P3-P1 of the reactive site of antithrombin III, and also on other substrates due to increased Vmax. IIFMGRVANP also shortened the thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting time, whereas ANRPFLVFI inhibited the thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C both in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin. The direct effect of ANRPFLVFI and IIFMGRVANP on thrombin was confirmed by enhancement of the incorporation of dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide into thrombin. These findings suggest that the COOH-terminal region of antithrombin III interacts with thrombin and Factor Xa to increase the reactivity of the enzyme, which may enhance acyl-bond formation between the inhibitor and the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2109072483,"The nucleoside analog acyclovir (9-[2-hydroxy-ethoxy)methyl]guanine or acycloguanosine; ACV) inhibited the in vitro transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by Abelson murine leukemia virus and the proliferation of abl- and bcr-abl-transformed hemopoietic murine cell lines. This effect is selective since ACV at the same concentration had no effect on the src and Ha-ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells or on the proliferation of hemopoietic cells transformed by those oncogenes. The inhibitory effect on proliferation of abl-transformed cells correlated with the extent of ACV triphosphate formation and incorporation into cellular DNA that was greater than that in normal or other oncogene-transformed cells. The increased ACV triphosphate formation might be due to a higher level of 5'-nucleotidase, the enzyme responsible for trace levels of ACV phosphorylation in uninfected cells."
