This has led to the suggestion that caspases are activated not just to kill but to prevent dying cells from triggering a host immune response. Here, we show that the caspase cascade suppresses type I interferon (IFN) production by cells undergoing Bak/Bax-mediated apoptosis. Bak and Bax trigger the release of mitochondrial DNA. This is recognized by the cGAS/STING-dependent DNA sensing pathway, which initiates IFN production. Activated caspases attenuate this response. Pharmacological caspase inhibition or genetic deletion of caspase-9, Apaf-1, or caspase-3/7 causes dying cells to secrete IFN-β. In vivo, this precipitates an elevation in IFN-β levels and consequent hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction, which is corrected by loss of Bak and Bax. Thus, the apoptotic caspase cascade functions to render mitochondrial apoptosis immunologically silent."
https://openalex.org/W2015879727,"The mechanism by which cells undergo death determines whether dying cells trigger inflammatory responses or remain immunologically silent. Mitochondria play a central role in the induction of cell death, as well as in immune signaling pathways. Here, we identify a mechanism by which mitochondria and downstream proapoptotic caspases regulate the activation of antiviral immunity. In the absence of active caspases, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by Bax and Bak results in the expression of type I interferons (IFNs). This induction is mediated by mitochondrial DNA-dependent activation of the cGAS/STING pathway and results in the establishment of a potent state of viral resistance. Our results show that mitochondria have the capacity to simultaneously expose a cell-intrinsic inducer of the IFN response and to inactivate this response in a caspase-dependent manner. This mechanism provides a dual control, which determines whether mitochondria initiate an immunologically silent or a proinflammatory type of cell death."

Previously, using (13)C-NMR analysis of brain tumors resected from patients during infusion of (13)C-glucose, we demonstrated that there is robust oxidation of glucose in the citric acid cycle, yet glucose contributes less than 50% of the carbons to the acetyl-CoA pool. Here, we show that primary and metastatic mouse orthotopic brain tumors have the capacity to oxidize [1,2-(13)C]acetate and can do so while simultaneously oxidizing [1,6-(13)C]glucose. The tumors do not oxidize [U-(13)C]glutamine. In vivo oxidation of [1,2-(13)C]acetate was validated in brain tumor patients and was correlated with expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme 2, ACSS2. Together, the data demonstrate a strikingly common metabolic phenotype in diverse brain tumors that includes the ability to oxidize acetate in the citric acid cycle. This adaptation may be important for meeting the high biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of malignant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2139480055,"Alternative splicing (AS) generates vast transcriptomic and proteomic complexity. However, which of the myriad of detected AS events provide important biological functions is not well understood. Here, we define the largest program of functionally coordinated, neural-regulated AS described to date in mammals. Relative to all other types of AS within this program, 3-15 nucleotide ""microexons"" display the most striking evolutionary conservation and switch-like regulation. These microexons modulate the function of interaction domains of proteins involved in neurogenesis. Most neural microexons are regulated by the neuronal-specific splicing factor nSR100/SRRM4, through its binding to adjacent intronic enhancer motifs. Neural microexons are frequently misregulated in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and this misregulation is associated with reduced levels of nSR100. The results thus reveal a highly conserved program of dynamic microexon regulation associated with the remodeling of protein-interaction networks during neurogenesis, the misregulation of which is linked to autism."
https://openalex.org/W1972254548,"Acetyl-CoA represents a central node of carbon metabolism that plays a key role in bioenergetics, cell proliferation, and the regulation of gene expression. Highly glycolytic or hypoxic tumors must produce sufficient quantities of this metabolite to support cell growth and survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. Here, we show that the nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme, ACSS2, supplies a key source of acetyl-CoA for tumors by capturing acetate as a carbon source. Despite exhibiting no gross deficits in growth or development, adult mice lacking ACSS2 exhibit a significant reduction in tumor burden in two different models of hepatocellular carcinoma. ACSS2 is expressed in a large proportion of human tumors, and its activity is responsible for the majority of cellular acetate uptake into both lipids and histones. These observations may qualify ACSS2 as a targetable metabolic vulnerability of a wide spectrum of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2134920945,"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are critical enzymes that govern genome regulation, metabolism, and aging. Despite conserved deacetylase domains, mitochondrial SIRT4 and SIRT5 have little to no deacetylase activity, and a robust catalytic activity for SIRT4 has been elusive. Here, we establish SIRT4 as a cellular lipoamidase that regulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Importantly, SIRT4 catalytic efficiency for lipoyl- and biotinyl-lysine modifications is superior to its deacetylation activity. PDH, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, has been known to be primarily regulated by phosphorylation of its E1 component. We determine that SIRT4 enzymatically hydrolyzes the lipoamide cofactors from the E2 component dihydrolipoyllysine acetyltransferase (DLAT), diminishing PDH activity. We demonstrate SIRT4-mediated regulation of DLAT lipoyl levels and PDH activity in cells and in vivo, in mouse liver. Furthermore, metabolic flux switching via glutamine stimulation induces SIRT4 lipoamidase activity to inhibit PDH, highlighting SIRT4 as a guardian of cellular metabolism."

Our findings reveal an essential role for muscle spindle feedback in directing basic locomotor recovery and facilitating circuit reorganization after spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury has an immediate and devastating impact on the control of movement. The origin of motor impairments lies in the physical disconnection of descending pathways from spinal circuits below the lesion, depriving them of synaptic input essential for the generation and regulation of motor output. Despite the failure of severed axons to regenerate at long distance (Ramon y Cajal, 1928Ramon y Cajal S. Degeneration and Regeneration of the Nervous System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1928Google Scholar, Tello, 1907Tello F. La regeneration dans les voies optiques.Trab. Lab. Invest. Biol. Univ. Madr. 1907; 5: 237-248Google Scholar), partial lesions of the human spinal cord are frequently associated with spontaneous functional improvement (Curt et al., 2008Curt A. Van Hedel H.J. Klaus D.

Neurotrauma. 2008; 25: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). One of many challenges in restoring motor control after spinal cord injury is to re-establish a sufficient level of task-specific excitability within disconnected local spinal circuits to drive motor neurons caudal to the injury. Recent studies on incomplete spinal cord injury animal models uncovered some of the mechanisms that may contribute to spontaneous motor recovery (Ballermann and Fouad, 2006Ballermann M. Fouad K.

These investigations showed that recovery correlates with the establishment of intraspinal detour circuits. Such alternative pathways through the spared tissue form novel functional bridges across the lesioned spinal segments. At present, circuit-level mechanisms promoting the formation of detour circuits to restore control of movement remain elusive, even though such insight might play a pivotal role in developing interventions that enhance locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. Various studies suggest that sensory information plays a critical role in gait control and in locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (Edgerton et al., 2008Edgerton V.R. Courtine G.

The most common medical practice used to facilitate motor recovery of paraplegic patients is weight-supported locomotor rehabilitation (Dietz and Fouad, 2014Dietz V. Fouad K.

Repetitive movement during rehabilitative training likely enhances glutamatergic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory feedback, which constitutes the primary extrinsic source of excitation entering the spinal cord below injury to engage local spinal circuits. This interpretation is supported by evidence from animal models in which spinal cord injury coupled to partial or complete elimination of sensory input impairs gait control and locomotor recovery (Bouyer and Rossignol, 2003Bouyer L.J.

However, the DRG neuron subtype promoting locomotor recovery and the mechanisms by which this process takes place are unclear. Proprioceptive sensory neurons innervate sense organs in the muscle and transmit information about muscle contraction to the spinal cord (Brown, 1981Brown A.G. Organization of the Spinal Cord. Springer Verlag, New York1981Crossref Google Scholar, Rossignol et al., 2006Rossignol S. Dubuc R. Gossard J.P. Dynamic sensorimotor interactions in locomotion.Physiol.

Bull. 2007; 73: 155-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Their influence on the activity of central circuits is essential for modulation and adjustment of motor output (Pearson, 2008Pearson K.G. Role of sensory feedback in the control of stance duration in walking cats.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Rossignol et al., 2006Rossignol S. Dubuc R. Gossard J.P. Dynamic sensorimotor interactions in locomotion.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 89-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Muscle spindle afferents constitute a subset of proprioceptors contacting muscle spindle sense organs. They exhibit the most widespread central projection pattern of all DRG sensory neurons and establish synaptic contacts with motor neurons and various classes of interneurons implicated in motor control (Brown, 1981Brown A.G. Organization of the Spinal Cord. Springer Verlag, New York1981Crossref Google Scholar, Eccles et al., 1957Eccles J.C. Eccles R.M. Lundberg A. The convergence of monosynaptic excitatory afferents on to many different species of alpha motoneurones.J.

Bull. 2007; 73: 155-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Muscle spindle afferents are thus in a prime position to convey direct excitation to spinal circuits relevant to the regulation of motor behavior, especially under conditions of disconnected descending input. The zinc-finger transcription factor Egr3 is expressed selectively by muscle spindle-intrinsic intrafusal muscle fibers, and its mutation results in early postnatal degeneration of muscle spindles (Tourtellotte and Milbrandt, 1998Tourtellotte W.G. Milbrandt J. Sensory ataxia and muscle spindle agenesis in mice lacking the transcription factor Egr3.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This defect abolishes normal function of muscle spindle afferents as assessed electrophysiologically (Chen et al., 2002Chen H.H. Tourtellotte W.G. Frank E. Muscle spindle-derived neurotrophin 3 regulates synaptic connectivity between muscle sensory and motor neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3512-3519PubMed Google Scholar) and leads to gait ataxia (Tourtellotte and Milbrandt, 1998Tourtellotte W.G. Milbrandt J. Sensory ataxia and muscle spindle agenesis in mice lacking the transcription factor Egr3.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Egr3 mutant mice thus represent a genetic model with DRG sensory neuron dysfunction selectively restricted to muscle spindle afferents. They provide an opportunity to investigate how this feedback channel contributes to gait control in intact mice and influences locomotor recovery and circuit reorganization after spinal cord injury. To address this question, we conducted kinematic analyses in wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice. Deficiency of muscle spindle feedback did not affect basic motor abilities in intact Egr3 mutant mice beyond specific gait features. However, lack of muscle spindle feedback severely restricted spontaneous recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury. Egr3 mutant mice also exhibit a markedly reduced ability to establish descending detour circuits restoring access to spinal circuits below spinal cord injury. We conclude that muscle spindle feedback is a key neuronal substrate to direct circuit rearrangement necessary for locomotor recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury. We performed high-resolution video recordings to reconstruct hindlimb kinematics in wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice (Figures 1A and 1B ). We focused on task-dependent contributions of muscle spindle input to hindlimb motor control with the aim to establish a baseline to which we could compare the locomotor recovery process after spinal cord injury. We first assessed hindlimb motor control during basic overground locomotion. Wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice performed this task with reciprocal activation of flexor and extensor muscles and alternation between left and right hindlimbs (Figure 1B; Movie S1 available online). However, Egr3 mutant mice exhibited gait ataxia as reported previously (Tourtellotte and Milbrandt, 1998Tourtellotte W.G. Milbrandt J. Sensory ataxia and muscle spindle agenesis in mice lacking the transcription factor Egr3.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To characterize gait patterns, we computed >100 kinematic parameters that provide a comprehensive quantification of locomotor features (Figure S1) (Courtine et al., 2008Courtine G. Song B. Roy R.R. Zhong H. Herrmann J.E. Ao Y. Qi J. Edgerton V.R. Sofroniew M.V. Recovery of supraspinal control of stepping via indirect propriospinal relay connections after spinal cord injury.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We subjected all measured parameters to a principal component (PC) analysis (van den Brand et al., 2012van den Brand R. Heutschi J. Barraud Q. DiGiovanna J. Bartholdi K. Huerlimann M. Friedli L. Vollenweider I. Moraud E.M.

We then visualized gait patterns in the new space created by PC1–3, where PC1 explained the highest variance (18%) and distinguished the two genotypes (Figure 1C). The locomotor phenotype observed in Egr3 mutant mice was limited to distinct gait features represented in PC1 and approximately 65% of all parameters did not correlate with this genotype-specific PC1 (Figure S3A).Figure S2Steps of Locomotor Analysis, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4Show full captionFlowchart depicting the multi-step approach applied for behavioral analysis.

To evaluate the ability of Egr3 mutant mice to adjust gait patterns to changing locomotor velocities, we tested mice during stepping on a treadmill. Both wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice were capable of stepping across the entire range of tested treadmill speeds (7–23 cm/s; Figures 1D and S3B). PC1 captured adjustment of gait patterns with increasing speed in mice of both genotypes (16% of explained variance; Figures 1D and S3C), whereas PC2 segregated genotypic differences independent of velocity (10% explained variance; Figures 1D and S3C). Electromyogram (EMG) recordings of ankle extensor and flexor muscles revealed that both genotypes showed appropriate speed-dependent adjustments in burst duration (Figure 1D). These findings resonate with work demonstrating that the flexion phase of the step cycle remains constant, whereas the extension phase progressively shortens with increased locomotor speed (Arshavskiĭ et al., 1965Arshavskiĭ IuI.

The stride cycle of the cat: the modelling of locomotion by computerized analysis of automatic recordings.Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1983; 521: 1-75PubMed Google Scholar), a property we now demonstrate to be independent of muscle spindle sensory feedback. In summary, both wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice are able to perform basic locomotor tasks proficiently, but mutant mice display specific gait alterations concordant with the previously proposed role of muscle spindle feedback in control and adjustment of locomotion (Pearson, 2008Pearson K.G. Role of sensory feedback in the control of stance duration in walking cats.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Rossignol et al., 2006Rossignol S.

Muscle proprioceptive feedback and spinal networks.Brain Res. Bull. 2007; 73: 155-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Next, we tested mice of both genotypes during walking on a horizontal ladder, requiring precision in foot placement. Whereas wild-type mice progressed across the ladder with ease, Egr3 mutants frequently slipped off or missed rungs, which was reflected in aberrant bouts of EMG activity (Figure 2A; Movie S2). Quantification of foot positioning relative to successive rungs revealed that wild-type mice targeted rungs precisely, whereas Egr3 mutant mice displayed near-random foot placement (Figure 2B). These findings demonstrate an essential role for muscle spindle feedback circuits in the regulation of accurate foot placement in a locomotor precision task. Egr3 mutant mice exhibit selective defects of muscle spindle feedback, but other sensory feedback is preserved (Tourtellotte and Milbrandt, 1998Tourtellotte W.G. Milbrandt J. Sensory ataxia and muscle spindle agenesis in mice lacking the transcription factor Egr3.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). During swimming, afferents from Golgi tendon organs are attenuated due to reduced weight load (Gruner and Altman, 1980Gruner J.A. Altman J. Swimming in the rat: analysis of locomotor performance in comparison to stepping.Exp. Brain Res. 1980; 40: 374-382PubMed Google Scholar). Proprioceptive signaling therefore relies almost exclusively on muscle spindle feedback. We found that during swimming, wild-type mice displayed well-coordinated alternation of left and right hindlimbs with reciprocal activity of ankle flexor and extensor muscles (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, Egr3 mutant mice were unable to keep afloat and showed uncoordinated hindlimb movements with extensive coactivation of antagonistic muscles (Figures 2C and 2D). Together, these findings stress the pivotal function of muscle spindle feedback in the control of swimming, a condition when Golgi tendon organ and cutaneous feedback circuits only play a limited task-related function. The core ability to perform basic locomotion is not disturbed in Egr3 mutant mice, providing an opportunity to assess the role of muscle spindle feedback circuits in gait control and spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury. We placed a lateral hemisection injury at the thoracic level (T10) and confirmed lesion completeness upon termination of experiments (Figure 3A). This lesion interrupts descending tracts projecting ipsilateral to lesion (ipsilesional hereafter), which normally innervate lumbar segments containing circuits essential for the control of ipsilesional hindlimb muscles (Figure 3A). We performed kinematic analysis at regular intervals after injury to follow locomotor recovery (Figures 3A and 3B). Three days after injury (acute), both wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice dragged the ipsilesional hindlimb along the runway as they moved forward (Figure 3B; Movies S3 and S4). Wild-type mice gradually regained locomotor proficiency over the time course analyzed. By 7 weeks postinjury (chronic), they regained weight-bearing plantar steps with regular alternation of stance and swing phases of the ipsilesional hindlimb (Figures 3B and S4A; Movies S3 and S4). In contrast, Egr3 mutant mice still exhibited severe locomotor deficits at the chronic stage (Figures 3B and S4A; Movies S3 and S4). To quantitatively assess the recovery of ipsilesional hindlimb function, we conducted a PC analysis comparing intact condition to each time point evaluated. We found that PC1 characterized the recovery process (30% explained variance; Figures 3C and 3D). In wild-type mice, time-dependent gait clusters gradually moved toward intact conditions, reflecting the progressive recovery of locomotor function (Figures 3C and 3D). In contrast, gait clusters of Egr3 mutant mice remained confined in the same PC space through the entire time course evaluated (Figures 3C and 3D). Detailed kinematic analysis revealed that in chronic wild-type mice, 73% of all parameters affected at acute stages improved significantly (p < 0.05) and 17% even recovered to levels measured before lesion (Figure S4A). Lack of locomotor recovery in Egr3 mutant mice was associated with persistent dragging of the ipsilesional hindlimb at all time points (Figures 3B and S4A). In addition, analysis of contralesional hindlimb gait parameters revealed that both wild-type and Egr3 mutant mice adjust their gait to ipsilesional hindlimb deficiencies similarly and immediately after lesion (Figure S4B). Together, our results demonstrate that defective muscle spindle feedback circuitry severely limits spontaneous locomotor recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury. Next, we determined the extent to which hemisected wild-type mice regain the capacity to accommodate hindlimb movement to increasing walking speeds and to perform muscle spindle feedback-dependent swimming and ladder precision tasks. Wild-type mice at chronic stages recovered the ability to walk at the highest speed tested (23 cm/s). After a lack of ipsilesional muscle recruitment at acute stages, the modulation of ankle extensor muscle activity gradually recovered toward intact levels (Figure S4C). In contrast, prolonged paw dragging (Figure S4A) led to increased EMG bursts in ankle flexor muscles after lesion, a feature that only partially recovered at chronic stages (Figure S4C). Wild-type mice regained well-coordinated limb alternation during swimming (Figure S4D) (Zörner et al., 2010Zörner B. Filli L. Starkey M.L. Gonzenbach R. Kasper H. Röthlisberger M. Bolliger M. Schwab M.E. Profiling locomotor recovery: comprehensive quantification of impairments after CNS damage in rodents.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), providing further evidence for recovery of basic locomotor features. During precision walking on the horizontal ladder at chronic stages, 87% of ipsilesional hindlimb steps resulted in a complete miss of the targeted rung, and 12% slipped off the rung. In contrast, most steps of the contralesional hindlimb were placed correctly on the rungs (82%) (Figure 3E; Movies S5). Taken together, these results indicate that after lateral hemisection injury, wild-type mice regain basic locomotor function but only partially recover speed-dependent adaptation and completely fail to re"

Thus RcsF senses envelope damage by monitoring the activity of the Bam machinery. The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two membranes, separated by a viscous periplasm that contains the peptidoglycan (PG). The envelope is a permeability and structural barrier, which is essential for cell shape and growth, and serves as interface to the environment. To monitor their surroundings, bacteria use a number of signaling cascades that transduce the information from their envelope to their decision center (cytoplasm). Bacteria also constantly monitor the growth and assembly status of their envelope. As this compartment is devoid of energy, transport and assembly of its structural subunits are controlled by multicomponent protein machineries, which span the envelope and utilize energy from the cytoplasm (Silhavy et al., 2010Silhavy T.J. Kahne D. Walker S. The bacterial cell envelope.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000414Crossref Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). These machineries must tightly coordinate their function, as assembly of the different envelope layers is interlinked (components synthesizing one layer often reside in or interact with the other layer [Typas et al., 2012Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 123-136Google Scholar]) and coupled to growth rate. It is therefore vital for bacteria to detect when envelope assembly is perturbed and to rapidly fix or contain the damage. Many signaling systems can sense envelope perturbations in E. coli and mount a repair and/or a preventive response to minimize the damage. The best understood system is the σE stress response, which uses three proteins to sense accumulation of unassembled OM porins (OMPs) and LPS in the periplasm (Lima et al., 2013Lima S. Guo M.S.

In response to these insults, σE directs the transcription of genes that facilitate OMP and LPS assembly, transport, and turnover (Rhodius et al., 2006Rhodius V.A. Suh W.C. Nonaka G. West J.

In contrast to σE, other signal transduction systems associated with envelope damage surveillance in E. coli are less well understood, and in most cases, the direct activating signal is obscure. The Rcs phosphorelay is one of the most complex bacterial signaling systems. It is induced mostly by OM and cell wall damage (Evans et al., 2013Evans K.L. Kannan S. Li G. de Pedro M.A. Young K.D.

Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 379-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In response to these cues, Rcs controls the expression of genes involved in motility, biofilm formation, virulence, and periplasmic quality control (Majdalani and Gottesman, 2005Majdalani N. Gottesman S. The Rcs phosphorelay: a complex signal transduction system.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 379-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The complexity of the system, both at the input and output level, has been an obstacle in dissecting it and fully addressing its physiological role. Unlike typical two-component systems consisting of an inner membrane (IM) sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR), the Rcs system has at least six components (Figure 1A). In addition to RcsC (HK) and RcsB (RR), the system contains an intermediate IM phosphorelay protein, RcsD, an auxiliary nonphosphorylatable transcription factor RcsA, and two proteins that act upstream of the phosphorelay cascade and are associated with signal sensing, YrfF and RcsF (Cano et al., 2002Cano D.A. Domínguez-Bernal G. Tierrez A. Garcia-Del Portillo F. Casadesús J. Regulation of capsule synthesis and cell motility in Salmonella enterica by the essential gene igaA.Genetics. 2002; 162: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar, Castanié-Cornet et al., 2006Castanié-Cornet M.P.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4264-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). YrfF is an IM protein, mostly characterized in Salmonella Typhimurium, which downregulates the Rcs pathway by an unknown mechanism (Domínguez-Bernal et al., 2004Domínguez-Bernal G. Pucciarelli M.G. Ramos-Morales F. García-Quintanilla M. Cano D.A. Casadesús J. García-del Portillo F. Repression of the RcsC-YojN-RcsB phosphorelay by the IgaA protein is a requisite for Salmonella virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene is lethal, unless the Rcs phosphorelay is also inactivated (Cano et al., 2002Cano D.A. Domínguez-Bernal G. Tierrez A. Garcia-Del Portillo F. Casadesús J. Regulation of capsule synthesis and cell motility in Salmonella enterica by the essential gene igaA.Genetics. 2002; 162: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar). yrfF has been renamed to igaA in S. Typhimurium and we use the same nomenclature for the E. coli gene in this paper. RcsF is an OM lipoprotein that is absolutely required for sensing envelope damage caused either by chemicals targeting the LPS or the PG (Farris et al., 2010Farris C. Sanowar S. Bader M.W. Pfuetzner R. Miller S.I. Antimicrobial peptides activate the Rcs regulon through the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF.J.

Li G. de Pedro M.A. Young K.D. Eliminating a set of four penicillin binding proteins triggers the Rcs phosphorelay and Cpx stress responses in Escherichia coli.J.

Microbiol. 2005; 59: 379-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Rcs pathway is the only signal transduction system which has an OM component that is necessary for sensing nearly all inducing cues. Yet, how RcsF senses envelope defects and conveys the signal to the downstream Rcs components has remained unknown. We found that RcsF is displayed on the cell surface by forming a complex with the abundant β-barrel protein OmpA. BamA, the central component of the β-barrel protein assembly machinery, plays a key role in this process by interacting with RcsF and funneling it to OmpA. When the Bam machinery cannot assemble the OmpA-RcsF complex, newly synthesized RcsF remains exposed in the periplasm. There, RcsF can interact with the less abundant protein IgaA, which we show is the downstream component of the signaling cascade, and activate the Rcs response. We first examined whether the two upstream components of the Rcs system, RcsF and IgaA, use a common pathway to transduce information to downstream components. In S. Typhimurium IgaA is an essential IM protein that inhibits the Rcs system (Cano et al., 2002Cano D.A. Domínguez-Bernal G. Tierrez A. Garcia-Del Portillo F. Casadesús J. Regulation of capsule synthesis and cell motility in Salmonella enterica by the essential gene igaA.Genetics. 2002; 162: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar, Domínguez-Bernal et al., 2004Domínguez-Bernal G. Pucciarelli M.G. Ramos-Morales F. García-Quintanilla M. Cano D.A. Casadesús J. García-del Portillo F. Repression of the RcsC-YojN-RcsB phosphorelay by the IgaA protein is a requisite for Salmonella virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We verified that igaA is also essential in E. coli and using an established pipeline for large-scale testing of genetic interactions (Typas et al., 2008Typas A. Nichols R.J. Siegele D.A. Shales M. Collins S.R. Lim B. Braberg H. Yamamoto N. Takeuchi R. Wanner B.L. et al.High-throughput, quantitative analyses of genetic interactions in E. coli.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we showed that, among a collection of knockout mutants for all E. coli nonessential genes (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 0008Crossref Scopus (5382) Google Scholar), an igaA deletion was viable only when combined with deletions of rcsB, rcsC, and rcsD (Figure S1A available online). Thus, E. coli and S. Typhimurium igaA play similar roles. Importantly, deletion of rcsF did not suppress igaA lethality, implying that IgaA lies downstream of RcsF in the signaling cascade. In agreement with this configuration, depletion of igaA activated the Rcs system independently of RcsF (Figures 1B and S1B). We next tested whether IgaA and RcsF are physically linked by expressing a tagged version of the only periplasmic domain of IgaA (IgaAperi; ∼32 kDa) in the periplasm and pulling down its interaction partners after crosslinking with DTSSP (3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate]), which cannot cross the IM. RcsF was identified by both mass spectrometry (MS) and western blot (Figure S1C and Table S1). Likewise, a purified tag-less version of IgaAperi and a soluble His-tagged version of RcsF directly interacted, forming a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Figures 1C and S1D). These results support a model in which RcsF activates the Rcs system by interacting with IgaA, likely alleviating its inhibitory effect on the signaling cascade. Wild-type RcsF turns on the signaling cascade only upon envelope stress, suggesting that RcsF is physically occluded from IM IgaA under steady-state growth. This physical occlusion is tightly interconnected with the OM location of RcsF, as rerouting RcsF to the IM (RcsFIM) or expressing it as a soluble periplasmic protein (RcsFperi), constitutively activates the Rcs system (Farris et al., 2010Farris C. Sanowar S. Bader M.W. Pfuetzner R. Miller S.I. Antimicrobial peptides activate the Rcs regulon through the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4894-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Tao et al., 2012Tao K. Narita S. Tokuda H. Defective lipoprotein sorting induces lolA expression through the Rcs stress response phosphorelay system.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 3643-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore looked for the underlying occlusion mechanism. RcsF is composed of a 31-residue intrinsically disordered N-terminal linker (S17-T47), which connects its globular domain (P48-K134; referred to as “signaling domain”) to the lipidated cysteine residue anchoring the protein to the OM (Figure S2A) (Leverrier et al., 2011Leverrier P. Declercq J.P. Denoncin K. Vertommen D. Hiniker A. Cho S.H. Collet J.F. Crystal structure of the outer membrane protein RcsF, a new substrate for the periplasmic protein-disulfide isomerase DsbC.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16734-16742Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We first tested whether this linker is cleaved under stress, releasing RcsF in the periplasm, by fractionating cells exposed to various Rcs-inducing stresses. RcsF was never detected in the soluble fraction (Figure S2B). We then determined whether RcsF was occluded from IgaA by being sequestered by other proteins. To find proteins interacting with RcsF, we performed in vivo DTSSP crosslinking in both ΔrcsF and wild-type cells. Three RcsF-containing protein complexes were detected (Figure 2A; marked as 1, 2, and 3). To identify them, the RcsF-interacting complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by MS after reversing the crosslinks. We identified BamA, the core protein for β-barrel assembly, and the β-barrels OmpA, OmpC and OmpF as potential RcsF interacting partners (Table S2A). We further verified these interactions by analyzing the immunoprecipitated samples by western blot using antibodies specific for the interacting proteins. We confirmed that the ∼115 kDa band (complex 1) contained BamA (∼100 kDa) (Figure S2C). Only OmpA (38 kDa) could be detected in the ∼55 kDa complex (complex 2) (Figure S2C), but not OmpC (40 kDa) and OmpF (39 kDa) (data not shown), suggesting that OmpA was the major interaction partner involved in this complex. Consistently, upon depleting the essential BamA or deleting ompA, the respective complexes disappeared (Figure 2B). Using an lpp deletion mutant, we identified that the protein involved in complex 3 (∼25 kDa) was Lpp (8 kDa), the most abundant OM lipoprotein (Figure S2D).Figure 2RcsF Forms Complexes with BamA and OmpA In Vivo, Which Prevents It from Activating the Signaling CascadeShow full caption(A and B) In vivo chemical crosslinking of RcsF in the periplasm.

Three complexes were observed (A), which were identified as RcsF-BamA (1), RcsF-OmpA (2) and RcsF-Lpp (3) (Figures S2C and S2D).

Error bars depict standard deviations (n > 4). See also Figures S2 and S3. We further verified the specificity of these interactions by site-specific photocrosslinking, inserting the crosslinkable amino acid p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBpa) at 25 specific positions in RcsF. Thereby we could map the interaction interface of RcsF with its binding partners more precisely, and lower the risk of nonspecific interactions (pBpa can only form covalent bonds with residues at a very close proximity [3 Å], whereas DTSSP has a 12 Å spacer). We selected 21 residues located on the surface of the signaling domain and 4 located in the N-terminal linker (Figure S3A). Following UV-exposure, 6/25 variants formed the previously observed 55 kDa complex with OmpA (Figures 2C and S3B). The identity of OmpA was confirmed by MS after immunoprecipitating RcsFK40pBPA-OmpA (OmpC and OmpF were not detected in the sample, Table S2B). High complex levels were observed when pBpa was inserted in the N-terminal linker and at the tip of the signaling domain of RcsF (Figure S3C). Four of these variants could also form the 115 kDa complex corresponding to BamA-RcsF (Figures 2C and S3D), which was confirmed with a BamA antibody (Figure S3D). As none of the 25 pBpa-containing variants was found in complex with Lpp, and as Lpp is the most abundant protein in E. coli, which could lead to nonspecific interactions, we decided not to follow up on this interaction. Altogether, these results indicated that RcsF interacts specifically with BamA and OmpA. Importantly, the levels of the RcsFK40pBPA-OmpA complex were ∼30%–40% of these of free RcsF, indicating that 25%–30% of total RcsF is bound to OmpA (Figures S3E and S3F). Given that photocrosslinking efficiency at optimal conditions can reach 40% (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang M. Lin S. Song X. Liu J. Fu Y. Ge X. Fu X. Chang Z. Chen P.R. A genetically incorporated crosslinker reveals chaperone cooperation in acid resistance.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we concluded that most RcsF is in complex with OmpA. The interactions of RcsF with BamA and OmpA suggested that in nonstress conditions RcsF is occluded from IgaA by interacting with OM proteins, but that these interactions are disturbed upon envelope stress, enabling RcsF to interact with IgaA. If OmpA and BamA occlude RcsF from IgaA under nonstress conditions, then the Rcs system should be activated when bamA or ompA are knocked down/out. We found that an ompA deletion induced the Rcs system by ∼3-fold, with induction being dependent on RcsF (Figure 2D). As OmpC and OmpF were also identified as RcsF partners, we tested the effect of deleting ompC or ompF on Rcs activity. Whereas the system was only marginally induced in the ompC mutant, the ompF deletion had no impact (Figure 2D). When ompC and ompF deletions were combined together or with ompA, synergistic effects were observed, but the absence of OmpA was clearly the most important contributor of the three to the activation of Rcs (Figure 2D), consistently with our interaction data (Figures 2 and S3). In contrast to the omp mutants, the Rcs system was fully induced in the bamA knockdown (bamA101) mutant (Figure 2D). In this strain, BamA levels decrease ∼5-fold without significantly compromising β-barrel assembly (Aoki et al., 2008Aoki S.K. Malinverni J.C. Jacoby K. Thomas B. Pamma R. Trinh B.N. Remers S. Webb J. Braaten B.A. Silhavy T.J. Low D.A. Contact-dependent growth inhibition requires the essential outer membrane protein BamA (YaeT) as the receptor and the inner membrane transport protein AcrB.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 323-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with the idea that OMPs (mainly OmpA) and BamA occlude RcsF from IgaA and suggest a dominant role for BamA in this process. To dissect the signaling system further, we examined RcsF-BamA and RcsF-OmpA complex formation during Rcs activation by polymyxin B, A22, or mecillinam. All three chemicals induce the Rcs by targeting different cellular structures but always in an RcsF-dependent manner (Figure S4A) and without significantly affecting the transport of RcsF to the OM (Figure S4B). The cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B damages the OM by perturbing the LPS leaflet, A22 inhibits the actin-like MreB, and the β-lactam antibiotic mecillinam inhibits the essential transpeptidase PBP2. After addition of subinhibitory amounts of each drug, we observed a sharp decrease in the levels of the BamA-RcsF complex within the timeframe that the Rcs system would be activated, while OmpA-RcsF remained largely unaffected (Figures 3A–3C). We also probed a galU mutant that cannot produce UDP-D-glucose, a precursor for LPS and other surface-exposed sugars, and in which the Rcs system is constitutively turned on in an RcsF-dependent manner (Figure S4C) (Girgis et al., 2007Girgis H.S.

Similarly, the impact on the BamA-RcsF complex was stronger (Figure S4D). Thus, the BamA-RcsF complex was more responsive than the OmpA-RcsF complex, regardless of the stress applied.

BamA is required for assembly of β-barrel proteins in the OM, including OmpA (Hagan et al., 2011Hagan C.L. Silhavy T.J. Kahne D. β-Barrel membrane protein assembly by the Bam complex.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We postulated that BamA is also required for assembling the OmpA-RcsF complex. In this model, the BamA-RcsF complex would be an intermediate in the RcsF-OmpA formation during the assembly of the latter in the OM. Consistently decreasing BamA levels (bamA101) led to lower OmpA-RcsF levels (Figure 2B). Moreover, overexpressing BamA alone, without the other components of the Bam machinery (BamA alone cannot assemble OMPs [Hagan et al., 2010Hagan C.L. Kim S. Kahne D.

We established that the BamA-RcsF interaction is key in the ability of RcsF to activate the Rcs system and in the assembly of the OmpA-RcsF complex.

https://openalex.org/W2004299086,"Allelic richness (number of alleles) is a measure of genetic diversity indicative of a population's long-term potential for adaptability and persistence. It is used less commonly than heterozygosity as a genetic diversity measure, partially because it is more mathematically difficult to take into account the stochastic process of genetic drift for allelic richness. This paper presents a stochastic model for the allelic richness of a newly founded population experiencing genetic drift and gene flow. The model follows the dynamics of alleles lost during the founder event and simulates the effect of gene flow on maintenance and recovery of allelic richness. The probability of an allele's presence in the population was identified as the relevant statistical property for a meaningful interpretation of allelic richness. A method is discussed that combines the probability of allele presence with a population's allele frequency spectrum to provide predictions for allele recovery. The model's analysis provides insights into the dynamics of allelic richness following a founder event, taking into account gene flow and the allele frequency spectrum. Furthermore, the model indicates that the “One Migrant per Generation” rule, a commonly used conservation guideline related to heterozygosity, may be inadequate for addressing preservation of diversity at the allelic level. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between heterozygosity and allelic richness as measures of genetic diversity, since focusing merely on the preservation of heterozygosity might not be enough to adequately preserve allelic richness, which is crucial for species persistence and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2081299320,"Reprogramming to iPSCs resets the epigenome of somatic cells, including the reversal of X chromosome inactivation. We sought to gain insight into the steps underlying the reprogramming process by examining the means by which reprogramming leads to X chromosome reactivation (XCR). Analyzing single cells in situ, we found that hallmarks of the inactive X (Xi) change sequentially, providing a direct readout of reprogramming progression. Several epigenetic changes on the Xi occur in the inverse order of developmental X inactivation, whereas others are uncoupled from this sequence. Among the latter, DNA methylation has an extraordinary long persistence on the Xi during reprogramming, and, like Xist expression, is erased only after pluripotency genes are activated. Mechanistically, XCR requires both DNA demethylation and Xist silencing, ensuring that only cells undergoing faithful reprogramming initiate XCR. Our study defines the epigenetic state of multiple sequential reprogramming intermediates and establishes a paradigm for studying cell fate transitions during reprogramming."

https://openalex.org/W2062569744,"Background Determination of methylated Septin 9 (mSEPT9) in plasma has been shown to be a sensitive and specific biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the relationship between methylated DNA in plasma and colon tissue of the same subjects has not been reported. Methods Plasma and matching biopsy samples were collected from 24 patients with no evidence of disease (NED), 26 patients with adenoma and 34 patients with CRC. Following bisulfite conversion of DNA a commercial RT-PCR assay was used to determine the total amount of DNA in each sample and the fraction of mSEPT9 DNA. The Septin-9 protein was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Results The percent of methylated reference (PMR) values for SEPT9 above a PMR threshold of 1% were detected in 4.2% (1/24) of NED, 100% (26/26) of adenoma and 97.1% (33/34) of CRC tissues. PMR differences between NED vs. adenoma and NED vs. CRC comparisons were significant (p<0.001). In matching plasma samples using a PMR cut-off level of 0.01%, SEPT9 methylation was 8.3% (2/24) of NED, 30.8% (8/26) of adenoma and 88.2% (30/34) of CRC. Significant PMR differences were observed between NED vs. CRC (p<0.01) and adenoma vs. CRC (p<0.01). Significant differences (p<0.01) were found in the amount of cfDNA (circulating cell-free DNA) between NED and CRC, and a modest correlation was observed between mSEPT9 concentration and cfDNA of cancer (R2 = 0.48). The level of Septin-9 protein in tissues was inversely correlated to mSEPT9 levels with abundant expression in normals, and diminished expression in adenomas and tumors. Conclusions Methylated SEPT9 was detected in all tissue samples. In plasma samples, elevated mSEPT9 values were detected in CRC, but not in adenomas. Tissue levels of mSEPT9 alone are not sufficient to predict mSEPT9 levels in plasma. Additional parameters including the amount of cfDNA in plasma appear to also play a role."

Comerford et al. and Mashimo et al. now demonstrate that several types of cancer are avid consumers of acetate, which facilitates macromolecular biosynthesis and histone modification. Cancer cells have distinctive nutrient demands to fuel growth and proliferation, including the disproportionate use of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids. Comerford et al. and Mashimo et al. now demonstrate that several types of cancer are avid consumers of acetate, which facilitates macromolecular biosynthesis and histone modification. Metabolic pathways in cancer cells are programmed to facilitate survival and proliferation in the nonnative microenvironment of a tumor. This involves changes in both the way extracellular nutrients are captured and how they are metabolized. Historically, research efforts have focused on the wiring of glucose metabolism, owing to the seminal observations of Warburg and to the dominant role glucose plays in many basic biosynthetic processes (Vander Heiden et al., 2009Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10142) Google Scholar). The importance of other fuel sources, including glutamine, lipids, and protein, have received more recent attention upon realization that pathways governing their metabolism are often driven by oncogenes. In this issue of Cell, new studies from the McKnight and Tu (Comerford et al., 2014Comerford S.A. Huang Z. Du X. Wang Y. Cai L. Witkiewicz A.K. Walters H. Tantawy M.N. Fu A.

Vemireddy V. Hatanpaa K.J. Singh D.K. Sirasanagandla S. Nannepaga S. Piccirillo S.G. Kovacs Z. Foong C. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1603-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) illustrate that a variety of cancers are also capable of capturing and metabolizing exogenous acetate and that this represents a metabolic adaptation that some tumors use to facilitate growth. Acetate, when ligated to coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), is among the most central and dynamic metabolites in intermediary metabolism (Figure 1). It can be generated by the oxidation of glucose, glutamine, or fatty acids; it is used to biosynthesize nucleotides, amino acids, and both principle components of the cell membrane in mammals (i.e., fatty acids and cholesterol); and it contributes to enzyme and gene regulation by reversibly adding to nonhistone protein and histone tails, respectively (Figure 1) (Kaelin and McKnight, 2013Kaelin Jr., W.G. McKnight S.L. Cell. 2013; 153: 56-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Indeed, numerous studies have illustrated the fundamental roles that acetyl-CoA regulation plays in cell growth and proliferative processes (Wellen and Thompson, 2012Wellen K.E. Thompson C.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 270-276PubMed Google Scholar). However, under oxygen limiting conditions, as are often seen in the microenvironment of a tumor, the ability of a cell to make acetyl-CoA is severely hampered. Intrigued by this conundrum, and based on the mechanisms by which yeast generate acetyl-CoA, Comerford et al., 2014Comerford S.A. Huang Z. Du X. Wang Y. Cai L. Witkiewicz A.K. Walters H. Tantawy M.N.

Manning H.C. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1591-1602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar explored the functional relevance of the mammalian homologs of the yeast enzymes that generate acetyl-CoA. Mammals express three isoforms of short-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSS) that convert acetate and coenzyme-A into acetyl-CoA by consuming ATP. Two of these are localized in mitochondria (ACSS1 and ACSS3), and one can access both the nuclear and cytoplasmic space, ACSS2 (Watkins et al., 2007Watkins P.A. Maiguel D. Jia Z. Pevsner J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2736-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Comerford et al., 2014Comerford S.A. Huang Z. Du X. Wang Y. Cai L. Witkiewicz A.K. Walters H. Tantawy M.N. Fu A. Manning H.C. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1591-1602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar find that knockdown of ACSS2, but not the mitochondrial isoforms, dramatically impairs the incorporation of exogenously supplied acetate into lipids and histone protein. These results illustrate that proliferating mammalian cells, including cancer cells, can consume and contribute acetate carbon to the cellular pool of acetyl-CoA. In a parallel study, Mashimo et al., 2014Mashimo T. Pichumani K. Vemireddy V. Hatanpaa K.J. Singh D.K. Sirasanagandla S. Nannepaga S. Piccirillo S.G. Kovacs Z.

The authors examined acetate metabolism in this context based on an earlier observation that a significant proportion of carbon in the acetyl-CoA pool could not be accounted for by tracing glucose and glutamine metabolism (Marin-Valencia et al., 2012Marin-Valencia I. Yang C. Mashimo T. Cho S. Baek H. Yang X.L. Rajagopalan K.N. Maddie M. Vemireddy V. Zhao Z. et al.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). By tracing acetate carbon, Mashimo et al., 2014Mashimo T. Pichumani K. Vemireddy V. Hatanpaa K.J. Singh D.K. Sirasanagandla S. Nannepaga S. Piccirillo S.G. Kovacs Z. Foong C. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1603-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar reveal that TCA cycle intermediates consist of as much as 50% acetate-derived carbon by mass. In contrast, non-tumor-bearing brain incorporates on the order of 10% acetate-derived carbon into TCA cycle intermediates. These observations are striking for several reasons, foremost because it illustrates that cancer cells are a sink for acetate and that acetate readily competes with glucose for generating TCA cycle intermediates, even though glucose is much more abundant. In these experiments, in vivo acetate levels are artificially raised to ∼0.6 mM, and systemic glucose is maintained at ∼5 mM. These results also provide validation of earlier, provocative work from the Bachoo and Maher labs (Marin-Valencia et al., 2012Marin-Valencia I. Yang C. Mashimo T. Cho S. Baek H. Yang X.L. Rajagopalan K.N. Maddie M. Vemireddy V. Zhao Z. et al.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) that glutamine carbon is not actively oxidized in the TCA cycle in cells within the brain microenvironment (both brain cancer and metastases from other organ disease). Together, this argues that glucose and acetate metabolites are the dominant TCA cycle fuels in these cancers. The independent but convergent findings from these two teams, which illustrate that acetate is readily captured and metabolized by cancer cells, prompted an exploration of the functional relevance and necessity of ACSS2 and acetate metabolism in cancer. To this end, Comerford et al., 2014Comerford S.A. Huang Z. Du X. Wang Y. Cai L. Witkiewicz A.K. Walters H. Tantawy M.N. Fu A.

In both cases, the tumor burden is significantly blunted. Consistent with this finding, high ACSS2 protein expression is observed in a subset of human triple-negative breast cancer samples, and this elevation correlates with poor survival. Similar correlations between ACSS2 elevation and poor outcome are obtained by Mashimo et al., 2014Mashimo T. Pichumani K. Vemireddy V. Hatanpaa K.J. Singh D.K. Sirasanagandla S. Nannepaga S.

The advantage of this technique is that the metabolism of acetate can be traced into downstream products. Initially, using orthotopic models with patient-derived material, they illustrate that acetate contributes a significant fraction of carbon to TCA cycle intermediates. Moreover, they show, using the identical technique in human patients, that brain tumors growing in human beings metabolize acetate in a manner nearly identical to tumors grown orthotopically in the mouse brain. Collectively, these results have several important therapeutic implications. First, they provide a clear demonstration that acetate is a metabolic fuel in vivo that is preferentially utilized by a subset of cancers. They also illustrate that this is mediated by ACSS2, whose expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness in the six different organ diseases analyzed. This suggests that acetate avidity and metabolism may be a general feature of many cancers. In contrast, normal cells appear unaffected by loss of ACSS2-mediated acetate metabolism, as ACSS2 null mice do not exhibit any overt phenotypic defects. Taken together, it is reasonable to conclude that acetate metabolism may represent an addiction of certain cancer cells. Furthermore, the results presented in these studies illustrate the clinical applicability of two different acetate-measuring technologies—i.e., [11C]acetate-PET and [13C]acetate-NMR. Such strategies could be used to identify patients likely to respond to an antimetabolism therapy and could also be used as markers of therapeutic response. These findings beg the question as to how ACSS2 inhibition would affect an established tumor. The only experiment presented in this regard revealed that ACSS2 knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in brain cancer cells grown in 3D culture resulted in cell death and an overall reduction in neurospheres. The astute reader may recognize that, under such conditions (growth in culture), very little acetate is present. More to this point, the concentration of serum acetate under physiological circumstances is on the order of 0.2 mM (Tollinger et al., 1979Tollinger C.D. Vreman H.J. Weiner M.W. Clin. Chem. 1979; 25: 1787-1790PubMed Google Scholar), raising the question of how a relatively low abundance molecule could contribute meaningfully to biomass in a rapidly proliferating cell. To address this, Comerford et al., 2014Comerford S.A. Huang Z. Du X. Wang Y. Cai L. Witkiewicz A.K. Walters H. Tantawy M.N. Fu A. Manning H.C. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1591-1602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar put forth a persuasive argument for tumor cell evolution, relating it to that of bacterial cells evolving in a population, where seemingly minor advantages can ultimately have profound impacts. We put forth an additional, but not mutually exclusive, point of view based on three pieces of experimental data from these studies. First, exogenous acetate, by way of acetyl-CoA, is found on histone proteins. Second, ACSS2 is readily observed in the nucleus of tumor cells, as evidenced by histological staining. And third, as noted above, ACSS2 knockdown in human patient tumor cell lines, grown in media devoid of acetate, is growth inhibitory. These finding suggest that the major role of ACSS2 is to capture acetate released from deacetylated proteins and to reincorporate that into the acetyl-CoA pool for epigenetic regulation. As Comerford et al., 2014Comerford S.A. Huang Z. Du X. Wang Y. Cai L. Witkiewicz A.K. Walters H. Tantawy M.N. Fu A. Manning H.C. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1591-1602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar point out, the half-life of histone acetylation is on the order of minutes, and a considerable fraction of acetate could be produced in vivo by the turnover of histone acetylation. ACSS2 in the nucleus provides a rapid way to reconvert this acetate to acetyl-CoA for use in reacetylating histones and thereby maintaining the epigenetic code. Although ACSS2 is not essential for this function in normal tissues, as evidenced by the viable ACSS2 knockout mouse, it is possible that certain cancer cells require this function to maintain gene expression profiles optimized for rapid growth. Exogenous acetate, in this case, is treated equivalently to that generated by deacetylation. Regardless of the mechanism(s) by which cancer cells utilize acetate, the insights provided by these studies position acetate metabolism as a potentially exploitable vulnerability in cancer metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2039104072,"Recent studies applying high-throughput sequencing technologies have identified several recurrently mutated genes and pathways in multiple cancer genomes. However, transcriptional consequences from these genomic alterations in cancer genome remain unclear. In this study, we performed integrated and comparative analyses of whole genomes and transcriptomes of 22 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and their matched controls. Comparison of whole genome sequence (WGS) and RNA-Seq revealed much evidence that various types of genomic mutations triggered diverse transcriptional changes. Not only splice-site mutations, but also silent mutations in coding regions, deep intronic mutations and structural changes caused splicing aberrations. HBV integrations generated diverse patterns of virus-human fusion transcripts depending on affected gene, such as TERT, CDK15, FN1 and MLL4. Structural variations could drive over-expression of genes such as WNT ligands, with/without creating gene fusions. Furthermore, by taking account of genomic mutations causing transcriptional aberrations, we could improve the sensitivity of deleterious mutation detection in known cancer driver genes (TP53, AXIN1, ARID2, RPS6KA3), and identified recurrent disruptions in putative cancer driver genes such as HNF4A, CPS1, TSC1 and THRAP3 in HCCs. These findings indicate genomic alterations in cancer genome have diverse transcriptomic effects, and integrated analysis of WGS and RNA-Seq can facilitate the interpretation of a large number of genomic alterations detected in cancer genome."

The aim of this study was to describe and compare the microbial communities of the lower airway of clinically stable children with CF and children without CF. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and paired oropharyngeal swabs from clinically stable children with CF (n = 13) and BAL from children without CF (n = 9) were collected. DNA was isolated, the 16S rRNA regions amplified, fragmented, biotinylated and hybridised to a 16S rRNA microarray. Patient medical and demographic information was recorded and standard microbiological culture was performed. Results A diverse bacterial community was detected in the lower airways of children with CF and children without CF. The airway microbiome of clinically stable children with CF and children without CF were significantly different as measured by Shannon's Diversity Indices (p = 0.001; t test) and Principle coordinate analysis (p = 0.01; Adonis test). Overall the CF airway microbial community was more variable and had a less even distribution than the microbial community in the airways of children without CF. We highlighted several bacteria of interest, particularly Prevotella veroralis, CW040 and a Corynebacterium, which were of significantly differential abundance between the CF and non-CF lower airways. Both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae culture abundance were found to be associated with CF airway microbial community structure. The CF upper and lower airways were found to have a broadly similar microbial milieu. Conclusion The microbial communities in the lower airways of stable children with CF and children without CF show significant differences in overall diversity. These discrepancies indicate a disruption of the airway microflora occurring early in life in children with CF."

We found that autosomal recessive TPP2 mutations cause recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and neurodevelopmental delay in humans. We show that a major function of TPPII in mammalian cells is to maintain amino acid levels and that TPPII-deficient cells compensate by increasing lysosome number and proteolytic activity. However, the overabundant lysosomes derange cellular metabolism by consuming the key glycolytic enzyme hexokinase-2 through chaperone-mediated autophagy. This reduces glycolysis and impairs the production of effector cytokines, including IFN-γ and IL-1β. Thus, TPPII controls the balance between intracellular amino acid availability, lysosome number, and glycolysis, which is vital for adaptive and innate immunity and neurodevelopmental health."
https://openalex.org/W1968906797,"The ethiology of colon cancer is largely dependent on inflammation driven oxidative stress. The analysis of 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) level in leukocyte DNA of healthy controls (138 individuals), patients with benign adenomas (AD, 137 individuals) and with malignant carcinomas (CRC, 169 individuals) revealed a significant increase in the level of 8-oxodGuo in leukocyte DNA of AD and CRC patients in comparison to controls. The counteracting mechanism is base excision repair, in which OGG1 and PARP-1 play a key role. We investigated the level of PARP-1 and OGG1 mRNA and protein in diseased and marginal, normal tissues taken from AD and CRC patients and in leukocytes taken from the patients as well as from healthy subjects. In colon tumors the PARP-1 mRNA level was higher than in unaffected colon tissue and in polyp tissues. A high positive correlation was found between PARP-1 and OGG1 mRNA levels in all investigated tissues. This suggests reciprocal influence of PARP-1 and OGG1 on their expression and stability, and may contribute to progression of colon cancer. PARP-1 and OGG1 proteins level was several fold higher in polyps and CRC in comparison to normal colon tissues. Individuals bearing the Cys326Cys genotype of OGG1 were characterized by higher PARP-1 protein level in diseased tissues than the Ser326Cys and Ser326Ser genotypes. Aforementioned result may suggest that the diseased cells with polymorphic OGG1 recruit more PARP protein, which is necessary to remove 8-oxodGuo. Thus, patients with decreased activity of OGG1/polymorphism of the OGG1 gene and higher 8-oxodGuo level may be more susceptible to treatment with PARP-1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2007325180,"Single domain antibodies are the small recombinant variable domains derived from camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies. They are renowned for their stability, in large part due to their ability to refold following thermal or chemical denaturation. In addition to refolding after heat denaturation, A3, a high affinity anti-Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B single domain antibody, possesses a melting temperature of ∼84°C, among the highest reported for a single domain antibody. In this work we utilized the recently described crystal structure of A3 to select locations for the insertion of a second disulfide bond and evaluated the impact that the addition of this second bond had on the melting temperature. Four double-disulfide versions of A3 were constructed and each was found to improve the melting temperature relative to the native structure without reducing affinity. Placement of the disulfide bond at a previously published position between framework regions 2 and 3 yielded the largest improvement (>6°C), suggesting this location is optimal, and seemingly provides a universal route to raise the melting temperature of single domain antibodies. This study further demonstrates that even single domain antibodies with extremely high melting points can be further stabilized by addition of disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2054127577,"The smoking of tobacco continues to be the leading cause of premature death worldwide and is linked to the development of a number of serious illnesses including heart disease, respiratory diseases, stroke and cancer. Currently, cell line based toxicity assays are typically used to gain information on the general toxicity of cigarettes and other tobacco products. However, they provide little information regarding the complex disease-related changes that have been linked to smoking. The ethical concerns and high cost associated with mammalian studies have limited their widespread use for in vivo toxicological studies of tobacco. The zebrafish has emerged as a low-cost, high-throughput, in vivo model in the study of toxicology. In this study, smoke condensates from 2 reference cigarettes and 6 Canadian brands of cigarettes with different design features were assessed for acute, developmental, cardiac, and behavioural toxicity (neurotoxicity) in zebrafish larvae. By making use of this multifaceted approach we have developed an in vivo model with which to compare the toxicity profiles of smoke condensates from cigarettes with different design features. This model system may provide insights into the development of smoking related disease and could provide a cost-effective, high-throughput platform for the future evaluation of tobacco products."
https://openalex.org/W2013660990,"The importance of epigenetic changes in the development of hepatic steatosis is largely unknown. The histone variant macroH2A1 under alternative splicing gives rise to macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2. In this study, we show that the macroH2A1 isoforms play an important role in the regulation of lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Hepatoma cell line and immortalized human hepatocytes transiently transfected or knocked down with macroH2A1 isoforms were used as in vitro model of fat-induced steatosis. Gene expressions were analyzed by quantitative PCR array and Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to check the association of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) with the promoter of lipogenic genes. Livers from knockout mice that are resistant to lipid deposition despite a high-fat diet were used for histopathology. We found that macroH2A1.2 is regulated by fat uptake and that its overexpression caused an increase in lipid uptake, triglycerides, and lipogenic genes compared with macroH2A1.1. This suggests that macroH2A1.2 is important for lipid uptake, whereas macroH2A1.1 was found to be protective. The result was supported by a high positivity for macroH2A1.1 in knockout mice for genes targeted by macroH2A1 (Atp5a1 and Fam73b), that under a high-fat diet presented minimal lipidosis. Moreover, macroH2A1 isoforms differentially regulate the expression of lipogenic genes by modulating the association of the active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks on their promoters. This study underlines the importance of the replacement of noncanonical histones in the regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the progression of steatosis.—Podrini, C., Koffas, A., Chokshi, S., Vinciguerra, M., Lelliott, C.

https://openalex.org/W2162104697,"The microtubule network regulates the turnover of integrin-containing adhesion complexes to stimulate cell migration. Disruption of the microtubule network results in an enlargement of adhesion complex size due to increased RhoA-stimulated actomyosin contractility, and inhibition of adhesion complex turnover; however, the microtubule-dependent changes in adhesion complex composition have not been studied in a global, unbiased manner. Here we used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to determine adhesion complex changes that occur upon microtubule disruption with nocodazole. Nocodazole-treated cells displayed an increased abundance of the majority of known adhesion complex components, but no change in the levels of the fibronectin-binding α5β1 integrin. Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed these findings, but revealed a change in localisation of adhesion complex components. Specifically, in untreated cells, α5-integrin co-localised with vinculin at peripherally located focal adhesions and with tensin at centrally located fibrillar adhesions. In nocodazole-treated cells, however, α5-integrin was found in both peripherally located and centrally located adhesion complexes that contained both vinculin and tensin, suggesting a switch in the maturation state of adhesion complexes to favour focal adhesions. Moreover, the switch to focal adhesions was confirmed to be force-dependent as inhibition of cell contractility with the Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, prevented the nocodazole-induced conversion. These results highlight a complex interplay between the microtubule cytoskeleton, adhesion complex maturation state and intracellular contractile force, and provide a resource for future adhesion signaling studies. The proteomics data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001183."
https://openalex.org/W2023717753,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease with significant morbidity and economic burden, accounting for a significant part of the workload in clinical microbiology laboratories. Current clinical chemisty point-of-care diagnostics rely on imperfect dipstick analysis which only provides indirect and insensitive evidence of urinary bacterial pathogens. An electronic nose (eNose) is a handheld device mimicking mammalian olfaction that potentially offers affordable and rapid analysis of samples without preparation at athmospheric pressure. In this study we demonstrate the applicability of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) -based eNose to discriminate the most common UTI pathogens from gaseous headspace of culture plates rapidly and without sample preparation. We gathered a total of 101 culture samples containing four most common UTI bacteries: E. coli, S. saprophyticus, E. faecalis, Klebsiella spp and sterile culture plates. The samples were analyzed using ChemPro 100i device, consisting of IMS cell and six semiconductor sensors. Data analysis was conducted by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression (LR). The results were validated by leave-one-out and 5-fold cross validation analysis. In discrimination of sterile and bacterial samples sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 97% were achieved. The bacterial species were identified with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 96% using eNose as compared to urine bacterial cultures.These findings strongly demonstrate the ability of our eNose to discriminate bacterial cultures and provides a proof of principle to use this method in urinanalysis of UTI."
https://openalex.org/W2063130669,"The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) has been widely used to study attention and impulse control in rodents. In order to mimic cognitive impairments in psychiatry, one approach has been to use acute administration of NMDA antagonists. This disruption in glutamatergic transmission leads to impairments in accuracy, omissions, and premature responses although findings have been inconsistent. In this study, we further investigated glutamatergic mechanisms using a novel version of the 5CSRTT, which we have previously shown to be more sensitive to cognitive enhancers. We first investigated the effects of systemic treatment with NMDA antagonists. We also carried out a preliminary investigation using targeted medial prefrontal cortex infusions of a NMDA antagonist (MK801), mGluR2/3 antagonist (LY341495), and mGluR7 negative allosteric modulator (MMPIP). Acute systemic administration of the different NMDA antagonists had no specific effects on accuracy. At higher doses PCP, ketamine, and memantine, increased omissions and affected other measures suggesting a general disruption in task performance. Only MK801 increased premature responses, and reduced omissions at lower doses suggesting stimulant like effects. None of the NMDA antagonists affected accuracy or any other measures when tested using a short stimulus challenge. Infusions of MK801 had no effect on accuracy but increased premature responses following infralimbic, but not prelimbic infusion. LY341495 had no effects in either brain region but a decrease in accuracy was observed following prelimbic infusion of MMPIP. Contrary to our hypothesis, disruptions to glutamate transmission using NMDA antagonists did not induce any clear deficits in accuracy in this modified version of the 5CSRTT. We also found that the profile of effects for MK801 differed from those observed with PCP, ketamine, and memantine. The effects of MK801 in the infralimbic cortex add to the literature indicating this brain region and glutamate play an important role in impulse control."
https://openalex.org/W2082632406,"Understanding the determinants of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is crucial, given its extensive health benefits. Some scholars have assumed that a proneness to react differently to environmental cues promoting sedentary versus active behaviors could be responsible for inter-individual differences in NEAT. In line with this reflection and grounded on the Reflective-Impulsive Model, we test the assumption that impulsive processes related to sedentary and physical activity behaviors can prospectively predict NEAT, operationalized as spontaneous effort exerted to maintain low intensity muscle contractions within the release phases of an intermittent maximal isometric contraction task. Participants (n = 91) completed a questionnaire assessing their intentions to adopt physical activity behaviors and a manikin task to assess impulsive approach tendencies towards physical activity behaviors (IAPA) and sedentary behaviors (IASB). Participants were then instructed to perform a maximal handgrip strength task and an intermittent maximal isometric contraction task. As hypothesized, multilevel regression analyses revealed that spontaneous effort was (a) positively predicted by IAPA, (b) negatively predicted by IASB, and (c) was not predicted by physical activity intentions, after controlling for some confounding variables such as age, sex, usual PA level and average force provided during the maximal-contraction phases of the task. These effects remained constant throughout all the phases of the task. This study demonstrated that impulsive processes may play a unique role in predicting spontaneous physical activity behaviors. Theoretically, this finding reinforces the utility of a motivational approach based on dual-process models to explain inter-individual differences in NEAT. Implications for health behavior theories and behavior change interventions are outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2021584909,"Osteoporosis is becoming a major health problem that is associated with increased fracture risk. Previous studies have shown that osteoporosis could delay fracture healing. Although there are potential agents available to promote fracture healing of osteoporotic bone such as statins and tocotrienol, studies on direct delivery of these agents to the fracture site are limited. This study was designed to investigate the effects of two potential agents, lovastatin and tocotrienol using targeted drug delivery system on fracture healing of postmenopausal osteoporosis rats. The fracture healing was evaluated using micro CT and biomechanical parameters. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley female rats were divided into 6 groups. The first group was sham-operated (SO), while the others were ovariectomized (OVx). After two months, the right tibiae of all rats were fractured at metaphysis region using pulsed ultrasound and were fixed with plates and screws. The SO and OVxC groups were given two single injections of lovastatin and tocotrienol carriers. The estrogen group (OVx+EST) was given daily oral gavages of Premarin (64.5 µg/kg). The Lovastatin treatment group (OVx+Lov) was given a single injection of 750 µg/kg lovastatin particles. The tocotrienol group (OVx+TT) was given a single injection of 60 mg/kg tocotrienol particles. The combination treatment group (OVx+Lov+TT) was given two single injections of 750 µg/kg lovastatin particles and 60 mg/kg tocotrienol particles. After 4 weeks of treatment, the fractured tibiae were dissected out for micro-CT and biomechanical assessments. The combined treatment group (OVx+Lov+TT) showed significantly higher callus volume and callus strength than the OVxC group (p<0.05). Both the OVx+Lov and OVx+TT groups showed significantly higher callus strength than the OVxC group (p<0.05), but not for callus volume. In conclusion, combined lovastatin and tocotrienol may promote better fracture healing of osteoporotic bone."
https://openalex.org/W2033710837,"The survey of plant and animal populations is central to undertaking field ecology. However, detection is imperfect, so the absence of a species cannot be determined with certainty. Methods developed to account for imperfect detectability during surveys do not yet account for stochastic variation in detectability over time or space. When each survey entails a fixed cost that is not spent searching (e.g., time required to travel to the site), stochastic detection rates result in a trade-off between the number of surveys and the length of each survey when surveying a single site. We present a model that addresses this trade-off and use it to determine the number of surveys that: 1) maximizes the expected probability of detection over the entire survey period; and 2) is most likely to achieve a minimally-acceptable probability of detection. We illustrate the applicability of our approach using three practical examples (minimum survey effort protocols, number of frog surveys per season, and number of quadrats per site to detect a plant species) and test our model's predictions using data from experimental plant surveys. We find that when maximizing the expected probability of detection, the optimal survey design is most sensitive to the coefficient of variation in the rate of detection and the ratio of the search budget to the travel cost. When maximizing the likelihood of achieving a particular probability of detection, the optimal survey design is most sensitive to the required probability of detection, the expected number of detections if the budget were spent only on searching, and the expected number of detections that are missed due to travel costs. We find that accounting for stochasticity in detection rates is likely to be particularly important for designing surveys when detection rates are low. Our model provides a framework to do this."
https://openalex.org/W2048397344,"After many years of research, small diameter, synthetic vascular grafts still lack the necessary biologic integration to perform ideally in clinical settings. Endothelialization of vascular grafts has the potential to improve synthetic graft function, and endothelial outgrowth cells (EOCs) are a promising autologous cell source. Yet no work has established the link between endothelial cell functions and outcomes of implanted endothelialized grafts. This work utilized steady flow, oscillatory flow, and tumor necrosis factor stimulation to alter EOC phenotype and enable the formulation of a model to predict endothelialized graft performance. To accomplish this, EOC in vitro expression of coagulation and inflammatory markers was quantified. In parallel, in non-human primate (baboon) models, the platelet and fibrinogen accumulation on endothelialized grafts were quantified in an ex vivo shunt, or the tissue ingrowth on implanted grafts were characterized after 1mth. Oscillatory flow stimulation of EOCs increased in vitro coagulation markers and ex vivo platelet accumulation. Steady flow preconditioning did not affect platelet accumulation or intimal hyperplasia relative to static samples. To determine whether in vitro markers predict implant performance, a linear regression model of the in vitro data was fit to platelet accumulation data—correlating the markers with the thromboprotective performance of the EOCs. The model was tested against implant intimal hyperplasia data and found to correlate strongly with the parallel in vitro analyses. This research defines the effects of flow preconditioning on EOC regulation of coagulation in clinical vascular grafts through parallel in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo analyses, and contributes to the translatability of in vitro tests to in vivo clinical graft performance."
https://openalex.org/W2105087163,"Objectives We investigated incidence rates to understand the nature of medication errors potentially introduced by utilizing a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in the three clinical phases of the medication process: prescription, administration, and documentation. Methods Overt observations and chart reviews were employed at two surgical intensive care units of a 950-bed tertiary teaching hospital. Ten categories of high-risk drugs prescribed over a four-month period were noted and reviewed. Error definition and classifications were adapted from previous studies for use in the present research. Incidences of medication errors in the three phases of the medication process were analyzed. In addition, nurses' responses to prescription errors were also assessed. Results Of the 534 prescriptions issued, 286 (53.6%) included at least one error. The proportion of errors was 19.0% (58) of the 306 drug administrations, of which two-thirds were verbal orders classified as errors due to incorrectly entered prescriptions. Documentation errors occurred in 205 (82.7%) of 248 correctly performed administrations. When tracking incorrectly entered prescriptions, 93% of the errors were intercepted by nurses, but two-thirds of them were recorded as prescribed rather than administered. Conclusion The number of errors occurring at each phase of the medication process was relatively high, despite long experience with a CPOE system. The main causes of administration errors and documentation errors were prescription errors and verbal order processes. To reduce these errors, hospital-level and unit-level efforts toward a better system are needed."

Here, we propose an optical imaging method to quantify glucose uptake and correct for in vivo delivery effects. Glucose uptake was measured using a fluorescent D-glucose derivative 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG) in mice implanted with dorsal skin flap window chambers. Additionally, vascular oxygenation (SO2) was calculated using only endogenous hemoglobin contrast. Results showed that the delivery factor proposed for correction, “RD”, reported on red blood cell velocity and injected 2-NBDG dose. Delivery-corrected 2-NBDG uptake (2-NBDG60/RD) inversely correlated with blood glucose in normal tissue, indicating sensitivity to glucose demand. We further applied our method in metastatic 4T1 and nonmetastatic 4T07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas. The ratio 2-NBDG60/RD was increased in 4T1 tumors relative to 4T07 tumors yet average SO2 was comparable, suggesting a shift toward a “Warburgian” (aerobic glycolysis) metabolism in the metastatic 4T1 line. In heterogeneous regions of both 4T1 and 4T07, 2-NBDG60/RD increased slightly but significantly as vascular oxygenation decreased, indicative of the Pasteur effect in both tumors. These data demonstrate the utility of delivery-corrected 2-NBDG and vascular oxygenation imaging for differentiating metabolic phenotypes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2006363083,"Mutations in MECP2 cause a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders of which Rett syndrome represents the best defined condition. Both neuronal and non-neuronal functions of the methyl-binding protein underlie the related pathologies. Nowadays MeCP2 is recognized as a multifunctional protein that modulates its activity depending on its protein partners and posttranslational modifications. However, we are still missing a comprehensive understanding of all MeCP2 functions and their involvement in the related pathologies. The study of human mutations often offers the possibility of clarifying the functions of a protein. Therefore, we decided to characterize a novel MeCP2 phospho-isoform (Tyr-120) whose relevance was suggested by a Rett syndrome patient carrying a Y120D substitution possibly mimicking a constitutively phosphorylated state. Unexpectedly, we found MeCP2 and its Tyr-120 phospho-isoform enriched at the centrosome both in dividing and postmitotic cells. The molecular and functional connection of MeCP2 to the centrosome was further reinforced through cellular and biochemical approaches. We show that, similar to many centrosomal proteins, MeCP2 deficiency causes aberrant spindle geometry, prolonged mitosis, and defects in microtubule nucleation. Collectively, our data indicate a novel function of MeCP2 that might reconcile previous data regarding the role of MeCP2 in cell growth and cytoskeleton stability and that might be relevant to understand some aspects of MeCP2-related conditions. Furthermore, they link the Tyr-120 residue and its phosphorylation to cell division, prompting future studies on the relevance of Tyr-120 for cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2104048792,"Insect outbreaks are often assumed to increase the severity or probability of fire occurrence through increased fuel availability, while fires may in turn alter susceptibility of forests to subsequent insect outbreaks through changes in the spatial distribution of suitable host trees. However, little is actually known about the potential synergisms between these natural disturbances. Assessing inter-disturbance synergism is challenging due to the short length of historical records and the confounding influences of land use and climate changes on natural disturbance dynamics. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct defoliator outbreaks and fire occurrence at ten sites along a longitudinal transect running from central Oregon to western Montana. We assessed synergism between disturbance types, analyzed long-term changes in disturbance dynamics, and compared these disturbance histories with dendroclimatological moisture availability records to quantify the influence of moisture availability on disturbances. After approximately 1890, fires were largely absent and defoliator outbreaks became longer-lasting, more frequent, and more synchronous at our sites. Fires were more likely to occur during warm-dry years, while outbreaks were most likely to begin near the end of warm-dry periods. Our results show no discernible impact of defoliation events on subsequent fire risk. Any effect from the addition of fuels during defoliation events appears to be too small to detect given the overriding influence of climatic variability. We therefore propose that if there is any relationship between the two disturbances, it is a subtle synergistic relationship wherein climate determines the probability of occurrence of each disturbance type, and each disturbance type damps the severity, but does not alter the probability of occurrence, of the other disturbance type over long time scales. Although both disturbance types may increase in frequency or extent in response to future warming, our records show no precedent that western spruce budworm outbreaks will increase future fire risk."

Recently, dexpramipexole (RPPX) was advanced into human ALS clinical trials. In the current studies, we investigated RPPX in two parallel screening systems: 1) appropriately powered, sibling-matched, gender-balanced survival efficacy screening in high-copy B6-SJL-SOD1G93A/Gur1 mice, and 2) high-content neuronal survival screening in primary rat cortical neurons transfected with wild-type human TDP43 or mutant human TDP43. In both cases, we exposed the test systems to RPPX levels approximating those achieved in human Phase II clinical investigations. In SOD1G93A mice, no effect was observed on neuromotor disease progression or survival. In primary cortical neurons transfected with either mutant or wild-type human TDP43, a marginally significant improvement in a single indicator of neuronal survival was observed, and only at the 10 µM RPPX treatment. These systems reflect both mutant SOD1- and TDP43-mediated forms of neurodegeneration. The systems also reflect both complex non-cell autonomous and neuronal cell autonomous disease mechanisms. The results of these experiments, taken in context with results produced by other molecules tested in both screening systems, do not argue positively for further study of RPPX in ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2118141117,"Water level fluctuations in lakes lead to shoreline displacement. The seasonality of flooding or beaching of the littoral area affects nutrient cycling, redox gradients in sediments, and life cycles of aquatic organisms. Despite the ecological importance of water level fluctuations, we still lack a method that assesses water levels in the context of hydropower operations. Water levels in reservoirs are influenced by the operator of a hydropower plant, who discharges water through the turbines or stores water in the reservoir, in a fashion that maximizes profit. This rationale governs the seasonal operation scheme and hence determines the water levels within the boundaries of the reservoir's water balance. For progress towards a sustainable development of hydropower, the benefits of this form of electricity generation have to be weighed against the possible detrimental effects of the anthropogenic water level fluctuations. We developed a hydro-economic model that combines an economic optimization function with hydrological estimators of the water balance of a reservoir. Applying this model allowed us to accurately predict water level fluctuations in a reservoir. The hydro-economic model also allowed for scenario calculation of how water levels change with climate change scenarios and with a change in operating scheme of the reservoir (increase in turbine capacity). Further model development will enable the consideration of a variety of additional parameters, such as water withdrawal for irrigation, drinking water supply, or altered energy policies. This advances our ability to sustainably manage water resources that must meet both economic and environmental demands."

The Rho GTPase family plays critical roles in actin and membrane dynamics; however, the roles of the Rho GTPase family are not limited to cell adhesion and migration.

In the current study, we identified Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, as potential upstream regulators of membrane fusion.

Furthermore, an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex, a downstream effector of Rac1 and Cdc42, also reduced self-contact-induced membrane fusion. At self-contacts, while the concentration of E-cadherin diminished, the intensity of GFP-tagged Arp3 rapidly fluctuated then decreased and stabilized after membrane fusion.

In mammalian cell fusion, only syncytins have thus far been identified as bona fide fusogens and are responsible for trophoblast fusion in the placenta (8Mi S. Lee X. Li X. Veldman G.M. Finnerty H.

However, syncytin-1 may also be involved in cancer cell fusion (9Bjerregaard B. Holck S. Christensen I.J. Larsson L.I. Syncytin is involved in breast cancer-endothelial cell fusions.Cell. Mol.

Once membranes are brought into contact with fusogens, a mixing of the two membrane bilayers forms a hemifusion intermediate, and fusion may then proceed (12Podbilewicz B.

Although some progress has been made in understanding cell-to-cell fusion, the molecular components and regulation of self-contact-induced membrane fusion remain unclear. Although actin polymerization is required for cell adhesion and cell migration, very little is known about actin dynamics at self-contact-induced membrane fusion. Using dominant negative constructs and specific inhibitors, we tested Rho GTPases, upstream regulators of actin organization dynamics, during membrane fusion. Furthermore, we analyzed myosin II, a downstream effector of RhoA, and the Arp2/3 2The abbreviations used are: Arpactin-related proteinMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyROCKRho-associated protein kinaseDNdominant-negativeMLCmyosin regulatory light chainANOVAanalysis of variance. complex, a downstream effector of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation, in membrane fusion.

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). MDCK cells stably expressing Arp3-GFP (13Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J.

Stable Arp3-GFP cells were transiently transfected with tandem dimer DsRed tagged E-cadherin for dual co-localization analysis. The polydimethylsiloxane micropillar array was fabricated as previously described using standard soft lithography technique (4Sumida G.M. Yamada S. Self-contact elimination by membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18958-18963Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The dimensions of individual pillars were 20 μm in height and 5 μm in diameter and arranged in a series of hexagons with an 18-μm pitch along each hexagon side. To view pillar dimensions, pillars were stained with CellTracker CM-DiI (0.5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). All pillar substrates were coated with rat tail collagen type I (50 μg/ml, BD Biosciences). Cells were either seeded at confluence and incubated for up to 6 h or grown to confluence over the course of 24–48 h on the pillar array. Cells were fixed with 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min and then stained with AlexaFluor 488/568-phalloidin (Invitrogen). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss AxioObserver equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disk confocal system, 40× or 10× objectives, 488- and 561-nm solid-state lasers, and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ camera. The microscope system was controlled by Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). For live-cell imaging, the temperature was set to 37 °C by a custom microscope heating chamber. For scanning electron microscopy, cells were seeded onto collagen-coated pillar substrates that were micro-fabricated on 12-mm diameter round coverslips. Cells were quickly washed twice with 50% (v/v) 0.2 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), fixed with Karnovsky's fixative for 15 min, then washed 3 times with 50% (v/v) 0.2 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer. Samples were then incubated with ethanol (Electron Microscopy Sciences), then hexamethyldisilazane (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA), and dried at room temperature. All samples were gold sputter-coated and viewed with a scanning electron microscope. The method to quantify self-contact-induced membrane fusion has been described previously (4Sumida G.M. Yamada S. Self-contact elimination by membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18958-18963Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on self-contact-inducing substrates were trypsinized to remove cell adhesion sites including self-junctions, then stained with phalloidin. Fused cells remained with the pillars without obvious self-junctions. Results comparing two groups were analyzed using a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. Results comparing a single factor between three groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA; significance was determined using Dunnett's post hoc test. Results were considered significant with p < 0.05. To quantify fluorescence intensities surrounding individual pillars, we defined an annular region of interest bounded by the pillar (inner) circumference and concentric outer circle with the radius enlarged by 0.6 μm of the pillar radius. For self and cell-cell contacts, a freehand region of interest of the self-contact or along one representative side of each cell (cell-cell contact) was defined to measure fluorescence intensities and adjusted as contacts moved. Mean intensities within the region of interest surrounding the pillars and along cell contacts were measured every minute and then normalized with the basal fluorescence of the cell of interest (average intensity of five separate regions of interest within the cell) to correct for expression levels in different cells. All time-lapse images were first registered based on differential interference contrast images using ImageJ. To characterize the dynamics of the Arp2/3 complex, we analyzed the accumulation of Arp3 by quantifying the overall GFP intensities and the fluctuations in Arp3 signal by quantifying the deviation of GFP signals. Overall fluorescence intensities were calculated as average intensities over the course of the time lapse. Fluorescence intensity deviations were calculated from the rolling intensity values (with ± 5 min windows) by taking the square root of the squared difference between the rolling average and actual intensities for each time point. To compare the Arp3 dynamics at pre- and post-membrane fusion, we identified self-contacts via confocal microscopy. Before and after each time-lapse, z-stack images were taken to determine if pillars were surrounded by continuous cells (fused) or discontinuous cells (self-contacts). Pillars were subsequently categorized as post-fusion (continuous cells before and after time-lapse), pre-fusion (discontinuous cells before and after time-lapse), or fusing (discontinuous cells before and continuous after time-lapse). Of the 45 pillars analyzed, 14 were categorized as post-fusion, 13 as pre-fusion, and 9 as fusing. Nine pillars were not categorized due to cell division (6Lenard A. Ellertsdottir E. Herwig L. Krudewig A. Sauteur L. Belting H.G. Affolter M. In vivo analysis reveals a highly stereotypic morphogenetic pathway of vascular anastomosis.Dev. Cell. 2013; 25: 492-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or the status of the cells surrounding the pillars was not discernible (3Stone C.E. Hall D.H. Sundaram M.V. Lipocalin signaling controls unicellular tube development in the Caenorhabditis elegans excretory system.Dev. Biol. 2009; 329: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data points were considered outliers if mean intensities were >1.5× interquartile range below the first quartile or above the third quartile. For example, the normalized intensity surrounding one of the pillars in pre-fusion conditions was greater than the rest of the pre-fusion population, found to be an outlier and not included in further statistical analyses (see the dot plot in Fig. 3F). Results comparing a single factor between three groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and significance was determined using Bonferroni's all pairs comparison or Dunnett's post-hoc test compared with a single control. Results were considered significant with p < 0.05. To promote the formation of cell self-contacts, MDCK epithelial cells were plated on a micro-fabricated pillar array with individual pillars measuring 20 μm high and 5 μm in diameter and arranged in a series of hexagons with an 18-μm pitch along each hexagon side (Fig. 1A) (4Sumida G.M. Yamada S. Self-contact elimination by membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18958-18963Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The design of the pillar array allowed opposing membrane extensions from single cells to spread around individual pillars to form self-contacts (Fig. 1A). The cells, whether as single cells or cells within a monolayer, remain wrapped around the pillars (Fig. 1A) even after trypsin digest to remove cell junctions, suggesting that self-contacts were eliminated by membrane fusion (4Sumida G.M. Yamada S. Self-contact elimination by membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18958-18963Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This unique system provides an experimental platform to tease out the parameters required for this membrane fusion. The Rho GTPase family members play critical roles in regulating actin dynamics and cell-cell fusion. Thus, we examined the contribution of three main members of the Rho GTPase family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) to self-contact-induced membrane fusion. To test RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in self-contact-induced membrane fusion, we transiently expressed dominant-negative (DN) mutants with a GFP tag in MDCK cells. Both wild-type (WT)-RhoA- and DN-RhoA-expressing cells formed self-contacts. While the RhoA constructs localized to self-contacts, only WT-RhoA expressing cells fused around the pillars (Fig. 1B). We previously showed that ROCK inhibitors reduce self-contact-induced membrane fusion, presumably by reducing myosin II activity (4Sumida G.M. Yamada S. Self-contact elimination by membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18958-18963Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The absence of membrane fusion at self-contacts in DN-RhoA-expressing cells suggests that RhoA is likely an upstream regulator of ROCK and myosin II, and cell contractility through the Rho/ROCK pathway is a key process mediating self-contact-induced membrane fusion. To test the roles of myosin II in self-contact-induced membrane fusion, we analyzed the localization of myosin II at self-contacts. The antibody-labeled myosin IIA, a predominant myosin II isoform in MDCK cells (14Shih W. Yamada S. Myosin IIA dependent retrograde flow drives 3D cell migration.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: L29-L31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), localized around the pillar as well as along self-contacts (Fig. 1C). To analyze the efficiency of membrane fusion around the pillars, cells were briefly digested with trypsin to remove self- and cell-cell contacts, thus leaving behind only fused cells around the pillars (Fig. 1D, Control). Using myosin IIA-deficient cells (14Shih W. Yamada S. Myosin IIA dependent retrograde flow drives 3D cell migration.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: L29-L31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or cells treated with blebbistatin, a myosin II-specific inhibitor, trypsin digest could not separate adhesive contacts (Fig. 1D), thus making discrimination between fused cells from self-contacting cells difficult. As an alternate approach, myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) with alanine substitutions at phosphorylation sites was transfected into MDCK cells and compared with WT MLC expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 1E). The GFP-tagged MLC localized around the pillars and at self-contacts (Fig. 1E). Unlike myosin IIA-deficient cells or blebbistatin-treated cells, the MLC mutant-expressing cells still retracted upon trypsin digest to enable the fusion quantification. Yet, trypsin digest revealed significantly reduced membrane fusion around the pillars in the mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 1F), suggesting that membrane fusion is highly sensitive to myosin II activity and upstream signaling from RhoA. Both WT-Rac1- and DN-Rac1-expressing cells formed self-contacts with a strong accumulation of both Rac1 and actin filaments at self-contacts and around the pillars. Although we observed WT-Rac1-expressing cells fused around individual pillars, we did not observe pillar-bound-fused membranes in DN-Rac1-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). Similar to Rac1, both WT-Cdc42- and DN-Cdc42-expressing cells formed self-contacts and accumulated at self-contacts and around pillars, but unlike Rac1, membrane extensions of WT and some DN-Cdc42-expressing cells fused around pillars (Fig. 2B). Because Rac1 and Cdc42 have distinct downstream effectors from the RhoA signaling pathway, these downstream molecules may reveal new mechanistic details on self-contact-induced membrane fusion. Therefore, we further perturbed these Rho GTPases by specific small molecule inhibitors and analyzed the efficiency of self-contact-induced membrane fusion. MDCK cells were treated with either a Rac1-specific (NSC23766) or Cdc42-specific (ML 141) inhibitor. Due to Rac1 and Cdc42, both regulating cell spreading and motility, these inhibitors will also reduce the chance of two extending membranes from single cells to wrap around the pillars to form self-contacts. To circumvent this issue, cells were initially seeded at confluence in the absence of serum, which suppresses membrane fusion at self-contacts, while cells still adhere and spread around individual pillars to establish self-contacts (4Sumida G.M. Yamada S. Self-contact elimination by membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18958-18963Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A subsequent introduction of serum with inhibitors could then selectively test the ability of self-contacts to fuse instead of affecting the self-contact formation. Using trypsin treatment to separate cell-cell and self-contacts to identify fused cells around pillars (Fig. 2, C and E), both NSC23766 and ML 141 significantly decreased membrane fusion at self-contacts compared with respective control conditions, albeit the reduction of fusion was greater in the presence of the NSC23766 inhibitor (Fig. 2, D and F). To tease out defects in fusion due to either cell adhesion or membrane fusion, we tested whether inhibitor-treated cells are capable of maintaining self-contacts by analyzing E-cadherin localization. In the presence of NSC23766 or ML 141 inhibitor, E-cadherin localized to self-contacts, suggesting that cells were still capable of maintaining self-junctions despite NSC23766 or ML 141 treatment (Fig. 2G). Therefore, the reduction of fused membrane around the pillars was not due to the failure of cells to maintain self-contacts around individual pillars but, rather, to intrinsic defects during membrane fusion. Although some DN-Cdc42-expressing cells appeared to be fused around the pillars (Fig. 2B), the quantitative analysis using the inhibitors demonstrated that both Rac1 and Cdc42 suppress the fusion activity at self-contacts. To identify the Rac1 and Cdc42 downstream effectors that promote membrane fusion, we focused on the Arp2/3 complex, a potent actin nucleator that promotes the growth of actin network at the leading edge of migrating cells. In fixed cells, GFP-tagged Arp3, a component of the Arp2/3 complex, co-localized with phalloidin-labeled actin at sites of self-contact at a level similar to cell-cell contacts (Fig. 3A). In live-cell confocal imaging, Arp3-GFP formed puncta, and its intensity was discontinuous along cell-cell and self-contacts, thus making precise localization at self-contacts difficult. We define the pre-fusion state by scanning z-sections and finding Arp3-GFP localization that resembles self-contacts. In the absence of such localization, the membranes were defined as post-fusion. Arp3-GFP rapidly and transiently accumulated at self-contacts and subsequently dissipated as cells fused around individual pillars (Fig. 3B, supplemental Movie 1). Interestingly, Arp3-GFP also localized around the pillars adjacent to self-contacts with its intensity, often exceeding that of self and cell-cell contacts, rapidly fluctuating (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine the extent of the intensity fluctuations, we calculated intensity deviations (see “Experimental Procedures”) over time (Fig. 3C). As cells transitioned from self-contact to fused, the fluctuating Arp3-GFP intensities surrounding the pillars dimmed and stabilized (Fig. 3C, see another example in Fig. 3D, supplemental Movie 2). To further investigate the relationship between Arp3 surrounding the pillars and the state of the self-junctions (i.e. pre- versus post-fusion), we monitored Arp3-GFP intensity in confluent cells on the pillar substrate over the course of 3 h. The fluorescence intensities in post-fusion membranes remained dim and stable (Fig. 3E, supplemental Movie 3), whereas intensities in pre-fusion membranes were highly variable (Fig. 3E, supplemental Movie 4). The mean intensities of pre-fusion contact surrounding the pillars were greater than in post-fusion pillars (Fig. 3F). Additionally, intensities surrounding the pillars fluctuated throughout the time-lapse in pre-fusion membranes compared with the relatively stable intensities displayed in post-fusion membranes (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, the pre-fusion mean intensities and deviations surrounding the pillars were greater than at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 3, F and G), suggesting distinct Arp2/3 complex dynamics at self-contacts versus normal cell-cell contacts. We hypothesized that this Arp2/3 dynamics may be required for membrane fusion and tested the requirement of Arp2/3 activity in self-contact-induced membrane fusion using the Arp2/3-specific inhibitor CK-666. In immuno-stained wild-type cells, CK-666 decreased Arp3 at sites of self- and cell-cell contact as well as surrounding the pillars despite the presence of phalloidin labeled actin (Fig. 4A). In live-cell imaging, CK-666 decreased Arp3-GFP accumulation surrounding the pillars and at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 4B), suggesting the Arp2/3 complex is quickly inactivated in the presence of CK-666. Furthermore, in the presence of CK-666, self and cell-cell junctions remained intact with positive E-cadherin localization (Fig. 4B), albeit with a slight reduction in E-cadherin intensity. To analyze the effect of inhibitors on the accumulation and fluctuation of the Arp2/3 complex, we quantified Arp3-GFP intensity and deviation surrounding the pillars after drug treatment. Compared with CK-689 control, both Arp3-GFP intensity and deviation significantly decreased in the presence of CK-666 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, inhibition of the upstream regulators of the Arp2/3 complex, Rac1 and Cdc42, had less impact on both Arp3-GFP intensity and deviation (Fig. 4C). The effects of CK-666 on self-contact-induced membrane fusion were tested using the same inhibitor protocol for Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibitors. Although CK-666-treated cells were capable of forming self-contacts (Fig. 4D, −Trypsin, arrowheads), fusion decreased in a dose-dependent manner in comparison to the inactive CK-689 control (Fig. 4E). These data point to a direct role of the Arp2/3 complex in self-contact-induced membrane fusion. The Arp2/3 complex is required for lamellipodia extension that promotes the formation of new focal adhesions during cell migration. Therefore, we sought whether the Arp2/3 complexes promote the engagement or clustering of E-cadherin at self-junctions. We expressed tandem dimer DsRed-tagged E-cadherin and GFP-tagged Arp3 in MDCK cells. In live-cell imaging, E-cadherin was strongly concentrated at self-contact (Fig. 5A, arrowhead; supplemental Movie 5), whereas Arp3-GFP accumulated surrounding the pillar (Fig. 5A, supplemental Movie 6). As E-cadherin localization at self-contact became discontinuous, both E-cadherin and Arp3 intensities diminished (Fig. 5A, supplemental Movie 7). Upon closer examination, E-cadherin intensity initially became discontinuous immediately adjacent to the pillar (Fig. 5B, 14 min, arrow), where the Arp3 intensity was the highest at the side of the pillar facing the self-contact (Fig. 5B, 14 min). As E-cadherin intensity dissipated along the self-contact adjacent to the pillar (Fig. 5, B and C, 14 min), the Arp3 intensity remained high, albeit the Arp3 intensity slowly diminished after the E-cadherin intensity became discontinuous along the self-contact (Fig. 5C, 14 min and beyond). The reason for this gradual response of the Arp2/3 activity to membrane fusion is not clear, however. Eventually, both E-cadherin and Arp3 decreased to basal expression levels (Fig. 5C, 60 min). Unlike the canonical function of the Arp2/3 complex that promotes adhesion, these results suggest that high Arp2/3 activity promotes membrane fusion while E-cadherin dissipates from self-contacts. The fusion of membranes is a multistep process (membrane adhesion, close apposition of the membranes, and fusion) requiring careful, multifaceted regulation. All three small GTPases analyzed, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, compromise the efficiency of self-contact-induced membrane fusion, albeit at different degrees. The expression of DN-RhoA decreases the observed membrane fusion around the pillars (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with previous observations that ROCK inhibition and ROCK1/2 knockdown also decrease the efficiency of self-contact-induced membrane fusion (4Sum"

Either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg liraglutide was subcutaneously administered daily to 10 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with ESRD. Hemodialysis was conducted on days 1 and 3. Plasma liraglutide and glucose concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a continuous glucose monitoring system, respectively. The safety profile of liraglutide was also assessed. Hemodialysis had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of liraglutide in patients with diabetes and ESRD; the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), tmax, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and CL/f were unaltered. Similarly, hemodialysis did not affect the mean or minimum glucose levels, AUC, or duration of hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) following liraglutide administration. However, significant increases in mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and standard deviation (SD) as markers of glucose fluctuation, and the maximum glucose level were observed during hemodialysis. No adverse events, including hypoglycemia, were observed after liraglutide injection, either off-hemodialysis (day 2) or on-hemodialysis (day 3). Liraglutide was well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. The present results suggested that hemodialysis did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide or most glycemic indices, with the exception of MAGE, SD, and the maximum glucose level. These results suggested that it may be possible to use liraglutide during hemodialysis for diabetes with ESRD, without dose adjustment.

A total of 305 canine sera that were Leptospira microscopic agglutination test (MAT)-negative (n = 102) and MAT-positive (n = 203) to 5 serovars (Pomona, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola and Hardjo) were tested. When individual recombinant antigens were used, the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA were 97.5% and 84.3% for rLigACon4-8; 89.7% and 81.4% for rLoa22; 92.6% and 84.3% for rLipL32 and 99.5% and 84.3% for rLipL21, respectively compared to the MAT. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA were, 92.6% and 91.2% for rLigACon4-8 and rLipL32, 97.5% and 84.3% for rLigACon4-8 and rLipL21, 89.7% and 87.3% for rLigACon4-8 and rLoa22, 89.7% and 87.3% to rLipL21 and rLoa22, 92.6% and 91.2% for rLipL21 and rLipL32 and 89.2% and 94.1% for rLoa22 and rLipL32 when one of the two antigens was test positive.

https://openalex.org/W2059952282,"The ability of commensal bacteria to influence gene expression in host cells under the influence of pathogenic bacteria has previously been demonstrated, however the extent of this interaction is important for understanding how bacteria can be used as probiotics. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the most sensitive tool for evaluating relative changes to gene expression levels. However as a result of its sensitivity an appropriate method of normalisation should be used to account for any variation incurred in preparatory experimental procedures. These variations may result from differences in the amount of starting material, quality of extracted RNA, or in the efficiency of the reverse transcriptase or polymerase enzymes. Selection of an endogenous control gene is the preferred method of normalisation, and ideally a proper validation of the gene's appropriateness for the study in question should be performed. In this study we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction data and applied four different algorithms (geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and comparative ΔCq) to evaluate eleven different genes as to their suitability as endogenous controls for use in studies involving colonic (HT-29) and vaginal (VK2/E6E7) human mucosal epithelial cells treated with probiotic and pathogenic bacteria. We found phosphoglycerate kinase 1 to be most appropriate for HT-29 cells, and ribosomal protein large P0 to be the best choice for VK2/E6E7 cells. We also showed that use of less stable reference genes can lead to less accurate quantification of expression levels of gene of interest (GOI) and also can result in decreased statistical significance for GOI expression levels when compared to control. Additionally, we found the cell type being analysed had greater influence on reference gene selection than the treatment performed. This study provides recommendations for stable endogenous control genes for use in further studies involving colonic and vaginal cell lines after bacterial challenge."

The aim of this research was to determine the synaptic and proliferative response of the DG to severe oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in acute rat hippocampal slices and to investigate the contribution of P2X7 and P2Y1 receptor antagonism to recovery of synaptic activity after OGD. Extracellular field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in granule cells of the DG were recorded from rat hippocampal slices. Nine-min OGD elicited an irreversible loss of fEPSP and was invariably followed by the appearance of anoxic depolarization (AD). Application of MRS2179 (selective antagonist of P2Y1 receptor) and BBG (selective antagonist of P2X7 receptor), before and during OGD, prevented AD appearance and allowed a significant recovery of neurotransmission after 9-min OGD. The effects of 9-min OGD on proliferation and maturation of cells localized in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of slices prepared from rats treated with 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were investigated. Slices were further incubated with an immature neuron marker, doublecortin (DCX). The number of BrdU+ cells in the SGZ was significantly decreased 6 hours after OGD. This effect was antagonized by BBG, but not by MRS2179. Twenty-four hours after 9-min OGD, the number of BrdU+ cells returned to control values and a significant increase of DCX immunofluorescence was observed. This phenomenon was still evident when BBG, but not MRS2179, was applied during OGD. Furthermore, the P2Y1 antagonist reduced the number of BrdU+ cells at this time. The data demonstrate that P2X7 and P2Y1 activation contributes to early damage induced by OGD in the DG. At later stages after the insult, P2Y1 receptors might play an additional and different role in promoting cell proliferation and maturation in the DG."
https://openalex.org/W2011504421,G-protein-coupled receptors enable cells to recognize numerous external stimuli and to transmit corresponding signals across the plasma membrane to trigger appropriate cellular responses. Crystal structures of a number of these receptors have now been determined in inactive and active conformations bound to chemically and functionally distinct ligands. These crystal structures illustrate overall receptor organization and atomic details of ligand-receptor interactions.
https://openalex.org/W2046543990,"Vibrio vulnificus is an aquatic bacterium and an important human pathogen. Strains of V. vulnificus are classified into three different biotypes. The newly emerged biotype 3 has been found to be clonal and restricted to Israel. In the family Vibrionaceae, horizontal gene transfer is the main mechanism responsible for the emergence of new pathogen groups. To better understand the evolution of the bacterium, and in particular to trace the evolution of biotype 3, we performed genome-wide SNP genotyping of 254 clinical and environmental V. vulnificus isolates with worldwide distribution recovered over a 30-year period, representing all phylogeny groups. A custom single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array implemented on the Illumina GoldenGate platform was developed based on 570 SNPs randomly distributed throughout the genome. In general, the genotyping results divided the V. vulnificus species into three main phylogenetic lineages and an additional subgroup, clade B, consisting of environmental and clinical isolates from Israel. Data analysis suggested that 69% of biotype 3 SNPs are similar to SNPs from clade B, indicating that biotype 3 and clade B have a common ancestor. The rest of the biotype 3 SNPs were scattered along the biotype 3 genome, probably representing multiple chromosomal segments that may have been horizontally inserted into the clade B recipient core genome from other phylogroups or bacterial species sharing the same ecological niche. Results emphasize the continuous evolution of V. vulnificus and support the emergence of new pathogenic groups within this species as a recurrent phenomenon. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of the evolution of this human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2054716637,"In this paper, we propose an approach for modeling and analysis of a number of phenomena of collective behavior. By collectives we mean multi-agent systems that transition from one state to another at discrete moments of time. The behavior of a member of a collective (agent) is called conforming if the opinion of this agent at current time moment conforms to the opinion of some other agents at the previous time moment. We presume that at each moment of time every agent makes a decision by choosing from the set {0,1} (where 1-decision corresponds to action and 0-decision corresponds to inaction). In our approach we model collective behavior with synchronous Boolean networks. We presume that in a network there can be agents that act at every moment of time. Such agents are called instigators. Also there can be agents that never act. Such agents are called loyalists. Agents that are neither instigators nor loyalists are called simple agents. We study two combinatorial problems. The first problem is to find a disposition of instigators that in several time moments transforms a network from a state where a majority of simple agents are inactive to a state with a majority of active agents. The second problem is to find a disposition of loyalists that returns the network to a state with a majority of inactive agents. Similar problems are studied for networks in which simple agents demonstrate the contrary to conforming behavior that we call anticonforming. We obtained several theoretical results regarding the behavior of collectives of agents with conforming or anticonforming behavior. In computational experiments we solved the described problems for randomly generated networks with several hundred vertices. We reduced corresponding combinatorial problems to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and used modern SAT solvers to solve the instances obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2013619675,"MAP6 proteins (MAP6s), which include MAP6-N (also called Stable Tubule Only Polypeptide, or STOP) and MAP6d1 (MAP6 domain-containing protein 1, also called STOP-Like protein 21 kD, or SL21), bind to and stabilize microtubules. MAP6 deletion in mice severely alters integrated brain functions and is associated with synaptic defects, suggesting that MAP6s may also have alternative cellular roles. MAP6s reportedly associate with the Golgi apparatus through palmitoylation of their N-terminal domain, and specific isoforms have been shown to bind actin. Here, we use heterologous systems to investigate several biochemical properties of MAP6 proteins. We demonstrate that the three N-terminal cysteines of MAP6d1 are palmitoylated by a subset of DHHC-type palmitoylating enzymes. Analysis of the subcellular localization of palmitoylated MAP6d1, including electron microscopic analysis, reveals possible localization to the Golgi and the plasma membrane but no association with the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we observed localization of MAP6d1 to mitochondria, which requires the N-terminus of the protein but does not require palmitoylation. We show that endogenous MAP6d1 localized at mitochondria in mature mice neurons as well as at the outer membrane and in the intermembrane space of purified mouse mitochondria. Last, we found that MAP6d1 can multimerize via a microtubule-binding module. Interestingly, most of these properties of MAP6d1 are shared by MAP6-N. Together, these results describe several properties of MAP6 proteins, including their intercellular localization and multimerization activity, which may be relevant to neuronal differentiation and synaptic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2135134858,"There is no established single diagnostic marker for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). CD26 is a 110 kDa, multifunctional, membrane-bound glycoprotein that has dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of soluble CD26 (sCD26) in patients with MPM. The study included 80 MPM patients, 79 subjects with past asbestos exposure (SPE), and 134 patients with other benign pleural diseases (OPD) that were included as a control group. sCD26 levels and DPPIV activity in serum and/or pleural fluid were determined using an ELISA kit. Serum sCD26 levels and DPPIV enzyme activity in patients with MPM were significantly decreased compared with those in the SPE group (P = 0.000). The level of serum sCD26 was significantly decreased in patients with advanced stages of MPM compared with those with earlier stages (P = 0.047). The median OS of patients with MPM who had higher DPPIV enzyme activity was significantly longer than that of those with lower DPPIV enzyme activity (P = 0.032). The sCD26 levels in the pleural fluid of MPM patients with an epithelioid subtype were significantly increased compared with the OPD cohort (P = 0.012). Moreover, DPPIV enzyme activity in the pleural fluid of patients with MPM with an epithelioid subtype were significantly increased compared with those in the OPD cohort (P = 0.009). Patients with MPM who had lower specific DPPIV activity, determined as DPPIV/sCD26, showed significantly prolonged survival compared with those with higher specific DPPIV activity (P = 0.028). Serum sCD26 and DPPIV enzyme activity appear to be useful biomarkers for differentiating patients with MPM from SPE. The sCD26 levels or DPPIV enzyme activity in pleural fluid appear to be biomarkers in patients with an epithelioid subtype of MPM. DPPIV activity in serum or pleural fluid appears to be predictive for the prognosis of patients with MPM."
https://openalex.org/W2048391338,"Objective Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is now widely performed to treat VCF, which is usually caused by osteoporosis. Previous researches have reported unsuspected malignancies found by biopsy. However, the safety and cost-effective profiles of routine biopsy during PKP are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of routine biopsy during PKP in treatment of VCF. Methods Ninety-three patients (September 2007–November 2010) undergoing PKP without biopsy were reviewed as the control group. One hundred and three consecutive patients (November 2010–September 2013) undergoing PKP with biopsy of every operated vertebral level were prospectively enrolled as the biopsy group. The rate of unsuspected lesions was reported, and the severe adverse events, surgical duration, cement leakage rate and pain control were compared between the two groups. Results No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups, regarding the severe adverse events, surgical duration, cement leakage rate and pain control. Four unsuspected lesions were found in the biopsy group, three of which were malignancies with a 2.9% (3/103) unsuspected malignancy rate. The economic analysis showed that routine biopsy was cost-effective in finding new malignancies comparing with a routine cancer screening campaign. Conclusions Routine biopsy during PKP was safe and cost-effective in finding unsuspected malignancies. We advocate routine biopsy in every operated vertebral level during PKP for VCF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2123628232,"Human observers are able to perceive the motion direction of actions (either forward or backward) on the basis of the articulatory, relative motion of the limbs, even when the actions are shown under point-light conditions. However, most studies have focused on the action of walking. The primary purpose of the present study is to further investigate the perception of articulatory motion in different point-light actions (walking, crawling, hand walking, and rowing). On each trial, participants were presented with a forward or backward moving person and they had to decide on the direction of articulatory motion of the person. We analyzed sensitivity (d') as well as response bias (c). In addition to the type of action, the diagnosticity of the available information was manipulated by varying the visibility of the body parts (full body, only upper limbs, or only lower limbs) and the viewpoint from which the action was seen (from frontal view to sagittal view). We observe that, depending on the specific action, perception of direction of motion is driven by different body parts. Implications for the possible existence of a life detector, i.e., an evolutionarily old and innate visual filter that is tuned to quickly and automatically detect the presence of a moving living organism and direct attention to it, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2060795548,"Deregulation of Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (NF-κB) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling is commonly detected in leukemia, suggesting an important role for these two signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of leukemia. In this study, using Jurkat cells, an acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line, we evaluated the effects of an NF-κB inhibitor and a JNK inhibitor individually and in combination on the proliferation, survival and clonogenic capacity of leukemic cells. We found that leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs) were more sensitive to NF-κB inhibitor treatment than were healthy hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), as shown by a reduction in the clonogenic capacity of the former. Inactivation of NF-κB leads to the activation of JNK signaling in both leukemic cells and healthy HSPCs. Interestingly, JNK inhibitor treatment enhanced the repressive effects of NF-κB inhibitor on LSPCs but prevented such repression in HSPCs. Our data suggest that JNK signaling stimulates proliferation/survival in LSPCs but is a death signal in HSPCs. The combination of NF-κB inhibitor and JNK inhibitor might provide a better treatment for T-ALL leukemia by synergistically killing LSPCs while simultaneously preventing the death of normal HPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2037554576,"Background Prenatal dexamethasone exposure has been reported to increase allergy potential in childhood possibly by interference with normal immunological development in utero. This study investigated the effects of prenatal dexamethasone on T helper cell immune responses in a rat model. Methods Pregnant rats received either dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg/day or normal saline from gestational day 14–21. Off-springs were cared for by their biological mother, or cross-fostered by the opposing group. Spleen and blood samples were collected at post-natal day 7 and 120 and tested for mRNA expression and plasma cytokine levels of Th1/Th2/Th17 immune response. Results Both Th1 (T-bet) and Th2 (GATA-3) mRNA expression were shown to have a significant increase in the prenatal dexamethasone exposure group at day 120 (p<0.05). The plasma levels for Th1 (IFNγ and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) were found to have no significant differences between the two group (p>0.05). The mRNA expression of Th17 (RORγt) showed a significant decrease at post-natal day 120 as well as the plasma level of IL-17A at day 7 (11.21±1.67 vs. 6.23±1.06 pg/ml, p = 0.02). Cross-fostering by a dexamethasone exposed mother resulted in a significant increase in Th1/Th2 mRNA expression (p<0.05) and decrease of Th17. Conclusions Prenatal dexamethasone exposure increased Th1, Th2 and decreased Th17 expression. Cross-fostering by a dexamethasone exposed mother results in more prominent increase of Th1 and Th2 expression."
