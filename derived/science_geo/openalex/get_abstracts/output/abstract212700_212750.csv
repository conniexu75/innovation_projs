https://openalex.org/W2046502440,"Antibodies for rubella virus were detected in human serum and titrated by the indirect method of immunofluorescence; a chronically infected, continuous line of monkey kidney cells was used as antigen. Positive reactions were obtained with serums from convalescent patients or persons who had been exposed to the virus while serums from patients in the acute stage of the disease and those from unexposed individuals were negative"
https://openalex.org/W2066873102,Actinomycin D inhibits vitamin K induced formation of prothrombin in chicks deficient in vitamin K. The administration of actinomycin in doses which inhibit prothrombin formation also inhibits synthesis in the liver of RNA from adenosine triphosphate as detected with adenine-8-C14. The results are consistent with a genetic action of vitamin K in inducing RNA formation for the synthesis of clotting proteins.
https://openalex.org/W2032431286,"Studies on skeletal muscle of rats and mice indicate significant differences between the behaviors of the two basic types of muscle fibers during the development of denervation atrophy. While the diameter of fibers possessing sarcoplasmic granularity (""red"" fibers) is preserved for a long time after complete severance of motor and sensory nerves, fiber with agranular cytoplasm (""white"" fibers) undergo rapid atrophy. It is concluded that, at least in this respect, the ""white"" fibers are more dependent on neural control than are the ""red"" fibers."

https://openalex.org/W1987213916,"The antigens associated with the Gm(b) factor of human 7S gamma-globulin differ in Caucasoids and Negroids. The studies reported here show that an antigen, Gm(b(w)), associated with the Gm(b) of whites but not with that of Negroes, is present on the S (slow) fragment of 7S gamma-globulin obtained by digestion with papain or pepsin. All other Gm antigens thus far studied have been found on the F (fast) fragment. The antigens Inv(a) and Inv(b) were detected on isolated L-chains, and Gm(a) and Gm(b) were detected on isolated H-chains, but Gm(b(w)) was detected on neither. Recombining the H- and L-chains restored activity for Gm(b(w)) comparable to that of intact gamma-globulin"
https://openalex.org/W1989672121,Examination with the electron microscope of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and its component enzymes from Escherichia coli indicates that the complex has a polyhedral structure with a diameter of about 300 to 350 angstroms and a height of 200 to 250 angstroms. The reconstituted complex closely resembles the native complex in appearance. A tentative model of this multienzyme complex is proposed on the basis of the correlated biochemical and electron-microscopic data
https://openalex.org/W2035335976,"Amino acid analysis of protein from the enamel of shark teeth and from teleost scales shows the presence of collagens which can be classified chemically as ectodermal. This finding, together with results from a histological examination of the development of these tissues, constitutes strong evidence that both proteins are derived from the ectoderm, like the enamel of higher vertebrates. Since both are calcified, calcification cannot be a specific property of collagens of mesodermal origin alone."

https://openalex.org/W2060738306,"PROGESTERONE (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione), corticosterone (11β,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) and deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) have been shown to be precursors of aldosterone1–5. Aldosterone (11β,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione-18-al) is produced in the glomerulosa zona of the adrenal cortex6–8. It could be assumed that the biogenesis of aldosterone was preceded by hydroxylation of corticosterone in C18. Nicolis and Ulick9 obtained a slight yield of aldosterone (0.2 per cent) by incubation of tritiated-18-hydroxy-corticosterone (11β,18,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) with bull-frog adrenal tissue and beef zona glomerulosa tissue. Stachenko and Giroud10 considered that the cyclic 18→20 hemiketal form of 18-hydroxy-corticosterone11 was responsible for this lack of conversion of 18-hydroxy-corticosterone to aldosterone."
https://openalex.org/W2035930721,Bones of the forepaws of young rats were subjected to varying concentrations of fluoride ions in organ culture. The formation of DNA and protein synthesis were evaluated by measurements of the uptake of tritiated thymidine and C14-labeled proline. Fluoride concentrations as high as 10 to 20 parts per million had no demonstrable effect in vitro on these basic parameters of skeletal growth.

https://openalex.org/W2067012742,"PRECISELY regulated movements of the vocal folds (cords) are known to occur during respiration, swallowing and phonation in most mammals, including man1. That such movements must involve integrated reflex adjustments of the tone of the laryngeal muscles is apparent; and, by analogy with the situation in the limbs, the source of such reflex regulation has usually been sought in the laryngeal muscles themselves (or in the laryngeal mucosa). There is, however, no agreement on whether appropriate receptor nerve endings are present in the laryngeal muscles2,3; and attempts to record afferent proprioceptive discharges from the nerves supplying the laryngeal muscles have failed to demonstrate them4. Nevertheless, direct electrical stimulation of afferent fibres in the laryngeal nerves does produce reflex alterations in the tone of laryngeal muscles4,5."
https://openalex.org/W1964290565,"Patterns of electrical potentials recorded from the brains of sharks exhibit definite relationships to chemical and visual stimuli. Forebrain potentials reflect olfactory processes. Both restrained and free-swimming sharks exhibit mesencephalic responses to light and neural triggering of respiratory reflexes from the medulla. Early evolution of typical vertebrate brain functions, with emphasis upon chemoreception, is indicated"

https://openalex.org/W2085609709,"The sinoatrial node and the bundle of His in intact, unanesthetized dogs were subjected to local cooling by means of surgically implanted devices. Impulse formation in the sinoatrial node could thus be suppressed at will and the heart rate regulated within a physiological range by an electrode driving the atrium. Reversible blockage of atrioventricular conduction was easily induced on cooling the region of the bundle of His."
https://openalex.org/W2016755797,"Autocorrelations of electroencephalograms can be reduced to ratios of estimated power among distinguishable parameters of typical tracings: the dominant rhythm, background activity, abundance, and total power. These data reduction methods permit statistical evaluation of differences among experimental conditions, thus extending the usefulness of graphic correlograms in research. Ratios discriminate between two experimental conditions and two subjects, while showing stability over days."
https://openalex.org/W2011357519,"Chromatographic systems capable of resolving the 2'- and 3'-isomers of valyladenosine and N-acetylvalyladenosine are used to show that valyladenosine isolated from valyl-sRNA is the equilibrium mixture of 2'- and 3'-acyl isomers by the time of chromatography. Acyl migration in N-acetylvalyladenosine is shown to be a rapid, base-catalyzed reaction with a rate 40,000 times the rate of hydrolysis under equivalent conditions. Calculations indicate that the pool of free aminoacyl sRNA exists in vivo as the equilibrium mixture of the 2'- and 3'-aminoacyl isomers"

Similar observations were made in man. Moreover, a salt-poor diet or the administration of natridiuretics lower experimental and clinical hypertension. It has already been reported1,2 that, in rats rendered hypertensive, an accumulation of sodium in the arterial walls is frequently observed."

As part of this investigation aminopterin (C grade) (California Corporation for Biochemical Research, Los Angeles) was examined in new-born mice. The mice used were Swiss from the colony of this laboratory that have been maintained here for 12 years and are randomly bred. Ten litters of newborn mice less than 16 h of age were treated with a single subcutaneous injection in the dorsal region of 10 µg of aminopterin dissolved in 0.05 ml. of distilled water (with 4 drops of 10 per cent potassium hydroxide added to each 5 ml. of the standard solution). The mice were distributed in 9 litters of 8 new-born animals each and 1 of 7 new-born. They were housed in plastic cages on sterilized granular cellulose bedding with the mothers."
