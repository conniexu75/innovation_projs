https://openalex.org/W2024751914,"DENERVATION of sympathetically innervated structures has been known to cause supersensitivity of these organs to catecholamines1 and depletion of these hormones2. However, no conclusive explanation has been offered for these findings. To clarify these phenomena further we compared the uptake of injected DL β-3H-noradrenaline and DL β-3H-adrenaline by intact and denervated tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2041099167,Three pigeons were trained to peck at a horizontally oriented rubber srtip 10 in. long. The spatial distribution of responding along this strip is found to be nonrandom when every peck is reinforced with food. The degree of nonrandomness increases markedly when the pecking is intermittently reinforced

Other unique properties, such as their host range and their susceptibility to nuclease action, render them a wholly new dimension to be reckoned with in virology. These properties may explain a number of conditions which at present are considered anomalous. The release from infected tissues of even a small proportion of total virus as free nucleic acid could, in an otherwise immune individual, lead to a low level of infection which would, perhaps, explain permanent immunity. If the proportion of nucleic acid is higher, or if the nucleic acid is resistant to nucleases because of an inert envelope, such conditions as ""carrier"" states-that is, viremias with or without antibodies-are possible. Note added in proof: The recent article by J. D. Ebert and F. H. Wilt (54) came to my attention after the present article was written. Ebert and Wilt's excellent article indicates the impact of the newer knowledge of viral nucleic acids on the ideas developing in the field of embryology."

https://openalex.org/W2094389724,"AMBROSE et al. 1 have shown that individual tumour cells from hamster kidney possess a significantly greater electrophoretic mobility than normal homologous kidney cells. Later, Purdom et al. 2 obtained a correlation between the development of a mouse sarcoma and the progressive increase in the negative electrophoretic mobility of individual cells obtained from this sarcoma at various stages of its development. As the tumour cell acquired more malignant properties, evinced by the formation of early metastases, the negative electrophoretic mobility of individual cells was observed to have increased."

This treatment also produces aberrations in cellular differentiation in the leaves. Tracer studies show that 2-thiouracil becomes bound in cellular ribonucleic acid, which suggests that the effects on morphogenesis are due to interference with nucleic acid metabolism."

When tested with a series of lights dimmer than the conditioning stimulus, the monkeys showed a sharp gradient of effect for the rewarded response, in contrast to a very flat gradient for the avoidance response."

https://openalex.org/W1970975187,"Two groups of National Merit Scholarship students were selected on the basis of attendance at educational institutions ranked high or low in the production of future scholars and scientists. Four hypotheses pertaining to expected personality differences between matched groups from both sources were explored by means of the following instruments: the Omnibus Personality Inventory, the Strong Vocational Interest Blank, and the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values. In general, the hypotheses were firmly supported, and it was concluded that students of high ability attending highly productive institutions have a pattern of traits, values, and attitudes which is more closely related to serious intellectual pursuits than have students of high ability attending less productive institutions (16)."

It is suggested that these granules represent specific activity on the part of the normal cell as well as an increase in number after injury. While they are not limited to occurrence within the vacuoles in the cytoplasm of the odontoblasts, the relationship of the granules to the vacuoles suggests that the vacuoles are also a part of the physiologic activity of the adult odontoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2067371951,"As part of a programme designed to test a free-radical hypothesis of insecticidal action for DDT1, a series of new DDT compounds substituted by halogen in the ortho-position was synthesized and the toxicity to normal and to DDT-resistant house-flies (Musca domestica L.) was determined (Table 1). The results are of unusual significance in regard to: (1) the mechanism of DDT resistance, and (2) the relative toxicity of the positional isomers of DDT."

https://openalex.org/W2028750603,Rat sciatic nerve contains a substance that diffuses into the surrounding medium and causes a fresh normal nerve to respire at an increased rate. Both the utilization of glucose and the increase in oxygen uptake with electrical stimulation of nerves in the presence or absence of glucose appear to be dependent on the presence of this substance.

https://openalex.org/W2062928722,"THE effect of sound vibration on influenza virus has been described previously1,2. Lief and Henle2 showed that sonic treatment of influenza virus neither increased the hæmagglutinin titre nor changed the ratio of the hæmagglutinin titres obtained with chicken and guinea pig erythrocytes. The results briefly reported here deal with the effect of ultrasonic vibration on the hæmagglutinating activity of some para-influenza viruses."

The type of deprivation, either food or water, did not have an effect. The differences in alternation disappeared with repeated trials on the Y-maze."

In 1936, Brues1 described a case of spontaneous osteogenic sarcoma in the jaw of a three-year-old grey rabbit. Barrett et al. reported an osteogenic sarcoma attached to the left femur of a C3H female mouse2. Osteogenic sarcomas have also been induced by radio-isotopes such as radium-226, strontium-90, calcium-45 (ref. 3) and strontium-89 (ref. 4). One case of osteogenic neoplasm arising from muscle tissue has been reported in man5. This tumour found in the thigh muscle had developed over a period of ten years and was believed to have followed an abscess in the muscle."
