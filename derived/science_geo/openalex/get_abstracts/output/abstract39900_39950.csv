https://openalex.org/W1570735806,"Recently, a low molecular weight factor, which specifically stimulates sperm adenylate cyclase, was found in porcine seminal plasma (Okamura, N., and Sugita, Y. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13056-13062). The purified factor was analyzed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, infrared spectroscopy, and elementary analysis and identified as sodium bicarbonate. The effects of sodium bicarbonate both on adenylate cyclase activity in porcine spermatozoa and on sperm motility have been studied. Sperm adenylate cyclase was found to be specifically activated by bicarbonate over the physiological concentration range. In contrast, the adenylate cyclase activity in other tissues was not affected. The same concentration range of bicarbonate which resulted in activation of adenylate cyclase also stimulated sperm motility. The motility and enzyme activity of spermatozoa in all species so far tested (human, bovine, rat, mouse, and dog) were found to be similarly sensitive to bicarbonate concentration. These results show that the bicarbonate-sensitive adenylate cyclase system regulates sperm motility and suggest that this system is common to all mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1519416684,"Administration of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to immature female rats produces a 3-fold increase in 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to uterine membranes with no change in the affinity of membrane receptors for EGF. E2 treatment also increases the EGF receptor visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after affinity labeling of uterine membranes and the EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation activity. In addition, E2 administration stimulates EGF-dependent tyrosine kinase activity in an assay system using exogenous angiotensin II as substrate. Following hormone treatment, EGF receptor levels increase between 6 and 12 h, remain elevated at 18 h, and decline between 24 and 36 h. This stimulation of EGF receptor levels by E2 is specific, since the non-estrogenic hormones progesterone, dexamethasone, and dihydrotestosterone fail to elevate receptor levels. E2-stimulated increases in EGF receptor levels are also blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, suggesting that the observed effect represents de novo synthesis of the EGF receptor and may be mediated by a transcriptional mechanism. These results demonstrate that estrogen can regulate acutely the levels of EGF receptor in vivo and raise the possibility that events coupled to this receptor may play a role in estrogen-stimulated growth."
https://openalex.org/W2102290655,"The human genes for prepro-arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin II (prepro-AVP-NPII) and prepro-oxytocin-neurophysin I (prepro-OT-NPI) were cloned from a human genomic library and the nucleotide sequence of both genes was determined. The two genes are similar in their intron-exon structure, linked together with 12 kilobases intervening, and transcribed from opposite DNA strands. A human small cell lung cancer cell line, H378, produces significant quantities of pre-pro-AVP-NPII mRNA using a transcription unit predicted from the genomic DNA sequence. Despite the proximity of the actively transcribed prepro-AVP-NPII gene, transcription of prepro-OT-NPI is not detected in this cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1533335439,"Cultured hepatocytes pretreated with the ferric iron chelator deferoxamine were resistant to the toxicity of H2O2 generated by either glucose oxidase or by the metabolism of menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone). Ferric, ferrous, or cupric ions restored the sensitivity of the cells to H2O2. Deferoxamine added to hepatocytes previously treated with this chelator prevented the restoration of cell killing by only ferric iron. The free radical scavengers mannitol, thiourea, benzoate, and 4-methylmercapto-2-oxobutyrate protected either native cells exposed to H2O2 or pretreated hepatocytes exposed to H2O2 and given ferric or ferrous iron. Superoxide dismutase prevented the killing of native hepatocytes by either glucose oxidase or menadione. With deferoxamine-pretreated hepatocytes, superoxide dismutase prevented the cell killing dependent upon the addition of ferric but not ferrous iron. Catalase prevented the killing by menadione of deferoxamine-pretreated hepatocytes given either ferric or ferrous iron. Deferoxamine pretreatment did not prevent the toxicity of t-butyl hydroperoxide but did, however, prevent that of cumene hydroperoxide. It is concluded that both ferric iron and superoxide ions are required for the killing of cultured hepatocytes by H2O2. The toxicity of H2O2 is also dependent upon its reaction with ferrous iron to form hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction. The ferrous iron needed for this reaction is formed by the reduction of cellular ferric iron by superoxide ions. Such a sequence corresponds to the so-called iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction, and the present report documents its participation in the killing of intact hepatocytes by H2O2. Cumene hydroperoxide but not t-butyl hydroperoxide closely models the toxicity of hydrogen peroxide."
https://openalex.org/W1588723127,"The purification of a putative auxin is one possibility to elucidate the first event in the mechanism of auxin action. By affinity chromatography of membrane proteins on 2-OH-3,5-diiodobenzoic acid-Sepharose and gel filtration on Ultrogel a fraction enriched in auxin-binding protein (ABP) was obtained and used for rabbit immunization. From the immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction of the antisera IgGs against proteins not binding auxin (nonABP) could be obtained which were used to eliminate the nonABP from the eluates of the 2-OH-3,5-diiodobenzoic acid-Sepharose. The remainder fraction was further purified and concentrated on IgG-Sepharose which retained the ABP that could be eluted without loss of binding activity. A 600-fold purification with a yield of 42% was achieved. The ABP could be identified as the site I receptor described by Dohrmann et al. (Dohrmann, U., Hertel, R., and Kowalik, H. (1978) Planta (Berl.) 140, 97-106). It is shown that the competitors tested reduce [14C]1-naphthylacetic acid-(NAA) binding in the following order of effectiveness: NAA greater than 2-naphthylacetic acid greater than 1-phenylacetic acid greater than 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid greater than 3-indolylacetic acid greater than 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The ABP has a sharp binding optimum at pH 5.5, and the KD was calculated to be 5.7 X 10(-8) M to [14C]NAA. The binding activity of the ABP linearly decreased with increasing temperature but could partially be restored upon chilling in the presence of auxin. The ABP seems to be a 40-kDa dimer in its native form without disulfide bonds between its monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1535964227,"A full length cDNA for human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the membrane-bound glycoprotein that regulates cholesterol synthesis, was isolated from a human fetal adrenal cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA shows that the human reductase is 888 amino acids long and shares a high degree of homology with the hamster enzyme. The amino-terminal membrane-bound domain is the most conserved region between the two species (7 substitutions out of 339 amino acids). This region, which is predicted to span the endoplasmic reticulum membrane seven times, mediates accelerated degradation of reductase in the presence of sterols. The carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain is also highly conserved (22 substitutions out of 439 amino acids). However, the linker region between these two domains has diverged (32 substitutions out of 110 amino acids). Conservation of the structure of the membrane-bound domain in HMG-CoA reductase supports the hypothesis that sterol-regulated degradation is an important mechanism for suppression of reductase activity and for regulation of cholesterol metabolism in humans as well as in hamsters."
https://openalex.org/W1505649850,"The photoactive insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II analogue 4-azidobenzoyl-125I-IGF-II was synthesized and used to label specifically and covalently the Mr = 250,000 Type II IGF receptor. When rat adipocytes are irradiated after a 10-min incubation with 4-azidobenzoyl-125I-IGF-II at 10 degrees C and immediately homogenized, most of the labeled IGF-II receptors are associated with the plasma membrane fraction, indicating that receptors accessible to the labeling reagent at low temperature are on the cell surface. However, when the photolabeled cells are incubated at 37 degrees C for various times before homogenization, labeled IGF-II receptors are rapidly internalized with a half-time of 3.5 min as evidenced by a loss from the plasma membrane fraction and a concomitant appearance in the low density microsome fraction. The low density microsomes were previously shown to contain intracellular membranes (Oka, Y., and Czech, M.P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8125-8133). The steady state level of cell surface IGF-II receptors in the presence or absence of IGF-II, measured by the binding of anti-IGF-II receptor antibody to cells, remains constant under these conditions, demonstrating that IGF-II receptors rapidly recycle back to the cell surface at the same rate as receptor internalization. Using the above methodology, it is shown that acute insulin action: 1) increases the steady state number of cell surface IGF-II receptors; 2) increases the number of ligand-bound IGF-II receptors that are internalized per unit of time, as evidenced by a large increase in the photolabeling of intracellular membrane IGF-II receptors when cells are incubated at 37 degrees C with insulin and 4-azidobenzoyl-125I-IGF-II prior to photoactivation; and 3) increases the rate of cellular 125I-IGF-II degradation by a process that is blocked by anti-IGF-II receptor antibody. The results indicate that the action of insulin to elevate the steady state number of cell surface IGF-II receptors leads to an increased internalization flux of IGF-II-bound receptors, mediating increased IGF-II uptake and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1591165395,"The K0.5 for intracellular sodium of the two forms of (Na+,K+)-ATPase which exist in rat adipocytes (Lytton, J., Lin, J. C., and Guidotti, G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1177-1184) has been determined by incubating the cells in the absence of potassium in buffers of varying sodium concentration; these conditions shut off the Na+ pump and allow sodium to equilibrate into the cell. The activity of Na+,K+)-ATPase was then monitored with 86Rb+/K+ pumping which was initiated by adding isotope and KCl to 5 mM, followed by a 3-min uptake period. Atomic absorption and 22Na+ tracer equilibration were used to determine the actual intracellular [Na+] under the different conditions. The K0.5 values thus obtained were 17 mM for alpha and 52 mM for alpha(+). Insulin treatment of rat adipocytes had no effect on the intracellular [Na+] nor on the Vmax of 86Rb+/K+ pumping, but did produce a shift in the sodium ion K0.5 values to 14 mM for alpha (p less than 0.025 versus control) and 33 mM for alpha(+) (p less than 0.005 versus control). This change in affinity can explain the selective stimulation of alpha(+) by insulin under normal incubation conditions. Measurement of the K0.5 for sodium ion of (Na+,K+)-ATPase in membranes isolated from adipocytes revealed only a single component of activation with a low K0.5 of 3.5 or 12 mM in the presence of 10 or 100 mM KCl, respectively. Insulin treatment of the isolated membranes or of the cells prior to membrane separation had no effect on these values."
https://openalex.org/W1543455908,"The nucleotide sequence of rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I mRNA has been determined from the complementary DNA. The mRNA comprises minimally 5,645 nucleotides and codes for a polypeptide of 164,564 Da corresponding to the precursor form of the rat liver enzyme. The primary sequence of mature rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I indicates that the precursor is cleaved at one of two leucines at residues 38 or 39. The derived amino acid sequence of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I is homologous to the sequences of carbamyl phosphate synthetase of Escherichia coli and yeast. The sequence homology extends along the entire length of the rat polypeptide and encompasses the entire sequences of both the small and large subunits of the E. coli and yeast enzymes. The protein sequence data provide strong evidence that the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene of rat, the carAB gene of E. coli, and the CPA1 and CPA2 genes of yeast were derived from common ancestral genes. Part of the rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene has been characterized with two nonoverlapping phage clones spanning 28.7 kilobases of rat chromosomal DNA. This region contains 13 exons ranging in size from 68 to 195 base pairs and encodes the 453 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the rat protein. Southern hybridization analysis of rat genomic DNA indicates the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene to be present in single copy."
https://openalex.org/W1560669282,"The replication of plasmid pBR322 DNA has been reconstituted with purified proteins from Escherichia coli. Initiation of the leading-strand requires RNA polymerase holoenzyme, DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and DNA gyrase. Initiation of the lagging-strand requires the primosomal proteins (the dnaB, dnaC, and dnaG proteins, replication factor Y (protein n') and proteins i, n, and n) and the single-stranded DNA binding protein. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is required for extensive elongation of the nascent DNA chains. The products of this replication reaction are primarily nonsegregated daughter molecules. However, the addition of small amounts of soluble extract from E. coli results in the completion and segregation of these molecules to give mature form I DNA, suggesting that additional factors are required for this process. Topoisomerase I is necessary to make the replication system specific for pBR322 DNA as a template, indicating that the linking number of the DNA, determined by an equilibrium between the opposing activities of topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase, plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity of the DNA molecule toward initiating DNA replication. The function of the proteins involved in the replication of this closed-circular, double-stranded, superhelical DNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2411203475,"The guanine nucleotide analogue, guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) stimulated plasma membrane-associated phospholipase C. Phosphoinositides were the substrates for the reaction. Significant losses of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol phosphate occurred at lower doses of GTP gamma S than did significant loss of phosphatidylinositol. Loss of 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate was equal when plasma membranes were treated with either 100 microM GTP or 100 microM GTP gamma S, but accumulation of inositol trisphosphate was more apparent when the nonhydrolyzable analogue was used. The action of GTP gamma S alone was not dependent on Ca2+ although loss of 32P-labeled phosphoinositides was stimulated by Ca2+ alone or with GTP gamma S. The results are consistent with a role for guanine nucleotide binding proteins in the activation of membrane-bound phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1523316706,"Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitors have been found to exist in acutely saline-infused hog plasma, which also inhibit the specific binding of ouabain to Na+,K+-ATPase and the binding of digoxin to specific anti-digoxin antibody. Two of these inhibitors were purified by a combination of Amberlite XAD-2 adsorption chromatography and 3 steps of high-performance liquid chromatography. Reverse phase, high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry identified these substances as linoleic (18:2) and oleic acids (18:1). A significant increase in the ouabain-displacing activity was observed in hog plasma during saline infusion. The maximal level reached was approximately 10 times higher than that of the preinfusion plasma sample. The two unsaturated fatty acids contributed to approximately 52% of the total ouabain-displacing activity after 120 min of saline infusion. The increased fatty acid levels in volume-expanded plasma are sufficient for an extensive inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. These results strongly suggest that free unsaturated fatty acids in plasma regulate extracellular fluid volume in a pathological volume-expanded condition through modulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1600085067,"The current studies show that mRNAs with 16 different 5'-untranslated regions (varying in length from 68 to 670 nucleotides) are produced from the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase gene in hamster UT-1 cells. This complex pattern of mRNAs results from a combination of multiple transcription initiation sites and multiple 5' splice donor sites for the intron in the 5'-untranslated region of the gene. Analysis of the multiple mRNAs was made possible by a modification of the S1 nuclease technique in which we used a series of progressively truncated uniformly labeled, single-stranded [32P]DNA probes in addition to the usual end-labeled 32P-probes. All of the reductase mRNAs are diminished when UT-1 cells are incubated with sterols, indicating that all of them are subject to coordinate control."
https://openalex.org/W1696597933,"With the aid of affinity chromatography on auxin-binding protein-Sepharose (ABP-Sepharose) monospecific IgGanti-ABP from rabbit antisera were isolated as judged by immuno-double diffusion test and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With this IgGanti-ABP the ABP is localized within the outer epidermal cells of coleoptiles using indirect immunofluorescence labeling. Auxin-induced growth of coleoptile segments can be inhibited by IgGanti-ABP, and the auxin response of split coleoptile sections is also strongly reduced by IgGanti-ABP. The ABP, therefore, is referred to as an auxin receptor. This auxin receptor is localized at the plasmalemma of the outer epidermal cells of the coleoptile."
https://openalex.org/W1549704609,"The UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins of Escherichia coli are subunits of a DNA repair enzyme, ABC exci nuclease. In order to amplify these proteins, we have joined the artificial canonical promoter tac (Amann E., Brosius, J., and Ptashne, M. (1983) Gene (Amst.) 25, 167-178) to the uvr genes to obtain plasmids that express these genes under the control of the lac repressor. When cells carrying the tac-uvr plasmids are induced by the gratuitous lac inducer isopropyl-beta-D-galactoside the Uvr proteins are overproduced reaching a level of 10-20% of total cellular proteins after 6-8 h of induction. We have developed methods to purify all three Uvr proteins, UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC, in milligram quantities and to near homogeneity from these overproducing cells. The purified UvrA protein is an ATPase but UvrB and UvrC proteins are not. However, UvrB protein stimulates the ATPase activity of UvrA protein by a factor of 1.5 in the presence of double-stranded DNA and by a factor of about 2.6 in the presence of UV-irradiated DNA but not in the absence of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1504709499,"Exposure of confluent NRK cells to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) results in distinct alterations in subpopulations of plasma membrane epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. The low affinity sites increase in number, whereas the high affinity sites undergo a transient decrease in affinity followed by a prolonged increase in number. Cycloheximide inhibits both of these effects. Functional assays measuring EGF-stimulated thymidine incorporation in the presence of TGF-beta show that the resulting long-term stimulation of EGF receptor binding is associated with an increased sensitivity to EGF. Similarly, the initial, transient decrease in EGF binding is associated with a temporary inhibition of EGF-stimulated thymidine incorporation. The results describe a bifunctional effect of TGF-beta at the biochemical level consistent with the action of this peptide on NRK cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W176746488,"We previously reported that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulates the phosphorylation of a Mr 98,000 protein thought to be the beta-subunit of the type I IGF receptor of BRL-3A2 rat liver cells, as well as phosphorylation of the exogenous tyrosine-containing substrate poly(Glu,Tyr), 4:1. The present study provides additional evidence that the type I IGF receptor possesses intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and characterizes the properties of this receptor kinase. IGF-I stimulates receptor phosphorylation and phosphorylation of poly(Glu,Tyr), 4:1, by lectin-purified receptor preparations with the same concentration dependence; half-maximal stimulation was observed with approximately 3 nM IGF-I and approximately 3-fold higher concentrations of insulin. Although IGF-I-dependent receptor phosphorylation was observed within 2 min and was maximal after 10 min, phosphorylation of exogenous substrate did not begin to increase until 8 min after addition of [gamma-32P] ATP and poly(Glu,Tyr), 4:1. When IGF-I-receptor complexes were preincubated with unlabeled ATP for 10 min before addition of substrate, however, IGF-I-dependent 32P incorporation was observed within 2 min after addition of poly(Glu,Tyr), 4:1, and increased linearly for 20 min. We propose that this activation of type I IGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity results from autophosphorylation of the receptor kinase. Kinase activation is an intramolecular reaction, is specific for ATP, occurs within 3 min after addition of unlabeled ATP, and requires the presence of IGF-I before or concomitant with activation by ATP. IGF-I acts rapidly, stimulating substrate phosphorylation within 3 min. The properties of the type I-IGF receptor kinase closely resemble those of the insulin receptor kinase, suggesting that the homologies between the two receptors extend to their kinase domains."
https://openalex.org/W2105716780,"Extracts from epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells are up to 10 times more potent in phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6 than extracts from quiescent cells. Preparation of extracts in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors leads to a time-dependent loss of kinase activity. In order of potency, the most efficient phosphatase inhibitors in protecting the S6 kinase activity are phosphotyrosine followed by p-nitrophenyl phosphate, beta-glycerol phosphate, and phosphoserine. The kinetics of kinase activation following EGF treatment are rapid and transient. The maximum increase is observed between 15 and 30 min with only 20-30% of the activity remaining after 2 h. Phosphorylation of S6 in the intact cell follows a similar pattern of activation, reaching a maximum between 30 and 60 min and then slowly returning to basal levels by approximately 3 h. The activation of protein synthesis is also rapid; however, in contrast to the transient activation of the S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation, it remains persistently high for at least 6 h following EGF treatment. Comparison of these events with EGF binding shows that about 50% of the cell surface binding sites are lost within 10 min of exposure to EGF, and about 25% remain after 2 h. Finally, sodium orthovanadate, which is known to mimic the mitogenic effect of EGF, also leads to activation of the S6 kinase, however, with distinct kinetics and by an apparent EGF receptor-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1511825427,"The methylesterase which catalyzes demethylation of chemotactic membrane receptors in Salmonella typhimurium has been purified and characterized. Two forms of the enzyme have been isolated from cell extracts. One corresponds in molecular weight, Mr = 37,000, and amino acid composition to the predicted product of the structural gene for the methylesterase, cheB. The other is a proteolytic fragment, Mr = 21,000, corresponding to the C-terminal three-fifths of the intact CheB protein. The specific activity of the 21-kDa enzyme is at least 15-fold greater than that of its 37-kDa precursor. We conclude that the CheB protein is composed of at least two structurally distinct portions: a C-terminal catalytic domain, and an N-terminal region which modulates esterase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1537210834,"Phorbol diesters are tumor-promoting agents that cause differentiation of HL60 human leukemic cells and concomitantly regulate surface transferrin receptors. Regulation of transferrin receptors by phorbol diesters involves receptor internalization in association with increased receptor phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation). The intracellular mechanism of action of phorbol diester involves binding to and activation of the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Present studies comparing results obtained with whole cells and those from a cell-free system reconstituted from purified protein kinase C and transferrin receptor components have revealed that the transferrin receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase C activated by phorbol esters. Following tryptic digestion and two-dimensional separation of phosphopeptides of phosphorylated transferrin receptors, two major and several minor phosphoserine-containing fragments are resolved. These fragments are identical whether transferrin receptor is phosphorylated in whole cells incubated with phorbol diesters or following phosphorylation of affinity immobilized transferrin receptor in the in vitro reconstitution system. Phosphoamino acid analysis of these fragments indicates that serine is the only amino acid phosphorylated in whole cells or in the cell-free system. In addition, colchicine is shown to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner phorbol diester-induced internalization but not hyperphosphorylation of the surface transferrin receptor in whole cells. This inhibition is specific for colchicine since inactive beta- and gamma-Lumicolchicine have no such effect, while taxol reverses the inhibition. These results indicate that the phorbol diester-mediated process of down-regulation of the surface transferrin receptor is associated with phosphorylation of the receptor by activated protein kinase C and requires an intact cytoskeleton to affect receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W89639411,"We have purified angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) from rat brain corpus striatum and rat lung. The brain enzyme has Mr 165,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, whereas the lung enzyme is 175,000. This difference is not an artifact of preparation since mixture of the two tissues prior to purification results in isolation of two proteins with Mr 165,000 and 175,000. Separation of tryptic fragments of 125I-labeled lung and brain ACE by reverse-phase chromatography yields distinct but similar patterns. No differences between the native enzymes are detected in dansyl-tripeptide cleavage specificity, inhibitor profile, immunological properties, sucrose gradient sedimentation, or gel filtration of ACE from the two tissues. However, lung and brain ACE can be differentiated in their ability to cleave amidated peptides. Both lung and brain ACE cleave Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 (substance P) via two pathways. In one pathway, ACE first releases Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 and then dipeptides sequentially from the carboxyl terminus. The other first produces Leu-Met-NH2, and then releases dipeptides to leave substance P 1-5. Lung ACE favors initial tripeptide release 3:1, while the striatal enzyme acts via the two pathways to a similar extent. Lung and striatal ACE also differ in their ability to degrade other amidated peptides. His-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 (substance K) and bombesin are degraded by striatal but not lung ACE. Physalaemin and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone are cleaved by both enzymes, while eledoisin, kassinin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and substance P 5-11 are not cleaved by either enzyme. Physalaemin is degraded more rapidly by the lung enzyme. The coincidence of an ACE isozyme with substance P and substance K in the descending striatonigral pathway and the unique ability of this isozyme to cleave substance P and substance K suggest that one or both of these peptides is a physiological substrate for striatonigral ACE."
https://openalex.org/W1557577469,"We have previously reported that anionic phospholipids (Philipson, K.D., and Nishimoto, A.Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 16-19) and other anionic amphiphiles (Philipson, K.D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13999-14002) stimulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. To further these studies, we have now investigated the effects of a variety of fatty acids on both Na+-Ca2+ exchange and passive Ca2+ permeability. Na+-Ca2+ exchange was stimulated by fatty acids by up to 150%. Unsaturated fatty acids were more potent than saturated fatty acids, and the stimulation was primarily due to a decrease in the apparent KM (Ca2+). There was a positive correlation between the ability of a fatty acid to stimulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange and to increase passive Ca2+ permeability. The methyl esters of fatty acids had no effects on either exchange or permeability indicating the importance of anionic charge. We conclude that the combination of local lipid disorder and anionic charge regulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Perturbations of the bilayer hydrophobic region and increased negative surface charge are both required for fatty acids to increase passive Ca2+ flux. Na+-Ca2+ exchange is stimulated when the ratio of membrane free fatty acid to phospholipid is about 5%. This level of fatty acid is achieved during 1 h of myocardial ischemia (Chien, K. R., Han, A., Sen, A., Buja, L. M., and Willerson, J. T. (1984) Circ. Res. 54, 313-322), indicating that ischemia could induce altered sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport due to fatty acid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1530396044,"Properties of the Na+/H+ exchange system in synaptosomes have been studied primarily by using acridine orange fluorescence to follow H+ efflux. Results obtained from 22Na+ uptake experiments and [3H]ethylpropylamiloride binding experiments are also presented for comparison. The basal properties of the Na+/H+ antiport in synaptosomes are similar to those found in other systems; (i) the stoichiometry of Na+/H+ exchange is 1:1; (ii) Li+ can be successfully substituted for Na+; its affinity for the exchanger (KLi+ = 3 mM) is higher than that of Na+ (KNa+ = 12 mM), but the maximal rate of H+ efflux in the presence of Li+ is about 3 times lower than the maximal rate of H+ efflux in the presence of Na+; and (iii) the Na+/H+ antiport is inhibited by amiloride derivatives with the rank order:ethylisopropylamiloride greater than ethylpropylamiloride greater than amiloride greater than benzamil. The most important finding of this paper is that the external pH dependence of the synaptosomal Na+/H+ antiport is controlled by the value of internal pH and vice versa. For example apparent pHo values for half-maximum activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger are pHo = 7.12 when pHi = 6.4 and pHo = 7.95 when pHi = 7.3. Therefore, a 0.9 pH unit increase in internal pH produces a shift of at least a 0.83 pH unit in the external pH dependence. In addition, changing pHo from 7.75 to 8.50 also shifts the half-maximum pHi value for activation of the Na+/H+ antiport from 6.67 to 7.54."

They were identified as morphiceptin, beta-casomorphin, and 8-prolyl-beta-casomorphin. Since morphiceptin is a highly specific mu-agonist and can be derived from a milk protein, it is possible that morphiceptin is an exogenous opioid ligand specific for mu-receptors in the brain and gastrointestinal tract."

The entire nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli hisS locus was determined. The coding region is comprised of 424 codons, and the sequence was determined for 200 nucleotides on the 5'- and 3'-sides of the coding region. The translated nucleotide sequence was confirmed extensively by independent amino acid sequence information obtained by Edman degradations of purified peptides and by measurements of peptide masses by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. A significant sequence alignment of four bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases was reported recently (Webster, T., Tsai, H., Kula, M., Mackie, G., and Schimmel, P. (1984) Science 226, 1315-1317). Although the four enzymes vary considerably in length, this match occurs within the first 100 amino acids of each of the four enzymes and is in the segment believed to be part of the catalytic core. But no strong alignment could be found of the histidine sequence with these four tRNA synthetase sequences. This enzyme may be derived, therefore, from a different progenitor. Previous work suggested that three places in the hisS 5'-noncoding sequence could be promoter sites for RNA polymerase (Eisenbeis, S. J., and Parker, J. (1982) Gene 18, 107-114). We detected a 1400-nucleotide RNA species by RNA blot analysis with a hisS-specific probe. S1 nuclease mapping demonstrated a 5'-end to the RNA species occurs at -67 +/- 1, relative to the first nucleotide of the coding region. This position coincides with the predicted start site for transcription from one of the previously proposed promoter sites."
https://openalex.org/W1561996557,"Using EPR spectroscopy to monitor the integrity of the enzyme, conditions have been established which allow specific immunoprecipitation of the succinate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli. The enzyme complex precipitated from Lubrol PX-solubilized membranes by monospecific antiserum in the presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors contains four polypeptides of apparent MrS 71,000, 26,000, 17,000, and 15,000. The 71-kDa flavopeptide is readily susceptible to proteolysis, and the enzyme complex shows unusual facile dissociation. Spectroscopic measurements indicate the presence of a [2Fe-2S] cluster (Center 1), a [3Fe-xS] cluster (Center 3), and a b-type cytochrome. In addition, a change in relaxation of Center 1 at low potentials is indicative of Center 2. Midpoint redox potentials of Centers 1-3 for both the membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized enzyme were estimated to be +10 mV, -175 mV, and +65 mV, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1500880089,"It is now well-established that phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain of smooth muscle myosin (LC20) is a prerequisite for muscle contraction. However, the relationship between myosin dephosphorylation and muscle relaxation remains controversial. In the present study, we utilized a highly purified catalytic subunit of a type-2, skeletal muscle phosphoprotein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2A) and a glycerinated smooth muscle preparation to determine if myosin dephosphorylation, in the presence of saturating calcium and calmodulin, would cause relaxation of contracted uterine smooth muscle. Addition of the phosphatase catalytic subunit (0.28 microM) to the muscle bath produced complete relaxation of the muscle. The phosphatase-induced relaxation could be reversed by adding to the muscle bath either purified, thiophosphorylated, chicken gizzard 20,000-dalton myosin light chains or purified, chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase. Incubation of skinned muscles with adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) prior to the addition of phosphatase resulted in the incorporation of 0.93 mol of PO4/mol of LC20 and prevented phosphatase-induced relaxation. Under all of the above conditions, changes in steady-state isometric force were associated with parallel changes in myosin light chain phosphorylation over a range of phosphorylation extending from 0.01 to 0.97 mol of PO4/mol of LC20. We found no evidence that dephosphorylation of contracted uterine smooth muscles, in the presence of calcium and calmodulin, could produce a latch-state where isometric force was maintained in the absence of myosin light chain phosphorylation. These results show that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain is adequate for the regulation of contraction or relaxation, respectively, in glycerinated uterine smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1581961318,"Proteoliposomes containing the hog gastric H+,K+-ATPase were prepared from cholate and n-octyl glucoside extracts of native microsomes. Experiments were presented which show reconstitution-dependent selective purification of a 94-kDa peptide capable of Rb+/Rb+ exchange and active H+ transport. The absence of selective enrichment of residual protein contamination in this material suggests but does not prove that those transport reactions are attributable only to the 94-kDa peptide. Transport demonstrated inhibitor sensitivity and cation specificity comparable to the microsomal gastric ATPase. In K2SO4 media the H+ transport reaction was protonophore insensitive and correlated with MgATP-dependent 86Rb+ extrusion. This and other evidence suggested that active transport occurs via electroneutral H+in for K+out exchange. 86Rb+ exchange (uptake) in the proteoliposomes demonstrated both saturable and nonsaturable components. At a K0.5 = 1.5 mM, saturable 86Rb+ uptake accounted for about 90% of Rb+ influx. The vanadate-sensitive cation exchange indicated that the ATPase was reconstituted asymmetrically into the proteoliposomes (70% cis-/30% trans-vanadate site). 86Rb+ exchange was inhibited by ATP and stimulated about 2-fold by low Mg2+ and 5 mM phosphate. These ligand effects and the demonstration of comparable rates of passive exchange and active Rb+ efflux suggest that passive K+ exchange is not severely limited by a K+-occluded enzyme form in the H,K-ATPase. A model compatible with this hypothesis is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2417127756,"The nuclear gene COX5 coding for subunit 5 of cytochrome oxidase has been cloned by transformation of the cox5-1 mutant aE4-238/AL1 with a library of yeast genomic DNA. The recombinant plasmid pG46/ST2 bearing a nuclear DNA insert of 1.17 kilobase pairs restores the ability of cox5 mutants to respire and to synthesize a wild type subunit 5. The COX5 gene has been sequenced and determined to code for a 153-amino acid long protein with a molecular weight of 17,121. The amino-terminal 20 residues comprise the signal peptide. The sequence starting from residue 21 matches the partial sequence reported for the mature subunit 5. The sequence of the subunit 5 gene indicates that the mature protein has a molecular weight of 14,858 which agrees with previous size estimates based on electrophoretic migration. The primary sequence and polarity profile of yeast subunit 5 establishes that it is homologous to subunit 4 of bovine cytochrome oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1553491124,"Site-specific mutagenesis of a cloned gene for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum was used to examine the functional significance of carbamate activation. Lysine 191, the residue involved in carbamate formation, was replaced with a glutamate in order to mimic the anionic nature of the carbamate. The resulting enzyme was capable of binding the six-carbon transition state analog carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate, but completely lacked catalytic activity. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate binding was not stabilized by divalent metal and CO2. These observations are consistent with a proposed role for the carbamate in binding the metal required for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1551543515,"A low Mr human transforming growth factor (TGF) present in melanoma patients' urine has been purified approximately 200,000-fold to apparent homogeneity. Initial purification of an acid-soluble fraction of urine was achieved by Bio-Gel P-30 gel filtration chromatography in 1 M acetic acid. TGF activities were demonstrated in the Mr ranges of 30,000 and 6,000-10,000. These competed with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for binding to A431 membrane receptors and induced anchorage-independent growth of untransformed fibroblasts. The low Mr TGF activity obtained from P-30 chromatography was purified to apparent homogeneity by two sequential reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography steps with a mu Bondapak C18 column first using a linear gradient of acetonitrile going from 0-60% in 120 min and then by rechromatography of the activity over the same column using a shallower gradient of acetonitrile going from 20-40% in 160 min. The isoelectric point of the melanoma patient-derived urinary TGF was determined to be 6.2, which is distinct from that for human EGF. Amino acid composition analysis of the purified urinary TGF (uTGF) revealed that it is composed of at least 42 amino acid residues with a minimum estimated Mr of 4,545. Compositional analysis further revealed distinct similarities and differences between the uTGF, human EGF and TGFs secreted by various transformed human and rodent cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1572589552,"Phosphorylation of serine 40 of the major nucleocapsid protein of avian retroviruses, pp12, regulates binding to viral RNA (Leis, J., Johnson, S., Collins, L. S., and Traugh, J. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7726-7732). The phosphorylation state of the protein can be altered in vitro, resulting in the interconversion of the protein between a state of high affinity for single-stranded RNA and low affinity for single- or double-stranded RNA. The reversible phosphorylation of serine 40 is accompanied by a change in the conformation of the protein as demonstrated by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and chemical modification studies. Quenching of fluorescence of the sole tryptophan residue, Trp 80, by poly(U), KI, and CsCl indicates that the microenvironment of this residue is more positive in pp12 than in p12. Chemical modification studies indicate that the 3 lysine residues at positions 36, 37, and 39 of pp12 react with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, while only 1 of these residues reacts in p12. The addition of single-stranded, but not double-stranded RNA, to pp12 protects 2 of the 3 lysine residues from chemical modification, suggesting that the two protected lysyl groups are required for binding to single-stranded viral RNA. In contrast to the phosphorylation of serine 40, phosphorylation of serine 43, catalyzed by protease-activated kinase II in vitro, does not induce changes in the protein conformation nor does it alter the RNA binding properties of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1485029037,"Escherichia coli purF has been determined to be the distal gene of a polycistronic operon. The first gene of the purF operon encodes a hydrophobic 17.9-kDa protein of unknown function. Deletion analyses indicate that the 17.9-kDa protein plays no role in the regulation of purF in cis. mRNA hybridization studies establish that purF is regulated at the transcriptional level. Enzyme and mRNA levels are repressed 11-17-fold by excess adenine. A single mRNA start site at nucleotide +1 was identified for transcripts synthesized in vivo. Two sites, at +1 and approximately +30, were used for transcription initiation in vitro. The purF promoter is localized between nucleotides -96 and -7 with sequences upstream of -71 necessary for high level expression. Initial evidence suggests that transcription is subject to stringent control. Deletion analyses localize the purF control element to a region between nucleotides -71 and +35. A putative control site between nucleotides -35 to +3 strongly resembles a 5' flanking sequence in the co-regulated gene purM. This site contains an imperfect inverted repeat sequence that is characteristic of sites recognized by regulatory proteins and is a candidate for the purF operator. This is the first detailed analysis of a gene involved in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2405925561,"Bromoperoxidase Compound I has been formed in reactions between bromoperoxidase and organic peroxide substrates. The absorbance spectrum of bromoperoxidase Compound I closely resembles the Compound I spectra of other peroxidases. The pH dependence of the second order rate constant for the formation of Compound I with hydrogen peroxide demonstrates the presence of an ionizable group at the enzyme active site having a pKa of 5.3. Protonation of this acidic group inhibits the rate of Compound I formation. This pKa value is higher than that determined for other peroxidases but the overall pH rate profiles for Compound I formation are similar. The one-electron reduction of bromoperoxidase Compound I yields Compound II and a second reduction yields native enzyme. Bromoperoxidase Compound II readily forms Compound III in the presence of an excess of hydrogen peroxide. Compound III passes through an as yet uncharacterized intermediate (III) in its decay to native enzyme. Compound III is produced and accumulates in enzymatic bromination reactions to become the predominate steady state form of the enzyme. Since Compound III is inactive as catalyst for enzymatic bromination, its accumulation leads to an idling reaction pathway which displays an unusual kinetic pattern for the bromination of monochlorodimedone."
https://openalex.org/W1523730492,"A detailed kinetic study was performed to investigate the interaction of glucagon with receptors on freshly isolated hepatocytes. Competition binding assay results fit a mathematical expression for a single site noncooperative model of binding. Glucagon was shown to bind with first-order kinetics at six-hormone concentrations (0.02-0.50 nM) at 0 and 37 degrees C. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants are directly proportional to the hormone concentration at 0 degree C, but display a downward deviation from linearity at 37 degrees C. Dissociation of glucagon exhibited biexponential character at 37 degrees C which was not seen at 0 degree C. The biphasic dissociation at 37 degrees C was resolved into rapid (t1/2 = 1.9 min) and slow (t1/2 = 27.7 min) components. The distribution of the total bound hormone between the rapidly and slowly dissociating complexes was not dependent upon the extent of receptor occupancy. The absolute quantity of rapidly dissociating hormone-receptor complexes was constant at all times examined; however, the fraction of slowly dissociating hormone-receptor complexes was found to increase with increasing incubation time. The results indicate that a homogeneous population of hepatic receptors undergoes a time-dependent, temperature-dependent conversion from one state to another in a two-stage sequential manner."
https://openalex.org/W2415502906,"Nucleotide sequences which are required for RNA polymerase I-dependent selective initiation of transcription in vitro from a site within the spacer region of cloned yeast ribosomal DNA have been identified. Yeast rDNA templates containing deletion mutations extending from restriction endonuclease cleavage sites located upstream and downstream from the transcriptional initiation site were constructed. The ability of these mutant templates to support selective transcription in vitro was determined using a yeast whole cell extract. Nucleotide sequences which are required for selective transcription in vitro are within a 22-base pair region which is located immediately adjacent to the transcriptional initiation site. The 3' boundary of this 22-base pair sequence was mapped within a single base pair and resides within the transcribed portion of the rDNA. Nucleotide sequences upstream and downstream from the 22-base pair region are not required for selective transcription and do not appear to affect the efficiency of transcription in vitro. A hybrid plasmid containing only 32 base pairs of yeast rDNA, which includes the 22-base pair region, supports efficient and accurate RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription in vitro. These data demonstrate that the 22-base pair region of yeast rDNA is sufficient for accurate initiation of transcription in vitro. The transcriptional properties of several cloned rDNA templates isolated from two haploid yeast strains and a strain of bakers' yeast were examined. Four cistrons were identified which differ in nucleotide sequence. Three cistrons contain the 22-base pair promoter region and they support selective transcription in vitro. The fourth cistron does not support selective transcription in vitro and contains a single base pair substitution within the 22-base pair promoter sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1579685007,"The effects of hypothyroidism on glycogen metabolism in rat skeletal muscle were studied using the perfused rat hindlimb preparation. Three weeks after propylthiouracil treatment, serum thyroxine was undetectable and muscle glycogen and Glc-6-P were decreased. Basal and epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylase a and phosphorylase b kinase activities were also significantly reduced, as were epinephrine-stimulated cAMP accumulation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Conversely, basal and epinephrine-stimulated glycogen synthase I activities were significantly higher while the Ka of the enzyme for Glc-6-P was lower in hypothyroid animals. Propylthiouracil-treated rats also had increased phosphoprotein phosphatase activities towards phosphorylase and glycogen synthase and decreased activity of phosphatase inhibitor 1. beta-Adrenergic receptor binding and basal and epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were reduced in muscle particulate fractions from hypothyroid rats. Administration of triiodothyronine to rats for 3 days after 3 weeks of propylthiouracil treatment restored the altered metabolic parameters to normal. It is proposed that the decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness of the enzymes of glycogen metabolism in hypothyroid rat skeletal muscle is due to increased activity of phosphoprotein phosphatases and to reduced beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2418749868,"We previously demonstrated that the hydrolysis of GTP by canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is not sensitive to calcium and does not support the translocation of calcium and oxalate into the vesicular space. In response to GTP, however, calcium is accumulated into a compartment which is sensitive to pH and ionophore. In the present paper, we further explored the relationship between GTP hydrolysis and GTP-induced calcium accumulation. Both ATP- and GTP-induced calcium accumulation were prevented by the sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; I50 = 0.2 mM). In contrast, the sensitivity of NTP hydrolysis to NEM differed markedly; GTPase activity was not affected by NEM, whereas ATPase activity was markedly inhibited. Conversely, although the GTPase was noncompetitively inhibited by the ATP analogue, adenylyl imidodiphosphate (Ki = 8 microM), and was competitively inhibited by the GTP analogue, guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Ki = 60 microM), GTP-induced calcium accumulation was not affected by the NTP analogues at any concentration. Therefore, the GTP-dependent accumulation of calcium into the pH- and ionophore-sensitive compartment of cardiac SR may not require GTP hydrolysis but may be dependent on GTP binding. The previously reported noncompetitive inhibition of the GTPase by ATP was also observed when the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of ATP was prevented by NEM (Ki = 1.2 microM). Along with the noncompetitive inhibition of the GTPase by adenylyl imidodiphosphate, the inhibition of the GTP by ATP in the presence of NEM suggests that ATP binding may be involved in the observed inhibition. The Ki for the noncompetitive inhibition of GTPase activity is compatible with ATP binding to the high affinity catalytic site of the ATPase. Thus, although GTP-induced calcium accumulation differs somewhat from ATP-dependent calcium translocation, the similarities between the two processes (i.e. similar time courses and sensitivity to pH, ionophore, and sulfhydryl modification) suggest that they may be related in some manner."
https://openalex.org/W1489920602,"Uridine kinase from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has been purified about 60,000-fold to apparent homogeneity and with an overall recovery of about 40%. This purification was achieved using phosphocellulose and adenosine 5'-triphosphate-agarose affinity chromatography. The subunit molecular mass as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 31,000 daltons. With two-dimensional electrophoresis, only one spot was observed, indicating the absence of isoenzymes. Multiple peaks of activity are routinely observed on ion exchange chromatography or gel filtration, for both crude preparations or homogeneous uridine kinase, in agreement with our earlier results that this enzyme exists as multiple interconvertible oligomeric forms (Payne, R. C., and Traut, T. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12485-12488). The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 283 mumol/min/mg of protein at 22 degrees C. Initial velocity studies using uridine and ATP are consistent with a sequential mechanism. Km values for uridine, cytidine, and ATP are 40, 57, and 450 microM, respectively. CTP and UTP are competitive inhibitors with respect to ATP, with Ki values for CTP and UTP of 10 and 61 microM, respectively. The enzyme was active with several nucleoside analogs, the Km values being 69 microM (5-fluorouridine), 200 microM (3-deazauridine), and 340 microM (6-azauridine). The pure enzyme is very sensitive to freezing, but can be maintained at O degrees C for 8 weeks with only 20% loss of activity. For long-term storage, enzyme in 50% glycerol can be maintained at -20 degrees C for many months with no detectable loss of activity."

In both systems, a prominently labeled protein had a molecular weight of 11,000. Binding to this protein was inhibited by preincubation of the reaction mixture with antimycin prior to addition of the radioactive analog and subsequent irradiation.

https://openalex.org/W1564852721,"We have characterized a positive cooperativity mechanism in the binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) to its chick duodenum chromatin receptor. The Hill plot which can take account of the possibility of cooperativity resulted in a much better fitting of the experimental data than the Scatchard model (r = +0.998 versus r = -0.94). Concentrating the chromatin receptor preparation from 10 to 40% resulted in an increase of the Hill coefficient (nH) from 1.09 +/- 0.08 to 1.46 +/- 0.08 (S.D.). Increasing the temperature of incubation from 1 degree C to 40 degrees C resulted in a decrease of nH from 1.46 +/- 0.08 to 1.10 +/- 0.02 (S.D.). The calculation of the thermodynamics of the interaction of 1,25-(OH)2D3 with the second binding site of the receptor (from a Van't Hoff plot) showed that this process occurred spontaneously (delta G0 = -11.6 kcal X mol-1 at 1 degree C), was entropy-driven (delta S0 = +26 cal degree-1 mol-1), and was energy-requiring (delta H0 = -4.37 kcal X mol-1). The temperature controlled reversibility of the cooperativity demonstrates that this phenomenon is not an artifact. Finally, in a study of the rate of dissociation of [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 from the duodenal receptor preparation, we have found two slopes (k-1 = 32 X 10(-3) min-1; k-2 = 3.2 X 10(-3) min-1); this suggests the existence of two species of receptor. These receptor species could result possibly from either a monomer-dimer system or from a conformational change of a monomer via site-site interactions. In conclusion, the positive cooperativity in the binding of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the two binding sites of its intestinal receptor is an entropy-driven process and requires energy, is reversible with temperature, and has been shown to take place in concentrated chromatin aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1494199361,"A population of gastric membrane vesicles of high K+ permeability and of lower density than endoplasmic tubulovesicles containing (H+-K+)-ATPase was detected in gastric mucosal microsomes from the rat fasted overnight. The K+-transport activity as measured with 86RbCl uptake had a Km for Rb+ of 0.58 +/- 0.11 mM and a Vmax of 13.7 +/- 1.9 nmol/min X mg of protein. The 86Rb uptake was reduced by 40% upon substituting Cl- with SO2-4 and inhibited noncompetitively by ATP and vanadate with a Ki of 3 and 30 microM, respectively; vanadate also inhibited rat gastric (H+-K+)-ATPase but with a Ki of 0.03 microM. Carbachol or histamine stimulation decreased the population of the K+-permeable light membrane vesicles, at the same time increased K+-transport activity in the heavy, presumably apical membranes of gastric parietal cells, and enabled the heavy microsomes to accumulate H+ ions in the presence of ATP and KCl without valinomycin. The secretagogue-induced shift of K+ permeability was blocked by cimetidine, a H2-receptor antagonist. Four characteristics of the K+ permeability as measured with 86RbCl were common in the resting light and the carbachol-stimulated heavy microsomes; (a) Km for +Rb, (b) anion sensitivity (Cl- greater than SO2-4), (c) potency of various divalent cations (Hg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+) to inhibit Rb+ uptake, and (d) inhibitory effect of ATP, although the nucleotide sensitivity was latent in the stimulated heavy microsomes. The Vmax for 86RbCl uptake was about 10 times greater in the resting light than the stimulated heavy microsomes. These observations led us to propose that secretagogue stimulation induces the insertion of not only the tubulovesicles containing (H+-K+)-ATPase, but also the light membrane vesicles containing KCl transporter into the heavy apical membranes of gastric parietal cells."
https://openalex.org/W180730684,"The KpnI sequences constitute the dominant, long, interspersed repetitive DNA families in primate genomes. These families contain related, but nonidentical sequence subsets, some of which border functional gene domains and are transcribed into RNA. To test whether these sequences perform an organizational function in the nucleus, their association with the nuclear matrix has been examined in African green monkey cells. DNase I treatment depleted the residual matrix of most of the KpnI 1.2- and 1.5-kilobase pair family sequences although significant amounts of each family remained in the loop attachment DNA fragments. Hybridization analysis of the KpnI and RsaI cleavage patterns of matrix loop attachment DNA indicate that some sequence subsets of these KpnI families are relatively less depleted than others. The nuclear matrix association of subpopulations of KpnI 1.2- and 1.5-kilobase pair families was also shown by metrizamide gradient centrifugation of nuclear matrix complexes cleaved by KpnI endonuclease. The gradients demonstrate that some KpnI segments are differentially associated with nuclear matrix proteins. Moreover, the procedures permit the preparative isolation and purification of the DNA-protein complexes containing these KpnI 1.2- and 1.5-kilobase pair sequence families. Speculations on the relationship between the matrix association of these KpnI family sequences and their possible roles in gene organization and expression are presented and discussed."

Following the formation of radioiodinated human FSH (125I-hFSH)-receptor complexes, the membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 or beta-octyl glucoside and the supernatants from ultracentrifugation (220,000 X g) subjected to gel filtration (Sephadex G-200) to separate the labeled hormone-receptor complexes from the unbound 125I-hFSH. The appearance of a high molecular weight (greater than or equal to 200,000) radioactive component in the elution profile was abolished when an excess of unlabeled hFSH was included in the initial incubation. After concentration by ultrafiltration, the 125I-hFSH-receptor complex, as well as the free hormone, was treated with a variety of chemical cross-linkers and subjected to analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Bands of Mr = 65,000 and 83,000 observed in the autoradiograph of the hormone-receptor complex was not present in autoradiographs of free 125I-hFSH, nor were they present when an excess of unlabeled hFSH was included in the initial binding incubation mixtures. The 65,000 and 83,000 Mr bands were, therefore, considered to represent cross-linked complexes of labeled hFSH (Mr = 38,000) or its subunits (hFSH alpha, Mr = 16,000; hFSH beta, Mr = 21,000) and components of the FSH receptor. The bands were observed on autoradiographs when the extraction of the membranes was performed with either Triton X-100 or beta-octyl glucoside and when cross-linking was accomplished with disuccinimidyl suberate, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), or bis[2-(succinimido oxycarbonyl)oxyethyl]sulfone. The Mr of the native FSH receptor in the calf testis has been estimated at 146,000. Our studies demonstrate the multimeric nature of the FSH receptor. However, FSH is also composed of subunits, so that due to the complexity of the system, it was not possible to arrive at a precise assessment of the Mr or quaternary structure of the receptor subunits."
https://openalex.org/W138984878,"The three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli B/r porin (OmpF) was studied by chemical modification using activated sugars of different size. Galactose and galactosides of different penetration properties through the porin channel were oxidized by galactose oxidase, and the 6-aldehydes formed were linked to amino groups in porin by reduction with NaBH3CN. Tryptic fragments of modified and unmodified porin were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid and amino-terminal analysis from the known primary structure of OmpF. Modification of purified native porin trimers in beta-octylglucoside revealed three classes of amino groups: (i) those not modified by any sugars; (ii) those modified only by small sugars that diffuse rapidly through the pore, such as galactose or melibiose; and (iii) those modified by either small or large sugars, the latter including pore-impermeant sugars such as stachyose. The results suggest that the three classes of amino groups correspond, respectively, to groups buried in the trimeric molecule, those in the interior of the pore and those exposed on the surface of porin. In addition modification experiments performed on whole cells suggested that all the reactive groups modified by the pore-impermeant sugars (class iii) are located on the surface of porin exposed on the outside of the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1493883780,"The regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex was investigated during alpha-adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine in the isolated perfused rat liver. The metabolic flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction was monitored by measuring the production of 14CO2 from infused [1-14C] pyruvate. In livers from fed animals perfused with a low concentration of pyruvate (0.05 mM), phenylephrine infusion significantly inhibited the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation without affecting the amount of pyruvate dehydrogenase in its active form. Also, phenylephrine caused no significant effect on tissue NADH/NAD+ and acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratios or on the kinetics of pyruvate decarboxylation in 14CO2 washout experiments. Phenylephrine inhibition of [1-14C]pyruvate decarboxylation was, however, closely associated with a decrease in the specific radioactivity of perfusate lactate, suggesting that the pyruvate decarboxylation response simply reflected dilution of the labeled pyruvate pool due to phenylephrine-stimulated glycogenolysis. This suggestion was confirmed in additional experiments which showed that the alpha-adrenergic-mediated inhibitory effect on pyruvate decarboxylation was reduced in livers perfused with a high concentration of pyruvate (1 mM) and was absent in livers from starved rats. Thus, alpha-adrenergic agonists do not exert short term regulatory effects on pyruvate dehydrogenase in the liver. Furthermore, the results suggest either that the rat liver pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is insensitive to changes in mitochondrial calcium or that changes in intramitochondrial calcium levels as a result of alpha-adrenergic stimulation are considerably less than suggested by others."

To define the features of the HMG1 molecule which are essential for this activity, fragments of HMG1 and chemically modified HMG1 molecules were injected into HeLa cells and the capacity of each of these probes to accumulate in the nucleus was measured by an autoradiographic technique. Fragments representing the C-terminal and central portions of HMG1 did not concentrate in the nucleus; a fragment which consisted of the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule and which lacked the 41 consecutive aspartate and glutamate residues located near the C-terminal end of the molecule accumulated to about the same extent as intact HMG1. When the amino groups of HMG1 were chemically modified, there was a progressive loss in the ability of the protein to accumulate in the nucleus; derivatization of one-fourth of the total amino groups reduced the concentration of microinjected protein in the nucleus relative to that in the cytoplasm to one-half of the original value. In contrast, modification of one-fourth of the total carboxyl groups did not significantly affect the capacity of HMG1 to accumulate in the nucleus, although further modification resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation. Iodination of tyrosine residues was without effect and modification of the cysteine residues had only a modest effect on the ability of HMG1 to concentrate in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1613279313,"The stoichiometry of CO ligation to the dimer heme protein Rhodospirillum molischianum cytochrome c' is determined. We have recently measured the enthalpy change of CO ligation to this molecule by the van't Hoff method and found the value of -10.7 +/- 1.2 kcal/mol CO (aqueous) (Doyle, M. L., Weber, P. C., and Gill, S. J. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 1987-1991). In the present paper the enthalpy change of CO ligation, measured directly by titration calorimetry, is found to be -9.5 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol heme. Since the van't Hoff method gives the heat value in units/mole of CO and the calorimetric method gives the heat value in units/mole of heme, the stoichiometry of the reaction is given by the ratio of the two values and found to be 0.9 +/- 0.1, or within experimental error, one CO molecule bound per heme."
