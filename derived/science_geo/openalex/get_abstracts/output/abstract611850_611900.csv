https://openalex.org/W2806200645,"DNA barcoding based on a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene in the mitochondrial genome is widely applied in species identification and biodiversity studies. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive barcoding reference database of fishes in the Taiwan Strait and evaluate the applicability of using the COI gene for the identification of fish at the species level. A total of 284 mitochondrial COI barcode sequences were obtained from 85 genera, 38 families and 12 orders of fishes. The mean length of the sequences was 655 base pairs. The average Kimura two parameter (K2P) distances within species, genera, families, orders and classes were 0.21%, 6.50%, 23.70% and 25.60%, respectively. The mean interspecific distance was 31-fold higher than the mean intraspecific distance. The K2P neighbor-joining trees based on the sequence generally clustered species in accordance with their taxonomic classifications. High efficiency of species identification was demonstrated in the present study by DNA barcoding, and we conclude that COI sequencing can be used to identify fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2806985566,"The objective of the study was to examine the association between handgrip strength (HGS), knee flexion and extension strength, and static and dynamic balance in older women. One hundred and ten women with a mean age of 67.4±5.9 years were assessed for dynamic postural balance using the Time Up & Go Test (TUG) with and without cognitive tasks. Semi-static balance was assessed by means of a force platform; knee flexor and extensor muscle strength was calculated using an isokinetic dynamometer; and HGS using a hand held dynamometer. Weaker HGS was significantly correlated with worse performance in dynamic postural balance, as well as performance with TUG with and without cognitive tasks; however, there was no correlation between HGS and static balance. There was a moderate positive correlation between knee flexion/extension strength and HGS. This suggests that HGS could be used as a proxy indicator of overall strength capacity for clinical screening among older women."
https://openalex.org/W2806099717,"Objective Osteoporotic fragility fractures, that are common in men and women, signal increased risk of future fractures and of premature mortality. Less than one-third of postmenopausal women and fewer men are prescribed active treatments to reduce fracture risk. Therefore, in this study the association of oral bisphosphonate recommendation with subsequent fracture and mortality over eight years in a fracture liaison service setting was analysed. Materials and methods In this prospective cohort study, 5011 men and women aged >50 years, who sustained a clinical fracture, accepted the invitation to attend the fracture liaison service of the West Glasgow health service between 1999 and 2007. These patients were fully assessed and all were recommended calcium and vitamin D. Based on pre-defined fracture risk criteria, 2534 (50.7%) patients were additionally also recommended oral bisphosphonates. Mortality and subsequent fracture risk were the pre-defined outcomes analysed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results Those recommended bisphosphonates were more often female (82.9 vs. 72.4%), were older (73.4 vs. 64.4 years), had lower bone mineral density T-score (-3.1 vs. -1.5) and more had sustained hip fractures (21.7 vs. 6.2%; p < 0.001). After adjustments, patients recommended bisphosphonates had lower subsequent fracture risk (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49–0.73) and lower mortality risk (HR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.64–0.97). Conclusion Of the patients, who are fully assessed after a fracture at the fracture liaison service, those with higher fracture risk and a recommendation for bisphosphonates had worse baseline characteristics. However, after adjusting for these differences, those recommended bisphosphonate treatment had a substantially lower risk for subsequent fragility fracture and lower risk for mortality. These community-based data indicate the adverse public health outcomes and mortality impacts of the current low treatment levels post fracture could be improved by bisphosphonate recommendation for both subsequent fracture and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2806274639,"Mental fatigue is one of the main reasons for the decline of response inhibition. This study aimed to explore the impairing influence of mental fatigue on a driver's response inhibition. The effects of mental fatigue on response inhibition were assessed by comparing brain activity and behavioral indices when performing a Go/NoGo task before and after a 90-min fatigue manipulation task. Participants in the driving group performed a simulated driving task, while individuals in the control group spent the same time watching movies. We found that participants in the driving group reported higher levels of mental fatigue and had a higher percentage of eye closure and larger lateral deviations from their lane positions, which indicated there was effective manipulation of mental fatigue through a prolonged simulated driving task. After manipulation of mental fatigue, we observed increased reaction time and miss rates, delayed NoGo-N2 latency and Go-P3 latency, and decreased NoGo-P3 amplitude, which indicated that mental fatigue may slow down the speed of the inhibition process, delay the evaluation of visual stimuli and reduce the availability of attentional resources. These findings revealed the underlying neurological mechanisms of how mental fatigue impaired response inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2805692000,"Epidemiological studies use saliva on a regular basis as a non-invasive and easy-to-take sample, which is assumed to be a microbial representative of the oral cavity ecosystem. However, comparative studies between different kinds of saliva samples normally used in microbial studies are scarce. The aim of the current study was to compare oral microbiota composition between two different saliva samples collected simultaneously: non-stimulated saliva with paper points and stimulated saliva collected after chewing paraffin gum. DNA was extracted from saliva samples of ten individuals, then analyzed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to describe bacterial diversity. The results demonstrate significant differences between the microbiota of these two kinds of saliva. Stimulated saliva was found to contain an estimated number of species over three times higher than unstimulated saliva. In addition, bacterial composition at the class and genus level was radically different between both types of samples. When compared to other oral niches, both types of saliva showed some similarity to tongue and buccal mucosa, but they do not correlate at all with the bacterial composition described in supra- or sub-gingival dental plaque, questioning their use in etiological and epidemiological studies of oral diseases of microbial origin."
https://openalex.org/W2807384988,"The electrodermal activity (EDA) is a useful tool for assessing skin sympathetic nervous activity. Using spectral analysis of EDA data at rest, we have previously found that the spectral band which is the most sensitive to central sympathetic control is largely confined to 0.045 to 0.25 Hz. However, the frequency band associated with sympathetic control in EDA has not been studied for exercise conditions. Establishing the band limits more precisely is important to ensure the accuracy and sensitivity of the technique. As exercise intensity increases, it is intuitive that the frequencies associated with the autonomic dynamics should also increase accordingly. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the appropriate frequency band associated with the sympathetic nervous system in the EDA signal during exercise. Eighteen healthy subjects underwent a sub-maximal exercise test, including a resting period, walking, and running, until achieving 85% of maximum heart rate. Both EDA and ECG data were measured simultaneously for all subjects. The ECG was used to monitor subjects’ instantaneous heart rate, which was used to set the experiment’s end point. We found that the upper bound of the frequency band (Fmax) containing the EDA spectral power significantly shifted to higher frequencies when subjects underwent prolonged low-intensity (Fmax ~ 0.28) and vigorous-intensity exercise (Fmax ~ 0.37 Hz) when compared to the resting condition. In summary, we have found shifting of the sympathetic dynamics to higher frequencies in the EDA signal when subjects undergo physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2805556615,"Objectives We evaluated the ability of the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), a surrogate marker of hepatic steatosis, to predict the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) at 3 years follow-up in a Spanish cohort with prediabetes from a prospective observational study in primary care (PREDAPS). Methods FLI was calculated at baseline for 1,142 adult subjects with prediabetes attending primary care centers, and classified into three categories: FLI <30 (no steatosis), FLI 30–60 (intermediate) and FLI ≥60 (hepatic steatosis). We estimated the incidence rate of T2D in each FLI category at 3 years of follow-up. The association between FLI and incident T2D was calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, educational level, family history of diabetes, lifestyles, hypertension, lipid profile and transaminases. Results The proportion of subjects with prediabetes and hepatic steatosis (FLI ≥60) at baseline was 55.7%. The incidence rate of T2D at 3 years follow-up was 1.3, 2.9 and 6.0 per 100 person-years for FLI<30, FLI 30->60 and FLI ≥60, respectively. The most significant variables increasing the risk of developing T2D were metabolic syndrome (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.14–4.26) and FLI ≥60 (HR = 4.52; 95%CI = 2.10–9.72). Moreover, FLI ≥60 was independently associated with T2D incidence: the HR was 4.97 (95% CI: 2.28–10.80) in the base regression model adjusted by sex, age and educational level, and 3.21 (95%CI: 1.45–7.09) in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions FLI may be considered an easy and valuable early indicator of high risk of incident T2D in patients with prediabetes attended in primary care, which could allow the adoption of effective measures needed to prevent and reduce the progression of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2806214593,"Inadequate care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and may be associated with adverse outcomes after dialysis. The nationwide pre-end-stage renal disease pay for performance program (P4P) has been implemented in Taiwan to improve quality of CKD care. However, the effectiveness of the P4P program in improving the outcomes of pre-dialysis care and dialysis is uncertain. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study. Patients who newly underwent long-term dialysis (≥3 mo) between 2007 and 2009 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Based on the patient enrolment of the P4P program, they were categorized into P4P or non-P4P groups. We analysed pre-dialysis care, healthcare expenditures, and mortality between two groups. Among the 26 588 patients, 25.5% participated in the P4P program. The P4P group received significantly better quality of care, including a higher frequency of glomerular filtration rate measurement and CKD complications survey, a higher rate of vascular access preparation, and more frequent use of arteriovenous fistulas than the non-P4P group did. The P4P group had a 68.4% reduction of the 4-year total healthcare expenditure (excluding dialysis fee), which is equivalent to US$345.7 million, and a significant 22% reduction in three-year mortality after dialysis (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.82, P < 0.001) compared with the non-P4P group. P4P program improves quality of pre-dialysis CKD care, and provide survival benefit and a long-term cost saving for dialysis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2805688132,"Membrane integrity is essential in maintaining sperm viability, signaling, and motility, which are essential for fertilization. Sperm are highly susceptible to oxidative stress, as they are rich in sensitive polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and are unable to synthesize and repair many essential membrane constituents. Because of this, sperm cellular membranes are important targets of this process. Membrane Lipid Replacement (MLR) with glycerophospholipid mixtures (GPL) has been shown to ameliorate oxidative stress in cells, restore their cellular membranes, and prevent loss of function. Therefore, we tested the effects of MLR on sperm by tracking and monitoring GPL incorporation into their membrane systems and studying their effects on sperm motility and viability under different experimental conditions. Incubation of sperm with mixtures of exogenous, unoxidized GPL results in their incorporation into sperm membranes, as shown by the use of fluorescent dyes attached to GPL. The percent overall (total) sperm motility was increased from 52±2.5% to 68±1.34% after adding GPL to the incubation media, and overall sperm motility was recovered from 7±2% after H2O2 treatment to 58±2.5%)(n = 8, p<0.01) by the incorporation of GPL into sperm membranes. When sperm were exposed to H2O2, the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MIMP), monitored using the MIMP tracker dye JC-1 in flow cytometry, diminished, whereas the addition of GPL prevented the decrease in MIMP. Confocal microscopy with Rhodamine-123 and JC-1 confirmed the mitochondrial localization of the dyes. We conclude that incubation of human sperm with glycerolphospholipids into the membranes of sperm improves sperm viability, motility, and resistance to oxidizing agents like H2O2. This suggests that human sperm might be useful to test innovative new treatments like MLR, since such treatments could improve fertility when it is adversely affected by increased oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2805962585,"Background Hyperbilirubinemia is a common problem in neonates that can progress into kernicterus. Suspected neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a common reason for contact with the healthcare system. The severity and management of jaundice are determined based on estimated bilirubin levels. However, no easy and accessible tool for self-assessing neonatal jaundice is currently available. Smartphones could potentially be transformed into a medical device that could be used by both patients and practitioners. Objective To investigate whether a digital image produced by a camera embedded on a smartphone can be a used as a screening tool for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Study design A total of 64 randomly selected newborns were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were healthy Caucasians, gestational age >35 weeks, age >24 hours and ≤14 days old, and parental informed consent. The exclusion criteria were facial skin lesions and light treatment. Images of the glabella were obtained with an iPhone 6 via i) directly applied pressure, ii) a dermatoscope, or iii) a dermatoscope equipped with a Wratten No. 11 filter. The red, green and blue colour intensities of each image were compared to bilirubin levels. Results Only the dermatoscope-acquired intensities of the green and blue channels were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with bilirubin measurements (Pearson’s r: 0.59 and 0.48, respectively). For the green and blue channels, discrimination limits of 212 and 190, respectively, revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 62.5%, respectively, for green and 90.9% and 60%, respectively, for blue for a plasma bilirubin above 205 μmol/L. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that a smartphone equipped with a consistent light source in the form of a dermatoscope may be a simple screening tool for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. However, the method requires some improvement before clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2805746393,"Empathy is an important concept in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Despite the controversy around its definition, most researchers would agree that empathy is a multidimensional phenomenon which involves a vicarious experience of another person’s affective state and an understanding of another person’s affective experience. Self-report measures of empathy constitute an important tool for both research and clinical practice. The main goal of this study was to adapt and study the psychometric properties of the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE), a worldwide used measure of empathy, in a Portuguese community sample (N = 562). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the factor structure of the original QCAE. Results show that the Portuguese version of the QCAE has sound psychometric properties, with good structural validity and internal consistency for both scales (i.e., affective and cognitive) and respective subscales of the instrument (i.e., Emotion Contagion, Proximal Responsivity, Peripheral Responsivity, Perspective Taking and Online Simulation). We tested both a five correlated factor structure (Model 1) and a second-order model that postulates the affective and cognitive dimensions (Model 2). Our results show that while both models present acceptable goodness of fit indices, Model 1 performs slightly better. In conclusion, the Portuguese version of the QCAE may prove a useful tool for future cross-cultural assessments of empathy in both research and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2807587898,"There is a great unmet medical need in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) for novel drugs with other mechanisms of action than existing. PC cells express the onco-fetal RTK ROR1, absent on most normal post-partem cells. ROR1 is involved in proliferation, survival, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells in various malignancies. A small molecule inhibitor (KAN0439834) (530 Da) targeting the TK domain of ROR1 was developed and the activity in ROR1 expressing human PC cell lines (n = 8) evaluated. The effects were compared to a murine mAb against the external part of ROR1, gemcitabine, erlotinib and ibrutinib. KAN0439834 induced significant apoptosis of the tumor cells. EC50 values for KAN0439834 varied between 250–650 nM depending on the cell line. The corresponding values for erlotinib and ibrutinib were 10–40 folds higher. KAN0439834 was much more effective in inducing tumor cell death than the ROR1 mAb although both inhibited ROR1 phosphorylation and downstream non-canonical Wnt pathway molecules. Combination of KAN0439834 with erlotinib or ibrutinib had significant additive effects on tumor cell death. A first-in-class small molecule ROR1 inhibitor (KAN0439834) showed promising in vitro activity against a number of human PC cell lines. Interesting is the additive effects of erlotinib and ibrutinib which warrants further studies as both these agents are in clinical trials for pancreatic carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2805736408,"No validated biomarker at birth exists to predict which newborns will develop severe hyperbilirubinemia. This study's primary aim was to build and validate a prediction model for severe hyperbilirubinemia using umbilical cord blood bilirubins (CBB) and risk factors at birth in neonates at risk for maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility. This study's secondary aim was to compare the accuracy of CBB to the direct antigen titer.Inclusion criteria for this prospective cohort study included: ≥35 weeks gestational age, mother with blood type O and/or Rh negative or positive antibody screen, and <24 hours of age. The primary outcome was severe hyperbilirubinemia, defined as phototherapy during the initial hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were a total serum bilirubin concentration >95th and >75th percentile during the initial hospital stay. The predictive performance and accuracy of the two tests (CBB and direct antigen titer) for each outcome was assessed using area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.When compared to neonates who did not receive phototherapy (n = 463), neonates who received phototherapy (n = 36) had a greater mean CBB ± standard deviation (2.5 ± 0.7 vs. 1.6 ± 0.4 mg/dL, p<0.001). For every 0.3 mg/dL increase in CBB, a neonate was 3.20 (95% confidence interval, 2.31-4.45), 2.10 (1.63-2.70), and 3.12 (2.44-3.99) times more likely to receive phototherapy or have a total serum bilirubin concentration >95th and >75th percentile, respectively. The AUC ± standard error (95% confidence interval) for CBB for phototherapy and a total serum bilirubin concentration >95th and >75th percentile was 0.89 ± 0.03 (0.82-0.95), 0.81 ± 0.04 (0.73-0.90), and 0.84 ± 0.02 (0.80-0.89), respectively. However, the AUC for gestational age and maternal Asian race for these outcomes was only 0.55 ± 0.05 (0.45-0.66), 0.66 ± 0.05 (0.56-0.76), and 0.57 ± 0.04 (0.05-0.64), respectively. When the CBB was combined with gestational age and maternal Asian race, the AUC for a total serum bilirubin concentration >95th percentile improved to 0.87 ± 0.03 (0.81-0.92) (p = 0.034 vs. the model with CBB only and p<0.001 vs. the model with clinical risk factors only). In a sub-group of subjects (n = 189), the AUC for the direct antigen titer for phototherapy was 0.64 ± 0.06 (0.52-0.77) with a 52% sensitivity and 77% specificity. In contrast, a CBB cut-point of 1.85 mg/dL was 92% sensitive and 70% specific for phototherapy with an AUC of 0.87 ± 0.04 (0.80-0.95).CBB, in combination with gestational age and maternal race, may be a useful, non-invasive test to predict shortly after birth which neonates will develop severe hyperbilirubinemia."
https://openalex.org/W2806788788,"Background Many patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may require special attention and long-term treatment. Little is known on the efficacy and tolerability of the drugs used in practice. Material and methods We retrospectively reviewed the results of therapy of 400 patients with chronic ITP. All Patients were treated at our institution between 1996–2016 under consideration of guidelines, general recommendations, and individual aspects, including gender, age, weight, comorbidity, patient’s medical history and bleeding risk. Results Treatment was not required in 25% of patients (n = 100) during observation. In treated patients (n = 300), the rate of patients that responded and tolerated treatment with prednisolone was 59% (52/88), with azathioprine 32% (29/90), with eltrombopag 49% (31/63), with romiplostim 59% 27/45, with IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulines) 75% (94/126), with anti-D 37% (19/52) and with dexamethasone 60% (25/42) patients. Eighteen treated patients (6%) entered sustained remission after treatment with various drugs. Twenty-six patients underwent splenectomy (Splx) resulting in sustained remission in 15 cases (60%). Only two patients remained refractory to Splx and to all used drugs. Discussion None of the currently available drugs used in the treatment of ITP are invariably safe and effective. Responses, the duration of response, intolerability, and the course of disease are unpredictable. Although the treatment of ITP has considerably improved in the recent years, the currently available drugs may rarely cure affected patients. The need for safe and effective therapy in ITP is evident. Optimal treatment decisions for each patient remains a challenge in many cases."
https://openalex.org/W2806084354,"Anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder are highly comorbid, yet identifying neural dysfunction driving comorbidity has been challenging. Lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) dysfunction has been independently observed in each disorder. Here we tested the hypothesis that the lOFC is essential to partition mechanisms for fear regulation and alcohol consumption. Specifically, the capacity to regulate fear and the propensity to consume alcohol are unrelated when lOFC is intact, but become linked through lOFC dysfunction. Male Long Evans rats received bilateral, neurotoxic lOFC lesions or sham surgery. Fear regulation was determined by establishing discrimination to danger, uncertainty, and safety cues then shifting the shock probability of the uncertainty cue. Alcohol consumption was assessed through voluntary, intermittent access to 20% ethanol. The neurotoxic lesion approach ensured lOFC dysfunction spanned testing in fear regulation and alcohol consumption. LOFC-lesioned rats demonstrated maladaptive fear generalization during probability shifts, inverting normal prediction error assignment, and subsequently consumed more alcohol. Most novel, fear regulation and alcohol consumption were inextricably linked only in lOFC-lesioned rats: extreme fear regulation predicted excessive alcohol consumption. The results reveal the lOFC is essential to partition mechanisms for fear regulation and alcohol consumption and uncover a plausible source of neural dysfunction contributing to comorbid anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2807226956,"Positive interventions have shown promise for fostering hedonic (happiness) and eudaimonic (flourishing) well-being. However, few studies have focused on positive interventions that target hope as a means of increasing well-being, and none have examined the use of smartphone app-based systems for delivering interventions in the moments and contexts of daily life—an approach called ecological momentary intervention (EMI). We conducted a quasi-experimental pilot study using a pretest and posttest design to examine the feasibility and potential impact of a mobile app-based hope EMI. Participants appeared to engage with the intervention and found the experience to be user-friendly, helpful, and enjoyable. Relative to the control group, those receiving the intervention demonstrated significantly greater increases in hope; however, there were no between-group differences in hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The authors recommend future research to examine the potential of EMI mobile apps to cultivate hope and promote flourishing."
https://openalex.org/W2805870756,"Prior research has established the Gait Variability Index (GVI) as a composite measure of gait variability, based on spatiotemporal parameters, that is associated with functional outcomes. However, under certain circumstances the magnitude and directional specificity of the GVI is adversely affected by shortcomings in the calculation method. Here we present an enhanced gait variability index (EGVI) that addresses those shortcomings and improves the utility of the measure. The EGVI was further enhanced by removing some input spatiotemporal variables that captured overlapping/redundant information. The EGVI was used to reanalyze data from four previously published studies that used the original GVI. After removing data affected by the GVI’s prior shortcomings, the association between EGVI and GVI values was stronger for the pooled dataset (r2 = 0.95) and for the individual studies (r2 = 0.88–0.98). The EGVI also revealed stronger associations between the index value and functional outcomes for some studies. The EGVI successfully addresses shortcomings in the GVI calculation that affected magnitude and directional specificity of the index. We have confirmed the validity of prior published work that used the original GVI, while also demonstrating even stronger results when these prior data were re-analyzed with the EGVI. We recommend that future research should use the EGVI as a composite measure of gait variability."
https://openalex.org/W2806730319,"Background The disparity in the number of urban and rural physicians is a social problem in Japan. There may also be a disparity in the age of physicians. This study longitudinally examines both geographic and age distributions of physicians. Methods Individual data from the Survey of Physicians, Dentists and Pharmacists in 1994, 2004 and 2014 and municipality data from the National Population Census were used. The 2015 municipality border was applied to all years, and all municipalities were classified into equal-size quintiles based on population density. Both municipalities and physicians were longitudinally observed. Results Between 1994 and 2014, the number of physicians per 100,000 population increased by 31.8% in the most urban group of municipalities and 17.4% in the most rural group. The average age of physicians was highest in the most rural and lowest in the most urban group. The difference in average age between the urban and rural physicians widened from 2.1 years in 1994 to 6.0 years in 2014. This disparity is particularly pronounced among hospital physicians (from 1.5 years in 1994 to 7.6 years in 2014). In the most rural group, the number of hospital physicians younger than 40 years old has decreased by 59.4%, while the number of those 55–70 has grown by 153% and the number older than 70 years old by 41.0%. Between 1994 and 2004, only 23.0% of hospital physicians younger than 40 years old were retained in the most rural group; the retention rate fell to 19.3% between 2004 and 2014, while the rates increased in older physicians. Conclusions The uneven distribution of physicians is increasing in Japan, as is the aging of rural hospital physicians. Shortage of physicians in rural areas may be more serious than that shown as their headcount."

In the present study, a fungus which can induce agarwood formation efficiently was isolated and a suitable method for its application to induce agarwood formation was developed. Rigidoporus vinctus was isolated from the inner layers from infectious A. sinensis trees. When the fermentation liquid of fungi inoculated back to A. sinensis tree, agarwood was found to be induced. In addition, a novel method called trunk surface agarwood-inducing technique (Agar-Sit) was developed to produce agarwood with R. vinctus. The alcohol soluble extract content of the agarwood, up to 38.9%, far higher than the requirement (10%) in Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the six characteristic compounds of agarwood used as Chinese Medicinal Materials were all detected. Their relative percentages of the sesquiterpenes in the essential oil were 22.76%. This is the first report of the Agar-Sit and also the application of R. vinctus in agarwood induction. According to the results, when the combination of Agar-Sit and R. vinctus is used agarwood can be induced with high yield and good quality."
https://openalex.org/W2806653355,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global health and human rights problem. In Tanzania, national studies have shown that half of all women experience partner violence in their lifetime, 38% reported being abused during a period of 12 months and 30% during pregnancy. Despite the benefits of social support to women victims of violence during pregnancy, a majority of women hesitate to seek help and, if they do, they mainly turn to their natal relatives for support. However, this process of help-seeking and the type of support received is not well documented and needs to be explored with a view to future interventions. This article investigates women's own perspectives on the support they receive from natal relatives when experiencing IPV during pregnancy.Eighteen participants who experienced physical IPV during pregnancy were purposively selected from a cohort of 1,116 pregnant women enrolled in a project that aimed at assessing the impact of intimate partner violence on reproductive health. In-depth interviews were used to explore the social support received from the natal family among women who experienced partner violence during pregnancy. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed.Women who experienced severe IPV during pregnancy were more likely to seek help from natal relatives. Severe violence was defined by the women as acts that occurred frequently and/or resulted in injury. The women's natal relatives were willing to provide the support; however, they strongly encouraged women to maintain their marriage so that they could continue caring for their children jointly with their partners. Emotional support was the commonest form of support and included showing love and empathy and praying. Information provided to victims aimed mainly at advising them to maintain their marriage. Practical support included direct financial support and building their economic base to reduce dependency on their partners. When the couple was on the verge of separation, mediation was provided to save the marriage.Women who experienced partner violence preferred to seek help from their natal relatives. The support provided by natal relatives was beneficial; however, maintaining the marriage for the care of children and family was given the highest priority, over separation. As a consequence, many women continued to live with violence. Stakeholders supporting victims of violence need to understand the priorities of victims of violence and structure intervention to address their needs."
https://openalex.org/W2807075416,"Patients aged over 90 are being admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with increasing frequency. The appropriateness of such decisions still remains controversial due to questionable outcome, limited resources and costs. Our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and outcome in elderly patients (≥ 90 years) admitted in a medical ICU, with an additional focus on medico-economic implications.We reviewed the charts of all patients (≥ 90 years) admitted to our ICU. We compared them with all other ICU patients (< 90 years), sought to identify ICU mortality predictors and also performed a long-term survival follow-up.In the study group of 317 stays: median age was 92 years (IQR: 91-94 years); most patients were female (71.3%.). Acute respiratory failure (52.4%) was the main admission diagnosis; mean SAPS II was 55.6±21.3; half the stays (49.2%) required mechanical ventilation (duration: 7.2±8.8 days); withholding and withdrawing decisions were made for 33.4% of all stays. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 35.7% and 42.6% respectively. Mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.83, CI95%: 1.59-15.82) was an independent predictor of ICU mortality whereas age was not (OR = 0.88, CI95%: 0.72-1.08). Social security reimbursement was significantly lower in the study group compared with all other ICU stays, both per stay (13,160 vs 22,092 Euros, p< 0.01) and per day of stay (p = 0.03).Among critically ill elderly patients (≥ 90 years), chronological age was not an independent factor of ICU mortality. ICU care-related costs in this population should not be considered as a limiting factor for ICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W2805334697,"Autopsy studies reveal that atherosclerosis lesions can be found as early as two years of age. To slow the development of this early pathology, obesity and dyslipidemia prevention should start from childhood making it urgent to explore new ways to evaluate dyslipidemia risk in children that can be applied widely, such as the non-invasive anthropometric evaluation.Assess the metabolic profile of a pediatric population at a specific age to describe the association between anthropometric and biochemical cardiovascular disease risk factors; and evaluate selected anthropometric variables as potential predictors for dyslipidemic cardiovascular risk.Anthropometric features, bioimpedance parameters and fasting clinical profile were assessed in Lisbon and the Tagus Valley region pre-pubertal nine-year-old children (n = 1.496) from 2009-2013 in a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Anthropometric variables predictive power was evaluated through regression analysis.At least one abnormal lipid parameter was found in 65% of ""normal weight"", 73% of ""overweight"" and 81% of ""obese"" children according to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) standards. Dyslipidemia was present in 67.8% of children. Waist-hip ratio (WHR) explained 0.4% of total cholesterol (TC) variance. Waist circumference (WC) explained 2.8% of apolipoprotein (APO) A1 variance. Waist-circumference-to-height-ratio (WHtR) explained 2.7%, 2.8% and 1.9% of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), APO B, and N_HDL-c variance, respectively. Children with abnormally high WHR levels had an increase in risk of 4.49, 3.40 and 5.30 times, respectively, for developing cardiovascular disease risk factors measured as high-risk levels of TC, LDL-c and non-HDL-c (N_HDL-c) (p<0.05). Only 29.9% of ""normal weight"" children had no anthropometric, bioimpedance or biochemical parameters associated with CV risk.A large proportion of school age children have at least one lipid profile abnormality. BMI, zBMI, calf circumference (CC), hip circumference (HC), WC, and WHR are directly associated with dyslipidemia, whereas HC and calf circumference (CC) adjusted to WC, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), are all inversely associated with dyslipidemia. Selected anthropometric variables are likely to help predict increased odds of having CV risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2807183817,"Connexin43 (Cx43) is the predominant testicular gap junction protein and in cases of impaired spermatogenesis, Cx43 expression has been shown to be altered in several mammals. Amongst other functions, Cx43 is supposed to regulate junction formation of the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern of different tight junction (TJ) proteins of the murine BTB using SC-specific Cx43 knockout mice (SCCx43KO). Adult homozygous male SCCx43KO mice (SCCx43KO-/-) predominantly show an arrest of spermatogenesis and SC-only tubules that might have been caused by an altered BTB assembly, composition or regulation. TJ molecules claudin-3, -5 and -11 were examined in adult wild type (WT) and SCCx43KO-/- mice using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In this context, investigation of single tubules with residual spermatogenesis in SCCx43KO-/- mice was particularly interesting to identify a potential Cx43-independent influence of germ cells (GC) on BTB composition and dynamics. In tubules without residual spermatogenesis, a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution pattern for claudin-11 protein could be demonstrated in mutant mice. Nevertheless, claudin-11 seems to form functional TJ. Claudin-3 and -5 could not be detected immunohistochemically in the seminiferous epithelium of those tubules. Correspondingly, claudin-3 and -5 mRNA expression was decreased, providing evidence of generally impaired BTB dynamics in adult KO mice. Observations of tubules with residual spermatogenesis suggested a Cx43-independent regulation of TJ proteins by GC populations. To determine initial BTB formation in peripubertal SCCx43KO-/- mice, immunohistochemical staining and qRT-PCR of claudin-11 were carried out in adolescent SCCx43KO-/- and WT mice. Additionally, BTB integrity was functionally analysed using a hypertonic glucose fixative. These analyses revealed that SCCx43KO-/- mice formed an intact BTB during puberty in the same time period as WT mice, which however seemed to be accelerated."
https://openalex.org/W2806289687,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide (PACAP-38) is a common neuropeptide exerting a wide spectrum of functions in many fields, including immunology. In the present study, 5-day post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae of three diverse genetic lines [transgenic lines Tg(MPX:GFP) with GFP-labelled neutrophils and Tg(pou4f3:GAP-GFP) with GFP-labelled hair cells and the wild-type Tuebingen] were used to investigate an inhibitory role of PACAP-38 in inflammation associated with damaged hair cells of the lateral line. Individuals of each genetic line were assigned to four groups: (1) control, and those consisting of larvae exposed to (2) 10 µM CuSO4, (3) 10 µM CuSO4+100 nM PACAP-38 and (4) 100 nM PACAP-38, respectively. Forty-minute exposure to CuSO4 solution was applied to evoke necrosis of hair cells and consequent inflammation. The inhibitory role of PACAP-38 was investigated in vivo under a confocal microscope by counting neutrophils migrating towards damaged hair cells in Tg(MPX:GFP) larvae. In CuSO4-treated individuals, the number of neutrophils associated with hair cells was dramatically increased, while PACAP-38 co-treatment resulted in its over 2-fold decrease. However, co-treatment with PACAP-38 did not prevent hair cells from extensive necrosis, which was found in Tg(pou4f3:GAP-GFP) individuals. Real-Time PCR analysis performed in wild-type larvae demonstrated differential expression pattern of stress and inflammation inducible markers. The most significant findings showed that CuSO4 exposure up-regulated the expression of IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6 and ATF3, while after PACAP-38 co-treatment expression levels of these genes were significantly decreased. The presence of transcripts for all PACAP receptors in neutrophils was also revealed. Adcyap1r1a and vipr1b appeared to be predominant forms. The present results suggest that PACAP-38 should be considered as a factor playing an important regulatory role in inflammatory response associated with pathological processes affecting zebrafish hair cells and it cannot be excluded that this interesting property has more universal significance."

This study aims to test whether polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with cognitive function and physical health in the UK Biobank, a cohort of healthy individuals. Group-based analyses were then performed to compare the top and bottom 10% for the three neurodegenerative polygenic risk scores; these groups were compared on the cognitive and physical health variables. Higher polygenic risk for AD, ALS, and FTD was associated with lower cognitive performance. Higher polygenic risk for FTD was also associated with increased forced expiratory volume in 1s and peak expiratory flow. A significant group difference was observed on the symbol digit substitution task between individuals with high polygenic risk for FTD and high polygenic risk for ALS. The results suggest some overlap between polygenic risk for neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive function and physical health."
https://openalex.org/W2805779760,"Background The psychological care of abused children in the child protection system is an urgent issue in Japan. Child abuse has a serious impact on children’s emotion and behavior, but there is virtually no evidence about how child abuse affects sleep, which is closely related to behavioral and emotional control. In this study, we sought to identify sleep habits and suspected sleep disorders among abused children and adolescents admitted to residential care facilities in Japan and to investigate their association with emotional and behavioral problems. Methods The study targeted 273 abused children and adolescents (age range: 4 to 15 years) who had been admitted to a residential care facility in Japan. They were assessed by physicians and other personnel at facilities with expertise in childcare and abuse. Respondents completed a brief sleep questionnaire on the incidence of problematic sleep habits and suspected sleep disorders as well as a questionnaire on emotional and behavioral issues. Results Approximately 40% of the abused children and adolescents had some sleep-related symptoms at bedtime and waking, and 19% had suspected sleep disorder. Abused children with emotional and behavioral problems had a significantly higher incidence of suspected sleep disorders than abused children without such problems, and this incidence was particularly high among those with antisocial behavior and depressive behavior. Our predictive model also showed that antisocial behavior and depressive behavior were significant predictors of suspected sleep disorders. Conclusion Careful assessment and appropriate therapeutic intervention for sleep disorders are required in abused children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral problems."
https://openalex.org/W2806967055,"Introduction The pro-inflammatory status of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients promotes pulmonary colonization with opportunist and pathogenic bacteria, which is favored by a sticky mucus. Oral supplementation with (n-3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) has shown anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the positive effects of a long-term diet enriched in (n-3) LC-PUFA on the lungs of Cftr F508del mice. Materials and methods Breeding CftrΔF508del/+ mice received a control diet or a diet enriched in (n-3) LC-PUFA for 5 weeks before mating, gestation and lactation. After weaning, the offspring were given the same diet as their mother until post-natal day 60. The effects of (n-3) LC-PUFA supplementation on the lungs were evaluated in homozygous Cftr F508del mice and their wild-type littermates after acute lung inflammation induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation. Results (n-3) LC-PUFA enrichment of mothers contributes to enrichment of mammary milk and cell membrane of suckling pups. Cftr F508del mice exhibited growth retardation and lung damage with collapsed alveoli, hyperplasia of bronchial epithelial cells and inflammatory cell infiltration. The (n-3) LC-PUFA diet corrected the growth delay of Cftr F508del mice and decreased hyperplasia of bronchial epithelial cells. Besides decreasing metaplasia of Club cells after LPS inhalation, (n-3) LC-PUFA modulated lung inflammation and restricted lung damage. Conclusion Long-term (n-3) LC-PUFA supplementation shows moderate benefits to the lungs of Cftr F508del mice."
https://openalex.org/W2806970509,"Objective Bariatric surgery is considered the most efficient treatment for morbid obesity and its related diseases. However, its role as a metabolic modifier is not well understood. We aimed to determine biosignatures of response to bariatric surgery and elucidate short-term metabolic adaptations. Methods We used a LC- and FIA-ESI-MS/MS approach to quantify acylcarnitines, (lyso)phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, amino acids, biogenic amines and hexoses in serum samples of subjects with morbid obesity (n = 39) before and 1, 3 and 6 months after bariatric surgery. K-means cluster analysis allowed to distinguish metabotypes of response to bariatric surgery. Results For the first time, global metabolic changes following bariatric surgery independent of the baseline health status of the subjects have been revealed. We identify two metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) at the interval 6 months-baseline after surgery, which presented differences in the levels of compounds of urea metabolism, gluconeogenic precursors and (lyso)phospholipid particles. Clinically, metabotypes were different in terms of the degree of improvement in insulin resistance, cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins and uric acid independent of the magnitude of weight loss. Conclusions This study opens new perspectives and new hypotheses on the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery and understanding of the biology of obesity and its associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2806576407,"There is concern about excessive bleeding when low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in renal dysfunction. Our objective was to evaluate whether LMWH VTE prophylaxis was safe and effective in critically ill patients with renal dysfunction by conducting a subgroup analysis of PROTECT, a randomized blinded trial.We studied intensive care unit (ICU) patients with pre-ICU dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD; pre-specified subgroup; n = 118), or severe renal dysfunction at ICU admission (defined as ESRD or non-dialysis dependent with creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 ml/min; post hoc subgroup; n = 590). We compared dalteparin, 5000 IU daily, with unfractionated heparin (UFH), 5000 IU twice daily, and considered outcomes of proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT); pulmonary embolism (PE); any VTE; and major bleeding. Adjusted hazard ratios [HR] were calculated using Cox regression.In patients with ESRD, there was no significant difference in DVT (8.3% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.76), any VTE (10.0% vs. 6.9%; p = 0.39) or major bleeding (5.0% vs. 8.6%; p = 0.32) between UFH and dalteparin. In patients with severe renal dysfunction, there was no significant difference in any VTE (10.0% vs. 6.4%; p = 0.07) or major bleeding (8.9% vs. 11.0%; p = 0.66) but an increase in DVT with dalteparin (7.6% vs. 3.7%; p = 0.04). Interaction p-values for comparisons of HRs (ESRD versus not) were non-significant.In critically ill patients with ESRD, or severe renal dysfunction, there was no significant difference in any VTE or major bleeding between UFH and dalteparin. Patients with severe renal dysfunction who received dalteparin had more proximal DVTs than those on UFH; this finding did not hold in patients with ESRD alone."

https://openalex.org/W2806168473,"To investigate the prevalence of shoulder-related acute and overuse injuries in triathletes and examine the role of possible risk factors, in order to identify potential preventive measures.We performed a retrospective epidemiologic study of 193 amateur triathletes between June and August 2013 and evaluated their competition and training habits, as well as the presence of acute and overuse injuries of the shoulder sustained during the past 12 months. Contingency tables were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared test. Normally distributed data were compared with the independent samples t-test, while non-parametric analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Binary logistic regression was used to identify important predictors of injuries.12 participants (6%) sustained acute injuries and 36 athletes experienced an overuse injury. The acute injury rate amounted to 0.11 per 1000 hours of training and the overuse injury rate to 0.33 per 1000 hours of training. There was no association between athletes' age, height, weight, BMI, a history of shoulder complaints or triathlon experience in years and acute or overuse injuries. Male athletes had a trend for sustaining more acute injuries then female athletes (8% vs. 2%, p = 0.079). Athletes with acute injuries spent a significantly higher amount of time per week doing weight training (p = 0.007) and had a trend for a higher weekly duration of cycling training (p = 0.088). Athletes with overuse injuries participated in a significantly higher number of races compared to athletes without overuse injuries (p = 0.005). The regular use of paddles was associated with a significantly higher rate of overuse injuries (24% vs. 10%, p = 0.014).The regular use of paddles during swimming training appears to be a risk factor for the development of overuse injuries, while an increased duration of weight and cycling training seems to be associated with a higher rate of acute injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2806308769,"The eggs of the freshwater Pomacea apple snails develop above the water level, exposed to varied physical and biological stressors. Their high hatching success seems to be linked to their proteins or perivitellins, which surround the developing embryo providing nutrients, sunscreens and varied defenses. The defensive mechanism has been unveiled in P. canaliculata and P. maculata eggs, where their major perivitellins are pigmented, non-digestible and provide a warning coloration while another perivitellin acts as a toxin. In P. scalaris, a species sympatric to the former, the defense strategy seems different, since no toxin was found and the major perivitellin, PsSC, while also colored and non-digestible, is a carbohydrate-binding protein. In this study we examine the structure and function of PsSC by sequencing its subunits, characterizing its carbohydrate binding profile and evaluating its effect on gut cells. Whereas cDNA sequencing and database search showed no lectin domain, glycan array carbohydrate binding profile revealed a strong specificity for glycosphingolipids and ABO group antigens. Moreover, PsSC agglutinated bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. Inspired on the defensive properties of seed lectins we evaluated the effects of PsSC on intestinal cells both in vitro (Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells) and in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. PsSC binds to Caco-2 cell membranes without reducing its viability, while a PsSC-containing diet temporarily induces large epithelium alterations and an increased absorptive surface. Based on these results, we propose that PsSC is involved in embryo defenses by altering the gut morphophysiology of potential predators, a convergent role to plant defensive lectins."
https://openalex.org/W2806020994,"Surgical sterilization programs for dogs have been proposed as interventions to control dog population size. Models can be used to help identify the long-term impact of reproduction control interventions for dogs. The objective of this study was to determine the projected impact of surgical sterilization interventions on the owned dog population size in Villa de Tezontepec, Hidalgo, Mexico. A stochastic, individual-based simulation model was constructed and parameterized using a combination of empirical data collected on the demographics of owned dogs in Villa de Tezontepec and data available from the peer-reviewed literature. Model outcomes were assessed using a 20-year time horizon. The model was used to examine: the effect of surgical sterilization strategies focused on: 1) dogs of any age and sex, 2) female dogs of any age, 3) young dogs (i.e., not yet reached sexual maturity) of any sex, and 4) young, female dogs. Model outcomes suggested that as surgical capacity increases from 21 to 84 surgeries/month, (8.6% to 34.5% annual sterilization) for dogs of any age, the mean dog population size after 20 years was reduced between 14% and 79% compared to the base case scenario (i.e. in the absence of intervention). Surgical sterilization interventions focused only on young dogs of any sex yielded greater reductions (81% - 90%) in the mean population size, depending on the level of surgical capacity. More focused sterilization targeted at female dogs of any age, resulted in reductions that were similar to focusing on mixed sex sterilization of only young dogs (82% - 92%). The greatest mean reduction in population size (90% - 91%) was associated with sterilization of only young, female dogs. Our model suggests that targeting sterilization to young females could enhance the efficacy of existing surgical dog population control interventions in this location, without investing extra resources."
https://openalex.org/W2806634685,"Eye tracking is one of the most widely used technique for assessment, screening and human-machine interaction related applications. There are certain issues which limit the usage of eye trackers in practical scenarios, viz., i) need to perform multiple calibrations and ii) presence of inherent noise in the recorded data. To address these issues, we have proposed a protocol for one-time calibration against the ""regular"" or the ""multiple"" calibration phases. It is seen that though it is always desirable to perform multiple calibration, the one-time calibration also produces comparable results and might be better for individuals who are not able to perform multiple calibrations. In that case, ""One-time calibration"" can also be done by a participant and the calibration results are used for the rest of the participants, provided the chin rest and the eye tracker positions are unaltered. The second major issue is the presence of the inherent noise in the raw gaze data, leading to systematic and variable errors. We have proposed a signal processing chain to remove these two types of errors. Two different psychological stimuli-based tasks, namely, recall-recognition test and number gazing task are used as a case study for the same. It is seen that the proposed approach gives satisfactory results even with one-time calibration. The study is also extended to test the effect of long duration task on the performance of the proposed algorithm and the results confirm that the proposed methods work well in such scenarios too."
https://openalex.org/W2805577699,"The present study conducted in Japan aimed to clarify the relationship between violence directed towards parents by patients with schizophrenia and parents’ risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Questionnaire data from 353 parents were analyzed. In total, 84 of the 353 parents (23.8%) reported the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score ≥ 25 (high-IES-R), indicative of a high risk of developing PTSD. The rate of high-IES-R scores was significantly higher among parents who had experienced an act of violence that was likely to result in severe injury by their adult child with schizophrenia (OR = 2.03; 95% CI 1.09–3.80; using “never experienced” as a reference) and in parents of patients who were hospitalized at the time of the survey (OR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.01–6.06; using “regularly visited a psychiatrist” as a reference). Therefore, parents experiencing violence by their adult child with schizophrenia are at a risk of developing PTSD. Parents of patients with schizophrenia, who are at a high risk of PTSD, are not usually provided the required support in Japan. To prevent violence and provide support for family members who may develop PTSD, it is necessary to establish crisis intervention programs, especially given the current emphasis on deinstitutionalization policy in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2807001899,"Introduction Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has become one of the greatest threats worldwide to the therapeutic management of infections. Our previous research confirmed an in vitro synergistic effect of amlodipine and imipenem against A. baumannii, and this study is designed to understand its mechanism. Methods Sixty-four non-duplicate A. baumannii isolates were collected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk diffusion method. PCR amplification and sequencing were used to identify the presence of the adeB, adeE, adeH, adeJ, abeM and abeS efflux pump genes. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, imipenem+amlodipine and imipenem+carbonyl cyanide m–chlorophenyl-hydrazone against these isolates were also determined by the broth microdilution method before and after siRNA silencing of the expression of the adeABC efflux pump. Results In this study, the combination of amlodipine with imipenem showed synergistic antimicrobial activity against sixty-four A. baumannii isolates when compared with the activity of imipenem alone (p<0.025). In the multidrug-resistant group, AML was more effective than carbonyl cyanide m–chlorophenyl-hydrazone (p<0.001). The efflux pump genes adeB, adeE, adeH, adeJ, abeM and abeS were detected in 100% (4/64), 75% (48/64), 0% (0/64), 100% (64/64), 96.9% (62/64) and 96.9% (62/64) of the sixty-four A. baumannii isolates, respectively. The expression of the adeABC efflux pump genes in the multidrug-resistant group (5.05±19.25) is clearly higher than in the non-multidrug-resistant group (0.17±0.20), (p = 0.01). A gene silencing test verified that the mRNA expression levels of adeABC were decreased at 12 h and increased at 24 h, while the reversal of imipenem resistance by amlodipine disappeared at 12 h and reappeared at 24 h. Conclusions The combination of amlodipine with imipenem exhibits an in vitro synergistic antimicrobial effect on multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, which may be due to the inhibition of the AdeABC efflux pump."
https://openalex.org/W2806604798,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the human porphyrias, arises from a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with PCT. While these observations implicate HCV infection as a risk factor for PCT pathogenesis, the mechanism of interaction between the virus and porphyrin metabolism is unknown. This study aimed to assess the effect of HCV core protein on intracellular porphyrin metabolism to elucidate the link between HCV infection and PCT. The accumulation and excretion of porphyrins after treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, a porphyrin precursor, were compared between cells stably expressing HCV core protein and controls. Cells expressing HCV core protein had lower amounts of intracellular protoporphyrin IX and heme and had higher amounts of excreted coproporphyrin III, the oxidized form of coproporphyrinogen III, compared with controls. These observations suggest that HCV core protein affects porphyrin metabolism and facilitates the export of excess coproporphyrinogen III and/or coproporphyrin III, possibly via porphyrin transporters. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the presence of HCV core protein increased the mRNA expression of porphyrin exporters ABCG2 and FLVCR1. Western blot analysis showed a higher expression level of FLVCR1, but not ABCG2, as well as a higher expression level of mature ALAS1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway, in HCV core protein-expressing cells compared with controls. The data indicate that HCV core protein induced abnormal intracellular porphyrin metabolism, with an over-excretion of coproporphyrin III. These findings may partially account for the susceptibility of HCV-infected individuals to PCT development."

The aim of this study is to verify whether there are significant differences in wound healing between patients with and without systemic diseases, who underwent hallux valgus correction with Scarf osteotomy. A total of 155 consecutive patients were included into this prospective study. All of the patients underwent Scarf osteotomy for hallux valgus correction. In 60,6% of patients comorbidities were present, most often hypertension (57 patients, 36,8%), hypothyroidism (19 patients 12,3%) and diabetes (7 patients, 4,5%) occurred. Most of the patients were women (96,1%). During the study complication rate was noted. Patients underwent follow-up: 1,2, 3, 6 and 12 weeks and 6 months after the surgery. Preoperatively and during the last visit treatment results were assessed with AOFAS HMI scale. Scar assessment was performed by independent observer with VAS followed by patient scar assessment with VSS. In 30 patients complications were noted (19,4%). Surgical site infection was found in 6 patients (3,9%). In 13 patients (8,4%) partial wound dehiscence occurred, in 5 of them (3,2%) additional skin closure (Steri-Strips) was applied. Treatment results assessed with AOFAS HMI scale were good and very good in both healthy and comorbidity group, and the results improved significantly after surgical procedure. Scar assessment with VAS was on the average 1,5 pts. Average result in VSS was 2 pts. Results in both scales were rated as very good. No statistically significant differences were found in both healthy and comorbidity group in scar assessment.

Pcmt1 knockout mice exhibit a profound neuropathology and die 30–60 days postnatal from an epileptic seizure. Here we characterize four new SNP variants of human PIMT with respect to enzymatic activity, thermal stability, and propensity to aggregation. Under standard assay conditions, L191S, A150V, P174H and A65V showed activity losses of 72%, 64%, 61%, and 11% respectively. By differential scanning fluorimetry, melting temperature deviations were -5.2, -4.5, +0.5, and -3.4°C. SDS-PAGE of purified protein reveal significant aggregation of L191S, A150V, and P174H, but not A65V. We also report new data on three unusual PIMT variants among the 13 recently characterized by our laboratory. A7P and I58V were previously found to have 1.8–2.0 times the activity of WT PIMT in the standard assay; however, upon kinetic analysis, we find both variants exhibit reduced catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) due to weak isoaspartyl substrate binding. The near complete loss of activity (<1%) seen in R36C was investigated by comparing activity of two artificial variants. R36K shows 4.6X the activity of R36C, while R36A shows no improvement, suggesting the guanidino nitrogens of the R36 play a key role in binding the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). The new findings reported here extend the list of human PIMT variants that may contribute to neurological diseases in the young and the decline of CNS function in the aged."
https://openalex.org/W2806562513,"Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/CCdh1 inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/CCdh1 bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/CCdh1 and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/CCdh1 bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/CCdh1. Our study builds a coherent framework and generates hypotheses that can be further explored by experiments."

Due to differences in mass and material properties, the style and material of a catcher mask influences the impact metrics observed during simulated foul ball impacts. The catcher surrogate was a Hybrid III head and neck equipped with a six degree of freedom sensor package to obtain linear accelerations and angular rates. Four mask styles were impacted using an air cannon for six 30 m/s and six 35 m/s impacts to the nasion. To quantify impact severity, the metrics peak linear acceleration, peak angular acceleration, Head Injury Criterion, Head Impact Power, and Gadd Severity Index were used. An Analysis of Covariance and a Tukey's HSD Test were conducted to compare the least squares mean between masks for each head injury metric. For each injury metric a P-Value less than 0.05 was found indicating a significant difference in mask performance. Tukey's HSD test found for each metric, the traditional style titanium mask fell in the lowest performance category while the hockey style mask was in the highest performance category. Limitations of this study prevented a direct correlation from mask testing performance to mild traumatic brain injury."
https://openalex.org/W2806393027,"In this study we investigated effects of the APOE ε4 allele (which confers an enhanced risk of poorer cognitive ageing, and Alzheimer's Disease) on sustained attention (vigilance) performance in young adults using the Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task and event-related fMRI. Previous fMRI work with this task has used block designs: this study is the first to image an extended (6-minute) RVIP task. Participants were 26 carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, and 26 non carriers (aged 18-28). Pupil diameter was measured throughout, as an index of cognitive effort. We compared activity to RVIP task hits to hits on a control task (with similar visual parameters and response requirements but no working memory load): this contrast showed activity in medial frontal, inferior and superior parietal, temporal and visual cortices, consistent with previous work, demonstrating that meaningful neural data can be extracted from the RVIP task over an extended interval and using an event-related design. Behavioural performance was not affected by genotype; however, a genotype by condition (experimental task/control task) interaction on pupil diameter suggested that ε4 carriers deployed more effort to the experimental compared to the control task. fMRI results showed a condition by genotype interaction in the right hippocampal formation: only ε4 carriers showed downregulation of this region to experimental task hits versus control task hits. Experimental task beta values were correlated against hit rate: parietal correlations were seen in ε4 carriers only, frontal correlations in non-carriers only. The data indicate that, in the absence of behavioural differences, young adult ε4 carriers already show a different linkage between functional brain activity and behaviour, as well as aberrant hippocampal recruitment patterns. This may have relevance for genotype differences in cognitive ageing trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2807321979,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have enabled numerous basic research discoveries and therapeutic approaches for many protein classes. However, there still exist a number of target classes, such as multi-pass membrane proteins, for which antibody discovery is difficult, due in part to lack of high quality, recombinant protein. Here we describe the impact of several parameters on antigen expression and the development of mAbs against human claudin 4 (CLDN4), a potential multi-indication cancer target. Using gene gun-based DNA delivery and bioluminescence imaging, we optimize promoter type by comparing expression profiles of four robust in vivo promoters. In addition, we observe that most vectors rapidly lose expression, ultimately reaching almost background levels by three days post-delivery. Recognizing this limitation, we next explored skin pretreatment strategies as an orthogonal method to further boost the efficiency of mAb generation. We show that SDS pretreatment can boost antigen expression, but fails to significantly increase mAb discovery efficiency. In contrast, we find that sandpaper pretreatment yields 5-fold more FACS+ anti-CLDN4 hybridomas, without impacting antigen expression. Our findings coupled with other strategies to improve DNA immunizations should improve the success of mAb discovery against other challenging targets and enable the generation of critical research tools and therapeutic candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2805392635,"Previous research on statement analysis has mainly concerned accounts by witnesses and plaintiffs. In our studies we examined true and false statements as told by offenders. It was hypothesized that SVA and MASAM techniques would enhance the ability to discriminate between true and false offenders' statements. Truthful and deceptive statements (confessions and denials) were collected from Swedish and Polish criminal case files. In Experiment 1, Swedish law students (N = 39) were asked to assess the veracity of statements either after training in and usage of MASAM or without any training and using their own judgements. In Experiment 2, Polish psychology students (N = 34) assessed veracity after training in and usage of either MASAM or SVA or without prior training using their own judgements. The veracity assessments of participants who used MASAM and SVA were significantly more correct than the assessments of participants that used their own judgements. Results show, that trained coders are much better at distinguishing between truths and lies than lay evaluators. There were significant difference between total scores of truthful and false statements for both total SVA and MASAM and it can be concluded that both veracity assessment techniques are useful in assessing veracity. It was also found, that the content criteria most strongly associated with correct assessments were: logical structure, contextual embedding, self-depreciation, volume of statement, contextual setting and descriptions of relations. The results are discussed in relation to statement analysis of offenders' accounts."
https://openalex.org/W2806366251,"Background Several technical hurdles and limitations have restricted the use of IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS6110 RFLP), the most effective typing method for detecting recent tuberculosis (TB) transmission events. This has prompted us to conceive an alternative modality, IS6110-5’3’FP, a plasmid-based cloning approach coupled to a single PCR amplification of differentially labeled 5’ and 3’ IS6110 polymorphic ends and their automated fractionation on a capillary sequencer. The potential of IS6110-5’3’FP to be used as an alternative to IS6110 RFLP has been previously demonstrated, yet further technical improvements are still required for optimal discriminatory power and versatility. Objectives Here we introduced critical amendments to the original IS6110-5’3’FP protocol and compared its performance to that of 24-loci multiple interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR), the current standard method for TB transmission analyses. Methods IS6110-5’3’FP protocol modifications involved: (i) the generation of smaller-sized polymorphic fragments for efficient cloning and PCR amplification, (ii) omission of the plasmid amplification step in E. coli for shorter turnaround times, (iii) the use of more stable fluorophores for increased sensitivity, (iv) automated subtraction of background fluorescent signals, and (v) the automated conversion of fluorescent peaks into binary data. Results In doing so, the overall turnaround time of IS6110-5’3’FP was reduced to 4 hours. The new protocol allowed detecting almost all 5’ and 3’ IS6110 polymorphic fragments of any given strain, including IS6110 high-copy number Beijing strains. IS6110-5’3’FP proved much more discriminative than 24-loci MIRU-VNTR, particularly with strains of the M. tuberculosis lineage 4. Conclusions The IS6110-5’3’FP protocol described herein reached the optimal discriminatory potential of IS6110 fingerprinting and proved more accurate than 24-loci MIRU-VNTR in estimating recent TB transmission. The method, which is highly cost-effective, was rendered versatile enough to prompt its evaluation as an automatized solution for a TB integrated molecular surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2952225502,"Living cells are highly complex systems comprising a multitude of elements that are engaged in the many convoluted processes observed during the cell cycle. However, not all elements and processes are essential for cell survival and reproduction under steady-state environmental conditions. To distinguish between essential from expendable cell components and thus define the ‘minimal cell’ and the corresponding ‘minimal genome’, we postulate that the synthesis of all cell elements can be represented as a finite set of binary operators, and within this framework we show that cell elements that depend on their previous existence to be synthesized are those that are essential for cell survival. An algorithm to distinguish essential cell elements is presented and demonstrated within an interactome. Data and functions implementing the algorithm are given as supporting information. We expect that this algorithmic approach will lead to the determination of the complete interactome of the minimal cell, which could then be experimentally validated. The assumptions behind this hypothesis as well as its consequences for experimental and theoretical biology are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2977915466,"To evaluate the association between macular choroidal thickness and peripapillary RNFL thickness in patients with optic atrophy due to acute idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis and in normal controls using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).We performed SD-OCT peripapillary RNFL circular scan centered on the optic disc with horizontal and vertical crosshair scans through the fovea using the enhanced depth technique in 62 eyes with optic atrophy due to acute idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis and 86 eyes of normal controls. The association between RNFL thickness and macular choroidal thickness measurements was assessed.The mean age was 43 ± 14 years (mean ± SD) in patients with optic atrophy and 45 ± 16 years in healthy controls (p = 0.791). There was a significant association between nasal peripapillary RNFL thickness and choroidal thickness at 3.0 mm nasal to the foveal center in patients with optic atrophy in multivariate analysis (estimate = 1.398, p = 0.011). In controls, there were significant associations between global average, superior, and inferior peripapillary RNFL thickness and choroidal thickness at 3.0 mm superior to the foveal center (estimate = -60.112, p = 0.044, estimate = 15.821, p = 7.312, and estimate = 15.203, p = 7.222, respectively).Our SD-OCT data revealed that there was a significant association between peripapillary RNFL thickness and macular choroidal thickness in patients with optic atrophy due to acute idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis and in controls, although the mechanism remained unclear. The difference in the pattern of association between patients with optic atrophy and controls suggests that optic atrophy caused by acute idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis could affect the pattern of association between peripapillary RNFL thickness and macular choroidal thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2805440832,"It is important to detect mediastinal lymph node metastases in patients with lung cancer to improve outcomes, and it is possible that activatable fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) can help visualize metastatic lymph nodes. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of applying this method to mediastinal lymph node metastases in an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Tumors were formed by injecting H226 (EGFR-positive) and H520 (EGFR-negative) cell lines directly in the lung parenchyma of five mice each. When computed tomography revealed tumors exceeding 8 mm at their longest or atelectasis that occupied more than half of lateral lung fields, a panitumumab (Pan)–ICG conjugate was injected in the tail vein (50 μg/100 μL). The mice were then sacrificed 48 hours after injection and their chests were opened for fluorescent imaging acquisition. Lymph node metastases with the five highest fluorescent signal intensities per mouse were chosen for statistical analysis of the average signal ratios against the liver. Regarding the quenching capacity, the Pan–ICG conjugate had almost no fluorescence in phosphate-buffered saline, but there was an approximate 61.8-fold increase in vitro after treatment with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Both the fluorescent microscopy and the flow cytometry showed specific binding between the conjugate and H226, but almost no specific binding with H520. The EGFR-positive mediastinal lymph node metastases showed significantly higher average fluorescence signal ratios than the EGFR-negative ones (n = 25 per group) 48 hours after conjugate administration (70.1% ± 4.5% vs. 13.3% ± 1.8%; p < 0.05). Thus, activatable fluorescence imaging using the Pan–ICG conjugate detected EGFR-positive mediastinal lymph node metastases with high specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2805691461,"Osteoporosis has been associated with pulmonary silicosis in California horses exposed to soils rich in cytotoxic silica dioxide crystals, a syndrome termed silicate associated osteoporosis (SAO). The causal mechanism for the development of osteoporosis is unknown. Osteoporotic lesions are primarily located in bone marrow-rich sites such as ribs, scapula and pelvis. Gene transcription patterns within bone marrow and pulmonary lymph nodes of affected horses may offer clues to disease pathobiology. Bone marrow core and tracheobronchial lymph node tissue samples harvested postmortem from affected and unaffected horses were examined histologically and subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced data were analyzed for differential gene expression and gene ontology. Metatranscriptomic and metagenomic assays evaluated samples for infectious agents. Thirteen of 17 differentially expressed transcripts in bone marrow were linked to bone and cartilage formation such as integrin binding bone sialoprotein (log2FC = 3.39, PFDR = 0.013) and chondroadherin (log2FC = 4.48, PFDR = 0.031). Equus caballus solute carrier family 9, subfamily A2 (log2FC = 3.77, PFDR = 0.0034) was one of the four differentially expressed transcripts linked to osteoclast activity. Osteoblasts were hyperplastic and hypertrophic in bone marrow from affected horses. Biological pathways associated with skeletal morphogenesis were significantly enriched in affected horses. The 30 differentially expressed genes in affected lymph nodes were associated with inflammatory responses. Evidence of infectious agents was not found. The SAO affected bone marrow molecular signature demonstrated increased transcription and heightened activation of osteoblasts. Increased osteoblastic activity could be part of the pathological mechanism for osteoporosis or a compensatory response to the accelerated osteolysis. Transcriptome data offer gene targets for inquiries into the role of osteocytes and osteoblasts in SAO pathogenesis. Viral or bacterial infectious etiology in SAO is less likely based on metatranscriptomic and metagenomic data but cannot be completely ruled out."
