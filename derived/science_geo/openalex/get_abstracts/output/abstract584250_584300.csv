https://openalex.org/W2606864355,"In humans, the endometrium, the uterine mucosal lining, undergoes dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Despite the importance of the endometrium as the site of implantation and nutritional support for the conceptus, there are no long-term culture systems that recapitulate endometrial function in vitro. We adapted conditions used to establish human adult stem-cell-derived organoid cultures to generate three-dimensional cultures of normal and decidualized human endometrium. These organoids expand long-term, are genetically stable and differentiate following treatment with reproductive hormones. Single cells from both endometrium and decidua can generate a fully functional organoid. Transcript analysis confirmed great similarity between organoids and the primary tissue of origin. On exposure to pregnancy signals, endometrial organoids develop characteristics of early pregnancy. We also derived organoids from malignant endometrium, and so provide a foundation to study common diseases, such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer, as well as the physiology of early gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2607239001,"The emergence of apomixis-the transition from sexual to asexual reproduction-is a prominent feature of modern citrus. Here we de novo sequenced and comprehensively studied the genomes of four representative citrus species. Additionally, we sequenced 100 accessions of primitive, wild and cultivated citrus. Comparative population analysis suggested that genomic regions harboring energy- and reproduction-associated genes are probably under selection in cultivated citrus. We also narrowed the genetic locus responsible for citrus polyembryony, a form of apomixis, to an 80-kb region containing 11 candidate genes. One of these, CitRWP, is expressed at higher levels in ovules of polyembryonic cultivars. We found a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element insertion in the promoter region of CitRWP that cosegregated with polyembryony. This study provides new insights into citrus apomixis and constitutes a promising resource for the mining of agriculturally important genes."
https://openalex.org/W2605540758,"The progression of pancreatic oncogenesis requires immune-suppressive inflammation in cooperation with oncogenic mutations. However, the drivers of intratumoral immune tolerance are uncertain. Dectin 1 is an innate immune receptor crucial for anti-fungal immunity, but its role in sterile inflammation and oncogenesis has not been well defined. Furthermore, non-pathogen-derived ligands for dectin 1 have not been characterized. We found that dectin 1 is highly expressed on macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Dectin 1 ligation accelerated the progression of PDA in mice, whereas deletion of Clec7a-the gene encoding dectin 1-or blockade of dectin 1 downstream signaling was protective. We found that dectin 1 can ligate the lectin galectin 9 in mouse and human PDA, which results in tolerogenic macrophage programming and adaptive immune suppression. Upon disruption of the dectin 1-galectin 9 axis, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are dispensable for PDA progression in hosts with an intact signaling axis, become reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor immunity. These data suggest that targeting dectin 1 signaling is an attractive strategy for developing an immunotherapy for PDA."
https://openalex.org/W2606591457,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women can cause a wide range of congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the infant, a condition now collectively known as congenital ZIKV syndrome. A vaccine to prevent or significantly attenuate viremia in pregnant women who are residents of or travelers to epidemic or endemic regions is needed to avert congenital ZIKV syndrome, and might also help to suppress epidemic transmission. Here we report on a live-attenuated vaccine candidate that contains a 10-nucleotide deletion in the 3' untranslated region of the ZIKV genome (10-del ZIKV). The 10-del ZIKV is highly attenuated, immunogenic, and protective in type 1 interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. Crucially, a single dose of 10-del ZIKV induced sterilizing immunity with a saturated neutralizing antibody titer, which no longer increased after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV, and completely prevented viremia. The immunized mice also developed a robust T cell response. Intracranial inoculation of 1-d-old immunocompetent CD-1 mice with 1 × 104 infectious focus units (IFU) of 10-del ZIKV caused no mortality, whereas infections with 10 IFU of wild-type ZIKV were lethal. Mechanistically, the attenuated virulence of 10-del ZIKV may be due to decreased viral RNA synthesis and increased sensitivity to type-1-interferon inhibition. The attenuated 10-del ZIKV was incapable of infecting mosquitoes after oral feeding of spiked-blood meals, representing an additional safety feature. Collectively, the safety and efficacy results suggest that further development of this promising, live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate is warranted."

Driver behavior profiling tries to understand and positively impact driver behavior. Usually driver behavior profiling tasks involve automated collection of driving data and application of computer models to generate a classification that characterizes the driver aggressiveness profile. Different sensors and classification methods have been employed in this task, however, low-cost solutions and high performance are still research targets. This paper presents an investigation with different Android smartphone sensors, and classification algorithms in order to assess which sensor/method assembly enables classification with higher performance. The results show that specific combinations of sensors and intelligent methods allow classification performance improvement."

They show that both HLA alleles and genes encoding factors of the innate immune system drive viral genome polymorphism and that IFNL4 genotypes determine HCV viral load through a mechanism dependent on a specific polymorphism encoded in the HCV polyprotein. Outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and treatment depend on viral and host genetic factors. Here we use human genome-wide genotyping arrays and new whole-genome HCV viral sequencing technologies to perform a systematic genome-to-genome study of 542 individuals who were chronically infected with HCV, predominantly genotype 3. We show that both alleles of genes encoding human leukocyte antigen molecules and genes encoding components of the interferon lambda innate immune system drive viral polymorphism. Additionally, we show that IFNL4 genotypes determine HCV viral load through a mechanism dependent on a specific amino acid residue in the HCV NS5A protein. These findings highlight the interplay between the innate immune system and the viral genome in HCV control."
https://openalex.org/W2607166912,"Michael Taylor, Marco Marra and colleagues analyze spatial tumor heterogeneity in 9 medulloblastomas, 16 high-grade gliomas and 10 renal cell carcinomas, using a combination of transcriptomic and genomic profiling of multiregional biopsies. They find that medulloblastomas have spatially homogeneous transcriptomes, whereas somatic mutations that affect genes suitable for targeted therapeutics are spatially heterogeneous. Spatial heterogeneity of transcriptional and genetic markers between physically isolated biopsies of a single tumor poses major barriers to the identification of biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies that will be effective against the entire tumor. We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of multiregional biopsies from 35 patients, using a combination of transcriptomic and genomic profiles. Medulloblastomas (MBs), but not high-grade gliomas (HGGs), demonstrated spatially homogeneous transcriptomes, which allowed for accurate subgrouping of tumors from a single biopsy. Conversely, somatic mutations that affect genes suitable for targeted therapeutics demonstrated high levels of spatial heterogeneity in MB, malignant glioma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Actionable targets found in a single MB biopsy were seldom clonal across the entire tumor, which brings the efficacy of monotherapies against a single target into question. Clinical trials of targeted therapies for MB should first ensure the spatially ubiquitous nature of the target mutation."

https://openalex.org/W2605619410,"Structural analysis and spectroscopy elucidate how pairs of electrons are bifurcated in a flavoenzyme by generating an unstable flavin semiquinone, thus coupling exergonic and endergonic oxidation–reduction reactions. The recently realized biochemical phenomenon of energy conservation through electron bifurcation provides biology with an elegant means to maximize utilization of metabolic energy. The mechanism of coordinated coupling of exergonic and endergonic oxidation–reduction reactions by a single enzyme complex has been elucidated through optical and paramagnetic spectroscopic studies revealing unprecedented features. Pairs of electrons are bifurcated over more than 1 volt of electrochemical potential by generating a low-potential, highly energetic, unstable flavin semiquinone and directing electron flow to an iron–sulfur cluster with a highly negative potential to overcome the barrier of the endergonic half reaction. The unprecedented range of thermodynamic driving force that is generated by flavin-based electron bifurcation accounts for unique chemical reactions that are catalyzed by these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2607234585,"P85α, which acts as a tumour suppressor, is frequently found to be downregulated in various human cancers. However, the role of p85α in the tumour microenvironment is unknown. Here, we report that aberrantly low expression of p85α in breast cancer stroma is clinically relevant to breast cancer disease progression. Stromal fibroblasts can acquire the hallmarks of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a result of the loss of p85α expression. Paracrine Wnt10b from p85α-deficient fibroblasts can promote cancer progression via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by the canonical Wnt pathway. Moreover, exosomes have a key role in paracrine Wnt10b transport from fibroblasts to breast cancer epithelial cells. Our results reveal that p85α expression in stromal fibroblasts haves a crucial role in regulating breast cancer tumourigenesis and progression by modifying stromal-epithelial crosstalk and remodelling the tumour microenvironment. Therefore, p85α can function as a tumour suppressor and represent a new candidate for diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2606486957,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that compromise its chloride channel activity. The most common mutation, p.Phe508del, results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein, which has residual channel activity but is prematurely degraded. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in CF, which include impaired chloride permeability and persistent lung inflammation, a multidrug approach is required for efficacious CF therapy. To date, no individual drug with pleiotropic beneficial effects is available for CF. Here we report on the ability of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1)-a naturally occurring polypeptide with an excellent safety profile in the clinic when used as an adjuvant or an immunotherapeutic agent-to rectify the multiple tissue defects in mice with CF as well as in cells from subjects with the p.Phe508del mutation. Tα1 displayed two combined properties that favorably opposed CF symptomatology: it reduced inflammation and increased CFTR maturation, stability and activity. By virtue of this two-pronged action, Tα1 has strong potential to be an efficacious single-molecule-based therapeutic agent for CF."
https://openalex.org/W2605823623,"Pancreatic β cell dysfunction and reduction due to glucose toxicity play a crucial role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Irisin, a novel exercise-induced myokine, reduces obesity, improves insulin resistance and lowers blood glucose by promoting the browning of white adipose tissue, thereby enhancing thermogenesis and increasing energy expenditure. Recent studies have reported that irisin promotes cell proliferation and protects cells from apoptosis. However, the effects of irisin on pancreatic β cells are unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects and the potential underlying mechanisms of irisin on pancreatic β cell proliferation and apoptosis induced by high glucose. Both in vitro (INS-1 cells) and in vivo (a T2DM rat model) experiments were conducted. Irisin significantly increased the proliferation of INS-1 cells, with the most significant effect observed at 24 h with 100 ng/ml irisin. Irisin also promoted INS-1 cell proliferation via the ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, protected the cells from high-glucose-induced apoptosis by regulating the expression of caspases, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and improved pancreatic β cell function. Irisin significantly reduced the body weight and blood glucose values and increased the serum insulin levels of the diabetic rats. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) indicated that irisin also improved the glucose tolerance of T2DM rats. Together, these findings suggest that irisin may have applications in the prevention and treatment of T2DM because of its protective effect on the secretion of pancreatic β cells."
https://openalex.org/W2605919588,"Jacob George and colleagues examine whether the association of the IFNL3–IFNL4 region with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis is mediated by IFN-λ3 or IFN-λ4. They find greater hepatic inflammation, fibrosis progression rate and hepatic infiltration of immune cells in individuals with the risk haplotype that produces IFN-λ3 but not IFN-λ4. Genetic variation in the IFNL3–IFNL4 (interferon-λ3–interferon-λ4) region is associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis1,2,3,4. Whether IFN-λ3 or IFN-λ4 protein drives this association is not known. We demonstrate that hepatic inflammation, fibrosis stage, fibrosis progression rate, hepatic infiltration of immune cells, IFN-λ3 expression, and serum sCD163 levels (a marker of activated macrophages) are greater in individuals with the IFNL3–IFNL4 risk haplotype that does not produce IFN-λ4, but produces IFN-λ3. No difference in these features was observed according to genotype at rs117648444, which encodes a substitution at position 70 of the IFN-λ4 protein and reduces IFN-λ4 activity, or between patients encoding functionally defective IFN-λ4 (IFN-λ4–Ser70) and those encoding fully active IFN-λ4–Pro70. The two proposed functional variants (rs368234815 and rs4803217)5,6 were not superior to the discovery SNP rs12979860 with respect to liver inflammation or fibrosis phenotype. IFN-λ3 rather than IFN-λ4 likely mediates IFNL3–IFNL4 haplotype–dependent hepatic inflammation and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2606184753,"There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2606468927,"The function of cortical GABAergic interneurons is largely determined by their integration into specific neural circuits, but the mechanisms controlling the wiring of these cells remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for a major population of basket cells that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Here we found that the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 was required for the normal integration into cortical circuits of basket cells expressing CCK and vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGlut3). The number of inhibitory synapses made by CCK+VGlut3+ basket cells and the inhibitory drive they exerted on pyramidal cells were reduced in conditional mice lacking ErbB4. Developmental disruption of the connectivity of these cells diminished the power of theta oscillations during exploratory behavior, disrupted spatial coding by place cells, and caused selective alterations in spatial learning and memory in adult mice. These results suggest that normal integration of CCK+ basket cells in cortical networks is key to support spatial coding in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2605744160,"The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of post-operative depression in breast cancer patients who have undergone mastectomy with the incidence of post-operative depression in non-breast cancer participants (controls).Using data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA), we selected 2,130 patients with breast cancer who have undergone mastectomy for this national cohort study and matched these patients 1:4 with 8,520 control participants according to age, sex, income, region, and pre-operative depression. The incidence of post-operative depression was measured from mastectomy year to post-op year 10. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for data analysis, and the false-discovery rate was applied to determine statistical significance (P < 0.05).The incidence of depression was higher in the breast cancer with mastectomy group than in the control group up to 3 years after mastectomy). However, there was no difference in the incidence of depression between the breast cancer with mastectomy group and the control group after post-op 4 years. The incidence of depression was higher in the breast cancer with mastectomy group than in the control group up to 2 years after mastectomy, and there was no difference in the incidence of depression between the two groups after post-op 3 years in middle-aged and older adults (≥ 40 years old). In young adults (≤ 39 years old), the incidence of depression was significantly higher in the breast cancer with mastectomy group than in the control group in mastectomy year.Patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer experience depression more frequently than healthy people. However, patients overcome their depressive mood symptoms during the postoperative period. Young adults overcome their symptoms more quickly than middle-aged and older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2607005032,"Francesco Cucca, Stephen Montgomery and colleagues identify regulatory variants that influence gene expression and splicing using whole-genome and transcriptome sequence data from 624 Sardinians. They find a high frequency of splicing and expression quantitative trait loci near genes involved in malarial resistance and multiple sclerosis. Genetic studies of complex traits have mainly identified associations with noncoding variants. To further determine the contribution of regulatory variation, we combined whole-genome and transcriptome data for 624 individuals from Sardinia to identify common and rare variants that influence gene expression and splicing. We identified 21,183 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 6,768 splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), including 619 new QTLs. We identified high-frequency QTLs and found evidence of selection near genes involved in malarial resistance and increased multiple sclerosis risk, reflecting the epidemiological history of Sardinia. Using family relationships, we identified 809 segregating expression outliers (median z score of 2.97), averaging 13.3 genes per individual. Outlier genes were enriched for proximal rare variants, providing a new approach to study large-effect regulatory variants and their relevance to traits. Our results provide insight into the effects of regulatory variants and their relationship to population history and individual genetic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2606327171,"Background Physical activity in leisure time seems to reduce the risk of low back pain, but it is not known whether occupational activity, as recorded in a representative working population, produces a higher or lower risk. Objective To study associations between physical activity level at work and risk of chronic low back pain. Methods Associations were examined in a Norwegian prospective study using data from the HUNT2 and HUNT3 surveys carried out in the whole county of Nord-Trøndelag. Participants were 7580 women and 7335 men who supplied information about physical activity level at work. Levels considered were sedentary work, work involving walking but no heavy lifting, work involving walking and heavy lifting, and particularly strenuous physical work. Nobody in the cohort was affected by chronic low back pain at baseline. After 11 years, participants reported whether they suffered from chronic low back pain. Generalized linear modelling with adjustment for potential confounders was applied to assess associations with risk factors. Results In age-adjusted analyses both women and men showed statistically significant associations between physical activity at work and risk of chronic low back pain, suggesting positive relationships. For particularly strenuous physical work the relative risk of chronic low back pain was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.00–1.71) in women and 1.36 (95% CI 1.17–1.59) in men, compared to sedentary work. Women still showed a general association with activity level after adjustment for education, leisure time physical activity, BMI, smoking and occupational category. In men, the higher risk was only maintained for particularly strenuous work. Conclusion In this cohort, women had a higher risk of chronic low back pain with work involving walking and heavy lifting or particularly strenuous work, compared to sedentary work. Men participating in particularly strenuous work also experienced a higher risk of chronic low back pain."

https://openalex.org/W2606527259,"CRIPTO (CR-1, TDGF1) is a cell surface/secreted oncoprotein actively involved in development and cancer. Here, we report that high expression of CRIPTO correlates with poor survival in stratified risk groups of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. CRIPTO and its signaling partner glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) are highly expressed in PCa metastases and display higher levels in the metastatic ALDHhigh sub-population of PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 PCa cells compared with non-metastatic ALDHlow. Coculture of the osteotropic PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 PCa cells with differentiated primary human osteoblasts induced CRIPTO and GRP78 expression in cancer cells and increases the size of the ALDHhigh sub-population. Additionally, CRIPTO or GRP78 knockdown decreases proliferation, migration, clonogenicity and the size of the metastasis-initiating ALDHhigh sub-population. CRIPTO knockdown reduces the invasion of PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 cells in zebrafish and inhibits bone metastasis in a preclinical mouse model. These results highlight a functional role for CRIPTO and GRP78 in PCa metastasis and suggest that targeting CRIPTO/GRP78 signaling may have significant therapeutic potential."

https://openalex.org/W2605548524,"Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is the causative agent of an emerging vesicular disease in swine, which is clinically indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease. In addition, SVV has been associated with neonatal mortality in piglets. While a commercial SVV qRT-PCR is available, commercial antibodies are lacking to diagnose SVV infections by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Thus, a novel in situ hybridization technique—RNAscope (ISH) was developed to detect SVVRNA in infected tissues. From a total of 78 samples evaluated, 30 were positive by qRT-PCR and ISH-RNA, including vesicular lesions of affected sows, ulcerative lesions in the tongue of piglets and various other tissues with no evidence of histological lesions. Nineteen samples were negative for SVV by qRT-PCR and ISH-RNA. The Ct values of the qRT-PCR from ISH-RNA positive tissues varied from 12.0 to 32.6 (5.12 x 106 to 5.31 RNA copies/g, respectively). The ISH-RNA technique is an important tool in diagnosing and investigating the pathogenesis of SVV and other emerging pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2605476227,"A vertebral artery (VA) terminating in a posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is often considered to be a normal variation associated with VA hypoplasia. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of this cerebrovascular variant. A total of 80 patients with clinically evident cerebrovascular events in posterior circulation were examined by duplex sonography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Eighty healthy subjects who had MRA check-up were recruited as controls. PICA termination of the VA (PICA-VA) was identified as the VA not communicating with the basilar artery (BA) but ending into a PICA. We compared the prevalence of PICA-VA and associated hemodynamic parameters between the patients with and without PICA-VA, and investigated their relationships with VA hypoplasia. The prevalence of PICA-VA was higher in the patient group than in the controls (18.7% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.015). Most measurements (73.3%) of PICA-VA did not fit the criteria of VA hypoplasia. In comparison with the non-PICA-terminating group, the PICA-VA has a smaller diameter (3.7 ± 0.7 mm vs. 3.0 ± 0.5 mm, p < 0.001), lower mean velocity (241 ± 100 mm/sec vs. 164 ± 88 mm/sec, p < 0.01), and higher pulsatility index (1.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6, p < 0.001). Moreover, a smaller diameter of the BA (3.2 ± 0.5 mm vs. 2.5 ± 0.9 mm, p = 0.004) and the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (2.0 ± 0.1 mm vs. 1.6 ± 0.1 mm, p = 0.006) were also noted in the PICA-VA group. The higher prevalence of PICA-VA in the patient group with smaller diameter of VA, BA and PCA reflected its clinical significance, suggesting that PICA-VA may have a detrimental impact on cerebral hemodynamics. However, the sample is small, and further studies are needed with larger sample size for confirmation."

The monitoring was carried out by a no-contact technique using an interferometric radar, whose effectiveness in measuring the resonant frequencies of structures and historic monuments has proved over the last years through numerous monitoring activities. Owing to the dynamic behavior of the measurement system (radar and tripod), an accelerometer has been installed on the radar head to filter out the movement component of the measuring instrument from the measurement of the David's displacement. Measurements were carried out in the presence and absence of visitors, to assess their influence on the dynamic behavior of the statue.

Spindle defects are not only an impetus of chromosome instability but are also a cause of developmental disorders involving defective asymmetric cell division. In this work, we demonstrate BCCIP, especially BCCIPα, as a previously unidentified component of the mitotic spindle pole and the centrosome. We demonstrate that BCCIP localizes proximal to the mother centriole and participates in microtubule organization and then redistributes to the spindle pole to ensure faithful spindle architecture. We find that BCCIP depletion leads to morphological defects, disoriented mitotic spindles, chromosome congression defects and delayed mitotic progression. Our study identifies BCCIP as a novel factor critical for microtubule regulation and explicates a mechanism utilized by BCCIP in tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2607489768,"Each species of intestinal bacteria requires a nutritional source to maintain its population in the intestine. Dietary factors are considered to be major nutrients; however, evidence directly explaining the in situ utilization of dietary factors is limited. Microscale bacterial distribution would provide clues to understand bacterial lifestyle and nutrient utilization. However, the detailed bacterial localization around dietary factors in the intestine remains uninvestigated. Therefore, we explored microscale habitats in the murine intestine by using histology and fluorescent in situ hybridization, focusing on dietary factors. This approach successfully revealed several types of bacterial colonization. In particular, bifidobacterial colonization and adhesion on granular starch was frequently and commonly observed in the jejunum and distal colon. To identify the bacterial composition of areas around starch granules and areas without starch, laser microdissection and next-generation sequencing-based 16S rRNA microbial profiling was performed. It was found that Bifidobacteriaceae were significantly enriched by 4.7 fold in peri-starch areas compared to ex-starch areas. This family solely consisted of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum. In contrast, there was no significant enrichment among the other major families. This murine intestinal B. pseudolongum had starch-degrading activity, confirmed by isolation from the mouse feces and in vitro analysis. Collectively, our results demonstrate the significance of starch granules as a major habitat and potential nutritional niche for murine intestinal B. pseudolongum. Moreover, our results suggest that colonizing bifidobacteria effectively utilize starch from the closest location and maintain the location. This may be a bacterial strategy to monopolize solid dietary nutrients. We believe that our analytical approach could possibly be applied to other nutritional factors, and can be a powerful tool to investigate in vivo relationships between bacteria and environmental factors in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2606853429,"Teriparatide [human parathyroid hormone (1-34)], which exerts an anabolic effect on bone, is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients who are at a high risk for fracture. That the once-daily administration of teriparatide causes an increase in cortical porosity in animal models and clinical studies has been a matter of concern. However, it is not well documented that the frequency of administration and/or the total dose of teriparatide affect the cortical porosity. The present study developed 4 teriparatide regimens [20 μg/kg/day (D20), 40 μg/kg/day (D40), 140 μg/kg/week (W140) and 280 μg/kg/week (W280)] in the rabbit as a model animal with a well-developed Haversian system and osteons. The total weekly doses were equivalent in the low-dose groups (D20 and W140) and in the high-dose groups (D40 and W280). After the short-term (1 month) administration of TPDT, micro-CT, histomorphometry and three-dimensional second harmonic generation (3D-SHG) imaging to visualize the bone collagen demonstrated that daily regimens but not weekly regimens were associated with the significant development of cortical porosity and endosteal naïve bone formation by marrow fibrosis. We concomitantly monitored the pharmacokinetics of the plasma teriparatide levels as well as the temporal changes in markers of bone formation and resorption. The analyses in the present study suggested that the daily repeated administration of teriparatide causes more deleterious changes in the cortical microarchitecture than the less frequent administration of higher doses. The findings of the present study may have some implications for use of teriparatide in clinical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2606454898,"TP53 plays essential roles in tumor initiation and progression, and is frequently mutated in cancer. However, pharmacological stabilization and reactivation of p53 have not been actively explored for targeted cancer therapies. Herein, we identify a novel Cyclophilin A (CypA) small molecule inhibitor (HL001) that induces non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via restoring p53 expression. We find that HL001 stabilizes p53 through inhibiting the MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Further mechanistic studies reveal that the downregulation of G3BP1 and the induction of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage by HL001 contribute to p53 stabilization. Surprisingly, HL001 selectively suppresses tumor growth in p53 wild-type NSCLC harboring Arg72 homozygous alleles (p53-72R) through disrupting interaction between MDM2 and p53-72R in a CypA-dependent manner. Moreover, combining HL001 with cisplatin synergistically enhance tumor regression in orthotopic NSCLC mouse model. Collectively, this study demonstrates that pharmacologic inhibition of CypA offers a potential therapeutic strategy via specific activation of p53-72R in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2607179717,"Large carnivore conservation may be considered as successful in Sweden, as wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), brown bear (Ursus arctos), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and wolverine (Gulo gulo) populations have recovered from extinction or near extinction to viable populations during the last three decades. Particularly the wolf and lynx populations have returned at the cost of an increasing number of carnivore attacks on domestic livestock. To support coexistence between carnivores and livestock production, the Swedish authorities subsidise interventions to prevent or reduce the number of carnivore attacks. The most commonly used intervention is carnivore deterring fencing, and all livestock owners can apply for subsidies to build a fence. To receive reimbursement the fence must be approved by the authorities according to predefined criteria. An important part of any management aiming to be adaptive is evaluating interventions. In this paper we evaluate to what extent previously subsidised fences still meet the criteria 1-15 years after their approval. Of 296 fences that had received subsidies in the county of Värmland, 100 randomly selected fences were revisited in 2016. From this subsample 14% of the fences still met the initial criteria for subsidies. None of the fences that still fulfilled the criteria were more than 8 years old, whereas fences with identified failures occurred in all age groups. Of the 86 fences that failed to meet the criteria, construction failures were the most commonly occurring problem. Maintenance failures, wear and tear, only explain a minor part of the failures. To improve the quality of fencing, as well as the quality and longevity of the subsidies programme, there is a need for improved communication between authorities, and improved communication and support from the authorities to livestock producers before and during construction of fences, as well as more rigorous inspection when the fences are built."
https://openalex.org/W2607091320,"Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP), a wild relative of common wheat, possesses many potentially valuable genes for wheat breeding. To transfer these genes into wheat, a series of wheat-A. cristatum derivatives have been obtained in our laboratory. In this study, a wheat-A. cristatum derivative II-3-1 was obtained, which was proven to contain a 1P (1A) disomic substitution and 2P disomic addition line with 40 wheat chromosomes and two pairs of A. cristatum chromosomes by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular markers analysis. By further backcrossing with the wheat parent Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho) and self-fertilization, three different lines were separated from II-3-1, including wheat-A. cristatum 1P disomic addition line II-3-1a, 2P disomic addition line II-3-1b and 1P (1A) disomic substitution line II-3-1c. Because 2P addition line had been reported before, we aimed to investigate 1P disomic addition line II-3-1a and wheat-A. cristatum 1P (1A) disomic substitution line II-3-1c. Analysis of different genetic populations demonstrated that 1P chromosome harbored multiple agronomic traits, such as elevated spike length, increased tillering ability, reduced plant height and spikelet density. Besides, bristles on the glume ridges as an important morphological marker was located on 1P chromosome. Therefore, the novel 1P addition and substitution lines will be used as important genetic materials to widen the genetic resources of wheat."

Thus, the search for native enzymes from extremophiles that are suitable for use under industrial conditions is a permanent challenge for R & D departments. Here and toward such discoveries, two sequences homologous to amylopullulanases (EC 3.2.1.41, GH57) from an endogenous Cohnella sp., [Coh00831 (KP335161; 1998 bp) and Coh01133 (KP335160: 3678 bp)] were identified. The genes were heterologously expressed in E. coli to both determine their type and further characterize their properties. The isolated DNA was PCR amplified with gene specific primers and cloned in pET28a, and the recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The temperatures and pH optima of purified recombinants Coh 01133 and Coh 00831 enzymes were 70°C and 8, and 60°C and 6, respectively. These enzymes are stable more than 90% in 60°C and 50°C for 90 min respectively. The major reactions released sugars which could be fractionated by HPLC analysis, from soluble starch were mainly maltose (G2), maltotriose (G3) and maltotetraose (G4). The enzymes hydrolyzed pullulan to maltotriose (G3) only. Enzyme activities for both proteins were improved in the availability of Mn2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and reduced in the presence of Fe2+, Li2+, Na2+, Triton X100 and urea. Moreover, Co2+, K+, and Cu2+ had a negative effect only on Coh 01133 enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2606120941,"The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) has become a key species in investigations of the neural processing of sound localization cues in mammals. While its sound localization has been tested extensively under free-field stimulation, many neurophysiological studies use headphones to present signals with binaural localization cues. The gerbil's behavioral sensitivity to binaural cues, however, is unknown for the lack of appropriate stimulation paradigms in awake behaving gerbils. We close this gap in knowledge by mimicking a headphone stimulation; we use free-field loudspeakers and apply cross-talk cancellation techniques to present pure tones with binaural cues via ""virtual headphones"" to gerbils trained in a sound localization task. All gerbils were able to lateralize sounds depending on the interaural time or level difference (ITD and ILD, respectively). For ITD stimuli, reliable responses were seen for frequencies ≤2.9 kHz, the highest frequency tested with ITD stimuli. ITD sensitivity was frequency-dependent with the highest sensitivity observed at 1 kHz. For stimuli with ITD outside the gerbil's physiological range, responses were cyclic indicating the use of phase information when lateralizing narrow-band sounds. For ILD stimuli, reliable responses were obtained for frequencies ≥2 kHz. The comparison of ITD and ILD thresholds with ITD and ILD thresholds derived from gerbils' free-field performance suggests that ongoing ITD information is the main cue for sound localization at frequencies <2 kHz. At 2 kHz, ITD and ILD cues are likely used in a complementary way. Verification of the use of the virtual headphones suggests that they can serve as a suitable substitute for conventional headphones particularly at frequencies ≤2 kHz."
https://openalex.org/W2606558894,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in vascular repair, while circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are biomarkers of vascular damage and regeneration. Statins may promote EPC/CEC mobilization in the peripheral blood. We evaluated whether pre-procedural exposure to different lipid-lowering drugs (statins±ezetimibe) can acutely increase levels/activity of EPCs/CECs in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).In a planned sub-analysis of the Rosuvastatin For REduction Of Myocardial DamagE During Coronary AngioplastY (REMEDY) trial, 38 patients with stable CAD on chronic low-dose statin therapy were randomized, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, into 4 groups before PCI: i. placebo (n = 11); ii. atorvastatin (80 mg+40 mg, n = 9); iii. rosuvastatin (40 mg twice, n = 9); and iv. rosuvastatin (5 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) twice, (n = 9). At baseline and 24 h after treatment-before PCI-, patients underwent blinded analyses of EPCs [colony forming units-endothelial cells (CFU-ECs), endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and tubulization activity] and CECs in peripheral blood.We found no significant treatment effects on parameters investigated such as number of CECs [Median (IQR): i. 0(0), ii. 4.5(27), iii. 1.9(2.3), iv. 1.9(2.3)], CFU-ECs [Median (IQR): i. 27(11), ii. 19(31), iii. 47(36), iv. 30(98)], and ECFCs [Median (IQR): i. 86(84), ii. 7(84), iii. 8/(42.5), iv. 5(2)], as well as tubulization activity [total tubuli (well), Median (IQR): i. 19(7), ii. 5(4), iii. 25(13), iv. 15(24)].In this study, we found no evidence of acute changes in levels or activity of EPCs and CECs after high-dose lipid-lowering therapy in stable CAD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2606252713,"Background Cognitive impairment is one of the important critical issues in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, the associating factors of brain atrophy in HD patients have not been fully elucidated. Purpose and methods Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 34 of total 72 HD outpatients in our dialysis center. These MRI images were analyzed by an application software; Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer’s Disease (VSRAD). VSRAD quantitatively calculates the extent of brain atrophy (percent of volume reduction) comparing with a MRI imaging database of 80 age-matched healthy controls. The extent of both hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy was evaluated with possible contributing factors. Results In all patients, the mean extent of hippocampal atrophy was 27.3%, and the mean extent of whole-brain atrophy was 11.2%. The extent of hippocampal atrophy was significantly correlated with low body mass index (BMI), total serum homocysteine (tHcy) levels, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). The extent of whole-brain atrophy showed significant correlations with age, hypoalbuminemia, and baPWV. Based on the multiple regression analysis, tHcy was an independent determinant of hippocampal atrophy (β = 0.460, R2 = 0.189, P<0.01); while age was an independent determinant of whole-brain atrophy (β = 0.594, R2 = 0.333, P<0.01). Conclusions In this exploratory pilot study, hippocampal atrophy was significantly correlated with hyperhomocysteinemia in HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2605820298,"The prevalence of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is high among Western men who have sex with men (MSM), and CSA is associated with certain socio-demographic variables and with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Little is known about CSA among Chinese MSM; therefore, we explored the prevalence and frequency of non-contact (e.g., sexual invitations, exhibitionism) and contact (e.g., intercourse, genital contact) forms of CSA in an Internet-based sample of MSM in China. We also examined the associations between the participants' socio-demographic characteristics and HIV status, and their histories of CSA.We surveyed MSM from 30 Chinese provinces in 2014-2015; 1,030 (mean age = 25.15 years, SD = 6.32) and 1,020 (mean age = 25.05 years, SD = 5.95) respondents were eligible for inclusion in the non-contact and contact CSA groups, respectively.Prevalence of non-contact and contact CSA was 36.2% and 29.8%, respectively; 20.4% and 15.0% had experienced non-contact and contact CSA ≥ 3 times, respectively. Most respondents were young adults, well educated, single, had never ""come out,"" and self-identified as gay or bisexual men. Univariate analyses showed that respondents who had experienced contact CSA were more likely to be HIV-positive than those who had never experienced contact CSA. Multivariate analyses showed that non-contact CSA was associated with less education, being in a relationship with a woman or a man, and having ""come out."" Contact CSA was associated with less education, higher income, and being in a relationship with a man. Respondents who had experienced non-contact CSA ≥ 3 times were more likely to be less educated, ""out,"" and to be in a relationship with a woman or a man. Respondents who had experienced contact CSA ≥ 3 times were more likely to be less educated and to be in a relationship with a man.It is necessary to pay closer attention to CSA among MSM and other sexual minorities in China."
https://openalex.org/W2606183692,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been a candidate as a potential anti-amyloid immunotherapy for Alzheimer disease (AD) because it contains anti-amyloid β (Aβ) antibodies. Although several studies with IVIg in AD have been published, changing levels of Aβ efflux from the brain, or disaggregation of Aβ species induced by immunotherapy, have not been properly investigated. Here, we carried out an open label study of therapy with IVIg in five patients with AD. We collected plasma from a peripheral vein (peripheral-plasma) and from the internal jugular vein (jugular-plasma) to estimate directly the efflux of soluble Aβ from the brain. We also measured high molecular weight (HMW) Aβ oligomers in CSF as a marker to detect disaggregated Aβ. IVIg infusions were well tolerated in the majority of cases. However, one study subject had epileptic seizures after IVIg. Levels of HMW CSF Aβ oligomers in all participants were significantly increased after IVIg. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in jugular-plasma were continuously or temporarily elevated after treatment in three of five patients who showed preserved cognitive function, whereas levels of those in peripheral-plasma did not correlate with reactivity to the treatment. Other conventional biomarkers including 11C-Pittsburgh compound B retention were not altered after the treatment. These findings imply that HMW Aβ oligomer levels could be a better biomarker to reflect the anti-amyloid effects of IVIg than conventional Aβ species; moreover, Aβ in jugular-plasma seems to be a more direct and precise biomarker to estimate clearance of Aβ from the brain rather than Aβ in peripheral-plasma.

https://openalex.org/W2607102403,"With its airborne transmission and prolonged latency period, Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads worldwide as one of the most successful bacterial pathogens and continues to kill millions of people every year. M. tuberculosis lineage 1 is inferred to originate ancestrally based on the presence of the 52-bp TbD1 sequence and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Previously, we briefly reported the complete genome sequencing of M. tuberculosis strains 96121 and 96075, which belong to the ancient Manila family and modern Beijing family respectively. Here we present the comprehensive genomic analyses of the Manila family in lineage 1 compared to complete genomes in lineages 2–4. Principal component analysis of the presence and absence of CRISPR spacers suggests that Manila isolate 96121 is distinctly distant from lineages 2–4. We further identify a truncated whiB5 gene and a putative operon consisting of genes encoding a putative serine/threonine kinase PknH and a putative ABC transporter, which are only found in the genomes of Manila family isolates. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms are uniquely conserved in 38 Manila strains. Moreover, when compared to M. tuberculosis H37Rv, 59 proteins are under positive selection in Manila family isolate 96121 but not in Beijing family isolate 96075. The unique features further serve as biomarkers for Manila strains and may shed light on the limited transmission of this ancestral lineage outside of its Filipino host population."
https://openalex.org/W2605669878,"Significant progress has been made in the past few years in the development of recommendations, policies, and procedures for creating and promoting citations to data sets, software, and other research infrastructures like computing facilities. Open questions remain, however, about the extent to which referencing practices of authors of scholarly publications are changing in ways desired by these initiatives. This paper uses four focused case studies to evaluate whether research infrastructures are being increasingly identified and referenced in the research literature via persistent citable identifiers. The findings of the case studies show that references to such resources are increasing, but that the patterns of these increases are variable. In addition, the study suggests that citation practices for data sets may change more slowly than citation practices for software and research facilities, due to the inertia of existing practices for referencing the use of data. Similarly, existing practices for acknowledging computing support may slow the adoption of formal citations for computing resources."
https://openalex.org/W2606036164,"Objective To analyze the benefits and prognostic factors after surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods From Jan. 2004 to Jan. 2015, continuous 88 cases diagnosed with pulmonary metastases from CRC, including 15 cases of synchronous metastases and 73 metachronous metastases, were analyzed in the retrospective study. Results All of these 88 cases underwent curative pulmonary resection including 8 cases of simultaneous surgery. The one-year, three-year and five-year survival of the 88 cases were 93.4%, 60.2% and 35.7%, respectively. 63 patients just have one metastasis, and 25 patients have more than one metastasis. Additionally, the one-year, three-year and five-year survival was 98.1%, 70.2% and 40.3% respectively in one metastasis group, while 80.1%, 37.9% and 22.5% respectively in more than one metastasis group (p = 0.003). DFS of 37 metachronous metastases were equal or greater than 18 months, and DFS of 36 metachronous metastases were less than 18 months. The one-year, three-year and five-year survival was 97.8%, 77.9% and 41.4% respectively in the DFS≥18 month group, while 88.2%, 44.6% and 28.1% respectively in the DFS<18 month group (p = 0.01). Conclusion Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer can improve survival rate in selected patients. It seems that the number of metastases is an independence prognostic factor in surgical treatment. Furthermore, longer DFI implies longer survival for resectable CRC pulmonary metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2606766109,"Following a predicted decline in water resources in the Mediterranean Basin, we used reaction-diffusion equations to gain a better understanding of expected changes in properties of vegetation patterns that evolve along the rainfall transition between semi-arid and arid rainfall regions. Two types of scenarios were investigated: the first, a discrete scenario, where the potential consequences of climate change are represented by patterns evolving at discrete rainfall levels along a rainfall gradient. This scenario concerns space-for-time substitutions characteristic of the rainfall gradient hypothesis. The second, a continuous scenario, represents explicitly the effect of rainfall decline on patterns which evolved at different rainfall levels along the rainfall gradient prior to the climate change. The eccentricity of patterns that emerge through these two scenarios was found to decrease with decreasing rainfall, while their solidity increased. Due to their inverse modes of change, their ratio was found to be a highly sensitive indicator for pattern response to rainfall decline. An eccentricity ratio versus rainfall (ER:R) line was generalized from the results of the discrete experiment, where ERs above this line represent developed (recovered) patterns and ERs below this line represent degraded patterns. For the rainfall range of 1.2 to 0.8 mm/day, the continuous rainfall decline experiment with ERs that lie above the ER:R line, yielded patterns less affected by rainfall decline than would be expected according to the discrete representation of ecosystems' response. Thus, for this range, space-for-time substitution represents an overestimation of the consequences of the expected rainfall decline. For rainfall levels below 0.8 mm/day, eccentricity ratios from the discrete and continuous experiments practically converge to the same trend of pattern change along the ER:R line. Thus, the rainfall gradient hypothesis may be valid for regions characterized by this important rainfall range, which typically include desert fringe ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2607294336,"Dysfunction of DNase I-like 2 (DNase 1L2) has been assumed to play a role in the etiology of parakeratosis through incomplete degradation of DNA in the epidermis. However, the pathogenetic background factor for such pathophysiologic conditions remains unknown. In this context, non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNASE1L2 that would potentially result in loss of in vivo DNase 1L2 activity might serve as a genetic risk factor for such pathophysiologic conditions. Our aim was to effectively survey the non-synonymous SNPs of DNASE1L2 that would produce a loss-of-function variant of the enzyme together with a genetic distribution in the various populations. Here, the effects of all of the SNPs predicted by PolyPhen-2 analysis to be ""probably damaging"" (score = 1.000), and derived from frameshift/nonsense mutations, on the activity of DNase 1L2 were examined using the corresponding DNase 1L2 variants expressed in COS-7 cells. Genotyping of these SNPs was also performed in three ethnic groups including 14 different populations. Among the 28 SNPs examined, the minor allele of 23 SNPs was defined as a loss-of-function variant resulting in loss of DNase 1L2 function, indicating that Polyphen-2 analysis could be effective for surveys of at least non-synonymous SNPs resulting in loss of function. On the other hand, these minor alleles were not distributed worldwide, thereby avoiding any marked reduction of the enzyme activity in human populations. Furthermore, all of the 19 SNPs originating from frameshift/ nonsense mutations found in DNASE1L2 resulted in loss of function of the enzyme. Thus, the present findings suggest that each of the minor alleles for these SNPs may serve as one of genetic risk factors for parakeratotic skin diseases such as psoriasis, even though they lack a worldwide genetic distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2606848921,"Biopsy is often used to investigate brain tumour-specific abnormalities so that treatments can be appropriately tailored. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is predicted to only be effective in cancers where the targets of this drug (EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4) are abnormally active. Here we describe a method by which serial biopsy can be used to validate response to dacomitinib treatment in vivo using a mouse glioblastoma model. In order to determine the feasibility of conducting serial brain biopsies in mouse models with minimal morbidity, and if successful, investigate whether this can facilitate evaluation of chemotherapeutic response, an orthotopic model of glioblastoma was used. Immunodeficient mice received cortical implants of the human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG, modified to express the constitutively-active EGFR mutant, EGFRvIII, GFP and luciferase. Tumour growth was monitored using bioluminescence imaging. Upon attainment of a moderate tumour size, free-hand biopsy was performed on a subgroup of animals. Animal monitoring using a neurological severity score (NSS) showed that all mice survived the procedure with minimal perioperative morbidity and recovered to similar levels as controls over a period of five days. The technique was used to evaluate dacomitinib-mediated inhibition of EGFRvIII two hours after drug administration. We show that serial tissue samples can be obtained, that the samples retain histological features of the tumour, and are of sufficient quality to determine response to treatment. This approach represents a significant advance in murine brain surgery that may be applicable to other brain tumour models. Importantly, the methodology has the potential to accelerate the preclinical in vivo drug screening process."
https://openalex.org/W2606299825,"The principal target organ of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1) is duckling liver, which is an energy-intensive organ and plays important roles in body's energy metabolism and conversion. As the ""power house"" of the hepatocytes, mitochondria provide more than 90% of the energy. However, mitochondria are much vulnerable to the oxidative stress for their rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although previous researches have demonstrated that DHAV-1 could induce the oxidative stress in the serum of the infected ducklings, no related study on the mitochondria during the pathological process of DVH has been reported by far. To address this issue, we examined the HE stained tissue pathological slices, detected the hepatic SOD, CAT and GPX activities and MDA contents and analyzed the ATP content, mitochondrial ultrastructure and the mitochondrial SOD, GPX activities and MDA content in the liver tissues. The results showed that the hepatic redox status was significantly disturbed so that causing the mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion and mitochondrial oxidative stress during the process of the DHAV-1 infection, and a prescription formulated with Hypericum japonicum flavone, Radix Rehmanniae Recens polysaccharide and Salvia plebeia flavone (HRS), which had been demonstrated with good anti-oxidative activity in serum, could effectively alleviate the hepatic injury and the oxidative stress in liver tissue induced by DHAV-1 thus alleviating the mitochondrial injury and oxidative stress. In a word, this research discovers the oxidative stress induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress during the DVH pathological process and demonstrates HRS exerts good anti-oxidative activity in liver tissue to protect mitochondria against reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
https://openalex.org/W2606293140,"Biogeographical and ecological barriers strongly affect the course of micro-evolutionary processes in free living organisms. Here we assess the impact of a recently emerged barrier on populations of limnic fauna. Genetic diversity and population structure in a host-parasite system (Wenyonia virilis tapeworm, Synodontis schall catfish) are analyzed in the recently divided Turkana and Nile basins. The two basins, were repeatedly connected during the Holocene wet/dry climatic oscillations, following late Pleistocene dessication of the Turkana basin. Mitochondrial DNA sequences for cytochrome oxidase I gene (cox I) and a whole genome scanning method-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were employed. A total of 347 cox I sequences (representing 209 haplotypes) and 716 AFLP fragments, as well as 120 cox I sequences (20 haplotypes) and 532 AFLP fragments were obtained from parasites and hosts, respectively. Although results indicate that host and parasite populations share some formative traits (bottlenecks, Nilotic origin), their population histories/patterns differ markedly. Mitochondrial analysis revealed that parasite populations evolve significantly faster and show remarkably higher genetic variability. Analyses of both markers confirmed that the parasites undergo lineage fission, forming new clusters specific for either freshwater or saline parts of Lake Turkana. In congruence with the geological history, these clusters apparently indicate multiple colonisations of Lake Turkana from the Nile. In contrast, the host population pattern indicates fusion of different colonisation waves. Although fish host populations remain connected, saline habitats in Lake Turkana (absent in the Nile), apparently pose a barrier to the gene flow in the parasite, possibly due to its multihost lifecycle, which involves freshwater annelids. Despite partially corroborating mitochondrial results, AFLP data was not sufficiently informative for analyzing populations with recently mixed biogeographic histories."

We further classified study subjects who had moderate to severe LUTS and a maximum uroflow rate of less than 15ml/sec into three groups by their defined daily dose (DDD) of 5ARI used. The control group consisted of 7-28 cumulative DDD (cDDD) 5ARI users, while the short-term treatment group was 29-179cDDD 5ARI users, and the long-term treatment group was users of more than 180cDDD 5ARI. Each patient was monitored to identify those who subsequently developed TURP and AUR.TURP and AUR are detected in 5.6% of control group, 7.6% of short-term treatment group and 5.5% of long-term treatment group during 10-year follow up. Compared with the control group, there was no difference in the risk of TURP and AUR in the short-term and long-term treatment groups (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.62 and HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.56, respectively).5ARI therapy did not change the risk of TURP and AUR events in patients with PE, moderate to severe LUTS and a maximum uroflow rate of less than 15 ml/sec in 10 years of follow-up.
