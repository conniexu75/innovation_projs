https://openalex.org/W2066722240,A suspension of mouse spleen cells can be separated into two populations on the basis of their ability or inability to adhere to plastic dishes. It was found that both adherent and nonadherent cells were necessary for the induction of antibody formation to sheep red blood cells in vitro. Exposure of adherent cells to antigen for brief periods of time was sufficient to initiate a maximal in vitro response.

Incubation is performed in antibody-coated, disposable tubes that are finally washed-out with water and counted for quantitation of the bound tracer. The method is simple, rapid, inexpensive, and suitable for automation."

Such responses were deficient in late components. Subthreshold stimuli could elicit sensation with suitable repetition. The primary evoked response was not sufficient for sensation. These facts bear on the problems of neurophysiological correlates of conscious and unconscious experience, and of ""subliminal perception."""
https://openalex.org/W2068188325,"The nucleotide sequence of 5S RNA derived from KB carcinoma cell ribosomes has been determined. The molecule has a length of either 120 or 121 nucleotides with uridine at its 3′-terminus and guanylic acid at its 5′-terminus. If, in addition to Watson-Crick base-pairing, one accepts occasional base-pairing of guanylic acid to uridylic acid, long sequences of complementary nucleotides can be identified within the molecule. Two regions of the molecule contain sequences complementary to four or five bases in the pentanucleotide sequence guanylic acid, ribothymidylic acid, pseudouridylic acid, cytidylic acid, guanylic acid, which is common to most transfer RNA molecules. This is the first time the sequence of an animal-cell RNA has been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1636195124,"The biosynthesis of a bacterial polysaccharide—the surface O-antigen of Salmonella newington—differs in several respects from the more classical example of glycogen synthesis. Sugars are not transferred directly to the antigen from sugar nucleotide precursors but are transferred first into lipid-linked oligosaccharides. Growth of the polysaccharide chain then occurs by assembly of these lipid-linked precursors at the reducing end of the polymer rather than at its nonreducing end as in glycogen. This method of assembly, in which nascent chains are transferred to the next subunit, is analogous to the growth of proteins or fatty acids. It seems possible that these differences reflect the more complex requirements of a surface polysaccharide synthesized by membrane-bound enzymes. If this is the case, then several other polysaccharide systems may be synthesized by comparable mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1530868543,"Abstract 1. A number of steroid metabolites strongly stimulate porphyrin biosynthesis in chick embryo liver cells growing in primary culture. These metabolites are of the 5β-H type; they are derived from the biotransformation of C 19 and C 21 hormones, such as testosterone and progesterone, and they are active in inducing porphyrinogenesis in concentrations at least as low as 10-6 to 10-8 m. Typical inducing steroids are etiocholanolone, pregnandiol, 11-ketopregnanolone, and pregnantriol. Their activities in liver cell culture equal or exceed those of the most potent porphyria-inducing drugs and chemicals previously described. 2. Cholesterol, the major bile acids, and C 21-hydroxylated steroids such as cortisol and aldosterone are inactive in induction; other primary hormones and intermediates have weak activity, as do metabolites of the 5α-H type. 3. The glucuronide derivatives of even potent inducers are devoid of activity. Steroid induction of porphyrin synthesis in vivo, therefore, may be expected to depend, among other factors, on the rate at which the free inducing steroid is glucuronidated and the rate at which the steroid glucuronide is hydrolyzed. 4. These porphyrinogenic steroids are the first recognized general class of physiological agents which have potent porphyrin-inducing action in liver cells. Because they also stimulate heme synthesis in chick blastoderm erythroid cells, it is suggested as a working hypothesis that they may normally play a role in the control of heme biosynthesis in all cells through regulation of the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. 5. These porphyrinogenic steroids may also be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic porphyria in man, particularly at times when uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid formation or uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid-transferase activity for steroids becomes inhibited or limiting."

https://openalex.org/W2149137201,"Abstract The experiments described in this communication were carried out in order to compare certain aspects of the chemistry of ribonuclease T1 from Aspergillus oryzae with those of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A. The primary structures of these enzymes of different specificities are known and are very dissimilar; ribonuclease A is a basic protein whereas ribonuclease T1 is acidic. Ribonuclease T1, like the bovine enzyme, is inactivated by reaction with a 180- to 300-fold molar excess of iodoacetate at pH 5.5 and 37°, but not by iodoacetamide. The time for 50% inactivation is 1 hour, which is considerably longer than that for ribonuclease A, and the rate of inactivation is maximal at pH 5.5. Use of 14C-labeled reagent has shown that inactivation is accompanied by the incorporation of 1 carboxymethyl group per molecule of enzyme. The reaction is inhibited by the presence of polyvalent anions such as citrate or phosphate, by metallic cations such as Cu++ or Zn++, and by substrate analogues such as 2'- or 3'-guanylic acids. The inactivation reaction is also inhibited by 8 m urea and thus requires the native three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. Amino acid analyses of acid hydrolysates of the inactivated protein are indistinguishable from analyses of the parent enzyme; hence no reaction has occurred with residues of histidine or lysine which yield acid-stable carboxymethyl derivatives, and which are the sites of alkylation in pancreatic ribonuclease A. One equivalent of glycolic acid can be detected in the hydrolysate. The glycolic acid can be released from the protein by 1 m hydroxylamine at pH 9 in 8 m urea. Upon the working hypothesis that an ester had been formed on the carboxyl group of an aspartic or a glutamic acid residue, the aklylated protein was hydrolyzed by Nagarse to permit chromatographic isolation of a 14C-labeled peptide. The peptide proved to have been derived from Residues 57 to 62: Tyr-Glu-Trp-Pro-Ile-Leu. Hydrolysis of the peptide by aminopeptidase M yielded most of the expected amino acids (but no glutamic acid) plus a new ninhydrin-positive component which has been proved by synthesis to be the γ-carboxymethyl ester of glutamic acid. These experiments establish the presence of a highly reactive γ-carboxyl group at Glu-58 at the active center of ribonuclease T1. The failure of iodoacetamide to inactivate the enzyme indicates that there may be a positively charged group in the molecule which attracts the iodoacetate anion toward the active center and helps to orient the alkylating agent so as to cause the unexpected carboxymethylation of an essential carboxyl group in a glutamic acid residue. The enzyme is inactivated by the relatively small change involved in moving a carboxyl group about 4 A (from —COO- to —COOCH2COO-)."
https://openalex.org/W1993091017,"Action potentials, with no accompanying contraction, were recorded from muscle fibers in which the transverse tubular system had been disrupted. The results show that action potentials require an intact transverse tubular system to cause contraction. Furthermore, both the after-depolarization following a single action potential and the slower, late afterpotential following a train of action potentials were absent in this preparation. Therefore, both phenomena must normally involve the transverse tubular system."
https://openalex.org/W1593374398,"Abstract A study has been made of the changes with pH of the fluorescence spectrum and quantum yield of lysozyme and lysozyme complexes with di-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and tri-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. The fluorescence changes are associated with changes of ionization of certain carboxyl groups in the acid pH region and tyrosine groups in the basic pH region. The greater fluorescence loss for the complexed enzyme in the acid pH region is interpreted as the result of a localized conformational change which takes place upon binding these inhibitors, effecting the greater availability of carboxyl groups for quenching tryptophan residues in the binding site. A partial separation of the fluorescence spectra and quantum yield contributions of the 3 tryptophan residues involved in binding the tri-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine was possible with the use of difference fluorescence spectra. It was shown that 2 of these residues in the binding site are in an aqueous environment in the free enzyme and in a less aqueous environment in the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The spectrum of each of these residues was obtained for the complex and shown to be different, which indicates a difference in the local environment around each residue. The difference spectral method has also shown that tryptophan residues that are in a nonaqueous environment are preferentially quenched by ionized tyrosine via long range energy transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1594555563,"Abstract An aminopeptidase has been demonstrated in the bovine anterior pituitary which hydrolyzes dipeptidyl residues from the amino terminus of peptides containing a minimum of 4 residues. Tetraalanine and hexaalanine are completely hydrolyzed to dialanine, whereas pentaalanine is cleaved to dialanine and trialanine. N-Acetyltetraalanine is not hydrolyzed. Similarly, tetralysine and tetraphenylalanine are hydrolyzed to the respective dipeptides; tetraglutamic acid and tetraglycine are not attacked. Of the dipeptidyl-β-naphthylamides (βNA), only Arg-Arg-βNA is readily hydrolyzed, yielding Arg-Arg and β-naphthylamine, and appears to serve as a relatively specific substrate since Ala-Ala-βNA, Lys-Lys-βNA, Gly-Arg-βNA, Ser-Tyr-βNA, Leu-Ala-βNA, and Lys-Ala-βNA are not attacked. The optimum for the hydrolysis of the susceptible substrates lies at pH 8.5 to 9.0. The maximal rate of hydrolysis of Arg-Arg-βNA occurs at 0.04 mm; greater concentrations of substrate as well as the product, Arg-Arg, are inhibitory. The enzyme is inhibited by thiol reagents and activated by thiol compounds. A 500-fold purification can be achieved by fractionation with (NH4)2SO4 and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose."

The complex diet consumed during predation apparently activates the corpus allatum, and the hormone released acts independently on organ growth and sexual behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1578017728,"The turnover rates of the protein components of rat liver, kidney, and brain mitochondria were determined. In liver mitochondria, all protein components had an identical half-life of 8.5 days. In kidney mitochondria, the water-soluble proteins had a half-life of 5.9 days which was significantly shorter than that of the whole mitochondria, 8.6 days. The other protein components of kidney mitochondria had half-lives which did not differ significantly from that of the whole mitochondria. A similar situation was obtained with brain mitochondria in which the water-soluble proteins had a half-life of 17.9 days as compared to 26.3 days for the whole mitochondria. It is of interest that these water-soluble proteins appear to be synthesized extramitochondrially and then subsequently integrated into the mitochondrial structure."

https://openalex.org/W1546504247,"Abstract Model peptide substrates, e.g. glycyl-l-tyrosine, and inhibitors, e.g. β-(p-iodophenyl)propionate, are shown at 6 A resolution to bind to crystalline carboxypeptidase Aα in regions near the zinc atom. Although the question of bond formation of these added molecules to zinc must await studies at higher resolution, the present studies are not inconsistent with a direct role for the metal in enzymic reactions. Binding of glycyl-l-tyrosine to either native or acetylated crystals produces an increase in electron density in two adjacent regions (A and B) near the zinc. The main region (A) extends into the enzyme's pocket from above the zinc and is attributed to Gly-Tyr bound with its tyrosyl side chain projected into the pocket. Gly-Tyr bound to either apo- or copper-carboxypeptidase increases electron density only in Region A. Furthermore, there appears to be a structural change in the enzyme when substrates are bound to the native or modified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1498352465,"Abstract The synthesis of N-acetyl-l-isoasparagine and of N-acetyl-l-isoglutamine is reported. The acid dissociation constants of these compounds, and those of their corresponding N-carbobenzoxy derivatives, have been measured. Since these compounds are uncharged molecules of the type —NH—CH(—CH2COOH)—CO— or the corresponding glutamyl homologue, their dissociation constants represent the intrinsic dissociation constants of aspartyl and glutamyl side chains in polypeptide chains. Additional values for these constants were obtained from pK values of charged molecules of the same type, after calculating corrections for the effects of the charges. All results obtained in this way are consistent, and indicate that aspartyl carboxyl groups are significantly more acidic than glutamyl carboxyl groups. Intrinsic pK values at 25° and zero ionic strength are 4.08 ± 0.05 for aspartyl groups and 4.50 ± 0.06 for glutamyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1719405939,"Abstract A variety of rat tissues have the ability to hydrolyze 1-l-β-aspartamido[-2-acetamido]-1,2-dideoxy-β-d-glucose. In rat liver and kidney the enzyme is present in lysosomes. The lysosomal nature of the enzyme was established by the amount of enzyme sedimentable with mitochondrial and light mitochondrial particles, by the purification of lysosomes, and by the isolation of Triton WR 1339-filled liver lysosomes. Freezing and thawing, osmotic shock, and treatment with Triton X-100 resulted in the release of the enzyme from lysosomes. The kidney lysosomal enzyme was purified 430-fold by Sephadex gel filtration and the liver enzyme 650-fold by chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. In both instances the enzyme was well separated from β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 7.6. The Km was 5.9 x 10-4 m. The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, and by copper and nickel ions. Other divalent metal ions did not have any effect. The enzyme was quite stable in dilute solutions for prolonged periods of time. The purified enzyme had no asparaginase activity, but liberated aspartic acid from the substrate. It is concluded that the enzyme is an amidase. It is suggested that the amidase is involved in the intracellular digestion of glycoproteins."

When the flash is fired as soon as possible after the reaction of human deoxyhemoglobin with carbon monoxide or immediately after dilution of a concentrated human carbon monoxide hemoglobin solution, little of the quickly reacting form is present; the amount of quickly reacting material increases with time and reaches its final value in a few seconds. The results may be due to dissociation of ligand bound hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1566874159,"Abstract Bovine nucleus pulposus has been found to be a good source of a series of proteinpolysaccharides containing chondroitin 6-sulfate and keratan sulfate. Six distinct fractions have been separated, totaling 40% of the dry weight of the tissue. Each fraction contains protein, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and keratan sulfate, but the proportions of these components are different in each fraction. Of these six fractions, the one called PPL3 is obtained in largest yield (17%), has the lowest content of protein (14%) and the highest content of chondroitin sulfate (45%), and also contains keratan sulfate (35%). On sedimentation velocity studies in the analytical ultracentrifuge under a wide range of conditions, it appears to be homogeneous. Sedimentation equilibrium studies at low initial concentrations indicate some degree of polydispersity and a weight average molecular weight of 171,000. On zone electrophoresis the chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and protein move together. Fraction PPL3 has almost the same amino acid profile as the corresponding fraction from bovine nasal cartilage, although these fractions differ greatly in protein and keratan sulfate contents. The data provide reasons to believe that chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate are parts of the same molecule. Three other fractions, called PPL4, PPL5, and PPL6, show a regular increase in sedimentation velocity, a regular decrease in speed of migration on zone electrophoresis, a regular increase in protein content, and a ratio of chondroitin sulfate to keratan sulfate which is constant (0.62) and differs from that of PPL3 (1.3). For each of these fractions, on zone electrophoresis, protein, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate stand or move together. There is no evidence that in this tissue any independent kinetic component exists which contains only chondroitin sulfate or only keratan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1513244880,"Abstract In the presence of ATP, Pi, and magnesium ions, rat kidney mitochondria converted pyruvate and bicarbonate mainly to malate, fumarate, and citrate. Pyruvate carboxylase activity was estimated by measuring the amounts of products formed and the radioactive bicarbonate retained. When glutamate was added to the system, radioactive aspartate was formed without changing the incorporation of radioactivity into malate and citrate. High concentrations of pyruvate, magnesium ions, or bicarbonate inhibited pyruvate carboxylation, as did the absence of added Pi. Addition of short chain fatty acids or of acylcarnitines of various chain lengths decreased pyruvate decarboxylation. In the presence of octanoate and hexanoate, the formation of malate and citrate and the incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate were slightly decreased. The addition of ammonium chloride led to formation of small amounts of aspartate, but otherwise did not alter product formation or bicarbonate incorporation. With liver mitochondria, addition of ammonium chloride permitted formation of aspartate and glutamate in large quantities and malate production was depressed. With kidney mitochondria, the addition of malate, succinate, α-ketoglutarate, or citrate led to large increases in bicarbonate incorporation into malate. Similar but smaller effects were observed with liver mitochondria. It is concluded that kidney pyruvate carboxylase is sufficiently active to permit this organ to contribute significantly to gluconeogenesis in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1520028113,"Abstract An acetone powder of cat brain catalyzed the synthesis of two radioactive products when incubated with l-aspartate-14C and acetyl coenzyme A. The products were identified as N-acetyl-aspartic acid and citric acid. A water extract of the powder contained the system that produced citrate-14C, while the residue contained the aspartate N-acetyltransferase activity. The soluble system rather than the residue exhibited characteristics previously reported for a soluble aspartate N-acetyltransferase preparation of rat brain; hence, it is suggested that previous investigators were not measuring true l-aspartate N-acetyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2069600913,"A first experiment compared the behavior of goldfish injected with puromycin immediately after each of a weekly series of brief discriminative training sessions in the shuttlebox to that of appropriate controls. Discrimination was not prevented, nor was escape from shock impaired, but probability of response to the conditioned stimuli, both positive and negative, was reduced substantially. These results suggest that puromycin interferes with the consolidation of conditioned fear. The null outcome of a second experiment, in which all training was given in a single long session instead of a series of short sessions, suggests (contrary to recent indications) that consolidation begins in the training session. The conditioned-fear hypothesis is supported by the results of a third experiment in which the animals were shocked upon entering a goalbox to which they had previously learned to swim for food; animals injected with puromycin, immediately after the shock, entered the goalbox more readily 1 week later than did appropriate controls."
https://openalex.org/W1533975617,"Abstract Crystalline phosphoglucose isomerases isolated from brewers' and from bakers' yeast have each been resolved into three isoenzyme fractions. The separate identity of the isoenzymes has been demonstrated analytically by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate at pH 4.7, 5.2, and 6.5. Separation on a preparative scale has been achieved by column chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose with a sodium phosphate gradient at pH 6.0. The following points were investigated in order to establish the origin of the multiple forms of the enzyme. Crystalline phosphoglucose isomerases isolated from three yeast species were all found to contain three isoenzyme fractions. The chromatographic procedure itself was shown not to be responsible for the appearance of the different protein fractions. Conditions known to favor possible proteolysis neither altered the qualitative behavior of the isoenzymes nor changed the relative amounts of isoenzymes found after chromatographic separation. Three isoenzymes were also found in a phosphoglucose isomerase preparation crystallized after isolation from a live, genetically homogeneous yeast culture, thus excluding the possibility that in the dried yeast the existence of several isoenzymes might be explained by assuming genetically mixed strains. All results obtained support the conclusion that the isoenzymes exist in vivo and that they are not artifacts of the purification procedures."

https://openalex.org/W1595484306,"Abstract The effects of parathyroid hormone upon substrate decarboxylation and ion uptake and release in isolated mitochondria in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and the correlation between action in vivo and in vitro were studied. Parathyroid hormone added to isolated liver or kidney mitochondria in vitro stimulated the decarboxylation of a variety of Krebs' cycle intermediates. This decarboxylation required specific ion environments and in particular was not seen if chloride was the only anion present. In contrast, polylysine, histone, dinitrophenol, Zn++, and a basic nonhormonal peptide from the parathyroid glands all stimulated decarboxylation in a chloride medium. The effects of these basic polypeptides were inhibited completely by polyglutamic acid which did not greatly alter the effect of parathyroid hormone. The actions of these basic polypeptides were partially blocked by bovine serum albumin or by serum from parathyroidectomized animals, both of which enhanced the effect of parathyroid hormone. Specificity was also examined by comparing the effect of four different chemical modifications of the parathyroid hormone molecule upon succinate decarboxylation in vitro with their effects in a standard rat assay in vivo. There was a comparable loss of potency in the two assays with each derivative examined. Under optimum conditions in vitro, 2 x 10-8 m hormone produced a 2-fold increase in rate of succinate decarboxylation. This is well above the concentration found in normal plasma, but approaches that found in the plasma of patients with chronic secondary hyperparathyroidism. Conditions were defined under which the addition of parathyroid hormone to rat kidney mitochondria in vitro led to either enhanced or decreased uptake of calcium. The factor determining which of these effects was produced appeared to be the ionic composition of the medium. These data led to the following conclusions: (a) the effect of parathyroid hormone upon mitochondrial metabolism is highly specific; (b) concentrations of hormone which approach those seen in vivo are effective; and (c) there is a significant correlation between the effects that the hormone produces in vivo and those that it induces in vitro."

Comparison of the 3-acetamido-1,2,4-tri-O-acetyl-3,6-dideoxyhexose with 3-acetamido-1,2,4-tri-O-acetyl-3,6-dideoxy-l-glucose was made.

Contrary to an earlier report, several other amphibian species also have been shown to contain plasma oxidase activity. A unique feature of purified frog ceruloplasmin is its inhibition by HCO3- in contrast to human ceruloplasmin which is not affected by HCO3-. Tadpole and frog ceruloplasmin are also inhibited by certain dialyzable plasma constituents, providing a potential regulatory mechanism for plasma oxidase activity. However, in contrast to frog plasma, the inhibition of tadpole ceruloplasmin activity cannot be accounted for in terms of the HCO3- and Cl- content of the blood. The basis for this inhibition and the relationship of frog plasma oxidase activity to other plasma metalloproteins is also discussed."

Chem., 199, 585 (1952)) except for the omission of lyophilization of the initial extract (which destroys coenzyme Q reductase activity) and was found to reduce long chain coenzyme Q homologues quite rapidly. Cytochrome c and coenzyme Q reductase activities were not separable during the isolation procedure or on subsequent chromatography on hydroxylapatite and were properties of a single ultracentrifugal component. Coenzyme Q reductase activity is more labile than cytochrome c reductase activity during purification of the soluble enzyme or storage of the parent particles. Hence, when the enzyme is extracted from stored particles or is lyophilized overnight after extraction, a flavoprotein with low or no coenzyme Q reductase activity may be obtained. NADH-coenzyme Q reductase was extracted from phosphorylating particles and purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. The two preparations sedimented with the same velocity in the double sector cell of the analytical ultracentrifuge and thus their molecular weights appear to be the same. These data and previous work showing the close similarity of NADH-cytochrome c and NADH-coenzyme Q reductases in various catalytic assays, composition, absorption spectrum, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to rotenone and amytal in coenzyme Q6 and Q10 reductase assays, suggest that they are closely related fragments of the NADH dehydrogenase molecule. A disparity between the two flavoproteins has been observed in electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and chromatography on hydroxylapatite, but these divergences may be only expressions of relatively minor differences in conformation."

https://openalex.org/W2075065693,Injections of biological specimens and substrates with cesium were made with a small accelerator in the energy range of 20 to 1000 electron volts. Subsequent electron microscopic examination demonstrated that the contrast and appearance of the specimen depend on its structure and on the energy of injection. Substrate noise is decreased over conventional contrasting techniques. The same accelerator provides controlled etching of the specimen.
