https://openalex.org/W3014826571,"Intestinal homeostasis is tightly regulated by complex yet poorly understood signaling networks. Here, we demonstrate that Lats1/2, the core Hippo kinases, are essential to maintain Wnt pathway activity and intestinal stem cells. Lats1/2 deletion leads to loss of intestinal stem cells but drives Wnt-uncoupled crypt expansion. To explore the function of downstream transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors, we identified a selective small-molecule reversible inhibitor of TEAD auto-palmitoylation that directly occupies its lipid-binding site and inhibits TEAD-mediated transcription in vivo. Combining this chemical tool with genetic and proteomics approaches, we show that intestinal Wnt inhibition by Lats deletion is Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional activator with PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) dependent but TEAD independent. Mechanistically, nuclear YAP/TAZ interact with Groucho/Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split (TLE) to block Wnt/T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated transcription, and dual inhibition of TEAD and Lats suppresses Wnt-uncoupled Myc upregulation and epithelial over-proliferation in Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-mutated intestine. Our studies highlight a pharmacological approach to inhibit TEAD palmitoylation and have important implications for targeting Wnt and Hippo signaling in human malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W3014758815,"Postingestive nutrient sensing can induce food preferences. However, much less is known about the ability of postingestive signals to modulate food-seeking behaviors. Here we report a causal connection between postingestive sucrose sensing and vagus-mediated dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), supporting food seeking. The activity of VTA dopamine neurons increases significantly after administration of intragastric sucrose, and deletion of the NMDA receptor in these neurons, which affects bursting and plasticity, abolishes lever pressing for postingestive sucrose delivery. Furthermore, lesions of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve significantly impair postingestive-dependent VTA dopamine neuron activity and food seeking, whereas optogenetic stimulation of left vagus nerve neurons significantly increases VTA dopamine neuron activity. These data establish a necessary role of vagus-mediated dopamine neuron activity in postingestive-dependent food seeking, which is independent of taste signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3014245704,"State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence methods are increasingly leveraged in clinical predictive modeling to provide clinical decision support systems to physicians. Modern ML approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and tree boosting often perform better than more traditional methods like logistic regression. On the other hand, these modern methods yield a limited understanding of the resulting predictions. However, in the medical domain, understanding of applied models is essential, in particular, when informing clinical decision support. Thus, in recent years, interpretability methods for modern ML methods have emerged to potentially allow explainable predictions paired with high performance. To our knowledge, we present in this work the first explainability comparison of two modern ML methods, tree boosting and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), to traditional logistic regression methods using a stroke outcome prediction paradigm. Here, we used clinical features to predict a dichotomized 90 days post-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. For interpretability, we evaluated clinical features' importance with regard to predictions using deep Taylor decomposition for MLP, Shapley values for tree boosting and model coefficients for logistic regression. With regard to performance as measured by Area under the Curve (AUC) values on the test dataset, all models performed comparably: Logistic regression AUCs were 0.83, 0.83, 0.81 for three different regularization schemes; tree boosting AUC was 0.81; MLP AUC was 0.83. Importantly, the interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across models by rating age and stroke severity consecutively amongst the most important predictive features. For less important features, some differences were observed between the methods. Our analysis suggests that modern machine learning methods can provide explainability which is compatible with domain knowledge interpretation and traditional method rankings. Future work should focus on replication of these findings in other datasets and further testing of different explainability methods."
https://openalex.org/W3014126190,"Peripheral nerve injury in the upper extremity is linked to high socioeconomic burden, yet cost-analyses are rare and from small cohorts. The objective of this study was to determine the costs and long-term socioeconomic effects of peripheral nerve injuries in the upper extremity in Germany.We analyzed data of 250 patients with 268 work-related upper extremity nerve injuries from acute treatment to long-term follow-up on rehabilitation, sick-leave and disability-pension.Patients were on average 39.9±14.2 years old, male (85%) and mean inpatient treatment was 7±6 days. Location of nerve was 8% (N = 19) proximal to the wrist, 26% (N = 65) at the wrist and metacarpus, and 66% (N = 166) at phalangeal level. Acute in-patient treatment for (single) median nerve injury accounted for 66% with hospital reimbursement of 3.570€, ulnar nerve injury for 24% and 2.650€ and radial nerve injury for 10% and 3.166€, all including finger nerve injuries. The remaining were combined nerve injuries, with significantly higher costs, especially if combined with tendon 5.086€ or vascular injury 4.886€. Based on location, nerve injuries proximal to the wrist averaged 5.360±6.429€, at the wrist and metacarpus 3.534±2.710€ and at the phalangeal level 3.418±3.330€. 16% required rehabilitation with average costs of 5.842€ and stay of 41±21 days. Sick leave was between 11-1109 days with an average of 147 days with socioeconomic costs of 197€/day, equaling on average 17.640€. 30% received a mean yearly disability pension of 3.187€, that would account to 102.167€ per lifetime.This large German patient sample indicates that nerve injury has a major impact on function and employment, resulting in significant health care costs. Both proximal and distal nerve injuries led to long-term disability, subsequent sick-leave and in 30% to permanent disability pension. These data are determined to support future studies and health economical work on prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of these often small injuries with great consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3014802233,"Retaining patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ensuring good adherence remain cornerstone of long-term viral suppression. In this era of test and treat (T&T) policy, ensuring that patients starting ART remain connected to HIV clinics is key to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Currently, limited studies have evaluated the effect of early ART initiation on loss to follow up in a routine health care delivery setting. We studied the cumulative incidence, incidence rate of loss to follow up (LTFU), and factors associated with LTFU in a primary healthcare clinic that has practiced T&T since 2012.We retrospectively analyzed extracted routine program data on patients who started ART from January 2012 to 4th July 2016. We defined LTFU as failure of a patient to return to the HIV clinic for at least 90 days from the date of their last appointment. We calculated cumulative incidence, incidence rate and fitted a multivariable Cox proportion hazards regression model to determine factors associated with LTFU.Of the 7,553 patients included in our sample, 3,231 (42.8%) started ART within seven days following HIV diagnosis. There were 1,180 cases of LTFU observed over 15,807.7 person years at risk. The overall incidence rate (IR) of LTFU was 7.5 (95% CI, 7.1-7.9) per 100 person years of observation (pyo). Cumulative incidence of LTFU increased with duration of follow up from 8.9% (95% CI, 8.2-9.6%) at 6 months to 20.2% (95% CI, 19.0-21.4%) at 48 months. Predictors of elevated risk of LTFU were: starting ART within 7 days following HIV diagnosis ((aHR) = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.50-1.91), lack of a telephone set (aHR = 1.52, 95% CI, 1.35-1.71), CD4 cell count of 200-350μ/ml (aHR = 1.21, 95% CI, 1.01-1.45) and baseline WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 (aHR = 1.35, 95% CI, 1.10-1.65). Factors associated with a reduced risk of LTFU were: baseline age ≥25 years (aHR ranging from 0.62, 95% CI, 0.47-0.81 for age group 25-29 years to 0.24, 95% CI, 0.13-0.44 for age group ≥50 years), at least primary education level (aHR ranging from aHR = 0.77, 95% CI, 0.62-0.94 for primary education level to 0.50, 95% CI, 0.34-0.75 for post-secondary education level), and having a BMI ≥ 30 (aHR = 0.28, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51).The risk of loss to follow up increased with time and was higher among patients who started ART within seven days following HIV diagnosis, higher among patients without a telephone set, lower among patients aged ≥ 25 years, lower among patients with at least primary education and lower among patients with BMI of ≥ 30. In this era of T&T, it will be important for HIV programs to initiate and continue enhanced therapeutic education programs that target high risk groups, as well as leveraging on mHealth to improve patients' retention on ART throughout the cascade of care."
https://openalex.org/W3014953903,"Gathering of uncultivated food from green spaces, also known as foraging, is observed in urban areas across the world, but the literature focuses predominantly on the global north. Our study examines the existing urban land management structure and its approach to urban foraging in the eastern coastal region of South Africa. Through interviews with municipal officials in nine cities, we identified different stakeholders and their roles in urban green space management. We then used network analysis to represent interactions and influence of these stakeholders, and environmental worldviews to determine organisational and perceptual barriers to and enablers of foraging in urban green spaces. The policy on urban green space management, as well as land managers themselves are amenable to the concept of foraging in public spaces. Lack of knowledge on wild indigenous species and sustainable offtake, ambiguous, coarse, or lacking policy, and normative views of pristine nature may hinder foraging. We recommend pathways for policy and stakeholder partnerships to incorporate sustainable foraging in their biodiversity conservation and land stewardship strategies."

https://openalex.org/W3014893893,"This investigation examined anthropometric, hormonal, and physiological differences between advanced (ADV; n = 8, 27.8 ± 4.2 years, 170 ± 11 cm, 79.8 ± 13.3 kg) and recreational (REC; n = 8, 33.5 ± 8.1 years, 172 ± 14 cm, 76.3 ± 19.5 kg) CrossFit (CF) trained participants in comparison to physically-active controls (CON; n = 7, 27.5 ± 6.7 years, 171 ± 14 cm, 74.5 ± 14.3 kg). ADV and REC were distinguished by their past competitive success. REC and CON were resistance-trained (>2 years) and exercised on 3-5 days·wk-1 for the past year, but CON utilized traditional resistance and cardiovascular exercise. All participants provided a fasted, resting blood sample and completed assessments of resting metabolic rate, body composition, muscle morphology, isometric mid-thigh pull strength, peak aerobic capacity, and a 3-minute maximal cycle ergometer sprint across two separate occasions (separated by 3-7 days). Blood samples were analyzed for testosterone, cortisol, and insulin-like growth factor-1. Compared to both REC and CON, one-way analysis of variance revealed ADV to possess lower body fat percentage (6.7-8.3%, p = 0.007), greater bone and non-bone lean mass (12.5-26.8%, p ≤ 0.028), muscle morphology characteristics (14.2-59.9%, p < 0.05), isometric strength characteristics (15.4-41.8%, p < 0.05), peak aerobic capacity (18.8-19.1%, p = 0.002), and 3-minute cycling performance (15.4-51.1%, p ≤ 0.023). No differences were seen between REC and CON, or between all groups for resting metabolic rate or hormone concentrations. These data suggest ADV possess several physiological advantages over REC and CON, whereas similar physiological characteristics were present in individuals who have been regularly participating in either CF or resistance and cardiovascular training for the past year."
https://openalex.org/W3015041260,"Clinical ketosis (CK) and subclinical ketosis (SCK) are associated with lower milk production, lower reproductive performance, an increased culling of cows and an increased probability of other disorders. Quantifying the costs related to ketosis will enable veterinarians and farmers to make more informed decisions regarding the prevention and treatment of the disease. The overall aim of this study was to estimate the combined costs of CK and SCK using assumptions and input variables from a typical Dutch context. A herd level dynamic stochastic simulation model was developed, simulating 385 herds with 130 cows each. In the default scenario there was a CK probability of almost 1% and a SCK probability of 11%. The herds under the no risk scenario had no CK and SCK, while the herds under the high-risk scenario had a doubled probability of CK and SCK compared to the default scenario. The results from the simulation model were used to estimate the annual cash flows of the herds, including the costs related to milk production losses, treatment, displaced abomasum, mastitis, calf management, culling and feed, as well as the returns from sales of milk and calves. The difference between the annual net cash flows of farms in the no risk scenario and the default scenario provides the estimate of the herd level costs of ketosis. Average herd level costs of ketosis (CK and SCK combined) were €3,613 per year for a default farm and €7,371 per year for a high-risk farm. The costs for a single CK case were on average €709 (with 5 and 95 percentiles of €64 and €1,196, respectively), while the costs for a single SCK case were on average €150 (with 5 and 95 percentiles of €18 and €422, respectively) for the default farms. The differences in costs between cases occurred due to differences between cases (e.g., cow culled vs cow not culled, getting another disease vs not getting another disease)."
https://openalex.org/W3014198893,"Little is known about how activists and non-activists perceive and evaluate each other. This is important because activists often depend on societal support to achieve their goals. We examined these perceptions and evaluations in three field experiments set in different contexts, i.e., student protests in the Netherlands 2014/2015 (Study 1, activist sample N = 190; Study 2, non-activist sample N = 145), and environmental protests in Paris in 2015 (Study 3, activist sample N = 112). Through a scenario method, we manipulated the motivations expressed for (in)action by a member of the other group (i.e., an activist or non-activist) and measured individuals’ perceptions and evaluations. Findings showed that activists perceived a non-activist as selfish and felt personally distant to them, especially when a non-activist dismissed moral obligation for action (Study 1 and 3). By contrast, non-activists had a rather positive view of activists, especially in response to an activist communicating collective concerns for action (Study 2). Study 4 (N = 103) further supported this pattern of findings by showing that activists perceived larger intergroup differences than non-activists. We conclude that mutual perceptions and evaluations of activists and non-activists are asymmetrical, which may have (negative) consequences for mobilization for social change."
https://openalex.org/W3015165231,"The early life gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining the intestinal barrier, with disturbances in these communities linked to dysregulated renewal and replenishment of intestinal epithelial cells. Here we sought to determine pathological cell shedding outcomes throughout the postnatal developmental period, and which host and microbial factors mediate these responses. Surprisingly, neonatal mice (Day 14 and 21) were highly refractory to induction of cell shedding after intraperitoneal administration of liposaccharide (LPS), with Day 29 mice showing strong pathological responses, more similar to those observed in adult mice. These differential responses were not linked to defects in the cellular mechanisms and pathways known to regulate cell shedding responses. When we profiled microbiota and metabolites, we observed significant alterations. Neonatal mice had high relative abundances of Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterococcus and increased primary bile acids. In contrast, older mice were dominated by Candidatus Arthromitus, Alistipes, and Lachnoclostridium, and had increased concentrations of SCFAs and methyamines. Antibiotic treatment of neonates restored LPS-induced small intestinal cell shedding, whereas adult fecal microbiota transplant alone had no effect. Our findings further support the importance of the early life window for microbiota-epithelial interactions in the presence of inflammatory stimuli and highlights areas for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3015177547,"Hand hygiene is the simplest and most effective measure for preventing healthcare-associated infections. Despite the simplicity of this procedure and advances made in infection control, hospital health care workers’ compliance to hand hygiene recommendations is generally low. Nurses have the most frequent patient care interactions, and thus more opportunities to practice hand hygiene. As such, it is important to identify and understand determinants of nurses’ reported compliance. Formative research was undertaken to assess the potential impact of several unexamined factors that could influence HH among nurses: professional role and status, social affiliation, social norms, and physical modifications to the work environment (as well as institutional factors like safety climate). A survey questionnaire was developed primarily to inform the creation of a behaviour change intervention. The survey looked at how these factors influence HH among nurses and sought to identify barriers and levers to reported hand hygiene. It was administered to a survey panel of acute care nurses, working in US hospitals, with a year or more of experience. Multivariate regression modelling suggested that reported hand hygiene compliance was most likely to be a function of a hospital management’s communication openness, perceived performance by peers, increased interactions with patients and other staff members, and the reduction in stress, busyness, and cognitive load associated with role performance. A powerful, effective intervention on HH among nurses therefore could be directed at improving communication openness, consider the impact of perceived performance by peers, increase interactions with patients and staff, and determine how to reduce the stress and cognitive load associated with role performance."
https://openalex.org/W3014519033,"Introduction Cervical cancer is the most common type of malignancy among all malignancies for women worldwide with 266 000 deaths every year. Even though there is a proven importance of cervical cancer screening, the death of women due to cervical cancer in Ethiopia is high. We, therefore, did this study to investigate the utilization of cancer screening and its associated factors among women in Debremarkos town, Amhara region, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women from 30–49 years in Debremarkos town, from July 1 to August 30, 2018. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 822 women in the study. We used EPI info version 7 for data entry and SPSS version 24 software for cleaning and analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the utilization of cervical cancer screening. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were taken as significant variables. Result The study revealed that 44 (5.4%) of women have been screened for cervical cancer. Women’s age [AOR:3.126(1.246,7.845)], marital status (AOR:3.41(1.299,8.972)], educational status(secondary education level [AOR: 4.578(95% CI: 1.19, 17.65)] and College and above education level [AOR:7.27,95%CI: 2.07,25.513)]), started sexual intercourse for the first time below 16 years[AOR:3.021(1.84,4.97)], history of multiple sexual partners [AOR:2.51(1.040, 6.06)], history of sexually transmitted disease [AOR:4.04(1.68, 9.72),], knowledge on cervical cancer screening [AOR:4.02(2.07,7.77)] and attitude towards cervical cancer screening [AOR:3.23(2.52,4.12)] were significant factors for utilization of cervical cancer screening Conclusion This study showed the magnitude of the utilization of cervical cancer screening is very low. Women’s age, marital status, educational status, age at first sex history of multiple sexual partners and sexually transmitted disease, knowledge and attitude were important factors of screening. Therefore, intervention programs that are aimed at improving cervical cancer screening practice among women should focus on the identified factors."
https://openalex.org/W3014175908,"The trabecular meshwork (TM) is an ocular tissue that maintains intraocular pressure (IOP) within a physiologic range. Glaucoma patients have reduced TM cellularity and, frequently, elevated IOP. To establish a stem cell-based approach to restoring TM function and normalizing IOP, human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were induced to differentiate to TM cells in vitro. These ADSC-TM cells displayed a TM cell-like genotypic profile, became phagocytic, and responded to dexamethasone stimulation, characteristic of TM cells. After transplantation into naive mouse eyes, ADSCs and ADSC-TM cells integrated into the TM tissue, expressed TM cell markers, and maintained normal IOP, outflow facility, and extracellular matrix. Cell migration and affinity results indicated that the chemokine pair CXCR4/SDF1 may play an important role in ADSC-TM cell homing. Our study demonstrates the possibility of applying autologous or allogeneic ADSCs and ADSC-TM cells as a potential treatment to restore TM structure and function in glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W3014383924,"α-synuclein (aSyn) is a major player in Parkinson's disease and a group of other disorders collectively known as synucleinopathies, but the precise molecular mechanisms involved are still unclear. aSyn, as virtually all proteins, undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications during its lifetime, which can affect its biology and pathobiology. We recently showed that glycation of aSyn by methylglyoxal (MGO) potentiates its oligomerization and toxicity, induces dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in mice, and affects motor performance in flies. Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that facilitate the folding of proteins or target misfolded proteins for clearance. Importantly, sHsps were shown to prevent aSyn aggregation and cytotoxicity. Upon treating cells with increasing amounts of methylglyoxal, we found that the levels of Hsp27 decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we hypothesized that restoring the levels of Hsp27 in glycating environments could alleviate the pathogenicity of aSyn. Consistently, we found that Hsp27 reduced MGO-induced aSyn aggregation in cells, leading to the formation of nontoxic aSyn species. Remarkably, increasing the levels of Hsp27 suppressed the deleterious effects induced by MGO. Our findings suggest that in glycating environments, the levels of Hsp27 are important for modulating the glycation-associated cellular pathologies in synucleinopathies."

Using 2018 Annual Questionnaire data from The PRIDE Study, area under the curve (AUC) values were compared to identify which screening methods (“4 or more” or “5 or more” drinks on one occasion in the past year, or one or more items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT]) best predicted (i) harmful alcohol use and (ii) one or more past year alcohol dependence symptoms or consequences. Among 1892 participants, “5 or more” drinks on one occasion (AUC ranges: 0.82–0.86) performed better than “4 or more” drinks (AUC ranges: 0.78–0.81) in predicting harmful drinking. The screening methods “4 or more” drinks, “5 or more” drinks, and the consumption items of the AUDIT (AUDIT-C) using a cutoff score of 3 all maximized sensitivity and specificity to predict alcohol dependence symptoms or consequences in gender minority people overall (AUC: 0.77–0.78). Screening for “5 or more” drinks on one occasion within the past year performed as well as or better than other screening methods to detect both harmful drinking and alcohol dependence-related symptoms or consequences. This single-item screening method can identify if more extensive alcohol use assessment is warranted with gender minority people."
https://openalex.org/W3014682030,"Hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a pathological hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases and the level of tau pathology is correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. Tau hyper-phosphorylation is thought to be an early initiating event in the cascade leading to tau toxicity and neuronal death. Inhibition of tau phosphorylation therefore represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. However, the widespread expression of most kinases and promiscuity of their substrates, along with poor selectivity of most kinase inhibitors, have resulted in systemic toxicities that have limited the advancement of tau kinase inhibitors into the clinic. We therefore focused on the CNS-specific tau kinase, TTBK1, and investigated whether selective inhibition of this kinase could represent a viable approach to targeting tau phosphorylation in disease. In the current study, we demonstrate that TTBK1 regulates tau phosphorylation using overexpression or knockdown of this kinase in heterologous cells and primary neurons. Importantly, we find that TTBK1-specific phosphorylation of tau leads to a loss of normal protein function including a decrease in tau-tubulin binding and deficits in tubulin polymerization. We then describe the use of a novel, selective small molecule antagonist, BIIB-TTBK1i, to study the acute effects of TTBK1 inhibition on tau phosphorylation in vivo. We demonstrate substantial lowering of tau phosphorylation at multiple sites implicated in disease, suggesting that TTBK1 inhibitors may represent an exciting new approach in the search for neurodegenerative disease therapies."

Based on 19 high-resolution bioclimatic environmental datasets and 71 bog center point locations, we employed a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to reconstruct and predict the spatial-temporal geographical distribution patterns of Sphagnum bogs from the last interglacial (LIG) period to two typical CO2 representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP8.5) in the future. We further computed the migratory paths of the distribution center points. Finally, a jackknife test was used to uncover the crucial environmental factors restricting the geographical distribution of the bogs. Our data indicated that the MaxEnt niche model had a high simulation precision with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.957. Spatially, the suitable bog habitats are currently centralized in northeastern China, including the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the Changbai Mountains, as well as peripheral areas of the Sichuan Basin. Temporally, the contours of Sphagnum bogs were similar to the present and rendered from the last glacial maximum (LMG) period, and had much more total area than the current. The total area in LIG was nearly the same as the current because of the similar climate. It was worth noting that there would be a reduction of the total area in the future. Loss of area occurred at the edges of bogs, especially under RCP8.5. The distribution center of bogs will shift to the northwest in the immediate future. The precipitation of driest month, the mean temperature of warmest quarter and the precipitation of warmest quarter were identified as crucial climatic factors affecting the distribution of Sphagnum bogs. Overall, our research provides scientific evidence for the long-term protection and effective management of these rare, precious natural resources and suggestions for in situ conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3013946134,"Background The identification of negative self-imagery as a maintenance factor in adult social anxiety has led to enhanced treatments for this population. Whilst intrusive negative imagery is commonly reported by socially anxious adolescents, no studies have demonstrated that it plays a causal role in maintaining symptoms. To assess this possibility, we undertook an experimental study manipulating social self-imagery in high socially anxious adolescents. Methods High socially anxious adolescents undertook two conversations under different conditions. During one conversation they held a negative social self-image in mind, and in the other they held a benign social self-image in mind. Self-report, conversation partner report and independent assessor ratings were taken. Results When participants held a negative self-image in mind, they reported feeling more anxious, and believed they looked more anxious and performed more poorly. Furthermore, they overestimated how anxious they looked compared to conversation partner ratings. As well as distorting participants’ perception of their anxious appearance, holding a negative image in mind also had observable effects on the interaction. Participants were rated as looking more anxious and performing less well by their conversation partner when they held such images in mind, and the conversation was rated more critically by conversation partners and independent observers. Finally, a preliminary mediation analysis suggested that the detrimental effect of negative imagery on the social interaction may be partly due to the spontaneous use of avoidant safety behaviours. Conclusions The findings provide support for a causal role of negative self-imagery in adolescent social anxiety and point to the potential clinical value of techniques targeting imagery to treat the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3014223101,"Current transportation management systems rely on physical sensors that use traffic volume and queue-lengths. These physical sensors incur significant capital and maintenance costs. The ubiquity of mobile devices has made possible access to accurate and cheap traffic delay data. However, current traffic signal control algorithms do not accommodate the use of such data. In this paper, we propose a novel parsimonious model to utilize real-time crowdsourced delay data for traffic signal management. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the data and the proposed model on seven different intersections across three cities and two countries. This signal system provides an opportunity to leapfrog from physical sensors to low-cost, reliable crowdsourced data."

https://openalex.org/W3014284708,"Acetaminophen is one of the most common over-the-counter pain medications used worldwide and is considered safe at therapeutic dose. However, intentional and unintentional overdose accounts for up to 70% of acute liver failure cases in the western world. Extensive research has demonstrated that the induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are central to the development of acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Despite the insight gained on the mechanism of acetaminophen toxicity, there still is only one clinically approved pharmacological treatment option, N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine increases the cell's antioxidant defense and protects liver cells from further acetaminophen-induced oxidative damage. Because it primarily protects healthy liver cells rather than rescuing the already injured cells alternative treatment strategies that target the latter cell population are warranted. In this study, we investigated mitochondria as therapeutic target for the development of novel treatment strategies for acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Characterization of the mitochondrial toxicity due to acute acetaminophen overdose in vitro in human cells using detailed respirometric analysis revealed that complex I-linked (NADH-dependent) but not complex II-linked (succinate-dependent) mitochondrial respiration is inhibited by acetaminophen. Treatment with a novel cell-permeable succinate prodrug rescues acetaminophen-induced impaired mitochondrial respiration.

However, the biological contribution of chronic smoking and sex on the cecal microbiome has not been previously investigated.Adult male, female and ovariectomized mice were exposed to air (control group) or smoke for six months using a standard nose-only smoke exposure system. DNA was extracted from the cecal content using the QIAGEN QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit. Droplet digital PCR was used to generate total 16S bacterial counts, followed by Illumina MiSeq® analysis to determine microbial community composition. The sequencing data were resolved into Amplicon Sequence Variants and analyzed with the use of QIIME2®. Alpha diversity measures (Richness, Shannon Index, Evenness and Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity) and beta diversity (based on Bray-Curtis distances) were assessed and compared according to smoke exposure and sex.The microbial community was different between male and female mice, while ovariectomy made the cecal microbiome similar to that of male mice. Chronic smoke exposure led to significant changes in the cecal microbial community in both male and female mice. The organism, Alistipes, was the most consistent bacteria identified at the genus level in the cecal content that was reduced with chronic cigarette exposure and its expression was positively related to the whole-body weight of these mice.Chronic smoke exposure is associated with changes in the cecal content microbiome; these changes may play a role in the weight changes that are observed in cigarette smokers."
https://openalex.org/W3015096586,"The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of cactus silage and an intermittent water supply for lambs on carcass traits and meat quality. Thirty-six crossbreed lambs with an initial average weight of 19.8 ± 2.1 kg and average age of 6 months were randomly assigned to a 3 × 3 factorial design comprising three addition ratios of cactus silage to the diet (0, 21, and 42% based on dry matter) and three water supply intervals (0, 24, and 48 h) with four replicates. There was no interaction (P > 0.05) between the cactus silage ratio and intermittent water supply for any of the evaluated variables, with the exception of the yield of the half carcass commercial cuts. There was no significant effect of intermittent water supply (P > 0.05) on the carcass characteristics or meat quality. The addition of forage cactus silage as a substitute for Tifton hay affected the morphometric measurements (P < 0.05) and carcass compactness index (P < 0.05). The addition of 42% cactus silage to the diet increased (P < 0.05) the rib eye area (13.98 cm2). The addition of cactus silage as a substitute for Tifton hay positively affected (P < 0.05) the carcass weight of commercial cuts of the lambs. To the physical and chemical parameters of the Longissimus lumborum, the addition of 42% cactus silage to the diet reduced the color meat parameters (P < 0.05) and pH0 and 24h, cooking losses, and shear force were not affected (P > 0.05). The addition of forage cactus silage to the lambs' diet affected (P < 0.05) the composition of some saturated fatty acids in the meat. A water supply interval of up to 48 h does not influence carcass characteristics and meat quality. Therefore, the use of cactus silage can be recommended in situations of water scarcity without harming the production or meat quality of crossbreed lambs."
https://openalex.org/W3014572644,"Investigate the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM) on the expression of IL-10 and nitrites in individuals with Relapsing-Remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), as these biomarkers play a fundamental role in the physiopathology of the disease. The modulation of IL-10 and nitrites through treatment with PBM may be a novel treatment modality for MS.A randomized, uncontrolled, clinical trial was conducted involving 14 individuals with a diagnosis of Relapsing-Remitting MS and a score of up to 6.0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).Group 1 -PBM in the sublingual region; Group 2 -PBM over the radial artery. Irradiation was administered with a wavelength of 808 nm and output power of 100 mW for 360 seconds twice a week, totaling 24 sessions. Peripheral blood was analyzed for the determination of serum levels of IL-10 and nitrites.After treatment with PBM, the expression of IL-10 increased in both the sublingual group (pre-treatment: 2.8 ± 1.4 pg/ml; post-treatment: 8.3 ± 2.4 pg/ml) and the radial artery group (pre-treatment: 2.7 pg/ml ± 1.4; post-treatment: 11.7 ± 3.8 pg/ml). In contrast, nitrite levels were not modulated in the sublingual group (pre-treatment: 65 ± 50 nmol/mg protein; post-treatment: 51 ± 42 nmol/mg protein) or the radial artery group (pre-treatment: 51 ± 16 nmol/mg protein; post-treatment: 42 ± 7 nmol/mg protein).Treatment with PBM positively modulated the expression of IL-10 but had no effect on nitrite levels. Further studies should be conducted with a larger sample and a control group, as PBM may be a promising complementary treatment for the management of MS. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT03360487."
https://openalex.org/W3014799780,"In daily life, our emotions are often elicited by a multimodal environment, mainly visual and auditory stimuli. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the symmetrical characteristics of emotional responses to pictures and sounds. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the relationship of attentional states to emotional unimodal stimuli (pictures or sounds) and emotional responses by measuring the pupil diameter, which reflects the emotional arousal associated with increased sympathetic activity. Our hypothesis was that the emotional responses to both the image and sound stimuli are symmetrical: emotion might be suppressed when attentional resources are allocated to another stimulus of the same modality as the emotional stimulus—such as a dot presented at the same time as an emotional image, and a beep sound presented at the same time as an emotional sound. In our two experiments, data for 24 participants were analyzed for a pupillary response. In experiment 1, we investigated the relationship of the attentional state with emotional visual stimuli (International Affective Picture System) and emotional responses by using pupillometry. We set four task conditions to modulate the attentional state (emotional task, no task, visual detection task, and auditory detection task). We observed that the velocity of pupillary dilation was faster during the presentation of emotionally arousing pictures compared to that of neutral ones, regardless of the valence of the pictures. Importantly, this effect was not dependent on the task condition. In experiment 2, we investigated the relationship of the attentional state with emotional auditory sounds (International Affective Digitized Sounds) and emotional responses. We observed a trend towards a significant interaction between the stimulus and the task conditions with regard to the velocity of pupillary dilation. In the emotional and auditory detection tasks, the velocity of pupillary dilation was faster with positive and neutral sounds than negative sounds. However, there were no significant differences between the no task and visual detection task conditions. Taken together, the current data reveal that different pupillary responses were elicited to emotional visual and auditory stimuli, at least in the point that there is no attentional effect to emotional responses to visual stimuli, despite both experiments being sufficiently controlled to be of symmetrical experimental design."
https://openalex.org/W3014236578,"Large scale efforts to expand access to mental healthcare in low- and middle-income countries have focused on integrating mental health services into primary care settings using a task sharing approach delivered by non-specialist health workers. Given the link between mental disorders and risk of suicide mortality, treating common mental disorders using this approach may be a key strategy to reducing suicidality.The Programme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME) evaluated mental health services for common mental disorders delivered by non-specialist health workers at ten primary care facilities in Chitwan, Nepal from 2014 to 2016. In this paper, we present the indirect impact of treatment on suicidality, as measured by suicidal ideation, among treatment and comparison cohorts for depression and AUD using multilevel logistic regression. Patients in the treatment cohort for depression had a greater reduction in ideation relative to those in the comparison cohort from baseline to three months (OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05-0.59; p = 0.01) and twelve months (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.08-1.12; p = 0.07), with a significant effect of treatment over time (p = 0.02). Among the AUD cohorts, there were no significant differences between treatment and comparison cohorts in the change in ideation from baseline to three months (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.07-6.26; p = 0.70) or twelve months (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.06-3.27; p = 0.44), and there was no effect of treatment over time (p = 0.72).The results provide evidence integrated mental health services for depression benefit patients by accelerating the rate at which suicidal ideation naturally abates over time. Integrated services do not appear to impact ideation among people with AUD, though baseline levels of ideation were much lower than for those with depression and may have led to floor effects. The findings highlight the importance of addressing suicidality as a specific target-rather than an indirect effect-of treatment in community-based mental healthcare programs."
https://openalex.org/W3014256464,"Whether borderline hip dysplasia is pathologic remains unclear. In order to evaluate the three-dimensional joint congruity, this study sought to answer the question: are borderline dysplastic hip curvature mismatch and eccentricity between the acetabulum and the femoral head different from dysplastic or control hips three-dimensionally? The 113 hips, categorized as: dysplastic (LCEA ≤ 20°), 47 hips; borderline (20° ≤ LCEA < 25°), 32 hips; and control (25° ≤ LCEA < 35°), 34 hips; were evaluated. Three-dimensional (3D) femoral and coxal bone models were reconstructed from CT images. Using a custom-written Visual C++ routine, the femoral head and acetabular radii of curvature, and the femoral head and the acetabular curvature center were calculated. Then the ratio of the acetabular radius to the femoral head radius (3D curvature mismatch ratio), and the distance between the acetabular curvature center and the femoral head center (3D center discrepancy distance) were calculated. These indices were compared statistically among the three groups using Tukey’s post hoc test. The mean 3D curvature mismatch ratio in the borderline (1.13 ± 0.05) was smaller than in the dysplasia (1.23 ± 0.08, p < 0.001), and larger than in the control (1.07 ± 0.02, p < 0.001). The mean 3D center discrepancy distance in the borderline (3.2 ± 1.4 mm) was smaller than in the dysplasia (4.8 ± 2.3, p < 0.001) and larger than in the control (1.6 ± 0.7, p < 0.001). These results demonstrated that three-dimensional congruity of the borderline dysplastic hip is impaired, but its incongruity is not as severe as in dysplastic hips. The 3D curvature mismatch ratio and the 3D center discrepancy distance can be valuable signs of joint congruity in patients with borderline dysplasia. However, future studies are necessary to clarify any associations between curvature mismatch and pathogenesis of osteoarthritis in borderline dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W3014708440,"To solve the problems of yield reduction and low water-use efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) caused by winter and spring drought, a 2-year field experiment (2017-2019) was performed under movable shelter conditions with the large- and multispike cultivars Shannong 23 and 29, respectively, to explore the optimal supplemental irrigation regime. Three wetting layers were used for irrigation at the jointing stage: 0-10 cm (T2), 0-20 cm (T3) and 0-30 cm (T4). No irrigation at the jointing stage (T1) served as the control. Within a given cultivar, the soil water content in the 0-80 cm soil layers increased after irrigation, and the rate of tiller mortality decreased with increasing depth of the wetting layer used for irrigation at jointing. No significant differences were found between the T3 and T4 treatments in the photosynthetic rate (Pn) of the apical leaf of the main stem (O), the first primary tiller (I) and the fourth tiller (IV) after jointing. However, compared with the T3 treatment, the T4 treatment had a significantly higher transpiration rate (Tr) and lower instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEleaf) of the apical leaf of the O and tillers I and IV. This eventually led to a decreasing WUE, although there was no significant change in the spike number or grain yield. These results indicated that moderate irrigation at jointing can effectively reduce the tiller mortality, improve the leaf Pn of the tillers, and increase the spike number and grain yield. However, excessive irrigation can significantly increase the leaf Tr of the tillers, lead to inefficient water consumption and significantly reduce the WUEleaf of the tillers and the WUE. Irrigation at the jointing stage brought the soil water content in the 0-20 cm profile to 100% of field capacity, making it the most suitable supplemental irrigation regime for both the large- and multispike cultivars in the North China Plain."
https://openalex.org/W3014827666,"Effective receptor signaling is anchored on the preferential localization of the receptor in lipid rafts, which are plasma membrane platforms replete with cholesterol and sphingolipids. We hypothesized that the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) contains structural features that allow it to reside in lipid rafts for its activity. Mutation of C347 palmitoylation site and Y218 of a newly identified Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus motif resulted in the exclusion of D1R from lipid rafts, blunted cAMP response, impaired sodium transport, and increased oxidative stress in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs). Kidney-restricted silencing of Drd1 in C57BL/6J mice increased blood pressure (BP) that was normalized by renal tubule-restricted rescue with D1R-wild-type but not the mutant D1R 347A that lacks a palmitoylation site. Kidney-restricted disruption of lipid rafts by β-MCD jettisoned the D1R from the brush border, decreased sodium excretion, and increased oxidative stress and BP in C57BL/6J mice. Deletion of the PX domain of the novel D1R-binding partner sorting nexin 19 (SNX19) resulted in D1R partitioning solely to non-raft domains, while silencing of SNX19 impaired D1R function in RPTCs. Kidney-restricted silencing of Snx19 resulted in hypertension in C57BL/6J mice. Our results highlight the essential role of lipid rafts for effective D1R signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3015133270,"It is well known that the development of the ancient Maya civilization had significant and long-lasting impacts on the environment. This study assesses a large collection of faunal remains (>35,000 specimens) recovered over a span of several kilometers in and around the archaeological site of Ceibal, Guatemala, in order to determine whether the composition of animal resources was continuous throughout the site's history between 1000 BC and AD 1200, or whether there were any changes that could be attributed to sociopolitical or environmental causes. Results show a steep uniform decline in the number of freshwater mollusks across the site that occurred during the Preclassic to Classic transition, when large region-wide political changes, including the development of more complex and centralized political organization, took place throughout the Maya region. Evidence of species introductions (e.g., turkeys from central Mexico and possibly the Dermatemys river turtle from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec) and variations in resource exchange (e.g. marine shells) over time indicate that Ceibal was one of likely many communities involved in long-distance animal exchange networks. The results of the faunal analysis at Ceibal show how the ancient Maya had a complex and ever-changing relationship with the local wildlife, with outcomes that can still be observed in the environment today."
https://openalex.org/W3014318469,"Endogenous oxytocin has been associated with different aspects of social cognition in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. In this pilot study, we investigated the relationship between plasma oxytocin and oxytocin level changes induced by empathy-eliciting, attachment-related movie scenes with correlates of cognitive and emotional empathy in patients and healthy controls. The Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) were administered to patients with schizophrenia (N = 35, 12 females) and healthy controls (N = 35, 12 females) to estimate dimensions of cognitive and emotional empathy. Peripheral basal oxytocin concentrations and oxytocin responses to movie-based emotional stimuli were assessed using radioimmunoassay with sample extraction. In patients, induced oxytocin level changes were inversely correlated with MET cognitive empathy regarding negative emotional states. Controlling for non-social cognition and age revealed a significant negative association between basal oxytocin levels and MET cognitive empathy for positive emotions. In healthy subjects, oxytocin reactivity was inversely correlated with the IRI subscale ""fantasy"". Oxytocin was not related to any measure of emotional empathy. A hyper-reactive oxytocin system might be linked to impaired cognitive empathy as a part of a dysfunctional regulative circuit of attachment-related emotions and interpersonal stressors or threats by attribution of meaning. Healthy adults with a disposition to identify with fictional characters showed lower oxytocin reactivity, possibly indicating familiarity with movie-based stimuli. The oxytocinergic system may be involved in maladaptive coping mechanisms in the framework of impaired mentalizing and associated dysfunctional responses to interpersonal challenges in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W3014905596,"The aims of this study were to achieve a quantitative assessment of the severity of accidents involving roadside trees on highways and to propose corresponding safety measures to reduce accident losses. This paper used the acceleration severity index (ASI), head injury criteria (HIC) and chest resultant acceleration (CRA) as indicators of occupant injuries and horizontal radii, vehicle departure speeds, tree diameters and roadside tree spacing as research variables to carry out bias collision tests between cars, trucks and trees by constructing a vehicle rigid body system and an occupant multibody system in PC-crash 10.0® simulation software. A total of 2,256 data points were collected. For straight and curved segments of highways, the occupant injury evaluation models of cars were fitted based on the CRA, and occupant injury evaluation models of trucks and cars were fitted based on the ASI. According to the Fisher optimal segmentation method, reasonable classification standards of severities of accidents involving roadside trees and the corresponding ASI and CRA thresholds were determined, and severity assessment methods for accidents involving roadside trees based on the CRA and ASI were provided. Additionally, a new index by which to evaluate the accuracy of the accident severity classification and the degree of misclassification was built and applied for the validity verification of the proposed severity assessment methods. A proportion of trucks was introduced to further improve the ASI evaluation model. For the same simulation conditions, the results show that driver chest injuries are more serious than driver head injuries and that the average ASI of cars is greater than that of trucks. The CRA and ASI have a positive linear correlation with the departure speed and a logarithmic correlation with the roadside tree diameters. The larger the spacing of roadside trees is and the smaller the horizontal radius is, the smaller the chance that a vehicle will experience a second collision and the lower the risk of occupant injury. In method validation, the evaluation results from two proposed severity assessment methods based on the CRA and ASI are consistent, and the degrees of misclassification are 4.65% and 4.26%, respectively, which verifies the accuracy of the methods proposed in this paper and confirms that the ASI can be employed as an effective index for evaluating occupant injuries in accidents involving roadside trees."
https://openalex.org/W3015160712,"Autophagy is a mechanism responsible for intracellular degradation and recycling of macromolecules and organelles, essential for cell survival in adverse conditions. More than 40 autophagy-related (ATG) genes have been identified and characterized in fungi, among them ATG4 and ATG8. ATG4 encodes a cysteine protease (Atg4) that plays an important role in autophagy by initially processing Atg8 at its C-terminus region. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein essential for the synthesis of the double-layer membrane that constitutes the autophagosome vesicle, responsible for delivering the cargo from the cytoplasm to the vacuole lumen. The contributions of Atg-related proteins in the pathogenic yeast in the genus Cryptococcus remain to be explored, to elucidate the molecular basis of the autophagy pathway. In this context, we aimed to investigate the role of autophagy-related proteins 4 and 8 (Atg4 and Atg8) during autophagy induction and their contribution with non-autophagic events in C. neoformans. We found that Atg4 and Atg8 are conserved proteins and that they interact physically with each other. ATG gene deletions resulted in cells sensitive to nitrogen starvation. ATG4 gene disruption affects Atg8 degradation and its translocation to the vacuole lumen, after autophagy induction. Both atg4 and atg8 mutants are more resistant to oxidative stress, have an impaired growth in the presence of the cell wall-perturbing agent Congo Red, and are sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ). By that, we conclude that in C. neoformans the autophagy-related proteins Atg4 and Atg8 play an important role in the autophagy pathway; which are required for autophagy regulation, maintenance of amino acid levels and cell adaptation to stressful conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3014380194,"Phagocytes in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) do not generate reactive oxidative species (ROS), whereas nitric oxide (NO) production is increased in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 in CGD phagocytes compared with healthy phagocytes. Recently, patients with X-linked CGD (X-CGD) have been reported to show higher flow-mediated dilation, suggesting that endothelial cell function is affected by NO production from phagocytes. We studied NOS3 and EDN1 mRNA and protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a co-culture system with neutrophils from X-CGD patients. HUVECs were co-cultured for 30 minutes with human neutrophils from X-CGD or healthy participants in response to A23187 without cell-to-cell contact. The expression of NOS3 and EDN1 mRNA in HUVECs was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, we demonstrated the protein expression of eNOS, ET-1, and NFκB p65, including phosphorylation at Ser1177 of eNOS and Ser536 of NFκB p65. Neutrophils from X-CGD patients showed significantly higher NO and lower H2O2 production in response to A23187 than healthy neutrophils in vitro. Compared with healthy neutrophils, X-CGD neutrophils under A23187 stimulation exhibited significantly increased NO and decreased H2O2, and promoted downregulated NOS3 and EDN1 expression in HUVECs. The total expression and phosphorylation at Ser1177 of eNOS and ET-1 expression were significantly decreased in HUVECs co-cultures with stimulated X-CGD neutrophils. Also, phosphorylation at Ser536 of NFκB p65 were significantly decreased. In conclusions, eNOS and ET-1 significantly down-regulated in co-culture with stimulated X-CGD neutrophils through their excessive NO and the lack of ROS production. These findings suggest that ROS generated from neutrophils may mediate arterial tone affecting eNOS and ET-1 expression via their NO and ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W3014829350,"Phosphate toxicity is a major threat to cardiovascular health in chronic kidney disease. It is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and the accumulation of calcium phosphate commonly known as calcification in soft tissues leading to functional disorders of blood vessels. An improved calcification propensity test for the assessment of phosphate toxicity was developed, which measures the velocity of calcium phosphate mineralization from colloidal precursors in vitro. This so called T50 test measures the transformation from a primary into a secondary form of nanosized colloidal plasma protein-calcium phosphate particles known as calciprotein particles. The T50 test in its previous form required a temperature controlled nephelometer and several hours of continuous measurement, which precluded rapid bed side testing. We miniaturized the test using microfluidic polymer chips produced by ultrasonic hot embossing. A cartridge holder contained a laser diode for illumination, light dependent resistor for detection and a Peltier element for thermo control. Increasing the assay temperature from 37°C to 75°C reduced the T50 test time 36-fold from 381 ± 10 min at 37°C to 10.5 ± 0.3 min at 75°C. Incorporating sputtered micro mirrors into the chip design increased the effective light path length, and improved signal-to-noise ratio 9-fold. The speed and reproducibility of the T50 chip-based assay run at 75°C suggest that it may be suitable for rapid measurements, preferably in-line in a dialyser or in a portable microfluidic analytic device with the chip inserted as a disposable cartridge."
https://openalex.org/W3014109991,"Over the last three decades corals have declined precipitously in the Florida Keys. Their population decline has prompted restoration effort. Yet, little effort has been invested in understanding the contemporary niche spaces of coral species, which could assist in prioritizing conservation habitats. We sought to predict the probability of occurrence of 23 coral species, including the critically endangered Acropora cervicornis, using observations at 985 sites from 2011-2015. We ran boosted regression trees to evaluate the relationship between the presence of these corals and eight potential environmental predictors: (i) bathymetry (m), (ii) mean of daily sea surface temperature (SST) (°C), (iii) variance of SST (°C), (iv) range of SST (°C), (v) chlorophyll-a concentration (mg m3), (vi) turbidity (m-1), (vii) wave energy (kJ m-2), and (viii) distance from coast (km). The Marquesas and the lower and upper Florida Keys were predicted to support the most suitable habitats for the 23 coral species examined. A. cervicornis had one of the smallest areas of suitable habitat, which was limited to the lower and upper Florida Keys, the Dry Tortugas, and nearshore Broward-Miami reefs. The best environmental predictors of site occupancy of A. cervicornis were SST range (4-5°C) and turbidity (K490 between 0.15-0.25 m-1). Historically A. cervicornis was reported in clear oligotrophic waters, although the present results find the coral species surviving in nearshore turbid conditions. Nearshore, turbid reefs may shade corals during high-temperature events, and therefore nearshore reefs in south Florida may become important refuges for corals as the ocean temperatures continue to increase."
https://openalex.org/W3014147024,"Background Elective percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are difficult to discriminate from non-elective PCI in administrative data due to non-specific encounter codes, limiting the ability to track outcomes, ensure appropriate medical management, and/or perform research on patients who undergo elective PCI. The objective of this study was to assess the abilities of several algorithms to identify elective PCI procedures using administrative data containing diagnostic, utilization, and/or procedural codes. Methods and results For this retrospective study, administrative databases in an integrated healthcare delivery system were queried between 1/1/2015 and 6/31/2016 to identify patients who had an encounter for a PCI. Using clinical criteria, each encounter was classified via chart review as a valid PCI, then as elective or non-elective. Cases were tested against nine pre-determined algorithms. Performance statistics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Of 521 PCI encounters reviewed, 497 were valid PCI, 93 of which were elective. An algorithm that excluded emergency room visit events had the highest sensitivity (97.9%, 95%CI 92.5%-99.7%) while an algorithm that included events occurring within 90 days of a cardiologist visit and coronary angiogram or stress test had the highest positive predictive value (62.2%, 95%CI 50.8%-72.7%). Conclusions Without an encounter code specific for elective PCI, an algorithm excluding procedures associated with an emergency room visit had the highest sensitivity to identify elective PCI. This offers a reasonable approach to identify elective PCI from administrative data."

We hypothesized that morpho-physiological variations in the tropical tree Tabebuia heterophylla, observed on different geological substrates, arise in part due to microbial processes in the rhizosphere. We characterized the microbiota of the rhizosphere and soil communities associated with T. heterophylla trees in high and low altitude sites (with varying temperature and precipitation) of volcanic, karst and serpentine geologies across Puerto Rico. We sampled 6 areas across the island in three geological materials including volcanic, serpentine and karst soils. Collection was done in 2 elevations (>450m and 0-300m high), that included 3 trees for each site and 4 replicate soil samples per tree of both bulk and rhizosphere. Genomic DNA was extracted from 144 samples, and 16S rRNA V4 sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were the most dominant phyla, and microbiomes clustered by geological substrate and elevation. Volcanic samples were enriched in Verrucomicrobia; karst was dominated by nitrogen-fixing Proteobacteria, and serpentine sites harbored the most diverse communities, with dominant Cyanobacteria. Sites with similar climates but differing geologies showed significant differences on rhizobiota diversity and composition demonstrating the importance of geology in shaping the rhizosphere microbiota, with implications for the plant’s phenotype. Our study sheds light on the combined role of geology and climate in the rhizosphere microbial consortia, likely contributing to the phenotypic plasticity of the trees."

We developed an ex vivo platelet production system, introducing human megakaryocytes into an isolated porcine thighbone and culturing in closed circuit. The efficiency of the ex vivo platelet production system was compared to those in vivo and in vitro. CD61+ platelet-like cells were counted by immunostaining and flow cytometry. Results showed that 4.41 ± 0.27 × 103 CD61+ platelet-like cells were produced by 1 × 103 megakaryocytes in the ex vivo system, while 3.80 ± 0.87 × 103 and 0.12 ± 0.02 × 103 were produced in the in vivo and in vitro systems, respectively. Notably, ex vivo and in vitro production systems generated cells that responded well to thrombin stimulation and expressed functional molecules, such as CD62P. Overall, our ex vivo production system was comparable to in vivo production system and produced platelet-like cells that were functionally superior to those produced in vitro. In future, the present ex vivo production system implementing xenogeneic bone marrow would offer a promising alternative for industrial-scale production of platelet-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W3014126664,"Understanding how the psychology of predators shapes the defenses of colorful aposematic prey has been a rich area of inquiry, with emphasis on hypothesis-driven experiments that independently manipulate color and palatability in prey to examine predator responses. Most of these studies focus on avian predators, despite calls to consider more taxonomically diverse predators. This taxonomic bias leaves gaps in our knowledge about the generalizability of current theory. Here we have adapted tools that have been successfully used with bird predators and scaled them down and tested them with smaller predators (Habronattus jumping spiders) and small insect prey (termites, milkweed bug nymphs, pinhead crickets, fruit flies). Specifically, we test (1) the application of denatonium benzoate (DB) to the surface of live termites, crickets, and fruit flies, and (2) the effectiveness of manipulating the palatability of milkweed bug nymphs through diet. We also test the effectiveness of combining these palatability manipulations with various color manipulations. Across several experiments, we confirm that our palatability manipulations are not detectable to the spiders before they attack (i.e., they do not produce aversive odors that spiders avoid), and show that unpalatable prey are indeed quickly rejected and spiders do not habituate to the taste with experience. We also investigate limitations of these techniques by assessing possible unintended effects on prey behavior and the risk of contact contamination when using DB-treated prey in experiments. While similar tools have been used to manipulate color and palatability with avian predators and relatively large insect prey, we show how these techniques can be effectively adapted for use with small invertebrate predators and prey."

HIV prevalence among Mozambican women aged 15–49 years is 15%, and vertical transmission rate is still high. The study investigated HIV exposure in children aged less than 2 years in Mozambique and the factors associated with unknown HIV exposure and with HIV exposure status in this population. Methods This was a cross-sectional analytical study using data from the 2015 Survey of Indicators on Immunization, Malaria and HIV/AIDS in Mozambique. A total of 2141 mothers (15–49 years) with children aged less than 2 years were interviewed. The dependent variables were “known HIV exposure status in a child” and “HIV-exposed child,” and the explanatory variables were mother’s social, demographic, economic, and reproductive health characteristics. We used binary and logistic regression, adjusted for complex sampling, to determine the association between variables. Results HIV exposure status was unknown in 27% of children (95% CI, 25.1–28.9). Mothers residing in the North (AOR, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.18–8.91), in rural area (AOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.33–4.35), with no education (AOR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.38–5.36), and not having utilized any health services in the last pregnancy (AOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.42–2.55) were more likely to have a child with unknown HIV exposure status. Six percent of children were HIV-exposed (95% CI, 5–7). Children were less likely to be HIV-exposed if the head of the household was a male (AOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08–0.86), if the mother was residing in the North (AOR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26–0.66) and did not utilize any health services in her last pregnancy (AOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.83). Conclusion The high proportion of children with unknown HIV exposure status and the associated socioeconomic factors suggests that HIV retesting of eligible women throughout breastfeeding should be intensified and identifies the urgent need to reach women without prior access to health care using a multisectoral approach."
https://openalex.org/W3014452837,"Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris, Gray 1828) are widely distributed in tropical waters around the world. Although they occur in large, pelagic groups in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, elsewhere in the Pacific they are found in small and genetically isolated populations associated with islands. This species is considered to be ""Least Concern"" (LC) by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). To assess genetic diversity and population structure of an island-associated population in the South Atlantic Ocean we surveyed 162 spinner dolphins throughout the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago of the northeast coast of Brazil using ten microsatellite loci and sequencing a 413-bp section of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. Eleven mtDNA haplotypes were identified and haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) were 0.3747 and 0.0060, respectively. Median-Joining Network revealed the presence of two very divergent haplotypes and F-statistics indicated some heterogeneity between two sampling years. All microsatellite loci were polymorphic (Ho: 0.767; He: 0,764) but, revealed no detectable substructure. We also compared the mtDNA haplotypes from Noronha to 159 haplotypes representing 893 individuals from 14 locations worldwide. We found that the two common haplotypes from the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago were absent in all other populations. These comparisons showed that Noronha spinner dolphins are likely more differentiated than other island populations, suggesting that they form societies with strong site fidelity mediated by females."
https://openalex.org/W3014336713,"Rivers are characterized by rapid and continuous one-way directional fluxes of flowing, aqueous habitat, chemicals, suspended particles, and resident plankton. Therefore, at any particular location in such systems there is the potential for continuous, and possibly abrupt, changes in diversity and metabolic activities of suspended biota. As microorganisms are the principal catalysts of organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling in rivers, examination of their assemblage dynamics is fundamental to understanding system-level biogeochemical patterns and processes. However, there is little known of the dynamics of microbial assemblage composition or production of large rivers along a time interval gradient. We quantified variation in alpha and beta diversity and production of particle-associated and free-living bacterioplankton assemblages collected at a single site on the Lower Mississippi River (LMR), the final segment of the largest river system in North America. Samples were collected at timescales ranging from days to weeks to months up to a year. For both alpha and beta diversity, there were similar patterns of temporal variation in particle-associated and free-living assemblages. Alpha diversity, while always higher on particles, varied as much at a daily as at a monthly timescale. Beta diversity, in contrast, gradually increased with time interval of sampling, peaking between samples collected 180 days apart, before gradually declining between samples collected up to one year apart. The primary environmental driver of the temporal pattern in beta diversity was temperature, followed by dissolved nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations. Particle-associated bacterial production corresponded strongly to temperature, while free-living production was much lower and constant over time. We conclude that particle-associated and free-living bacterioplankton assemblages of the LMR vary in richness, composition, and production at distinct timescales in response to differing sets of environmental factors. This is the first temporal longitudinal study of microbial assemblage structure and dynamics in the LMR."
https://openalex.org/W3014573658,"Injury compensation claimants use legal services to help them navigate compensation schemes, including accessing benefits and resolving disputes. Little is known, however, about the extent of lawyer use by compensation claimants, including changes over time. This paper presents findings from one of the largest empirical investigations of lawyer use in an injury compensation setting to date. Using evidence from more than 275,000 claims in the road traffic injury scheme in the state of Victoria, Australia, this study examines the prevalence of, and changes in, lawyer use between 2000 and 2015. The analysis identifies a significant increase in the use of lawyers in the scheme, and explores possible explanations. This study provides critical insights into lawyer use in compensation settings: the steep increase in lawyer involvement has both access to justice and financial implications for compensation schemes, given the associations between lawyer use, claimant outcomes, and long-term scheme viability."
https://openalex.org/W3014762336,"Locally established clinical laboratory reference intervals (RIs) are required to interpret laboratory test results for screening, diagnosis and prognosis. The objective of this study was establishing reference interval of clinical chemistry parameters among apparently healthy adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years in Mekelle, Tigrai, northern part of Ethiopia.Community based cross sectional study was employed from December 2018 to March 2019 in Mekelle city among 172 males and 172 females based on Multi stage sampling technique. Blood samples were tested for Fasting blood sugar (FBS), alanine aminino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Creatinine, urea, total protein, albumin (ALB), direct and indirect bilirubin (BIL.D and BIL.T) using 25 Bio system clinical chemistry analyzer. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 23 software and based on the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)/ International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) C 28-A3 Guideline which defines the reference interval as the 95% central range of 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Mann Whitney U test, descriptive statistics and box and whisker were statistical tools used for analysis.This study observed statistically significant differences between males and females in ALP, ALT, AST, Urea and Creatinine Reference intervals. The established reference intervals for males and females, respectively, were: ALP (U/L) 79.48-492.12 versus 63.56-253.34, ALT (U/L) 4.54-23.69 versus 5.1-20.03, AST 15.7-39.1 versus 13.3-28.5, Urea (mg/dL) 9.33-24.99 versus 7.43-23.11, and Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.393-0.957 versus 0.301-0.846. The combined RIs for Total Protein (g/dL) was 6.08-7.85, ALB (g/dL) 4.42-5.46, FBS(mg/dL) 65-110, BIL.D (mg/dL) 0.033-0.532, and BIL.T (mg/dL) 0.106-0.812.The result showed marked difference among sex and with the company derived values for selected clinical chemistry parameters. Thus, use of age and sex specific locally established reference intervals for clinical chemistry parameters is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3014830462,"Background There are several reports describing allergy to hydrolyzed wheat products. After a large outbreak in Japan it was established that sensitization was caused by skin contact with acid hydrolyzed gluten in soap. It is still not clear if other forms of hydrolyzed gluten may sensitize, and if the skin is the only relevant route of sensitization in humans and to what extent oral tolerance to wheat play a role. Objectives The aim of the present study was to examine if wheat-tolerant rats may be sensitized via the oral or i.p. route when exposed to gluten, enzymatic or acid hydrolyzed gluten. Methods Brown Norway rats, tolerant to wheat, were dosed by three i.p. injections without adjuvant or by oral gavage daily for 35 days with the three gluten products, respectively. Sera were analyzed by ELISA for specific IgG1 and IgE. In addition inhibition and avidity ELISAs were performed. Results were compared to a similar study in rats naïve to wheat. Results More than half the animals had measurable IgG1 at the start of the dosing period. I.p. immunization resulted in significant specific IgG1 and IgE to the antigen used for immunization but significantly lower than in naïve rats. The results of inhibition and avidity ELISA’s indicate that the underlying tolerance to epitopes common to the three products influences the immune response. Oral dosing did not induce significant changes in response to either gluten or the hydrolyzed gluten product used for dosing. Conclusions The study shows that i.p. immunization with the three products can break the underlying tolerance to wheat. Exposure by the oral route to enzymatic or acid hydrolyzed gluten is very unlikely to break an already established tolerance to gluten and induce sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W3015032098,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is more difficult to diagnose and treat compared with drug-susceptible TB. Young children are at greater risk of severe TB disease and death when treatment is delayed compared to adults. We sought to describe characteristics of children (<13 years) diagnosed with MDR TB between 2008-2010 in three South African provinces and assess factors associated with pre-treatment loss to follow-up. We matched laboratory and medical records at treatment facilities to identify pre-treatment loss and examined demographic and clinical characteristics for association with loss. Categorical variables were examined for association using Pearson's x2 or Fisher's exact test, employing Bonferroni correction for multiple pairwise comparisons. Between 2008-2010, 156 children were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed MDR TB. Only 44% (n = 69) were documented as having received treatment. Young children (<2 years) (47/59, 80%), children with extrapulmonary (EP) TB (27/34, 79%), and children diagnosed at general hospitals (60/97, 62%) were most likely to be lost before treatment. Children most vulnerable to death from TB are most likely to be lost before treatment, possibly leading to underestimates of disease burden, case notifications, and poor outcomes among this population. Point-of-care diagnosis and robust follow-up may reduce pre-treatment loss in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3015091968,"The present study used exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) to examine the theorized dimension structure of the brief version of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ-BR) at the scale-level (i.e., 11 lower-order primary factors loading on four higher-order factors) and item-level (sets of 12 items loading on 11 lower-order primary factors). A total of 214 adults from the community addressed the MPQ-BR and the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS)/Behavioral Approach System (BAS) scales. The findings revealed poor fit and poorly defined factors at the item-level alongside adequate fit and well-defined factors at the scale-level. The higher-order factors in the latter model were supported for external validity in terms of demonstrating the expected theoretical and empirical correlations with the scales of the BIS/BAS scales. Result related implications for professional application, as well as potential revisions of the MPQ-BF are illustrated."
