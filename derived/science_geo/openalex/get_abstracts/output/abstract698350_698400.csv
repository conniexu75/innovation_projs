https://openalex.org/W4290188763,"Transcriptional heterogeneity among malignant cells of a tumor has been studied in individual cancer types and shown to be organized into cancer cell states; however, it remains unclear to what extent these states span tumor types, constituting general features of cancer. Here, we perform a pan-cancer single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis across 15 cancer types and identify a catalog of gene modules whose expression defines recurrent cancer cell states including 'stress', 'interferon response', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'metal response', 'basal' and 'ciliated'. Spatial transcriptomic analysis linked the interferon response in cancer cells to T cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Using mouse models, we further found that induction of the interferon response module varies by tumor location and is diminished upon elimination of lymphocytes. Our work provides a framework for studying how cancer cell states interact with the tumor microenvironment to form organized systems capable of immune evasion, drug resistance and metastasis."

Here, we performed transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling in primary human microglia from 150 donors to identify genetically driven variation and cell-specific enhancer–promoter (E-P) interactions. Integrative fine-mapping analysis identified putative regulatory mechanisms for 21 AD risk loci, of which 18 were refined to a single gene, including 3 new candidate risk genes (KCNN4, FIBP and LRRC25). Transcription factor regulatory networks captured AD risk variation and identified SPI1 as a key putative regulator of microglia expression and AD risk. This comprehensive resource capturing variation in the human microglia regulome provides insights into the etiology of neurodegenerative disease. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of human microglia identifies putative gene regulatory mechanisms for 21 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk loci. SPI1/PU.1 is nominated as a key regulator of microglia gene expression and AD risk."

We use two distinct empirical approaches in our analysis: (a) an event study around the date of the lockdowns (March to July 2020), and (b) a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the lockdown period in 2020 to the same months in 2021, in order to attempt to control for seasonality. In both countries, market activity was severely disrupted and we observe declines in expenditures. However, we find no evidence of declines in food security."
https://openalex.org/W4289837800,"Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay is a fatal brain disorder featuring cerebellar neurodegeneration leading to spasticity and ataxia. This disease is caused by mutations in the SACS gene that encodes sacsin, a massive 4579-amino acid protein with multiple modular domains. However, molecular details of the function of sacsin are not clear. Here, using live cell imaging and biochemistry, we demonstrate that sacsin binds to microtubules and regulates microtubule dynamics. Loss of sacsin function in various cell types, including knockdown and KO primary neurons and patient fibroblasts, leads to alterations in lysosomal transport, positioning, function, and reformation following autophagy. Each of these phenotypic changes is consistent with altered microtubule dynamics. We further show the effects of sacsin are mediated at least in part through interactions with JIP3, an adapter for microtubule motors. These data reveal a new function for sacsin that explains its previously reported roles and phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4291019803,"Background In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, an increased incidence of ROCM was noted in India among those infected with COVID. We determined risk factors for rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) post Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among those never and ever hospitalized for COVID-19 separately through a multicentric, hospital-based, unmatched case-control study across India. Methods We defined cases and controls as those with and without post-COVID ROCM, respectively. We compared their socio-demographics, co-morbidities, steroid use, glycaemic status, and practices. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) through logistic regression. The covariates with a p-value for crude OR of less than 0·20 were considered for the regression model. Results Among hospitalised, we recruited 267 cases and 256 controls and 116 cases and 231 controls among never hospitalised. Risk factors (AOR; 95% CI) for post-COVID ROCM among the hospitalised were age 45–59 years (2·1; 1·4 to 3·1), having diabetes mellitus (4·9; 3·4 to 7·1), elevated plasma glucose (6·4; 2·4 to 17·2), steroid use (3·2; 2 to 5·2) and frequent nasal washing (4·8; 1·4 to 17). Among those never hospitalised, age ≥ 60 years (6·6; 3·3 to 13·3), having diabetes mellitus (6·7; 3·8 to 11·6), elevated plasma glucose (13·7; 2·2 to 84), steroid use (9·8; 5·8 to 16·6), and cloth facemask use (2·6; 1·5 to 4·5) were associated with increased risk of post-COVID ROCM. Conclusions Hyperglycemia, irrespective of having diabetes mellitus and steroid use, was associated with an increased risk of ROCM independent of COVID-19 hospitalisation. Rational steroid usage and glucose monitoring may reduce the risk of post-COVID."
https://openalex.org/W4289755428,"Within the intestine, the human G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR35 is involved in oncogenic signaling, bacterial infections, and inflammatory bowel disease. GPR35 is known to be expressed as two distinct isoforms that differ only in the length of their extracellular N-termini by 31 amino acids, but detailed insights into their functional differences are lacking. Through gene expression analysis in immune and gastrointestinal cells, we show that these isoforms emerge from distinct promoter usage and alternative splicing. Additionally, we employed optical assays in living cells to thoroughly profile both GPR35 isoforms for constitutive and ligand-induced activation and signaling of 10 different heterotrimeric G proteins, ligand-induced arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization. Our results reveal that the extended N-terminus of the long isoform limits G protein activation yet elevates receptor-β-arrestin interaction. To better understand the structural basis for this bias, we examined structural models of GPR35 and conducted experiments with mutants of both isoforms. We found that a proposed disulfide bridge between the N-terminus and extracellular loop 3, present in both isoforms, is crucial for constitutive G13 activation, while an additional cysteine contributed by the extended N-terminus of the long GPR35 isoform limits the extent of agonist-induced receptor-β-arrestin2 interaction. The pharmacological profiles and mechanistic insights of our study provide clues for the future design of isoform-specific GPR35 ligands that selectively modulate GPR35-transducer interactions and allow for mechanism-based therapies against, for example, inflammatory bowel disease or bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal system."
https://openalex.org/W4289865920,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP, or abasic) sites in DNA are one of the most common forms of DNA damage. AP sites are reactive and form cross-links to both proteins and DNA, are prone to strand breakage, and inhibit DNA replication and transcription. The replication-associated AP site repair protein HMCES protects cells from strand breaks, inhibits mutagenic translesion synthesis, and participates in repair of interstrand DNA cross-links derived from AP sites by forming a stable thiazolidine DNA-protein cross-link (DPC) to AP sites in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Despite the importance of HMCES to genome maintenance and the evolutionary conservation of its catalytic SRAP (SOS Response Associated Peptidase) domain, the enzymatic mechanisms of DPC formation and resolution are unknown. Using the bacterial homolog YedK, we show that the SRAP domain catalyzes conversion of the AP site to its reactive, ring-opened aldehyde form, and we provide structural evidence for the Schiff base intermediate that forms prior to the more stable thiazolidine. We also report two new activities, whereby SRAP reacts with polyunsaturated aldehydes at DNA 3'-ends generated by bifunctional DNA glycosylases and catalyzes direct reversal of the DPC to regenerate the AP site, the latter of which we observe in both YedK and HMCES-SRAP proteins. Taken together, this work provides insights into possible mechanisms by which HMCES DPCs are resolved in cells."

https://openalex.org/W4290723784,"Background Widespread use of at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen tests has been proposed as an important public health intervention to interrupt chains of transmission. Antigen tests may be preferred over PCR because they provide on-demand results for relatively low cost and can identify people when they are most likely to be infectious, particularly when used daily. Yet the extent to which a frequent antigen testing intervention will result in a positive public health impact for COVID-19 will depend on high acceptability and high adherence to such regimens. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods study assessing acceptability of and adherence to a daily at-home mobile-app connected rapid antigen testing regimen among employees of a US-based media company. Acceptability was assessed across seven domains of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Results Among 31 study participants, acceptability of the daily testing intervention was generally high, with participants reporting high perceived effectiveness, intervention coherence, and self-efficacy; positive affective attitude; acceptable degree of burden and opportunity cost; and assessing the intervention as ethical. 71% reported a preference to test daily using an at-home antigen test than weekly employment-based PCR. Mean adherence to the 21-day testing regimen was 88% with 43% of participants achieving 100% adherence, 48% testing at least every other day, and 10% testing less than every other day. Conclusions Despite overall high acceptability and adherence, we identified three implementation challenges that must be addressed for frequent serial testing for COVID-19 to be implemented at scale and have a positive public health impact. First, users need guidance on how and when to adapt testing frequencies to different epidemiological conditions. Second, users and institutions need guidelines for how to safely store and share test results. Third, implementation of serial testing strategies must prioritize health equity and protect those most vulnerable to COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4289994798,"Many transcription factors contain intrinsically disordered transcription activation domains (TADs), which mediate interactions with coactivators to activate transcription. Historically, DNA-binding domains and TADs have been considered as modular units, but recent studies have shown that TADs can influence DNA binding. Whether these results can be generalized to more TADs is not clear. Here, we biophysically characterized the NFκB p50/RelA heterodimer including the RelA TAD and investigated the TAD's influence on NFκB-DNA interactions. In solution, we show the RelA TAD is disordered but compact, with helical tendency in two regions that interact with coactivators. We determined that the presence of the TAD increased the stoichiometry of NFκB-DNA complexes containing promoter DNA sequences with tandem κB recognition motifs by promoting the binding of NFκB dimers in excess of the number of κB sites. In addition, we measured the binding affinity of p50/RelA for DNA containing tandem κB sites and single κB sites. While the presence of the TAD enhanced the binding affinity of p50/RelA for all κB sequences tested, it also increased the affinity for nonspecific DNA sequences by over 10-fold, leading to an overall decrease in specificity for κB DNA sequences. In contrast, previous studies have generally reported that TADs decrease DNA-binding affinity and increase sequence specificity. Our results reveal a novel function of the RelA TAD in promoting binding to nonconsensus DNA, which sheds light on previous observations of extensive nonconsensus DNA binding by NFκB in vivo in response to strong inflammatory signals."
https://openalex.org/W4289839298,"Many cell surface stimuli cause calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores to regulate cellular physiology. Upon ER calcium store depletion, the ER-resident protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) physically interacts with plasma membrane protein Orai1 to induce calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) currents that conduct calcium influx from the extracellular milieu. Although the physiological relevance of this process is well established, the mechanism supporting the assembly of these proteins is incompletely understood. Earlier we demonstrated a previously unknown post-translational modification of Orai1 with long-chain fatty acids, known as S-acylation. We found that S-acylation of Orai1 is dynamically regulated in a stimulus-dependent manner and essential for its function as a calcium channel. Here using the acyl resin-assisted capture assay, we show that STIM1 is also rapidly S-acylated at cysteine 437 upon ER calcium store depletion. Using a combination of live cell imaging and electrophysiology approaches with a mutant STIM1 protein, which could not be S-acylated, we determined that the S-acylation of STIM1 is required for the assembly of STIM1 into puncta with Orai1 and full CRAC channel function. Together with the S-acylation of Orai1, our data suggest that stimulus-dependent S-acylation of CRAC channel components Orai1 and STIM1 is a critical mechanism facilitating the CRAC channel assembly and function."
https://openalex.org/W4290666521,"Science and its epistemology have been challenged by science-related populism —a variant of populism suggesting that a virtuous “ordinary people,” and not allegedly corrupt academic elites, should determine the “production of truth.” Yet almost no studies have assessed the prevalence of science-related populist attitudes among the population and explanatory factors thereof. Based on a nationally representative survey in Switzerland, our study shows that only a minority of the Swiss exhibit science-related populist attitudes. Comparisons with reference studies suggest that these attitudes may be less prevalent in Switzerland than political populist attitudes. Those who hold stronger science-related populist attitudes tend to have no university education, less personal contact with science, lower scientific literacy, and higher interest in science. Additional analyses show that left-leaning citizens are less likely to hold science-related populist attitudes than moderate and right-leaning citizens. Our findings contribute to current debates about a potential fragmentation of science communication audiences and call for further research on the sociodemographic and attitudinal profiles of people with skeptical orientations toward science."
https://openalex.org/W4290667425,"River Yamuna is one of the most sacred major tributaries of river Ganga. This study aimed to assess the level of heavy metals in monsoon and non-monsoon season in river Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh, India and to assess the possible source of contamination and its associated health risk. Except for iron (Fe), the mean levels of all metals were within drinking water safe limits in both seasons. Except for chromium (Cr), lower values were observed for other metals in the monsoon season could be attributed dilution effect. Multivariate analysis indicated that both geogenic and anthropogenic sources contribute to heavy metals in river Yamuna in monsoon and non-monsoon seasons. The health risk in terms of hazard index (HI) and fuzzy-logic hazard index (FHI) demonstrated that both HI and FHI values among children exceeded the safe limit in most of the sites in non-monsoon seasons and in few in monsoon season. For adults, HI and FHI values were within safe limit."
https://openalex.org/W4291019510,"Lithography based additive manufacturing techniques, specifically digital light processing (DLP), are considered innovative manufacturing techniques for orthopaedic implants because of their potential for construction of complex geometries using polymers, metals, and ceramics. Hydroxyapatite (HA) coupons, printed using DLP, were evaluated for biological performance in supporting viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of the human cell line U2OS and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) up to 35 days in culture to determine feasibility for future use in development of complex scaffold geometries. Contact angle, profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements showed the HA coupons to be hydrophilic, porous, and having micro size surface roughness, all within favourable cell culture ranges. The study found no impact of leachable and extractables form the DLP printing process. Cells seeded on coupons exhibited morphologies comparable to conventional tissue culture polystyrene plates. Cell proliferation rates, as determined by direct cell count and the RealTime-GloTM MT Cell Viability Assay, were similar on HA coupons and standard tissue culture polystyrene plates). Osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs on HA coupons was confirmed using alkaline phosphatase, Alizarin Red S and von Kossa staining. The morphology of MSCs cultured in osteogenic medium for 14 to 35 days was similar on HA coupons and tissue culture polystyrene plates, with osteogenic (geometric, cuboidal morphology with dark nodules) and adipogenic (lipid vesicles and deposits) features. We conclude that the DLP process and LithaBone HA400 slurry are biocompatible and are suitable for osteogenic applications. Coupons served as an effective evaluation design in the characterization and visualization of cell responses on DLP printed HA material. Results support the feasibility of future technical development for 3D printing of sophisticated scaffold designs, which can be constructed to meet the mechanical, chemical, and porosity requirements of an artificial bone scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W4289528669,"Human clock-gene variations contribute to the phenotypic differences observed in various behavioral and physiological processes, such as diurnal preference, sleep, metabolism, mood regulation, addiction, and fertility. However, little is known about the possible effects of identified variations at the molecular level. In this study, we performed a functional characterization at the cellular level of rare cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) missense variations that were identified from the Ensembl database. Our structural studies revealed that three variations (p.Pro123Leu, p.Asp406His, and p.Ser410Ile) are located at the rim of the secondary pocket of CRY2. We show that these variants were unable to repress CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput)/BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like-1)-driven transcription in a cell-based reporter assay and had reduced affinity to CLOCK-BMAL1. Furthermore, our biochemical studies indicated that the variants were less stable than the WT CRY2, which could be rescued in the presence of period 2 (PER2), another core clock protein. Finally, we found that these variants were unable to properly localize to the nucleus and thereby were unable to rescue the circadian rhythm in a Cry1-/-Cry2-/- double KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Collectively, our data suggest that the rim of the secondary pocket of CRY2 plays a significant role in its nuclear localization independently of PER2 and in the intact circadian rhythm at the cellular level."

Although mature forms of PTHrP in the body consist of splice variants of 139, 141, and 173 amino acids, our current understanding on how endogenous PTHrP transduces signals through its cognate G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the PTH type 1 receptor (PTHR), is largely derived from studies done with its N-terminal fragment, PTHrP1-36. Here, we demonstrate using various fluorescence imaging approaches at the single cell level to measure kinetics of (i) receptor activation, (ii) receptor signaling via Gs and Gq, and (iii) receptor internalization and recycling that the native PTHrP1-141 displays biased agonist signaling properties that are not mimicked by PTHrP1-36. Although PTHrP1–36 induces transient cAMP production, acute intracellular Ca2+ (iCa2+) release and β-arrestin recruitment mediated by ligand–PTHR interactions at the plasma membrane, PTHrP1-141 triggers sustained cAMP signaling from the plasma membrane and fails to stimulate iCa2+ release and recruit β-arrestin. Furthermore, we show that the molecular basis for biased signaling differences between PTHrP1-36 and properties of native PTHrP1-141 are caused by the stabilization of a singular PTHR conformation and PTHrP1-141 sensitivity to heparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan.

Developments in recording GPCR-signaling cascade in individual cells in real time using optical approaches during the decade of the ‘00s (1Vilardaga J.P. Bunemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J.

Feinstein T.N. Castro M. Wang B. Bouley R. Potts J.T. et al.Sustained cyclic AMP production by parathyroid hormone receptor endocytosis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Brief stimulation with PTHrP1-36 induces only transient cAMP production from the cell surface that is rapidly desensitized upon recruitment of β-arrestins (βarrs), cytosolic adapter proteins that canonically act to occlude further G protein coupling and promote translocation of the ligand–receptor complex from the cell surface to early endosomes. In contrast, PTH1-34 causes an additional sustained phase of cAMP generation via PTH–PTHR–βarr complexes that remain active in early endosomes. Thus, this distinction in the spatiotemporal cAMP profiles of PTH and PTHrP was proposed to be the underlying determinant responsible for their biological specificity.Mature forms of PTH and PTHrP are originally synthesized and secreted as 84 aa and 141 aa proteins, respectively. Early reports demonstrating that their respective N-terminal part, PTH1-34 and PTHrP1-36, retain their full capacity to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in cAMP accumulation assays led to the utilization of these N-terminal fragments in most studies. Indeed, it was PTH1-34 and PTHrP1-36 that were used in the aforementioned work that revealed differences in the time courses and subcellular locations of cAMP production by these two peptides. In contrast to these earlier findings of transient signaling by PTHrP1-36, a recent publication proposed sustained endosomal cAMP generation induced by full-length PTHrP1-141 (4Ho P.W.M. Chan A.S. Pavlos N.J. Sims N.A. Martin T.J.

Pharmacol. 2019; 169113627Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The authors employed a combination of radioimmunoassays and chemical inhibitors to suggest that PTHrP1-141 induces prolonged cAMP signaling in an endocytosis-dependent manner analogous to that observed for PTH1-34; however, cAMP experiments were performed in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibition, which provided a measure of the cumulative levels of cAMP produced during a defined time interval, as opposed to the dynamic levels of cAMP that result from the net effects of its production and breakdown. Furthermore, the chemical compounds utilized to inhibit endocytosis generated inconsistent results with experiments showing no reduction of sustained cAMP responses induced by PTHrP1-141 or PTH1-34, while others showed only reduction for PTHrP1-141 but not for PTH1-34. Reduction of PTH1-34-induced sustained cAMP response by blocking receptor endocytosis is expected given this ligand’s established ability to signal via internalized PTHR from early endosomes (3Ferrandon S.

These considerations motivated the necessity to implement alternative methods that permit analysis of real-time cAMP response kinetics in real time in single cells. The results unveil the mechanism by which PTHrP1-141 engages in sustained signaling and how this differs from the transient effects observed with the N-terminal fragment PTHrP1-36.Results and discussionWe utilized FRET to record real-time courses of cAMP production in single HEK293 cell stably expressing PTHR (HEK-PTHR). We found that brief stimulation with PTHrP1-141 induced a sustained cAMP response that was similar in both magnitude and duration to that induced by PTH1-84 or PTH1-34 and clearly distinct from the short-lived cAMP response mediated by PTHrP1-36 (Figs. 1A and S1). We next applied Glo-sensor cAMP accumulation assays to verify that time courses of sustained cAMP production mediated by the two native hormones, PTH1-84 and PTHrP1-141, were similar (Fig. 1B) and without a significant difference in the hormone concentration dependence (Fig. 1, C and D). We observed a striking inability of PTHrP1-141 to efficiently induce the release of intracellular calcium (iCa2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating defective Gq activation by PTHrP1-141. We have previously shown that Gq activation is required for endosomal cAMP generation by PTH1-34 (9White A.D. ean-Alphonse F.G. Fang F. Peña K.A. Liu S. König G.M. et al.Gq/11-dependent regulation of endosomal cAMP generation by parathyroid hormone class B GPCR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 7455-7460Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting a differential location of cAMP generation by this ligand. Moreover, the molecular basis for the failure of PTHrP1-141 to mimic cAMP and iCa2+ signaling responses mediated by PTHrP1-36 were unlikely to be caused by different binding affinities to either G protein coupled (RG) or uncoupled (R0) states of PTHR (Fig. 1, G and H) but were rather due to the stabilization of a distinct receptor conformation. We tested this theory by using cells expressing a FRET-based PTHR sensor (scheme in Fig. 1I). Time-resolved determination of intramolecular FRET changes recorded from single cells allows the analysis of the kinetics of receptor activation in response to ligand binding (1Vilardaga J.P.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A decrease in FRET mediated by an agonist reflects receptor switching from an inactive to an active conformation, and distinct time-constants of receptor activation measured for a saturating concentration of agonists indicate the stabilization of distinct signaling receptor conformations (1Vilardaga J.P.

As expected, perfusion of a saturating concentration of PTH1-34, PTHrP1-36, or PTHrP1-141 to individual cells triggered a decrease in FRET; however, the significantly distinct time constants (τ) for receptor activation indicated the stabilization of distinct PTHR conformations (Fig. 1, I and J).To assess the role of βarr recruitment, we measured PTHR–βarr interactions via FRET in cells transiently expressing PTHRCFP and βarr-2YFP. The βarr2 isoform was randomly selected, given that earlier studies demonstrated that PTH1-34 and PTHrP1-36 displayed equal potencies (EC50 values) for recruitment of both β-arr1 and β-arr2 (8White A.D.

Consistent with previous studies, addition of PTH1-34 resulted in significant association of βarr with the receptor that was stably maintained following ligand washout (Fig. 2A). In contrast, analogous experiments using PTHrP1-141 failed to promote this interaction (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the sustained signaling observed for PTHrP1-141 occurs in a βarr-independent manner. This finding led us to test the role of receptor internalization, a key step in PTHR endosomal signaling. Measurements of receptor internalization and recycling in single cells stably expressing PTHRSEP, the PTHR N-terminally tagged with a pH-sensitive GFP (super-ecliptic pHluorin SEP) that exhibits fluorescence intensity reduction in the acidic environment encountered in endosomes (scheme in Fig. 2B), showed reduced internalization and faster recycling in response to PTHrP1-141 or PTHrP1-36 when compared to PTH1-34 (Figs. 2B and S2). We next determined whether internalized PTHrP1-141-PTHR can signal via cAMP. We have previously shown that expression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant, DynK44A, effectively blocks translocation of PTH–PTHR complexes from the cell surface and blunts the sustained phase of cAMP generation without affecting the forskolin response (3Ferrandon S.

Jean-Alphonse F.G. et al.Spatial bias in cAMP generation determines biological responses to PTH type 1 receptor activation.Sci. Signal. 2021; 14eabc5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we compared the cAMP response following brief stimulation with PTHrP1-141 in HEK-PTHR control cells and those transiently expressing DynK44A fused to a red fluorescent protein (DynK44ARFP) (Fig. 2C). Strikingly, blockade of receptor internalization significantly reduced the magnitude and duration of cAMP production by PTH1-34 (Fig. 2, C and E) but had no effect on cAMP mediated by PTHrP1-141 (Fig. 2, D and E), indicating that native PTHrP does not promote sustained signaling in an endocytosis-dependent manner. We recently reported on the development of Gs-biased PTH analogs that stimulate sustained cAMP production exclusively from the cell surface due to retention of active ligand–receptor complexes at the cell surface. This was experimentally confirmed via cAMP time courses using a cell-impermeable PTHR antagonist, which completely abolished the sustained phase of cAMP generation for GS-biased peptides but not for PTH1-34, consistent with its ability to signal from intracellular compartments (8White A.D. Peña K.A. Clark L.J. Maria C.S. Liu S. Jean-Alphonse F.G. et al.Spatial bias in cAMP generation determines biological responses to PTH type 1 receptor activation.Sci. Signal. 2021; 14eabc5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We thus utilized this same approach to test whether PTHrP1-141 likewise induces prolonged cAMP signaling via ligand–receptor complexes that are localized to the cell surface. Indeed, addition of the cell-impermeable antagonist at 15 min following agonist washout rapidly reduced cAMP levels to baseline in cells treated with PTHrP1-141 but had no effect in those stimulated with PTH1-34 (Fig. 2, F and G). These findings demonstrate that PTHrP1-141 promotes sustained cAMP responses via active ligand–receptor complexes localized to the cell surface, which appear inconsistent with experiments showing receptor internalization.Figure 2Endosomal cAMP signaling by PTHrP1-141.

Consistent with this theory was the significant reduction in the magnitude and duration of cAMP production in response to PTHrP1-141 in the presence of soluble heparin used as a decoy to prevent potential PTHrP1-141 and GAGs interactions (Fig. 3, A and B). The selective effect of heparin was verified by its lack of inhibitory action on cAMP induced by either PTH1-34 or PTHrP1-36 (Fig. 3A, and Table 1).Figure 3Effect of heparin on cAMP production.

Open table in a new tab Collectively, these data prompt a reinterpretation of our previous understanding on how hormones act on the PTHR by providing compelling evidence that native PTHrP1-141 is biased toward sustained PTHR signaling via cAMP at the plasma membrane. The results support a model where PTHrP1-141 stabilizes an active receptor conformation that impairs βarr coupling and Gq signaling possibly through the interaction with GAG. Future experiments are needed for an extended characterization of PTHrP and GAG interaction as a possible means to reactivate recycled receptor by the cell surface–anchored hormone (Fig. 3C).Experimental proceduresMaterials and methods are detailed in SI Appendix.Data availabilitySource data are stored in Excel 2013 and will be deposited in the institutional repository of the University of Pittsburgh (http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/).Supporting informationThis article contains supporting information (1Vilardaga J.P.

Feinstein T.N. Castro M. Wang B. Bouley R. Potts J.T. et al.Sustained cyclic AMP production by parathyroid hormone receptor endocytosis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Brief stimulation with PTHrP1-36 induces only transient cAMP production from the cell surface that is rapidly desensitized upon recruitment of β-arrestins (βarrs), cytosolic adapter proteins that canonically act to occlude further G protein coupling and promote translocation of the ligand–receptor complex from the cell surface to early endosomes. In contrast, PTH1-34 causes an additional sustained phase of cAMP generation via PTH–PTHR–βarr complexes that remain active in early endosomes. Thus, this distinction in the spatiotemporal cAMP profiles of PTH and PTHrP was proposed to be the underlying determinant responsible for their biological specificity. Mature forms of PTH and PTHrP are originally synthesized and secreted as 84 aa and 141 aa proteins, respectively. Early reports demonstrating that their respective N-terminal part, PTH1-34 and PTHrP1-36, retain their full capacity to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in cAMP accumulation assays led to the utilization of these N-terminal fragments in most studies. Indeed, it was PTH1-34 and PTHrP1-36 that were used in the aforementioned work that revealed differences in the time courses and subcellular locations of cAMP production by these two peptides. In contrast to these earlier findings of transient signaling by PTHrP1-36, a recent publication proposed sustained endosomal cAMP generation induced by full-length PTHrP1-141 (4Ho P.W.M. Chan A.S. Pavlos N.J. Sims N.A. Martin T.J.

Pharmacol. 2019; 169113627Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The authors employed a combination of radioimmunoassays and chemical inhibitors to suggest that PTHrP1-141 induces prolonged cAMP signaling in an endocytosis-dependent manner analogous to that observed for PTH1-34; however, cAMP experiments were performed in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibition, which provided a measure of the cumulative levels of cAMP produced during a defined time interval, as opposed to the dynamic levels of cAMP that result from the net effects of its production and breakdown. Furthermore, the chemical compounds utilized to inhibit endocytosis generated inconsistent results with experiments showing no reduction of sustained cAMP responses induced by PTHrP1-141 or PTH1-34, while others showed only reduction for PTHrP1-141 but not for PTH1-34. Reduction of PTH1-34-induced sustained cAMP response by blocking receptor endocytosis is expected given this ligand’s established ability to signal via internalized PTHR from early endosomes (3Ferrandon S.

Here, we expand the FBP candidate list in the social amoeba Dictyostelium and show that the Skp1 interactome is highly remodeled as cells transition from growth to multicellular development. Importantly, a subset of candidate FBPs was less represented when the posttranslational hydroxylation and glycosylation of Skp1 was abrogated by deletion of the O2-sensing Skp1 prolyl hydroxylase PhyA. A role for this Skp1 modification for SCF activity was indicated by partial rescue of development, which normally depends on high O2 and PhyA, of phyA-KO cells by proteasomal inhibitors. Further examination of two FBPs, FbxwD and the Jumonji C protein JcdI, suggested that Skp1 was substituted by other factors in phyA-KO cells. Although a double-KO of jcdI and its paralog jcdH did not affect development, overexpression of JcdI increased its sensitivity to O2. JcdI, a nonheme dioxygenase shown to have physiological O2 dependence, is conserved across protists with its F-box and other domains, and is related to the human oncogene JmjD6. Sensitization of JcdI-overexpression cells to O2 depended on its dioxygenase activity and other domains, but not its F-box, which may however be the mediator of its reduced levels in WT relative to Skp1 modification mutant cells. The findings suggest that activation of JcdI by O2 is tempered by homeostatic downregulation via PhyA and association with Skp1."
https://openalex.org/W4289884285,"Intratumoral hypoxia is associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a lethal disease. FOXA1 is an epithelial transcription factor that is down-regulated in CRPC. We have previously reported that FOXA1 loss induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell motility through elevated TGFβ signaling. However, whether FOXA1 directly regulates hypoxia pathways of CRPC tumors has not been previously studied. Here we report that FOXA1 down-regulation induces hypoxia transcriptional programs, and FOXA1 level is negatively correlated with hypoxia markers in clinical prostate cancer (PCa) samples. Mechanistically, FOXA1 directly binds to an intragenic enhancer of HIF1A to inhibit its expression, and HIF1A, in turn, is critical in mediating FOXA1 loss-induced hypoxia gene expression. Further, we identify CCL2, a chemokine ligand that modulates tumor microenvironment and promotes cancer progression, as a crucial target of the FOXA1-HIF1A axis. We found that FOXA1 loss leads to immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration and increased cell invasion, dependent on HIF1A expression. Critically, therapeutic targeting of HIF1A-CCL2 using pharmacological inhibitors abolishes FOXA1 loss-induced macrophage infiltration and PCa cell invasion. In summary, our study reveals an essential role of FOXA1 in controlling the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and establishes the HIF1A-CCL2 axis as one mechanism of FOXA1 loss-induced CRPC progression."
https://openalex.org/W4290742909,"There is an ongoing debate about whether gender equality in education has been achieved or not. Research efforts have focused on primary and secondary education, while there are fewer studies on higher education, and few studies refer to distance education. To contribute to address this gap, this article presents a gender analysis of educational outcomes in economics at Spain's leading distance university, UNED, which is also the largest university in the European Union in terms of enrolment. The aim of the article is to assess whether there is a gender gap in academic results and to identify the sociodemographic and academic variables that may be causing such a gap by analysing how they shape such differences. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 is also considered. The results confirm that women underperformed significantly in our sample in terms of passing and scoring, especially among those between 30 and 45 years of age, who are more likely to have young children. When considering a distribution of family tasks biased against women, along with the higher average age of distance learning university students, gender gaps could probably be greater in nonface-to-face education. COVID-19 narrowed the gender gap during the lockdown period, as some men and women staying at home together were able to improve task sharing capabilities. After the lockdown, however, women's results worsened compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. A possible explanation is that they had to continue performing the same family duties in addition to substituting education and caring services (e.g., nurseries and day centres for the elderly) that did not resume activity immediately or continuously."
https://openalex.org/W4290666467,"Breast cancer is the most frequent and fatal cancer type globally. The fatality rate of breast cancer is mostly due to disease complications like hematological alterations. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the hematological abnormalities before, during, and after the initiation of cancer treatment in breast cancer patients at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital.Hematological profiles were collected from 267 breast cancer patients who attended the cancer treatment center from September 2017 to August 2021. A data extraction sheet was used to extract data from the patient's medical chart, including sociodemography, clinical, and hematological profiles. EPI info version 3.5.1 and SPSS Version 25 softwares were used for data entrance and analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics were summarized using frequency and percentage. The Friedman test followed by a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the mean difference between the hematological profiles at zero and after the 4th and 8th cycles of treatment.Of the total participants, 91% were females, and the median age of the study participants was 45 (IQR = 36, 55) years. Red blood cell, white blood cell, and lymphocyte counts, as well as hematocrit and hemoglobin values, were significantly reduced after the initiation of cancer treatment, while the platelet count and red cell distribution width were significantly increased. The prevalence of anemia was 21.7% (95% CI: 16.6, 26.8), 22.7% (95% CI: 17.6, 27.8), and 26.4% (95% CI: 21.3, 31.5) before, during, and after the initiation of cancer treatment, respectively. The prevalence of leukopenia before, during, and after treatment was 9.7%, 18.8%, and 15.1%, respectively. Finally the prevalence of thrombocytopenia was 6.3%, 3.4%, and 8% at before, during, and after treatment, respectively.This study concluded that many hematological parameters were significantly affected by the breast cancer treatment. Therefore, proper patient follow-up and provide appropriate interventions related to their hematological abnormalities is crucial. It is also important to conduct further prospective studies to confirm the findings of this study."
https://openalex.org/W4290666490,"Dietary nitrate lowers the oxygen cost of human exercise. This effect has been suggested to result from stimulation of coupling efficiency of skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation by reduced nitrate derivatives. In this paper, we report the acute effects of sodium nitrite on the bioenergetic behaviour of cultured rat (L6) myocytes. At odds with improved efficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, extracellular flux analysis reveals that a ½-hour exposure to NaNO2 (0.1-5 μM) does not affect mitochondrial coupling efficiency in static myoblasts or in spontaneously contracting myotubes. Unexpectedly, NaNO2 stimulates the rate of glycolytic ATP production in both myoblasts and myotubes. Increased ATP supply through glycolysis does not emerge at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation, which means that NaNO2 acutely increases the rate of overall myocellular ATP synthesis, significantly so in myoblasts and tending towards significance in contractile myotubes. Notably, NaNO2 exposure shifts myocytes to a more glycolytic bioenergetic phenotype. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption does not decrease after NaNO2 exposure, and non-mitochondrial respiration tends to drop. When total ATP synthesis rates are expressed in relation to total cellular oxygen consumption rates, it thus transpires that NaNO2 lowers the oxygen cost of ATP supply in cultured L6 myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4290666542,"The clinical profiles and outcomes of patients with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase fusion-positive ( NTRK + ) solid tumors receiving standard of care other than tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitor (TRKi) targeted therapy have not been well documented. Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of patients with NTRK + tumors treated in clinical practice using information from a United States electronic health record-derived clinicogenomic database. We also compared survival outcomes in NTRK + patients and matched NTRK fusion-negative ( NTRK – ) patients and investigated the clinical prognostic value of NTRK fusions. NTRK positivity was defined by the presence of a fusion or rearrangement involving NTRK1/2/3 , determined using NGS (Foundation Medicine, Inc.). NTRK + patients (n = 28) were diagnosed with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2019 and had received no TRKis (e.g., entrectinib or larotrectinib) during their patient journey. The unselected NTRK − population comprised 24,903 patients, and the matched NTRK − cohort included 280 patients. NTRK + patients tended to be younger, were more commonly not smokers, and had a shorter time from advanced diagnosis to first NGS report, compared with unselected NTRK − patients; however, these differences were not significant. Median overall survival (OS) from advanced/metastatic diagnosis was 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.2–14.1) for the NTRK + cohort versus 10.4 months (95% CI, 6.7–14.3) for the matched NTRK − cohort; hazard ratio for death in NTRK + versus matched NTRK − patients was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0–2.5; P = 0.05). Genomic co-alterations were rare in the NTRK + cohort (only two of 28 patients had a co-alteration). Overall, while hazard ratios suggest NTRK fusions may be a negative prognostic factor of survival, there are no significant indications of any favorable impact of NTRK fusions on patient outcomes. TRKis, with their high response rate and good tolerability, are likely to improve outcomes for patients compared with existing standard-of-care treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4290667426,"Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is used to prevent malaria and associated unfavorable maternal and foetal outcomes in pregnancy in moderate to high malaria transmission areas.

The Pfdhfr triple mutant N51I, C59R and S108N ( IRN ) was carried by 80.5% (128/159) and 96.5% (28/29) of the typed isolates collected at ANC visit and at delivery respectively. In the Pfdhps gene, SNPs were detected in 0.6% (1/174), 76.2% (138/181), 33.2% (60/181), 1.2% (2/174), 0% (0/183), and 16.6% (27/173) at codons 431, 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 respectively in samples collected at ANC, and 0% (0/25), 72% (18/25), 40% (10/25), 3.6% (1/25), 0% (0/29) and 7.4% (2/27) in samples collected at delivery. Quadruple mutant Pfdhfr N51I, C59R, and S108N + Pfdhps A437G ( IRN - G K) was present in 25.8% (33/128) and 34.8% (8/23) of isolates at ANC and at delivery respectively. Quintuple mutant alleles Pfdhfr N51I, C59R, and S108N + Pfdhps A437G and K540E ( IRN - GE ) were detected in 0.8% (1/128) and 4.4% (1/23) of samples collected at ANC and at delivery respectively. No mutations were identified at Pfdhfr codons 16 or 164 or Pfdhps 581. There is a high prevalence of Pfdhfr triple mutant P . falciparum infections among pregnant women in the study area. However, prevalence of the combined Pfdhfr/Pfdhps quadruple and quintuple mutants IRN - G K and IRN - GE respectively prior to commencement of IPTp-SP were low, and no Pfdhps A581G mutant was detected, indicating that SP is still likely to be efficacious for IPTp-SP in the forest-savannah area in the middle belt of Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W4290667436,"Workers' living standards have recently deteriorated in the service sector throughout the world, although a few decades ago, service was among the fastest growing sectors in industrialised nations. However, in recent years, in service sectors tourism especially has been drying up. This paper examines the symmetric and asymmetric effects of tourism, market capital, financial development, and trade on service sector employment in Australia from the period 1991-2019. The results of the cointegration tests, notably the ARDL and NARDL bound tests, reveal that the variables are related in the long run. The positive effect of tourist arrival on service sector employment in Australia is confirmed by long-run estimates from both ARDL and NARDL approaches. Similarly, both approaches also confirm the long-run positive relation of financial development. However, while ARDL shows long-run negative and positive associations of market capital and trade, respectively, the opposite is found in the case of the NARDL approach. As a result, policy proposals like planning and initiating tools for ensuring consistent international arrivals and easing of entry requirements have been recommended by this study to assist Australia in enhancing service sector employment, thus promoting economic development."
https://openalex.org/W4290667503,"Estrogens are thought to contribute to cognitive function in part by promoting the function of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the hippocampus and cortical regions including the entorhinal cortex. Reductions in estrogens may alter cognition by reducing the function of cholinergic inputs to both the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In the present study, we assessed the effects of ovariectomy on proteins associated with cholinergic synapses in the entorhinal cortex. Ovariectomy was conducted at PD63, and tissue was obtained on PD84 to 89 to quantify changes in the degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase, the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and muscarinic M1 receptor protein. Although the vesicular acetylcholine transporter was unaffected, ovariectomy reduced both acetylcholinesterase and M1 receptor protein, and these reductions were prevented by chronic replacement of 17β-estradiol following ovariectomy. We also assessed the effects of ovariectomy on the cholinergic modulation of excitatory transmission, by comparing the effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor eserine on evoked excitatory synaptic field potentials in brain slices obtained from intact rats, and from ovariectomized rats with or without 17β-estradiol replacement. Eserine is known to prolong the effects of endogenously released acetylcholine, resulting in an M1-like mediated reduction of glutamate release at excitatory synapses. The reduction in excitatory synaptic potentials in layer II of the entorhinal cortex induced by 15-min application of 10 μM eserine was greatly reduced in slices from ovariectomized rats as compared to intact rats and ovariectomized rats with replacement of 17β-estradiol. The reduced modulatory effect of eserine is consistent with the observed changes in cholinergic proteins, and suggests that reductions in 17β-estradiol following ovariectomy lead to impaired cholinergic function within the entorhinal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W4290723817,"Recent rapid industrial development in the Korean Peninsula has increased the impacts of meteorological disasters on marine and coastal environments. In particular, marine fog driven by summer cold water masses can inhibit transport and aviation; yet a lack of observational data hinders our understanding of this phenomena. The present study aimed to analyze the differences in cold water mass formation according to sea surface temperature (SST) resolution and its effects on the occurrence and distribution of sea fog over the Korean Peninsula from June 23–July 1, 2016, according to the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Data from the Final Operational Model Global Tropospheric Analyses were provided at 1° and 0.25° resolutions and NOAA real-time global SST (RTG-SST) data were provided at 0.083°. While conventional analyses have used initial SST distributions throughout the entire simulation period, small-scale, rapidly developing oceanic phenomena (e.g., cold water masses) lasting for several days act as an important mediating factor between the lower atmosphere and sea. RTG-SST was successful at identifying fog presence and maintained the most extensive horizontal distribution of cold water masses. In addition, it was confirmed that the difference in SST resolution led to varying sizes and strengths of the warm pools that provided water vapor from the open sea area to the atmosphere. On examining the horizontal water vapor transport and the vertical structure of the generated sea fog using the RTG-SST, water vapors were found to be continuously introduced by the southwesterly winds from June 29 to 30, creating a fog event throughout June 30. Accordingly, high-resolution SST data must be input into numerical models whenever possible. It is expected that the findings of this study can contribute to the reduction of ship accidents via the accurate simulation of sea fog."
https://openalex.org/W4291019437,"Clostridioides difficile infection is a global health threat and remains the primary cause of hospital-acquired infections worldwide. The burgeoning incidence and severity of infections coupled with high rates of recurrence have created an urgent need for novel therapeutics. Here, we report a novel natural product scaffold as a potential anticlostridial lead with antivirulence properties and potent activity both in vitro and in vivo. A whole cell phenotypic screening of 1,000 purified natural products identified 6 compounds with potent activity against C. difficile (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range from 0.03 to 2 μg/ml). All these 6 compounds were non-toxic to human colorectal cells. The natural product compounds also inhibited the production of key toxins, TcdA and TcdB, the key virulence determinants of C. difficile infection pathology. Additionally, the compounds exhibited rapid bactericidal activity and were superior to the standard-of-care antibiotic vancomycin, in reducing a high inoculum of C. difficile in vitro. Furthermore, a murine model of C. difficile infection revealed that compound NP-003875 conferred 100% protection to the infected mice from clinical manifestations of the disease. Collectively, the current study lays the foundation for further investigation of the natural product NP-003875 as a potential therapeutic choice for C. difficile infection."
https://openalex.org/W4292283967,"The possibility of posttraumatic growth in the aftermath of pregnancy loss has received limited attention to date. This study investigated posttraumatic growth in mothers following stillbirth compared to early miscarriage. It was hypothesised that mothers following stillbirth will demonstrate more posttraumatic growth, challenge to assumptive beliefs, and disclosure than mothers following early miscarriage. The study also sought to understand how theoretically-derived variables of the Model of Growth in Grief (challenge to assumptive beliefs and disclosure) explained unique variance in posttraumatic growth when key factors were controlled for. One-hundred and twenty women who had experienced a stillbirth (N = 57) or early miscarriage (N = 63) within the last two to six years completed validated questionnaires in an online survey relating to posttraumatic growth and key variables relevant to emotional adjustment post-bereavement. Participants who had experienced a stillbirth demonstrated significantly higher levels of posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress symptoms, perinatal grief, disclosure, challenge to assumptive beliefs and rumination than participants who had experienced an early miscarriage (Cohen’s d ranged .38-.94). In a hierarchical stepwise regression analysis, challenge to assumptive beliefs alone predicted 17.5% of the variance in posttraumatic growth. Intrusive and deliberate rumination predicted an additional 5.5% of variance, with urge to talk, reluctance to talk, and actual self-disclosure predicting a further 15.3%. A final model including these variables explained 47.9% of the variance in posttraumatic growth. Interventions targeting challenge to assumptive beliefs, disclosure, and rumination are likely to be clinically useful to promote psychological adjustment in mothers who have experienced stillbirth and early miscarriage."
https://openalex.org/W4289526571,"Ess2, also known as Dgcr14, is a transcriptional co-regulator of CD4+ T cells. Ess2 is located in a chromosomal region, the loss of which has been associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), which causes heart defects, skeletal abnormalities, and immunodeficiency. However, the specific association of Ess2 with 22q11DS remains unclear. To elucidate the role of Ess2 in T-cell development, we generated Ess2 floxed (Ess2fl/fl) and CD4+ T cell-specific Ess2 KO (Ess2ΔCD4/ΔCD4) mice using the Cre/loxP system. Interestingly, Ess2ΔCD4/ΔCD4 mice exhibited reduced naïve T-cell numbers in the spleen, while the number of thymocytes (CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8-, and CD4-CD8+) in the thymus remained unchanged. Furthermore, Ess2ΔCD4/ΔCD4 mice had decreased NKT cells and increased γδT cells in the thymus and spleen. A genome-wide expression analysis using RNA-seq revealed that Ess2 deletion alters the expression of many genes in CD4 single-positive thymocytes, including genes related to the immune system and Myc target genes. In addition, Ess2 enhanced the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Some genes identified as Ess2 targets in mice show expressional correlation with ESS2 in human immune cells. Moreover, Ess2ΔCD4/ΔCD4 naïve CD4+ T cells did not maintain survival in response to IL-7. Our results suggest that Ess2 plays a critical role in post-thymic T-cell survival through the Myc and IL-7 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4289528844,"Proximity-dependent protein labeling provides a powerful in vivo strategy to characterize the interactomes of specific proteins. We previously optimized a proximity labeling protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans using the highly active biotin ligase TurboID. A significant constraint on the sensitivity of TurboID is the presence of abundant endogenously biotinylated proteins that take up bandwidth in the mass spectrometer, notably carboxylases that use biotin as a cofactor. In C. elegans, these comprise POD-2/acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, PCCA-1/propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, PYC-1/pyruvate carboxylase, and MCCC-1/methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase alpha. Here, we developed ways to remove these carboxylases prior to streptavidin purification and mass spectrometry by engineering their corresponding genes to add a C-terminal His10 tag. This allows us to deplete them from C. elegans lysates using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. To demonstrate the method's efficacy, we use it to expand the interactome map of the presynaptic active zone protein ELKS-1. We identify many known active zone proteins, including UNC-10/RIM, SYD-2/liprin-alpha, SAD-1/BRSK1, CLA-1/CLArinet, C16E9.2/Sentryn, as well as previously uncharacterized potentially synaptic proteins such as the ortholog of human angiomotin, F59C12.3 and the uncharacterized protein R148.3. Our approach provides a quick and inexpensive solution to a common contaminant problem in biotin-dependent proximity labeling. The approach may be applicable to other model organisms and will enable deeper and more complete analysis of interactors for proteins of interest."
https://openalex.org/W4289731993,"Progranulin (PGRN) is a glycoprotein implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. It is highly expressed in microglia and macrophages and can be secreted or delivered to the lysosome compartment. PGRN comprises 7.5 granulin repeats and is processed into individual granulin peptides within the lysosome, but the functions of these peptides are largely unknown. Here, we identify CD68, a lysosome membrane protein mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, as a binding partner of PGRN and PGRN-derived granulin E. Deletion analysis of CD68 showed that this interaction is mediated by the mucin-proline-rich domain of CD68. While CD68 deficiency does not affect the lysosomal localization of PGRN, it results in a specific decrease in the levels of granulin E but no other granulin peptides. On the other hand, the deficiency of PGRN, and its derivative granulin peptides, leads to a significant shift in the molecular weight of CD68, without altering CD68 localization within the cell. Our results support that granulin E and CD68 reciprocally regulate each other's protein homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4289732098,"The analysis of hydrogen deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry as a function of temperature and mutation has emerged as a generic and efficient tool for the spatial resolution of protein networks that are proposed to function in the thermal activation of catalysis. In this work, we extend temperature-dependent hydrogen deuterium exchange from apo-enzyme structures to protein-ligand complexes. Using adenosine deaminase as a prototype, we compared the impacts of a substrate analog (1-deaza-adenosine) and a very tight-binding inhibitor/transition state analog (pentostatin) at single and multiple temperatures. At a single temperature, we observed different hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry properties for the two ligands, as expected from their 106-fold differences in strength of binding. By contrast, analogous patterns for temperature-dependent hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry emerge in the presence of both 1-deaza-adenosine and pentostatin, indicating similar impacts of either ligand on the enthalpic barriers for local protein unfolding. We extended temperature-dependent hydrogen deuterium exchange to a function-altering mutant of adenosine deaminase in the presence of pentostatin and revealed a protein thermal network that is highly similar to that previously reported for the apo-enzyme (Gao et al., 2020, JACS 142, 19936-19949). Finally, we discuss the differential impacts of pentostatin binding on overall protein flexibility versus site-specific thermal transfer pathways in the context of models for substrate-induced changes to a distributed protein conformational landscape that act in synergy with embedded protein thermal networks to achieve efficient catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W4289732191,"Soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenases (STHs) are flavoenzymes involved in the redox homeostasis of the essential cofactors NAD(H) and NADP(H). They catalyze the reversible transfer of reducing equivalents between the two nicotinamide cofactors. The soluble transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli (SthA) has found wide use in both in vivo and in vitro applications to steer reducing equivalents toward NADPH-requiring reactions. However, mechanistic insight into SthA function is still lacking. In this work, we present a biochemical characterization of SthA, focusing for the first time on the reactivity of the flavoenzyme with molecular oxygen. We report on oxidase activity of SthA that takes place both during transhydrogenation and in the absence of an oxidized nicotinamide cofactor as an electron acceptor. We find that this reaction produces the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary significance of the well-conserved CXXXXT motif that distinguishes STHs from the related family of flavoprotein disulfide reductases in which a CXXXXC motif is conserved. Our mutational analysis revealed the cysteine and threonine combination in SthA leads to better coupling efficiency of transhydrogenation and reduced reactive oxygen species release compared to enzyme variants with mutated motifs. These results expand our mechanistic understanding of SthA by highlighting reactivity with molecular oxygen and the importance of the evolutionarily conserved sequence motif."
https://openalex.org/W4289767391,"Riboswitches are 5'-untranslated regions of mRNA that change their conformation in response to ligand binding, allowing post-transcriptional gene regulation. This ligand-based model of riboswitch function has been expanded with the discovery of a ""pH-responsive element"" (PRE) riboswitch in Escherichia coli. At neutral pH, the PRE folds into a translationally inactive structure with an occluded ribosome-binding sequence, whereas at alkaline pH, the PRE adopts a translationally active structure. This unique riboswitch does not rely on ligand binding in a traditional sense to modulate its alternative folding outcomes. Rather, pH controls riboswitch folding by two possible modes that are yet to be distinguished; pH either regulates the transcription rate of RNA polymerase (RNAP) or acts on the RNA itself. Previous work suggested that RNAP pausing is prolonged by alkaline pH at two sites, stimulating PRE folding into the active structure. To date, there has been no rigorous exploration into how pH influences RNAP pausing kinetics during PRE synthesis. To provide that understanding and distinguish between pH acting on RNAP versus RNA, we investigated RNAP pausing kinetics at key sites for PRE folding under different pH conditions. We find that pH influences RNAP pausing but not in the manner proposed previously. Rather, alkaline pH either decreases or has no effect on RNAP pause longevity, suggesting that the modulation of RNAP pausing is not the sole mechanism by which pH affects PRE folding. These findings invite the possibility that the RNA itself actively participates in the sensing of pH."

The objectives of this study were to describe the use of a novel drug-eluting embolic microsphere containing paclitaxel for use during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), to compare results of liver-specific owner questionnaires and tumor volume pre- and post-TACE, and to measure systemic paclitaxel concentration post-TACE. Client-owned dogs with non-resectable hepatic neoplasia were prospectively enrolled. All owners completed questionnaires validated for the assessment of subjective outcomes in dogs with cancer before the TACE procedure and approximately 4 weeks after the TACE procedure. A CT scan was performed before TACE and 1 month after TACE; results were compared. Blood samples were obtained at specified time points post-TACE to determine systemic paclitaxel concentrations. Seven dogs (median weight: 8.9 kg; range, 4.3-31 kg) were enrolled. TACE was successfully performed in all dogs, and no intra-procedural complications were encountered. Questionnaire scores improved significantly post-TACE. Among the 6 dogs for which full data were available, median pre-TACE tumor volume was 390 cc (range 152-1,484; interquartile range 231-1,139) and median post-TACE tumor volume was 203 cc (range 98-889; interquartile range 151-369), which was significantly (P = .028) lower. All 6 dogs had a reduction in volume at the post-TACE measurement. Mean percent change in tumor volume was -45.6% (95%CI -58.6 to -32.6%). The mean plasma paclitaxel concentration in canine blood peaked at 4 days post-TACE procedure and was 25.7 ng/mL (range = 3.09-110 ng/mL) Median survival time was 629 days (95%CI 18 to upper limit not reached). The use of a novel paclitaxel-eluting microsphere in this cohort of dogs successfully decreased tumor volume significantly after TACE and improved clinical signs. Future investigation into the use of TACE and other similar therapies is warranted due to the promising outcomes noted in this cohort."

However, the influence of an individual's perception of criticism in their social relationships on negative emotional reactions to criticism has not been examined across different relational contexts. The present study investigated the influence of perceived criticism and relational contexts-mother, father, romantic partner, and workplace supervisor-on the feelings of hurt and relational distancing experienced upon receiving criticism. Participants (N = 178) completed the Perceived Criticism Measure and read vignettes describing scenarios of personally directed criticism in the four relational contexts. Significant main effects of perceived criticism and source were found on levels of relational distancing. Participants who perceived their relational partner to be more critical experienced greater distancing upon receiving criticism from them. Greater relational distancing was experienced for criticism received from workplace supervisors compared to mothers, fathers and romantic partners. Results indicate that emotional reactions and relationship outcomes in response to criticism can differ based on individual differences and relational context, suggesting their role in relationship maintenance and development of psychopathology."

We modified the 2TT to the cross-thumb technique (CTT) to maintain good CPR performance at the same position as 2FT. We aimed to compare the quality of chest compression and brief hands-off times in 2FT, 2TT, and CTT by a single rescuer using an infant CPR manikin model.This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled simulation-based study. We used the Resusci® Baby QCPR (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway) as a simulated 3-month-old infant. Ventilation was performed by the mouth-to-mouth technique using a chest compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 as a single rescuer. Data on CPR quality, such as locations, rates, depth and release of chest compressions, hands-off times, and proper ventilation, were recorded using the Resusci® Baby QCPR and SkillReporter. Also, the chest compression fraction (CCF) was automatically calculated.The depth of chest compression in 2FT, 2TT, and CTT were 40.0 mm (interquartile range [IQR] 39.0, 41.0), 42.0 mm (IQR 41.0, 43.0), and 42.0 mm (IQR 41.0, 43.0), respectively. The depth of chest compression in 2FT was shallower than that in the other two techniques (P<0.05). CCF in 2FT, 2TT, and CTT were 73.9% (IQR 72.2, 75.6), 71.2% (IQR 67.2, 72.2) and 71.3% (IQR 67.7, 74.1), respectively. CCF was higher in 2FT than in the other two techniques (P<0.05). Correct location in 2FT, 2TT, and CTT were 99.0% (IQR 86.0, 100.0), 100.0% (IQR 97.0, 100.0) and 100.0% (IQR 99.0, 100.0), respectively. Correct location in CTT and 2TT was higher than that in 2FT. Performing CTT, the subjective pain and fatigue score were lower than other two technique.A new chest compression technique, CTT was better in chest compression depth compared with 2FT and may be helpful in maintaining correct chest compression location with less pain and fatigue in infant CPR."

GsMTx4, a mechanosensitive channel–selective inhibitor, has been shown to suppress arrhythmias through the inhibition of stretch-activated channels (SACs) in the heart. The cost of synthesizing this peptide is a major obstacle to clinical use. Here, we studied two types of short peptides derived from GsMTx4 for their effects on a stretch-activated big potassium channel (SAKcaC) from the heart. Type I, a 17-residue peptide (referred to as Pept 01), showed comparable efficacy, whereas type II (i.e., Pept 02), a 10-residue peptide, exerted even more potent inhibitory efficacy on SAKcaC compared with GsMTx4. We identified through mutagenesis important sequences required for peptide functions. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations revealed common structural features with a hydrophobic head followed by a positively charged protrusion that may be involved in peptide channel–lipid interactions. Furthermore, we suggest that these short peptides may inhibit SAKcaC through a specific modification to the mechanogate, as the inhibitory effects for both types of peptides were mostly abolished when tested with a mechano-insensitive channel variant (STREX-del) and a nonmechanosensitive big potassium (mouse Slo1) channel.

It also was shown to suppress stretch-induced vulnerability to AF without influence on the refractory period and action potential under stretching, making this peptide a potential AAD candidate for the treatment of AF (1Bode F.

Nevertheless, synthesizing the folded structure with three disulfide bonds limits its application and the development of therapeutic drugs. The primary aim of this study was to identify short peptides that could mimic the function of peptide GsMTx4 on MSCs by using a SA big potassium (BK) channel (SAKcaC) from the heart as a model channel.Spider toxin GsMTx4 belongs to the inhibitor cystine-knot (ICK) peptide, a common feature for venom toxins (16Oswald R.E.

Structural analysis reveals that GsMTx4 is composed of 34 amino acids, the six cysteines in the backbone form three cystine knots and are folded into two doughnut-like interconnected rings (16Oswald R.E.

Another prominent feature for GsMTx4 is that the structure contains a belt of charged residues surrounding a hydrophobic patch. Sequence comparison between the two mechanotoxins (GsMTx-4 and GsMTx-2) and with other homologous ICK peptides (e.g., hanatoxin, voltage sensor toxin X1, etc.) shows less similarity between the two MS peptides (GsMTx4 versus GsMTx2) than among GsMTx4 to other ICK peptides (e.g., GsMTx4 versus hanatoxin) (16Oswald R.E.

Even though, none of these ICK peptides (e.g., hanatoxin, voltage sensor toxin X1, etc.) has been identified as an inhibitor of the MSCs. Thus, the inhibitory action of GsMTx4 on MSCs may be explained by a feature that is not shared with other peptides (16Oswald R.E. Suchyna T.M. McFeeters R. Gottlieb P. Sachs F.

We noticed that the backbone folds in loop2 and loop3 in the two mechanotoxins (GsMTx4 versus GsMTx2) are highly conserved (16Oswald R.E. Suchyna T.M. McFeeters R. Gottlieb P. Sachs F. Solution structure of peptide toxins that block mechanosensitive ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34443-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We thus predicted that the regions between loop2 + loop3 in GsMTx4 are responsible for its action on the MSCs. As the backbone in loop2 between the two mechanotoxins (GsMTx4 and GsMTx2) is nearly superimposable, whereas that in loop3 of GsMTx4 shows greater similarity to hanatoxin than to GsMTx2 (16Oswald R.E. Suchyna T.M. McFeeters R. Gottlieb P. Sachs F. Solution structure of peptide toxins that block mechanosensitive ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34443-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), loop3 does not seem to be essential for the selective action of peptide GsMTx4 on MSCs. We thus predicated that loop2 in GsMTx4 is responsible for its specific inhibition action on the MSCs. In this study, two types of short peptides, one (e.g., Pept 01) derived from the loop2 + loop3 in GsMTx4, and the other (e.g., Pept 02, Pept 03, Pept 04, and Pept 05, etc.) from loop2 were designed; we tested their inhibition efficacy on a SAKcaC as well as the non-MS variant (STREX-del) and a regular BK (mouse Slo1 [mSlo1]) channel.ResultsPeptide design strategyThe neuropeptide GsMTx4 has been reported to selectively inhibit MS ion channels (12Li H.

To examine whether a short peptide derived from GsMTx4 would function similarly to GsMTx4, we designed and synthesized two types of short peptides based on the similarities among ICK toxins and tested their effects on SAKcaC.Theoretically, toxins having similar physiological functions would be expected to share similar sequence and/or structural features (16Oswald R.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34443-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Even though, GsMTx4 shares less homology in sequence with GsMTx2, another mechanotoxin (∼11% identity and ∼28% similarity) than to hanatoxin (∼28% identity and ∼37% similarity) (16Oswald R.E.

Likewise, the voltage sensor toxin X1 (VSTX1) that blocks voltage-sensitive ion channels has an even greater identity and similarity to GsMTx4 (∼43.2% identity and ∼54.3% similarity), nevertheless, VSTX1 does not block MSCs (16Oswald R.E.

These correlations indicated that examining the linear sequence of the full-length peptide may not be sufficient for understanding the efficacy of blocking MSCs. We noticed that the backbone folds in loop2 + loop3 share higher similarity between the two mechanotoxins (16Oswald R.E. Suchyna T.M. McFeeters R. Gottlieb P. Sachs F.

These led us to postulate that the functional fragment in GsMTx4 might be among the residues between in loop 2 and loop 3 (as we designed as the type I peptide Pept 01, from Trp7 to Cys17 in GsMTx4; Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 2Cys17 is important for type I (Pept 01) function in the absence of Cys10/Cys11.

https://openalex.org/W4289997353,"In higher eukaryotes, mitochondria play multiple roles in energy production, signaling, and biosynthesis. Mitochondria possess multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 37 genes that are essential for mitochondrial and cellular function. When mtDNA is challenged by endogenous and exogenous factors, mtDNA undergoes repair, degradation, and compensatory synthesis. mtDNA degradation is an emerging pathway in mtDNA damage response and maintenance. A key factor involved is the human mitochondrial genome maintenance exonuclease 1 (MGME1). Despite previous biochemical and functional studies, controversies exist regarding the polarity of MGME1-mediated DNA cleavage. Also, how DNA sequence may affect the activities of MGME1 remains elusive. Such information is not only fundamental to the understanding of MGME1 but critical for deciphering the mechanism of mtDNA degradation. Herein, we use quantitative assays to examine the effects of substrate structure and sequence on the DNA-binding and enzymatic activities of MGME1. We demonstrate that MGME1 binds to and cleaves from the 5'-end of single-stranded DNA substrates, especially in the presence of 5'-phosphate, which plays an important role in DNA binding and optimal cleavage by MGME1. In addition, MGME1 tolerates certain modifications at the terminal end, such as a 5'-deoxyribosephosphate intermediate formed in base excision repair. We show that MGME1 processes different sequences with varying efficiencies, with dT and dC sequences being the most and least efficiently digested, respectively. Our results provide insights into the enzymatic properties of MGME1 and a rationale for the coordination of MGME1 with the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase γ in mtDNA degradation."

The purpose of the study was to investigate the diagnostic value of the clinical, laboratory and especially echocardiographic characteristics including speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) of patients with ACS-like myocarditis and AMI. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing 69 symptomatic patients (≤ 45 years old), hospitalized at the Department of Interventional Cardiology (Medical University of Lodz, Poland) between April 2014 and June 2021 with an initial diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Results 37 patients with the cardiac magnetic resonance–confirmed acute myocarditis and 32 patients diagnosed with AMI based on the clinical presentation, electrocardiogram and the presence of a culprit lesion on the coronary angiography were analysed including echocardiography parameters. On STE analysis an average global longitudinal (GLS), radial and circumferential strain including three—layers observation were significantly lower (absolute value) in patients with AMI versus acute myocarditis (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in Endo/Epi ratio (p = 0.144) between the groups. An average GLS &lt; (-17.5) represented the optimal cut-off value for the myocarditis diagnosis. Conclusion In patients with AMI a significant reduction of global and three-layers strains compared to patients with myocarditis was detected. Furthermore, our analysis also confirmed the discriminative pattern of myocardial injury between the groups."
https://openalex.org/W4290666445,"Social determinants of health (SDoH) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are interrelated. The prevalence of T2DM is increased amongst those with suboptimal SDoH. Poor SDoH can also negatively impact T2DM self-management. Social determinants of health are mostly considered at population and community levels, rather than individually or clinically. This qualitative study combines the perspectives of a multidisciplinary cohort of health professionals to identify and explore the impact of social determinants on self-management, and ways they could be incorporated into individual clinical care. Purposively selected participants chose to partake in an in-depth, semi-structured, one-on-one interview or focus group. Data were analysed, and themes identified using a combination of deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Fifty-one health professionals volunteered for the study. Two small focus groups (n = 3 and n = 4) and 44 one-on-one interviews were conducted. The identified themes were: 1) Support for incorporating SDoH into T2DM care, 2) Effect of SDoH on T2DM self-management, 3) Identifying and addressing social need, 4) Requirements for incorporating SDoH into T2DM individual clinical care. Health professionals reported that poor social determinants negatively affect an individual’s ability to self manage their T2DM. Person-centred care could be enhanced, and people with T2DM may be more likely to achieve self-management goals if SDoH were included in individual clinical care. To achieve successful and sustained self-management for people with T2DM, health professionals require a thorough understanding of T2DM and the effect of social determinants, respect for client privacy, client trust and rapport, effective communication skills, validated tools for assessing SDoH, team champions, teamwork, ongoing education and training, adequate resources, guiding policies and procedures, and management support. Incorporating SDoH into individual, clinical care for people with T2DM was strongly supported by health professionals. If embraced, this addition to care for individuals with T2DM could improve self-management capacity and enhance person-centred care."
https://openalex.org/W4290666491,"Heterotrimeric G-protein transducin, Gt, is a key signal transducer and amplifier in retinal rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Despite similar subunit composition, close amino acid identity, and identical posttranslational farnesylation of their Gγ subunits, rods and cones rely on unique Gγ1 (Gngt1) and Gγc (Gngt2) isoforms, respectively. The only other farnesylated G-protein γ-subunit, Gγ11 (Gng11), is expressed in multiple tissues but not retina. To determine whether Gγ1 regulates uniquely rod phototransduction, we generated transgenic rods expressing Gγ1, Gγc, or Gγ11 in Gγ1-deficient mice and analyzed their properties. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting demonstrated the robust expression of each transgenic Gγ in rod cells and restoration of Gαt1 expression, which is greatly reduced in Gγ1-deficient rods. Electroretinography showed restoration of visual function in all three transgenic Gγ1-deficient lines. Recordings from individual transgenic rods showed that photosensitivity impaired in Gγ1-deficient rods was also fully restored. In all dark-adapted transgenic lines, Gαt1 was targeted to the outer segments, reversing its diffuse localization found in Gγ1-deficient rods. Bright illumination triggered Gαt1 translocation from the rod outer to inner segments in all three transgenic strains. However, Gαt1 translocation in Gγ11 transgenic mice occurred at significantly dimmer background light. Consistent with this, transretinal ERG recordings revealed gradual response recovery in moderate background illumination in Gγ11 transgenic mice but not in Gγ1 controls. Thus, while farnesylated Gγ subunits are functionally active and largely interchangeable in supporting rod phototransduction, replacement of retina-specific Gγ isoforms by the ubiquitous Gγ11 affects the ability of rods to adapt to background light."
https://openalex.org/W4290691905,"Avian lymphoid leukosis-like (LL-like) lymphoma has been observed in some experimental and commercial lines of chickens that are free of exogenous avian leukosis virus. Reported cases of avian lymphoid leukosis-like lymphoma incidences in the susceptible chickens are relatively low, but the apathogenic subgroup E avian leukosis virus (ALV-E) and the Marek’s disease vaccine, SB-1, significantly escalate the disease incidence in the susceptible chickens. However, the underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we bioinformatically analyzed the deep RNA sequences of 6 lymphoid leukosis-like lymphoma samples, collected from susceptible chickens post both ALV-E and SB-1 inoculation, and identified a total of 1,692 novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Thirty-nine of those novel lncRNAs were detected with altered expression in the LL-like tumors. In addition, 13 lncRNAs whose neighboring genes also showed differentially expression and 2 conserved novel lncRNAs, XLOC_001407 and XLOC_022595 , may have previously un-appreciated roles in tumor development in human. Furthermore, 14 lncRNAs, especially XLOC_004542 , exhibited strong potential as competing endogenous RNAs via sponging miRNAs. The analysis also showed that ALV subgroup E viral gene Gag/Gag-pol and the MD vaccine SB-1 viral gene R-LORF1 and ORF413 were particularly detectable in the LL-like tumor samples. In addition, we discovered 982 novel lncRNAs that were absent in the current annotation of chicken genome and 39 of them were aberrantly expressed in the tumors. This is the first time that lncRNA signature is identified in avian lymphoid leukosis-like lymphoma and suggests the epigenetic factor, lncRNA, is involved with the avian lymphoid leukosis-like lymphoma formation and development in susceptible chickens. Further studies to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the avian lymphoid leukosis-like lymphoma is indeed warranted."

To reduce the obesity prevalence levels and associated challenges, public health interventions highlight healthy eating and increased physical activity, which are key elements for weight management.This study explored perceived factors that hinder or facilitate weight management in an urban poor context in Accra, Ghana.A cross-sectional qualitative data was obtained from eight focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted among community members. The FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis.The findings indicate that weight management is mainly inhibited by the perception that healthy foods are expensive and not satisfying, laziness, lack of time to engage in physical activity, and social representation of being fat or slim. On the contrary, personal decision to manage weight and social support facilitated engagement in weight management.The findings indicate that weight management is influenced by individual, community, and structural factors. These findings have programmatic implications in terms of health education strategies and messaging."
https://openalex.org/W4291020193,"Over the decades, practical biotechnology researchers have aimed to improve naturally occurring proteins and create novel ones. It is widely recognized that coupling protein sequence randomization with various effect screening methodologies is one of the most powerful techniques for quickly, efficiently, and purposefully acquiring these desired improvements. Over the years, considerable advancements have been made in this field. However, developing PCR-based or template-guided methodologies has been hampered by resultant template sequence biases. Here, we present a novel whole plasmid amplification-based approach, which we named OverFlap PCR, for randomizing virtually any region of plasmid DNA without introducing a template sequence bias."
https://openalex.org/W4291020487,"Proteome profile changes post-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (post-SARS-CoV-2) infection in different body sites of humans remains an active scientific investigation whose solutions stand a chance of providing more information on what constitutes SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. While proteomics has been used to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, there are limited data about the status of proteome profile in different human body sites infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To bridge this gap, our study aims to characterize the proteins secreted in urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), gargle solution, and nasopharyngeal samples and assess the proteome differences in these body samples collected from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. We downloaded publicly available proteomic data from ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ ). The data we downloaded had the following identifiers: (i) PXD019423, n = 3 from Charles Tanford Protein Center in Germany. (ii) IPX0002166000 , n = 15 from Beijing Proteome Research Centre, China. (iii) IPX0002429000 , n = 5 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, and (iv) PXD022889, n = 18 from Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905 USA. MaxQuant was used for the human peptide spectral matching using human and SARS-CoV-2 proteome database which we downloaded from the UniProt database (access date 13 th October 2021). The individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 viruses displayed a different proteome diversity from the different body sites we investigated. Overally, we identified 1809 proteins across the four sample types we compared. Urine and BALF samples had significantly more abundant SARS-CoV-2 proteins than the other body sites we compared. Urine samples had 257(33.7%) unique proteins, followed by nasopharyngeal with 250(32.8%) unique proteins. Gargle solution and BALF had 38(5%) and 73(9.6%) unique proteins respectively. Urine, gargle solution, nasopharyngeal, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples have different protein diversity in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our data also demonstrated that a given body site is characterized by a unique set of proteins in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4291020739,"Only about 39% of infants in low- and middle-income countries are exclusively breast-fed for the first six months. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive women report confusion about the best feeding methods. Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) practices in HIV positive mothers are sub-optimal in Ethiopia. This study aimed to identify the main factors influencing EBF among HIV positive breast-feeding mothers. A facility based cross-sectional study was carried out from September 2017 to June 30 2018 among HIV positive mothers with infants aged 6–23 months. Thirteen public health facilities (7 health centers and 6 hospitals) that provided anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services, found in three districts of West, East and Kellem Wollega Zones, were randomly selected. Respondents were recruited by systematic random sampling techniques from these facilities using client registers as a sampling frame. Data were collected using face to face interviews with a pre-tested questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI info Version 3.5.1 and analyzed using SPSS Version 20 for windows. Candidate variables for the final multi-variable model were selected considering P≤ 0.05 at bivariable analysis. Associations were declared at P≤ 0.05 by assuming Confidence Intervals did not cross ‘1’with corresponding 95%. A total of 218 HIV positive mothers were included in this study. Of these, only 122 (56.0%) practiced EBF in the first six months. The proportion of study participants who initiated EBF within the first hour of delivery was 134 (61.8%). Mean age of study participants was 28.6years with SD ± 4. Mothers’ having received advice on EBF [AOR 3, 95% CI (1.2–6.7)], disclosure of HIV status to someone close to them including their husband [AOR 6, 95% CI (1.2–29.6)] and believing HIV can be transmitted during delivery [AOR 5.2, 95% CI (1.1–24.0)] were found to increase the likelihood of EBF practices among the study participants (P-value ≤ 0.05). In this study, only just over half of the mothers practiced EBF for the first six months. Care providers should continue to encourage mothers to practice EBF in the first six months and to disclosure of HIV status to someone close to them including their partner. Efforts should be in place to curb the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission during delivery. Continues advise for mothers to practice EBF in the first 6 months is still needed."
https://openalex.org/W4291021268,"Talent identification and selection are critical components of competitive sport success. Despite the time, effort, and resources invested, the accuracy of selection decisions remains generally poor. While much of the scholarship in this area has focused on the factors discriminating skilled and less-skilled individuals, limited research exists on what information is used in the decision-making process for athlete selection. The current study seeks to gain a better understanding of the information used by elite distance running coaches when forming judgements for athlete selection. Ten semi-structured interviews with elite distance running coaches from across Canada were transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. It was interpreted that coaches mainly gather information using their coach’s eye to determine an athlete’s ‘fit’ to the team. Coaches also use more objective information such as race times and movement analyses to assess performance and judge future ‘potential’. As well, the decisions were believed to be influenced by situational considerations at the time of the selection procedure. Specifically, these considerations affecting a coach’s selection included length of time to make a decision, personal limitations in decision-making abilities, and team circumstances. Interestingly, coaches recognized limitations in their selection practices and procedures and discussed some of their personal and system-level biases, highlighting their awareness of potential selection inefficiencies/inaccuracies. Overall, distance running coaches used a variety of techniques to gather information before a selection was made, relying on both subjective and objective information for crafting judgments. Findings are discussed in relation to implications for coaches, sport organizations, and talent identification and selection programs."
