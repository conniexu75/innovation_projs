https://openalex.org/W3031323202,"Background The pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19) hit India recently; and the associated uncertainty is increasingly testing psychological resilience of the masses. When the global focus has mostly been on testing, finding a cure and preventing transmission; people are going through a myriad of psychological problems in adjusting to the current lifestyles and fear of the disease. Since there is a severe dearth of researches on this issue, we decided to conduct an online survey to evaluate its psychological impact. Methods From 26th to 29th March an online survey (FEEL-COVID) was conducted using principles of snowballing, and by invitation through text messages to participate. The survey collected data on socio-demographic and clinical variables related to COVID-19 (based on the current knowledge); along with measuring psychological impact with the help of Impact of Event–revised (IES-R) scale. Results There were a total of 1106 responses from around 64 cities in the country. Out of these 453 responses had at least one item missing; and were excluded from the analysis. The mean age of the respondents was around 41 years with a male female ratio of 3:1 and around 22% respondents were health care professionals. Overall approximately one third of respondents had significant psychological impact (IES-R score > 24). Higher psychological impact was predicted with younger age, female gender and comorbid physical illness. Presence of physical symptoms and contact history predicted higher psychological impact, but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion During the initial stages of COVID-19 in India, almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact. This indicates a need for more systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs of the population, which can help the government in formulating holistic interventions for affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3030261235,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified as the causative agent for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products.SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3).Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units.Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other. Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories."
https://openalex.org/W3029165707,"Bacterial biofilms are organized sessile communities of bacteria enclosed in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). To analyze organization of bacteria and EPS in high resolution and high magnification by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it is important to preserve the complex architecture of biofilms. Therefore, fixation abilities of formalin, glutaraldehyde, and Methacarn (methanol/chloroform/acetic acid-6:3:1) fixatives were evaluated to identify which fixative would best preserve the complex structure of bacterial biofilms. Economically important Gram-negative Mannheimia haemolytica, the major pathogen associated with bovine respiratory disease complex, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, the major cause of chronic mastitis in cattle, bacteria were selected since both form biofilms on solid-liquid interface. For SEM analysis, round glass coverslips were placed into the wells of 24-well plates and diluted M. haemolytica or S. aureus cultures were added, and incubated at 37°C for 48-72 h under static growth conditions. Culture media were aspirated and biofilms were fixed with an individual fixative for 48 h. SEM examination revealed that all three fixatives were effective preserving the bacterial cell morphology, however only Methacarn fixative could consistently preserve the complex structure of biofilms. EPS layers were clearly visible on the top, in the middle, and in the bottom of the biofilms with Methacarn fixative. Biomass and three-dimensional structure of the biofilms were further confirmed spectrophotometrically following crystal violet staining and by confocal microscopy after viability staining. These findings demonstrate that Methacarn fixative solution is superior to the other fixatives evaluated to preserve the complex architecture of biofilms grown on glass coverslips for SEM evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3029364764,"Background Health care workers (HCWs) are essential for the delivery of health care services in conflict areas and in rebuilding health systems post-conflict. Objective The aim of this study was to systematically identify and map the published evidence on HCWs in conflict and post-conflict settings. Our ultimate aim is to inform researchers and funders on research gap on this subject and support relevant stakeholders by providing them with a comprehensive resource of evidence about HCWs in conflict and post-conflict settings on a global scale. Methods We conducted a systematic mapping of the literature. We included a wide range of study designs, addressing any type of personnel providing health services in either conflict or post-conflict settings. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the general characteristics of the included papers and built two interactive systematic maps organized by country, study design and theme. Results Out of 13,863 identified citations, we included a total of 474 studies: 304 on conflict settings, 149 on post-conflict settings, and 21 on both conflict and post-conflict settings. For conflict settings, the most studied counties were Iraq (15%), Syria (15%), Israel (10%), and the State of Palestine (9%). The most common types of publication were opinion pieces in conflict settings (39%), and primary studies (33%) in post-conflict settings. In addition, most of the first and corresponding authors were affiliated with countries different from the country focus of the paper. Violence against health workers was the most tackled theme of papers reporting on conflict settings, while workforce performance was the most addressed theme by papers reporting on post-conflict settings. The majority of papers in both conflict and post-conflict settings did not report funding sources (81% and 53%) or conflicts of interest of authors (73% and 62%), and around half of primary studies did not report on ethical approvals (45% and 41%). Conclusions This systematic mapping provides a comprehensive database of evidence about HCWs in conflict and post-conflict settings on a global scale that is often needed to inform policies and strategies on effective workforce planning and management and in reducing emigration. It can also be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps to direct future primary research, and knowledge clusters."
https://openalex.org/W3031332809,"The field of Evolutionary Robotics addresses the challenge of automatically designing robotic systems. Furthermore, the field can also support biological investigations related to evolution. In this paper, we evolve (simulated) modular robots under diverse environmental conditions and analyze the influences that these conditions have on the evolved morphologies, controllers, and behavior. To this end, we introduce a set of morphological, controller, and behavioral descriptors that together span a multi-dimensional trait space. Using these descriptors, we demonstrate how changes in environmental conditions induce different levels of differentiation in this trait space. Our main goal is to gain deeper insights into the effect of the environment on a robotic evolutionary process."
https://openalex.org/W3030198598,"In pre-hypertension, moderate control of blood pressure (BP) can be obtained by a nutritional approach. The effects of a diet enriched with defatted larvae of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) (TM) endowed with ACE inhibitory activity was studied in both spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in the age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto strain. These were fed for 4 weeks with standard laboratory rodent chow supplemented with or without TM or captopril. In SHR, the TM diet caused a significant reduction in BP, heart rate and coronary perfusion pressure, as well as an increase in red blood cell glutathione/glutathione disulphide ratio. Rat brain slices of SHR were more resistant to oxidative stress and contained lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, while vascular and liver enzyme-activities were not affected. These results suggest that TM can be considered a new functional food that can lower BP in vivo and thus control cardiovascular-associated risk factors such as hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3029146550,"To define the sex, age, and disease-specific associations of resting heart rate (RHR) with cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in 502,534 individuals from the UK Biobank over 7-12 years of prospective follow-up.The main outcomes were all-cause, cardiovascular, and ischaemic heart disease mortality. Additional outcomes included incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI), fatal AMI, and cancer mortality. We considered a wide range of confounders and the effects of competing hazards. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality and sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHR) for other outcomes with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) per 10bpm increment of RHR.In men, for every 10bpm increase of RHR there was 22% (HR 1.22, CI 1.20 to 1.24, p = 3×10-123) greater hazard of all-cause and 17% (SHR 1.17, CI 1.13 to 1.21, p = 5.6×10-18) greater hazard of cardiovascular mortality; for women, corresponding figures were 19% (HR 1.19, CI 1.16 to 1.22, p = 8.9×10-45) and 14% (SHR 1.14, CI 1.07 to 1.22, p = 0.00008). Associations between RHR and ischaemic outcomes were of greater magnitude amongst men than women, but with similar magnitude of association for non-cardiovascular cancer mortality [men (SHR 1.18, CI 1.15-1.21, p = 5.2×10-46); women 15% (SHR 1.15, CI 1.11-1.18, p = 3.1×10-18)]. Associations with all-cause, incident AMI, and cancer mortality were of greater magnitude at younger than older ages.RHR is an independent predictor of mortality, with variation by sex, age, and disease. Ischaemic disease appeared a more important driver of this relationship in men, and associations were more pronounced at younger ages."
https://openalex.org/W3029743086,"Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global health and economic concern. Current antimicrobial agents are becoming less effective against common bacterial infections. We previously identified pyrrolocins A and C, which showed activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria. Structurally similar compounds, known as pyrrolidinediones (e.g., TA-289, equisetin), also display antibacterial activity. However, the mechanism of action of these compounds against bacteria was undetermined. Here, we show that pyrrolocin C and equisetin inhibit bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the first step in fatty acid synthesis. We used transcriptomic data, metabolomic analysis, fatty acid rescue and acetate incorporation experiments to show that a major mechanism of action of the pyrrolidinediones is inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis, identifying ACC as the probable molecular target. This hypothesis was further supported using purified proteins, demonstrating that biotin carboxylase is the inhibited component of ACC. There are few known antibiotics that target this pathway and, therefore, we believe that these compounds may provide the basis for alternatives to current antimicrobial therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3029227874,"A genetic algorithm (GA) cannot always avoid premature convergence, and multi-population is usually used to overcome this limitation by dividing the population into several sub-populations (sub-population number) with the same number of individuals (sub-population size). In previous research, the questions of how a network structure composed of sub-populations affects the propagation rate of advantageous genes among sub-populations and how it affects the performance of GA have always been ignored. Therefore, we first propose a multi-population GA with an ER network (MPGA-ER). Then, by using the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) as an example and considering the total individual number (TIN), we study how the sub-population number and size and the propagation rate of advantageous genes affect the performance of MPGA-ER, wherein the performance is evaluated by the average optimal value and success rate based on TIN. The simulation results indicate the following regarding the performance of MPGA-ER: (i) performance shows considerable improvement compared with that of traditional GA; (ii) for an increase in the sub-population number for a certain TIN, the performance first increases slowly, and then decreases rapidly; (iii) for an increase in the sub-population size for a certain TIN, the performance of MPGA-ER first increases rapidly and then tends to remain stable; and (iv) with an increase in the propagation rate of advantageous genes, the performance first increases rapidly and then decreases slowly. Finally, we use a parameter-optimized MPGA-ER to solve for more FJSP instances and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with that of other algorithms proposed in other studies."
https://openalex.org/W3030110926,"Population is a major production factor in rural development in China, which makes the study of rural population distribution patterns at different times and the factors influencing the population distribution an important foundation for understanding the issues in rural China and moving forward with the implementation of rural revitalization strategies. This paper analyzed the spatial evolution of the population in rural China based on population census data for the People’s Republic of China by county in 1990, 2000 and 2010. Applying the geographical detector method, this paper also delved into the contributing factors that influenced the distribution based on the natural, social and economic data, such as the potential crop productivity, the average slope, the urbanization rate and the time cost to reach the nearest cities. The results indicate that the migration of the population from the rural areas into the cities, which was a result of rapid urbanization, did not change the original population distribution in rural China significantly. The rural population was still concentrated in the eastern plains, basins and deltas, and the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin still house the bulk of rural residents, but the population density of rural residents in the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin decreased from 1990 to 2010. The rural population in China tended to be distributed around the cities. Seventy-four percent of the rural population lived in an area within a 60-minute driving distance from the surrounding cities. The areas with dense rural population were basically consistent with the locations of the current major urban agglomerations in China. The current distribution of the rural population in China was a result of natural, social and economic conditions and location factors. Among them, natural factors such as the potential crop productivity and the degree of surface fragmentation had the most significant influence."
https://openalex.org/W3029003480,"Attaining and maintaining the Official Tuberculosis Free status continues to be a challenge when several domestic and wild hosts contribute to the maintenance of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). Local tuberculosis hotspots are sometimes identified in cattle in low-prevalence regions. We have, therefore, studied one such hotspot in depth in order to produce an epidemiological diagnosis. Host population size and MTC prevalence were estimated in selected wildlife and in livestock, while on-cattle environmental DNA detection was additionally used as a proxy for risk of exposure at the farm (herd) level. Positive skin test reactors were found on16 of the 24 cattle farms studied in the period 2012–2016. Although all goats tested negative to the skin test during this period, MTC was confirmed in four sheep at slaughter, thus indicating an unknown prevalence of infection in this host species. With regard to wildlife, the prevalence of MTC infection based on culture was 8.8% in the case of wild boar (Sus scrofa), and the only road-killed badger (Meles meles) submitted for culture tested positive. Two criteria were employed to divide the cattle farms into higher or lower risk: tuberculosis testing results and environmental DNA detection. Environmental MTC DNA detection yielded significant differences regarding “use of regional pastures” and “proximity to woodland”. This study suggests that on-animal environmental DNA sampling may help when assessing contact risk as regards MTC in livestock at the herd level. This tool opens up new avenues of epidemiological research in complex multi-host settings."
https://openalex.org/W3032448253,"Background Retesting for HIV is critical to identifying newly-infected persons and reinforcing prevention efforts among at-risk adults. Incentives can increase one-time HIV testing, but their role in promoting retesting is unknown. We sought to test feasibility and acceptability of incentive strategies, including commitment contracts, to promote HIV retesting among at-risk adults in rural Uganda. Methods At-risk HIV-negative adults were enrolled in a pilot trial assessing feasibility and acceptability of incentive strategies to promote HIV retesting three months after enrollment. Participants were randomized (1:1:3) to: 1) no incentive; 2) standard cash incentive (~US$4); and 3) commitment contract: participants could voluntarily make a low- or high-value deposit that would be returned with added interest (totaling ~US$4 including the deposit) upon retesting or lost if participants failed to retest. Contracts sought to promote retesting by leveraging loss aversion and addressing present bias via pre-commitment. Outcomes included acceptability of trial enrollment, contract feasibility (proportion of participants making deposits), and HIV retesting uptake. Results Of 130 HIV-negative eligible adults, 123 (95%) enrolled and were randomized: 74 (60%) to commitment contracts, 25 (20%) to standard incentives, and 24 (20%) to no incentive. Of contract participants, 69 (93%) made deposits. Overall, 93 (76%) participants retested for HIV: uptake was highest in the standard incentive group (22/25 [88%]) and lowest in high-value contract (26/36 [72%]) and no incentive (17/24 [71%]) groups. Conclusion In a randomized trial of strategies to promote HIV retesting among at-risk adults in Uganda, incentive strategies, including commitment contracts, were feasible and had high acceptability. Our findings suggest use of incentives for HIV retesting merits further comparison in a larger trial. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT:02890459"
https://openalex.org/W3029377582,"One of the potential contributing factors for iron overload-induced osteoporosis is the iron toxicity on bone forming cells, osteoblasts. In this study, the comparative effects of Fe3+ and Fe2+ on osteoblast differentiation and mineralization were studied in UMR-106 osteoblast cells by using ferric ammonium citrate and ferrous ammonium sulfate as Fe3+ and Fe2+ donors, respectively. Effects of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] and iron chelator deferiprone on iron uptake ability of osteoblasts were examined, and the potential protective ability of 1,25(OH)2D3, deferiprone and extracellular calcium treatment in osteoblast cell survival under iron overload was also elucidated. The differential effects of Fe3+ and Fe2+ on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in osteoblasts were also compared. Our results showed that both iron species suppressed alkaline phosphatase gene expression and mineralization with the stronger effects from Fe3+ than Fe2+. 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly increased the intracellular iron but minimally affected osteoblast cell survival under iron overload. Deferiprone markedly decreased intracellular iron in osteoblasts, but it could not recover iron-induced osteoblast cell death. Interestingly, extracellular calcium was able to rescue osteoblasts from iron-induced osteoblast cell death. Additionally, both iron species could induce ROS production and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts with the stronger effects from Fe3+. In conclusions, Fe3+ and Fe2+ differentially compromised the osteoblast functions and viability, which can be alleviated by an increase in extracellular ionized calcium, but not 1,25(OH)2D3 or iron chelator deferiprone. This study has provided the invaluable information for therapeutic design targeting specific iron specie(s) in iron overload-induced osteoporosis. Moreover, an increase in extracellular calcium could be beneficial for this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3031247572,"The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is the most important oil-producing crop of the Mediterranean basin. However, although plant protection measures are regularly applied, disease outbreaks represent an obstacle towards the further development of the sector. Therefore, there is an urge for the improvement of plant protection strategies based on information acquired by the implementation of advanced methodologies. Recently, heavy fungal infections of olive fruits have been recorded in major olive-producing areas of Greece causing devastating yield losses. Thus, initially, we have undertaken the task to identify their causal agent(s) and assess their pathogenicity and sensitivity to fungicides. The disease was identified as the olive anthracnose, and although Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum acutatum species complexes are the two major causes, the obtained results confirmed that in Southern Greece the latter is the main causal agent. The obtained isolates were grouped into eight morphotypes based on their phenotypes, which differ in their sensitivities to fungicides and pathogenicity. The triazoles difenoconazole and tebuconazole were more toxic than the strobilurins being tested. Furthermore, a GC/EI/MS metabolomics model was developed for the robust chemotaxonomy of the isolates and the dissection of differences between their endo-metabolomes, which could explain the obtained phenotypes. The corresponding metabolites-biomarkers for the discrimination between morphotypes were discovered, with the most important ones being the amino acids L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, and L-proline, the disaccharide α,α-trehalose, and the phytotoxic pathogenesis-related metabolite hydroxyphenylacetate. These metabolites play important roles in fungal metabolism, pathogenesis, and stress responses. The study adds critical information that could be further exploited to combat olive anthracnose through its monitoring and the design of improved, customized plant protection strategies. Also, results suggest the necessity for the comprehensive mapping of the C. acutatum species complex morphotypes in order to avoid issues such as the development of fungicide-resistant genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3029305682,"As lumbar spinal stenosis commonly occurs between the L2 and L5 segments, hip abductors are easily affected. However, studies regarding the gait pattern in these patients from the coronal plane have not yet been conducted.To determine the effects of lumbar spinal stenosis on the gait pattern (stride width and femorotibial angle) and hip abductor surface electromyography in varied stride widths compared with healthy individuals.Prospective case-control study.Seventeen patients and 20 healthy individuals were enrolled. Each participant completed three gait assessments in their normal gait, adducted gait and abducted gait. The femorotibial angle and surface electromyography signals were measured. Pain scores was used to quantify the degree of discomfort in the gluteal area and medial side of the knee.When the hip abductors' surface electromyography signals were normalized by quadriceps femoris, patients group showed significantly higher activation ratios throughout all gait patterns. Generally, surface electromyography signals and ratios were significantly higher during abducted gait compared with a normal gait. Femorotibial angle became significantly closer to the varus in healthy individuals during abducted gait. When femorotibial angle during normal gait was compared between the two groups, patients group exhibited slightly wider stride width and FTA significantly closer to the varus. Pain scores were significantly higher in the patient group and during abducted gait.Wider stride widths indicated increased relative activation of the hip abductors, closer proximity between femorotibial angle and varus, and increased pain scores for discomfort. The same tendency was observed in patients group when compared with healthy individuals. Widening of stride width in patients group despite abductor weakness suggests that additional muscle recruitment may be needed to maintain balance. Furthermore, such a distinctive gait pattern exerts increased loading on the medial knee, relating to the escalated risk of degenerative knee osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3030573506,"Development of a successful HIV vaccine is dependent upon a determination of the optimum antigen and adjuvant as well as choosing an optimal site for vaccine delivery. The site of delivery is particularly relevant as HIV transmission generally requires that the virus crosses a mucosal membrane to infect a new host. Here we undertake a pilot study comparing three vaccine delivery routes, two to the oral cavity (intraepithelial (iEp) and needle-free (NF-Injex)) as well as intramuscular (IM) delivery. These vaccinations utilized a recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer 10042.05 from an elite neutralizer, subject VC10042, that has previously induced high titers of cross-clade reactive V1V2 antibodies. The 10042.05.SOSIP fused trimer was administered with adjuvants R848 (Resiquimod), MPLA and Alhydrogel to characterize the innate cellular and anti-HIV Envelope (Env) antibody responses following the administration of the vaccine to the oral mucosa. Oral delivery of the 10042.05.SOSIP induced high titers of anti-V1V2 antibodies, which together with previous studies, indicates an immunogenic bias toward the V1V2 regions in 10042-derived Envs. Both types of oral vaccine delivery resulted in immunologic and serologic responses that were comparable to the IM delivery route. Furthermore, induction of anti-V1-V2 specific antibodies was best following iEp delivery of the oral vaccine identifying this as the optimal method to orally deliver this vaccine formulation."
https://openalex.org/W3032259271,"Populations of Arnica montana, a characteristic species of nutrient poor grasslands in Central Europe, have been deteriorating over the last decades, especially in lowland regions. Population size has been declining and signs of sexual reproduction are scarce. To start a long-term regeneration program, we investigated the major habitat specific drivers for the decline in Hesse, Germany. Firstly, we conducted a field study to analyze habitat characteristics of 32 Hessian lowland sites, comparing those on which this species has become extinct during the last 15 years with sites of small and declining, as well as large, stable populations. We compared habitat traits focusing on soil parameters, nutrients, and vegetation characteristics. Secondly, we set up a greenhouse experiment to study the response of A. montana seedlings to competition and nutrient input to assess the effects of competition pressure and fertilization. The results show lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and higher Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values on sites with extinct populations compared to existing populations. Both pH and Ellenberg soil reaction indicator values were higher on sites with extinct populations. In the greenhouse, the combination of nitrogen addition and competition resulted in lower seedling numbers. While rosette size was not dependent on fertilization, growth was strongly enhanced in the plots lacking vegetation. Both studies suggest that soil nutrient enrichment followed by competition pressure diminishes the number of safe sites for A. montana seedling recruitment and establishment and negatively impacts the growth of existing rosettes, thus leading to the continuous decline of populations. There is an urgent need for actions to reduce unintentional nitrogen deposition in the remaining nutrient poor areas as well as to modify land use to withdraw nutrients from enriched soils in order to preserve the remaining A. montana populations and to create bare ground for the safekeeping and enhancement of self-sustainable populations."
https://openalex.org/W3032298262,"Mechanisms implicated in disease progression in multiple sclerosis include continued oligodendrocyte (OL)/myelin injury and failure of myelin repair. Underlying causes include metabolic stress with resultant energy deficiency. Biotin is a cofactor for carboxylases involved in ATP production that impact myelin production by promoting fatty acid synthesis. Here, we investigate the effects of high dose Biotin (MD1003) on the functional properties of post-natal rat derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). A2B5 positive OPCs were assessed using an in vitro injury assay, culturing cells in either DFM (DMEM/F12+N1) or ""stress media"" (no glucose (NG)-DMEM), with Biotin added over a range from 2.5 to 250 μg/ml, and cell viability determined after 24 hrs. Biotin reduced the increase in OPC cell death in the NG condition. In nanofiber myelination assays, biotin increased the percentage of ensheathing cells, the number of ensheathed segments per cell, and length of ensheathed segments. In dispersed cell culture, Biotin also significantly increased ATP production, assessed using a Seahorse bio-analyzer. For most assays, the positive effects of Biotin were observed at the higher end of the dose-response analysis. We conclude that Biotin, in vitro, protects OL lineage cells from metabolic injury, enhances myelin-like ensheathment, and is associated with increased ATP production."
https://openalex.org/W3029150508,"Chickens are a widely held economic and nutritional asset in rural Africa and are frequently managed by women. Despite potential benefits of larger flock sizes, the average number of chickens kept at the household level is reported to be low. Whether this reflects decision-making to maximize benefits per unit labor by voluntary reduction of chicken numbers by consumption or sale versus involuntary losses due to mortality is a significant gap in knowledge relevant to improving smallholder household welfare.In a 4-year longitudinal study of 1,908 smallholder households in rural western Kenya, the number of chickens owned by quarterly census at each household was determined. Households reported gains and losses of chicken over the immediate previous quarter. Gains were classified as on-farm or off-farm; losses were classified as voluntary (sales, gifts, consumption) or involuntary (mortality, unclassified loss).The mean number of chickens owned over the 16 quarters was 10, consistent with prior cross-sectional data. Involuntary losses represented 70% of total off-take, while voluntary off-take represented the remaining 30%. Mortality composed 60% of total reported off-take and accounted for most of the involuntary losses. Household consumption, sales, and gifts represented 18%, 9%, and 3% of off-take, respectively.The overwhelming majority of off-take can be classified as involuntary off-take, principally due to mortality, that does not reflect the owner's decision to maximize value through nutritional gain, income, or social capital. This strongly suggests that there is substantial opportunity to enhance the value of chickens as an asset, both nutritional and income generating, for smallholder households living at poverty level. Our findings suggest that programs emphasizing community level poultry vaccination and feed supplementation are much more likely to be effective than those solely focused on providing chickens."
https://openalex.org/W3029218987,"The healthy cornea is remarkably resistant to infection, quickly clearing deliberately inoculated bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Contrasting with the adjacent conjunctiva and other body surfaces, it also lacks a resident viable bacterial microbiome. Corneal resistance to microbes depends on intrinsic defenses involving tear fluid and the corneal epithelium. Dry eye, an ocular surface disease associated with discomfort and inflammation, can alter tear fluid composition and volume, and impact epithelial integrity. We previously showed that experimentally-induced dry eye (EDE) in mice does not increase corneal susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection. Here, we explored if EDE alters corneal resistance to bacterial colonization. EDE was established in mice using scopolamine injections and dehumidified air-flow, and verified by phenol-red thread testing after 5 and 10 days. As expected, EDE corneas showed increased fluorescein staining versus controls consistent with compromised epithelial barrier function. Confocal imaging using mT/mG knock-in mice with red-fluorescent membranes revealed no other obvious morphological differences between EDE corneas and controls for epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. EDE corneas were imaged ex vivo and compared to controls after alkyne-functionalized D-alanine labeling of metabolically-active colonizing bacteria, or by FISH using a universal 16S rRNA gene probe. Both methods revealed very few viable bacteria on EDE corneas after 5 or 10 days (median of 0, upper quartile of ≤ 1 bacteria per field of view for each group [9–12 eyes per group]) similar to control corneas. Furthermore, there was no obvious difference in abundance of conjunctival bacteria, which included previously reported filamentous forms. Thus, despite reduced tear flow and apparent compromise to corneal barrier function (fluorescein staining), EDE murine corneas continue to resist bacterial colonization and maintain the absence of a resident viable bacterial microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3030247332,"Background The Russian Federation has among the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the world and a high rate of untreated hypertension remains an important risk factor. Understanding who is at greatest risk is important to inform approaches to primary prevention. Methods 2,353 hypertensive 35–69 year olds were selected from a population-based study, Know Your Heart, conducted in Arkhangelsk and Novosibirsk, Russian Federation, 2015–2018. The associations between untreated hypertension and a range of co-variates related to socio-demographics, health, and health behaviours were examined. Results The age-standardised prevalence of untreated hypertension was 51.1% (95% CI 47.8–54.5) in males, 28.8% (25.4–32.5) in females, and 40.0% (37.5–42.5) overall. The factors associated with untreated hypertension relative to treated hypertension were younger ages, self-rated general health as very good-excellent, not being obese, no history of CVD events, no evidence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and not seeing a primary care doctor in the past year as well as problem drinking for women and working full time, lower education, and smoking for men. Conclusion The study found relatively high prevalence of untreated hypertension, especially, in men. Recent initiatives to strengthen primary care provision and implementation of a general health check programme (dispansarisation) are promising, although further studies should evaluate other, potentially more effective strategies tailored to the particular circumstances of this population."
https://openalex.org/W3029721901,"Optometry students in clinical years are usually faced with the challenges of making a career choice in or outside optometry. This cross sectional study was conducted to investigate the career aspirations of optometry students in Ghana. All students in their fourth to sixth year who consented to participate in the study responded to a questionnaire which explored: demographic characteristics, career aspirations, and factors influencing their choices. Descriptive statistics was used to present data as frequencies, proportions and percentages. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate relationships between variables. Two hundred and nine students from the two optometry training institutions in Ghana; Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (49.8%) and University of Cape Coast (51.2%) responded to the questionnaire. The mean (SD) age of students was 23.6 (1.9) years (males = 65.6%). On seeking admission into the university, optometry (65.6%) and human biology/medicine (28.2%) were the leading first choice programmes among participants. Participants largely aspire to be in clinical practice (64.6%) or Academia/Research (28.2%). The major factors which influenced career choices were interest in career field (64.1%) and potential good income (38.3%). Females were twice more likely to practice optometry and pursue an interest in paediatric optometry than males. Institution of study (p = .028) and information on career opportunities (p = .018) were significant predictors of students’ decision to pursue a career in academia/research. Optometry students in Ghana largely aspire to be in clinical practice, a finding which is useful for optometry training institutions and relevant stakeholders in developing the optometry programme and projecting its future in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3030365963,"Several candidate HIV subunit vaccines based on recombinant envelope (Env) glycoproteins have been advanced into human clinical trials. To facilitate biopharmaceutical production, it is necessary to produce these in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, the cellular substrate used for the manufacturing of most recombinant protein therapeutics. However, previous studies have shown that when recombinant Env proteins from clade B viruses, the major subtype represented in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, are expressed in CHO cells, they are proteolyzed and lack important glycan-dependent epitopes present on virions. Previously, we identified C1s, a serine protease in the complement pathway, as the endogenous CHO protease responsible for the cleavage of clade B laboratory isolates of -recombinant gp120s (rgp120s) expressed in stable CHO-S cell lines. In this paper, we describe the development of two novel CHOK1 cell lines with the C1s gene inactivated by gene editing, that are suitable for the production of any protein susceptible to C1s proteolysis. One cell line, C1s-/- CHOK1 2.E7, contains a deletion in the C1s gene. The other cell line, C1s-/- MGAT1- CHOK1 1.A1, contains a deletion in both the C1s gene and the MGAT1 gene, which limits glycosylation to mannose-5 or earlier intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. In addition, we compare the substrate specificity of C1s with thrombin on the cleavage of both rgp120 and human Factor VIII, two recombinant proteins known to undergo unintended proteolysis (clipping) when expressed in CHO cells. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and practicality of the C1s-/- MGAT1- CHOK1 1.A1 cell line for the expression of clinical isolates of clade B Envs from rare individuals that possess broadly neutralizing antibodies and are able to control virus replication without anti-retroviral drugs (elite neutralizer/controller phenotypes). The Envs represent unique HIV vaccine immunogens suitable for further immunogenicity and efficacy studies."
https://openalex.org/W3030761111,"Trehalose metabolism in yeast has been linked to a variety of phenotypes, including heat resistance, desiccation tolerance, carbon-source utilization, and sporulation. The relationships among the several phenotypes of mutants unable to synthesize trehalose are not understood, even though the pathway is highly conserved. One of these phenotypes is that tps1Δ strains cannot reportedly grow on media containing glucose or fructose, even when another carbon source they can use (e.g. galactose) is present. Here we corroborate the recent observation that a small fraction of yeast tps1Δ cells do grow on glucose, unlike the majority of the population. This is not due to a genetic alteration, but instead resembles the persister phenotype documented in many microorganisms and cancer cells undergoing lethal stress. We extend these observations to show that this phenomenon is glucose-specific, as it does not occur on another highly fermented carbon source, fructose. We further demonstrate that this phenomenon appears to be related to mitochondrial complex III function, but unrelated to inorganic phosphate levels in the cell, as had previously been suggested. Finally, we found that this phenomenon is specific to S288C-derived strains, and is the consequence of a variant in the MKT1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W3031683315,"Cognitive function is an important factor for secondary prevention in elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on the improvement of cognitive function.A total of 66 consecutive elderly patients (≥70 years old) with cardiovascular diseases were prospectively enrolled. The change in cognitive function during 6 months was compared between the patients with monthly CR (at least once per month; n = 27) and those without monthly CR (n = 39). Cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB).There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. The change in the MMSE score was significantly greater in patients with monthly CR than in those without monthly CR (2.3 ± 0.4 vs. -0.1 ± 0.3 points; p <0.001). Among the MMSE items, the change in temporal orientation and attention and calculation was significantly greater in the monthly CR group than in the non-monthly CR group (0.8 ± 0.7 vs. -0.1 ± 0.8 points [p <0.001] and 1.0 ± 1.5 vs. -0.1 ± 0.1 points [p <0.001], respectively). The general linear model revealed that monthly CR (effect estimate, 1.455; 95% confidence interval, 0.747-2.163; p <0.001) was independently associated with the change in the MMSE score.Cognitive function may improve with regular CR. These results might partly explain the efficacy of CR for secondary prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3030009475,"Inflammation has received considerable attention in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Supporting this concept, enhanced expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and increased infiltration of macrophages are observed in pancreatic islets of patients with T2DM. Although IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) plays a major role in controlling of IL-1β-mediated inflammation, its counteraction effects and epigenetic alterations in T2DM are less studied. Thus, we aimed to analyze the DNA methylation status in IL1RN, RELA (p65) and NFKB1 (p50) genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from treated T2DM patients (n = 35) and age-/sex- matched healthy controls (n = 31). Production of IL-1β and IL-1Ra was analyzed in plasma and supernatants from LPS-induced PBMCs. Immunomodulatory effects of IL-1β and IL-1Ra were studied on THP-1 cells. Average DNA methylation level of IL1RN and NFKB1 gene promoters was significantly decreased in T2DM patients in comparison with healthy controls (P< 0.05), which was associated with the increased IL-1Ra (P< 0.001) and IL-1β (P = 0.039) plasma levels in T2DM patients. Negative association between average methylation of IL1RN gene and IL-1Ra plasma levels were observed in female T2DM patients. Methylation of NFKB1 gene was negatively correlated with IL-1Ra levels in the patients and positively with IL-1β levels in female patients. LPS-stimulated PBMCs from female patients failed to raise IL-1β production, while the cells from healthy females increased IL-1β production in comparison with unstimulated cells (P< 0.001). Taken together, the findings suggest that hypomethylation of IL1RN and NFKB1 gene promoters may promote the increased IL-1β/IL-1Ra production and regulate chronic inflammation in T2DM. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the causal direction of these associations and potential role of IL-1Ra in anti-inflammatory processes in treated patients with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3029724298,"Rapid urbanisation has led to major landscape alterations, affecting aquatic ecosystems' hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity. Thus, habitat alteration is considered a major driver of aquatic biodiversity loss and related aquatic ecosystem goods and services. This study aimed to investigate and compare aquatic macroinvertebrate richness, diversity and community structure between urban temporary wetlands, located within protected and un-protected areas. The latter were found within an open public space or park with no protection or conservation status, whereas the former were inaccessible to the public and had formal protected, conservation status. We hypothesised that; (1) protected urban wetlands will harbour higher aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (both dry and wet) as compared to un-protected urban wetlands, and (2) that the community composition between the two urban wetlands types will be significantly different. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results revealed no major differences between protected and un-protected urban wetlands, based on the measures investigated (i.e. taxon richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, Pielou's evenness and community composition) during the dry and wet phase. The only exception was community composition, which revealed significant differences between these urban wetland types. These results suggest that human activities (potential littering and polluting) in the un-protected urban wetlands have not yet resulted in drastic change in macroinvertebrate richness and composition, at least from the dry phase. This suggests a potential for un-protected urban wetlands suffering from minimal human impact to act as important reservoirs of biodiversity and ecosystem services."
https://openalex.org/W3030038775,"Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial bones. The goal of this study was to determine if delivery of recombinant tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) could prevent or diminish the severity of craniosynostosis in a C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ model of neonatal onset craniosynostosis or a BALB/c FGFR2C342Y/+ model of postnatal onset craniosynostosis. Mice were injected with a lentivirus encoding a mineral targeted form of TNAP immediately after birth. Cranial bone fusion as well as cranial bone volume, mineral content and density were assessed by micro CT. Craniofacial shape was measured with calipers. Alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) activity levels were measured in serum. Neonatal delivery of TNAP diminished craniosynostosis severity from 94% suture obliteration in vehicle treated mice to 67% suture obliteration in treated mice, p<0.02) and the incidence of malocclusion from 82.4% to 34.7% (p<0.03), with no effect on cranial bone in C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ mice. In contrast, treatment with TNAP increased cranial bone volume (p< 0.01), density (p< 0.01) and mineral content (p< 0.01) as compared to vehicle treated controls, but had no effect on craniosynostosis or malocclusion in BALB/c FGFR2C342Y/+ mice. These results indicate that postnatal recombinant TNAP enzyme therapy diminishes craniosynostosis severity in the C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ neonatal onset mouse model of Crouzon syndrome, and that effects of exogenous TNAP are genetic background dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3030177270,"Adaptive regulation of epithelial transporters to nutrient intake is essential to decrease energy costs of their synthesis and maintenance, however such regulation is understudied. Previously we demonstrated that the transport function of the basolateral amino acid uniporter LAT4 (Slc43a2) is increased by dephosphorylation of serine 274 (S274) and nearly abolished by dephosphorylation of serine 297 (S297) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Phosphorylation changes in the jejunum of food-entrained mice suggested an increase in LAT4 transport function during food expectation. Thus, we investigated further how phosphorylation, expression and localization of mouse intestinal LAT4 respond to food-entrained diurnal rhythm and dietary protein content. In mice entrained with 18% protein diet, LAT4 mRNA was not submitted to diurnal regulation, unlike mRNAs of luminal symporters and antiporters. Only in duodenum, LAT4 protein expression increased during food intake. Concurrently, S274 phosphorylation was decreased in all three small intestinal segments, whereas S297 phosphorylation was increased only in jejunum. Interestingly, during food intake, S274 phosphorylation was nearly absent in ileum and accompanied by strong phosphorylation of mTORC1 target S6. Entraining mice with 8% protein diet provoked a shift in jejunal LAT4 localization from the cell surface to intracellular stores and increased S274 phosphorylation in both jejunum and ileum during food anticipation, suggesting decreased transport function. In contrast, 40% dietary protein content led to increased LAT4 expression in jejunum and its internalization in ileum. Ex vivo treatments of isolated intestinal villi fraction demonstrated that S274 phosphorylation was stimulated by protein kinase A. Rapamycin-sensitive insulin treatment and amino acids increased S297 phosphorylation, suggesting that the response to food intake might be regulated via the insulin-mTORC1 pathway. Ghrelin, an oscillating orexigenic hormone, did not affect phosphorylation of intestinal LAT4. Overall, we show that phosphorylation, expression and localization of intestinal mouse LAT4 responds to diurnal and dietary stimuli in location-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W3030622397,"While survivorship curves typically exhibit smooth declines over time, step-patterned curves can occur with multiple stressors within a life stage. To explore this process, we examined the effects of heat (24°C) and food restriction on juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) in challenge experiments. We observed step-patterned survivorship curves determined by mortality and loss of equilibrium (LOE) endpoints. To examine the cause of heterogeneity in the stress responses from early to late mortality and LOE, we measured indices of energetic reserves. The step transition in the survivorship curves, the peak mortality rates, and start of when individuals reached a critical energetic threshold (14% dry mass; 4.0 kJ·g-1 energy) all occurred at around days 10–15 of the challenge. The coherence in these temporal patterns suggest heterogeneity in the cohort stress responses, in which an early subgroup died from heat stress and a late subgroup died from starvation. Thus, their endpoint sensitivities resulted in step-patterned survivorship curves. We discuss the implications of the study for understanding effects of multiple stressors on population heterogeneity and note the possible significance of stress response selection under climate change in which heat stress and food limitations occur in concert."
https://openalex.org/W3030723976,"Morroniside is a biologically active polyphenol found in Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc (CO) that exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, such as protecting nerves, and preventing diabetic liver damage and renal damage. However, little data are available regarding the mechanism of its intestinal absorption. Here, an in vitro human intestinal epithelial cell model of cultured Caco-2 cells was applied to study the absorption and transport of morroniside. The effects of donor concentration, pH and inhibitors were investigated. The bidirectional permeability of morroniside from the apical (AP) to the basolateral (BL) side and in the reverse direction was studied. When administered at three tested concentrations (5, 25 and 100 μM), the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values in the AP-to-BL direction ranged from 1.59 × 10−6 to 2.66 × 10−6 cm/s. In the reverse direction, BL-to-AP, the value was ranged from 2.67 × 10−6 to 4.10 × 10−6 cm/s. The data indicated that morroniside transport was pH-dependent. The permeability of morroniside was affected by treatment with various inhibitors, such as multidrug resistance protein inhibitors MK571 and indomethacin, as well as the breast cancer resistance protein inhibitor apigenin. The mechanisms of the intestinal absorption of morroniside may involve multiple transport pathways, such as the passive diffusion and efflux protein-mediated active transport especially involving multidrug resistance protein 2 and breast cancer resistance protein. After the addition of CO, the Papp values in the AP-to-BL direction increased significantly, therefore, it can be assumed that some ingredients in the CO promote morroniside absorption in the small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W3031186669,"Political orientation is one of the most important and consequential individual attributes studied by social scientists. Yet, we know relatively little about the temporal evolution of political orientation, especially at periods in the life course during which individuals are forming new social relationships and transitioning to new relational contexts. Here we use Stochastic Actor-Oriented models (SAOMs) to examine the co-evolution of political orientation and social networks using two feature-rich, temporal network datasets from samples of students making the transition to college at the University of Notre Dame (i.e. the NetSense and NetHealth studies). Overall, we find a great deal of stability in political orientation, with a slight tendency for the 2011 NetSense study participants to become more conservative during their first four semesters in college, but not the 2015 NetHealth study participants. Partisanship is the best predictor of changes in political orientation, with students who identify or vote as Republicans becoming more conservative over time. Neither network influence nor selection processes seem to be driving observed changes. During this formative period, relatively stable identities such as party affiliation predict changes in political orientation independently of local network dynamics, selection processes, socio-demographic traits, and dispositional factors."
https://openalex.org/W3031988704,"A study on population status, foraging ecology and activity pattern of golden jackal (Canis aureus) was conducted from October 2017 to August 2018. Data was collected through direct observation (total count, focal and scan sampling) and faecal dropping analysis. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and compared with Chi-square test, t test and one way ANOVA. The result indicated that the average number of golden jackal in the study area was 65 during the wet season and 83 during the dry season. There was a significant difference in the population size of golden jackal between the wet and the dry season (t = 38.13, df = 1, P<0.05). The mean pack size ± SD were 4±1.19 and 4.5±1.3 during the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. Golden jackal was observed feeding mostly on rodents and plant materials. The food items consumed were significantly differed (χ2 = 20.33, df = 5, P< 0.05) between both seasons. They were mostly active during early morning (6:00–8:00) and late afternoon (16:00–18:00). The overall status of the current population does not appear in an immediate danger. However, there are many conservation problems that could affect the species in the future in the area. Therefore, appropriate conservation measures should be taken in to consideration to protect golden jackal and create suitable habitat."
https://openalex.org/W3032339995,"Sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Increased expression of olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4), a glycoprotein contained within a subpopulation of neutrophils, has been associated with complicated course in sepsis. The factors that regulate OLFM4 expression are unknown. Here, we followed children undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to document the percentage of neutrophils that express OLFM4 over time. This population was selected because of the ability to observe nascent neutrophils following engraftment, perform frequent blood sampling, and the children are at high risk for clinical complications that may associate with changes in percentage of OLFM4+ neutrophils. We found a surprising degree of variability of OLFM4 expression between patients. In the weeks following initial neutrophil recovery we also saw great variability in OLFM4 expression within individual patients, indicating that multiple external factors may modify OLFM4 expression. We identified decreased expression of CD64 (a marker associated with response to infection), in OLFM4+ neutrophils. This is the first study to demonstrate fluctuation in OLFM4 expression within patients and provides insight into possible mechanisms for OLFM4 regulation in nascent neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W3032434232,"Along with increasing amounts of big data sources and increasing computer performance, real-world evidence from such sources likewise gains in importance. While this mostly applies to population averaged results from analyses based on the all available data, it is also possible to conduct so-called personalized analyses based on a data subset whose observations resemble a particular patient for whom a decision is to be made. Claims data from statutory health insurance companies could provide necessary information for such personalized analyses. To derive treatment recommendations from them for a particular patient in everyday care, an automated, reproducible and efficiently programmed workflow would be required. We introduce the R-package SimBaCo (Similarity-Based Cohort generation) offering a simple, but modular, and intuitive framework for this task. With the six built-in R-functions, this framework allows the user to create similarity cohorts tailored to the characteristics of particular patients. An exemplary workflow illustrates the distinct steps beginning with an initial cohort selection according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A plotting function facilitates investigating a particular patient’s characteristics relative to their distribution in a reference cohort, for example the initial cohort or the precision cohort after the data has been trimmed in accordance with chosen variables for similarity finding. Such precision cohorts allow any form of personalized analysis, for example personalized analyses of comparative effectiveness or customized prediction models developed from precision cohorts. In our exemplary workflow, we provide such a treatment comparison whereupon a treatment decision for a particular patient could be made. This is only one field of application where personalized results can directly support the process of clinical reasoning by leveraging information from individual patient data. With this modular package at hand, personalized studies can efficiently weight benefits and risks of treatment options of particular patients."

Sexual transmission of HAV has been demonstrated, particularly among Men-Who-Have-Sex-With-Men (MSM), causing MSM-specific outbreaksin Europe. Here we report a molecular epidemiologic and phylodynamic analysis on HAV sequences in Lazio (central Italy)to identify genetic background and the phylogenetic relations, and test the HAV infection dynamics during a large outbreak through phylodynamic model.Among all HAV sequences found during 2013-2018 in Lazio, low genetic diversity was observed in HAV population in 2016 and 2017, along with high frequenciesVRD_521_2016and RIVM-HAV16-090, suggesting a large expansion event of viral population. The initial expansion of both VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 clusters dated back to 2012 (95% HPD:2006-2015). During the2016-2017outbreak in Lazio region, the Re peaked around mid-2016, with a value of 1.73 (95% HPD: 1.03-2.37), consistent with incidence trend of AHA cases in Lazio between 2016 and mid-2017.

https://openalex.org/W3029820517,"Soluble endoglin (sEng) released into the circulation was suggested to be related to cardiovascular based pathologies. It was demonstrated that a combination of high sEng levels and long-term exposure (six months) to high fat diet (HFD) resulted in aggravation of endothelial dysfunction in the aorta. Thus, in this study, we hypothesized that a similar experimental design would affect the heart morphology, TGFβ signaling, inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress and eNOS signaling in myocardium in transgenic mice overexpressing human sEng. Three-month-old female transgenic mice overexpressing human sEng in plasma (Sol-Eng+ high) and their age-matched littermates with low levels of human sEng (Sol-Eng+ low) were fed a high-fat diet containing 1.25% of cholesterol and 40% of fat for six months. A blood analysis was performed, and the heart samples were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The results of this study showed no effects of sEng and HFD on myocardial morphology/hypertrophy/fibrosis. However, the expression of pSmad2/3 and p-eNOS was reduced in Sol-Eng+ high mice. On the other hand, sEng and HFD did not significantly affect the expression of selected members of TGFβ signaling (membrane endoglin, TGFβRII, ALK-5, ALK-1, Id-1, PAI-1), inflammation (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), oxidative stress (NQO1, HO-1) and heart remodeling (PDGFβ, COL1A1, β-MHC). In conclusion, the results of this study confirmed that sEng, even combined with a high-fat diet inducing hypercholesterolemia administered for six months, does not affect the structure of the heart with respect to hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress. Interestingly, pSmad2/3/p-eNOS signaling was reduced in both the heart in this study and the aorta in the previous study, suggesting a possible alteration of NO metabolism caused by six months exposure to high sEng levels and HFD. Thus, we might conclude that sEng combined with a high-fat diet might be related to the alteration of NO production due to altered pSmad2/3/p-eNOS signaling in the heart and aorta."
https://openalex.org/W3031345645,"As a group, newly arrived migrants in Sweden face inequities in health compared to the general population. Successful promotion of population health requires awareness of and focus on health from several sectors of society. In light of this, the aim was to study the views of local authority officials on collaboration in health promotion activities for newly arrived migrants. Data was collected through five focus group interviews with 23 local authority officials working with the integration of newly arrived migrants in the Establishment Program in a municipality or at the Employment Services in northern Sweden. An inductive qualitative latent content analysis was performed, and the analysis showed that the participating officials considered health promotion as desirable in the Establishment Program, but it also raised complex issues within the existing organisations. The officials described unclear roles, but also possible changes to the organisation that would improve the possibility of working to promote health. The present study adds to the relatively limited knowledge of health promotion in integration activities and offers clinical relevance for policymakers through the officials’ suggestions for improvements in the Establishment Program. It also raises important questions for further research."

However, similar reports for goats are still missing. The aim of the study was to present ultrasound features of the normal thyroid and internal parathyroid glands in goats with the determination of their dimensions and volume, followed by a comparison of the results to the gross examination. Seventy-two goats were used in the study. The echostructure and echogenicity of the thyroid and parathyroid glands were assessed. The length, width and height of the thyroid and the length and width of the parathyroid glands were measured. The thyroid volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula, basing on the ultrasonographic dimensions. Size and volume of the dissected thyroid glands were established grossly, followed by a histological examination. In order to accurately describe the anatomy of the thyroid, new anatomical terminology characterizing this gland was proposed. The mean dimensions of the thyroid lobes were 30.2 x 10.5 x 6.3 mm. There were no statistically significant differences between the right and left lobe. Parathyroid glands measured an average of 3.6 x 2.4 mm. The percentage Root Mean Square Error between the results of ultrasonographic and gross examination was 16.73%, 20.65% and 17.01% for thyroid length, width and height, respectively, and 46.30% for volume. In order to obtain more precise calculation of the thyroid volume, a modified correction factor for the ellipsoid formula was introduced. For the first time, the normal ultrasonographic characteristics and dimensions of the caprine thyroid and internal parathyroid glands were presented. The results may serve as a radiological reference and be the basis for further research."
https://openalex.org/W3029098147,"Intronic gene regions are mostly considered in the scope of gene expression regulation, such as alternative splicing. However, relations between basic statistical properties of introns are much rarely studied in detail, despite vast available data. Particularly, little is known regarding the relationship between the intron length and the intron phase. Intron phase distribution is significantly different at different intron length thresholds. In this study, we performed GO enrichment analysis of gene sets with a particular intron phase at varying intron length thresholds using a list of 13823 orthologous human-mouse gene pairs. We found a specific group of 153 genes with phase 1 introns longer than 50 kilobases that were specifically expressed in brain, functionally related to synaptic signaling, and strongly associated with schizophrenia and other mental disorders. We propose that the prevalence of long phase 1 introns arises from the presence of the signal peptide sequence and is connected with 1–1 exon shuffling."
https://openalex.org/W3029529201,"Regular Mouthing Movements (RMMs) are movements in which lips and lower jaw movements occur regularly and can be observed in the fetus using transabdominal ultrasonic tomography. In near term infants, it is known that RMMs form clusters during the quiet sleep period. The notation of RMMs is not uniform, and is described as spontaneous sucking movement or non-nutritive sucking in newborns. Non-nutritive sucking is used to evaluate neurological function after birth, but there are no fetal indicators. The purpose of this study was to clarify the changes in the RMM clusters in fetuses at 24–39 weeks of gestation, and to investigate the relationship with the non-eye movement (NEM) period, which corresponds to the quiet sleep period after birth. Subjects included 83 normal single pregnancy cases. Fetal RMMs and eye movement (EM) were observed for 60 minutes using ultrasonic tomography and recorded as moving image files. We created time series data of eye movements and mouth movements from video recordings, and calculated RMM clusters per minute within effective observation time, RMM clusters per minute in EM period, RMM clusters per minute in NEM period, mouthing movements per cluster and ratio of number of RMM clusters per minute between NEM and EM periods and analyzed using linear regression analysis. As a result, critical points were detected in at two time points, at 32–33 weeks and 36–37 weeks of gestation, in RMM clusters per minute within the effective observation time and RMM clusters per minute in NEM period, respectively. RMM clusters in human fetuses increased from 32–33 to 36–37 weeks. This change is thought to represent fetal sleep development and central nervous system development."
https://openalex.org/W3030692065,"Mesenchymal stromal cells are an important component of the bone marrow hematopoietic niche. Prior studies showed that signaling from members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily in mesenchymal stromal cells is required for normal niche development. Here, we assessed the impact of TGF family signaling on niche maintenance and stress responses by deleting Smad4 in mesenchymal stromal cells at birth, thereby abrogating canonical TGF signaling. No alteration in the number or spatial organization of CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, osteoblasts, or adipocytes was observed in Osx-Cre, Smad4fl/fl mice, and expression of key niche factors was normal. Basal hematopoiesis and stress erythropoiesis responses to acute hemolytic anemia were normal. TGF-β potently inhibits stromal CXCL12 expression in vitro; however, G-CSF induced decreases in bone marrow CXCL12 expression and subsequent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell mobilization were normal in Osx-Cre, Tgfbr2fl/fl mice, in which all TGF-β signaling in mesenchymal stromal is lost. Finally, although a prior study showed that TGF-β enhances recovery from myeloablative therapy, hematopoietic recovery following single or multiple doses of 5-flurauracil were normal in Osx-Cre, Tgfbr2fl/fl mice. Collectively, these data suggest that TGF family member signaling in mesenchymal stromal cells is dispensable for hematopoietic niche maintenance under basal and stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3030487456,"The effects of each type of machine perfusion preservation (MP) of liver grafts donated after cardiac death on the bile canaliculi of hepatocytes remain unclear. We analyzed the intracellular three-dimensional ultrastructure of the bile canaliculi and hepatocyte endomembrane systems in porcine liver grafts after warm ischemia followed by successive MP with modified University of Wisconsin gluconate solution. Transmission and osmium-maceration scanning electron microscopy revealed that lumen volume of the bile canaliculi decreased after warm ischemia. In liver grafts preserved by hypothermic MP condition, bile canaliculi tended to recover in terms of lumen volume, while their microvilli regressed. In contrast, midthermic MP condition preserved the functional form of the microvilli of the bile canaliculi. Machine perfusion preservation potentially restored the bile canaliculus lumen and alleviated the cessation of cellular endocrine processes due to warm ischemia. In addition, midthermic MP condition prevented the retraction of the microvilli of bile canaliculi, suggesting further mitigation of the damage of the bile canaliculi."
https://openalex.org/W3032305904,"Malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease causing alveolar-pulmonary barrier lesion and increased vascular permeability characterized by severe hypoxemia. Computed tomography (CT), among other imaging techniques, allows the morphological and quantitative identification of lung lesions during ARDS. This study aims to identify the onset of malaria-associated ARDS development in an experimental model by imaging diagnosis. Our results demonstrated that ARDS-developing mice presented decreased gaseous exchange and pulmonary insufficiency, as shown by the SPECT/CT technique. The pulmonary aeration disturbance in ARDS-developing mice on the 5th day post infection was characterized by aerated tissues decrease and nonaerated tissue accumulation, demonstrating increased vascular permeability and pleural effusion. The SPECT/CT technique allowed the early diagnosis in the experimental model, as well as the identification of the pulmonary aeration. Notwithstanding, despite the fact that this study contributes to better understand lung lesions during malaria-associated ARDS, further imaging studies are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3028753822,"Humans are constantly acquiring new information and skills. However, forgetting is also a common phenomenon in our lives. Understanding the lability of memories is critical to appreciate how they are formed as well as forgotten. Here we investigate the lability of chimpanzees’ short-term memories and assess what factors cause forgetting in our closest relatives. In two experiments, chimpanzees were presented with a target task, which involved remembering a reward location, followed by the presentation of an interference task—requiring the recollection of a different reward location. The interference task could take place soon after the presentation of the target task or soon before the retrieval of the food locations. The results show that chimpanzees’ memories for the location of a reward in a target task were compromised by the presentation of a different food location in an interference task. Critically, the temporal location of the interference task did not significantly affect chimpanzees’ performance. These pattern of results were found for both Experiment 1—when the retention interval between the encoding and retrieval of the target task was 60 seconds- and Experiment 2—when the retention interval between the encoding and retrieval of the target task was 30 seconds. We argue that the temporal proximity of the to-be-remembered information and the interference item during encoding is the factor driving chimpanzees’ performance in the present studies."
https://openalex.org/W3030036373,"There is mounting evidence that North Americans are better able to remember faces of targets who belong to the same social group, and this is true even when the social groups are experimentally created. Yet, how Western cultural contexts afford the development of this own group face recognition bias remains unknown. This question is particularly important given that recent findings suggest that first-generation East Asian Canadians do not show this bias. In the current research, we examined the own-group bias among first- and second-generation East Asian Canadians, who vary systematically in their exposure to and engagement in a Western cultural context, and tested mediators that could explain any difference. In Study 1, second-generation East Asian Canadians showed better memory for same-group (vs. other-group) faces. In Studies 2 and 3, as well as a meta-analysis of all three studies, we found some additional evidence that second-generation East Asian Canadians show better memory for same-group (vs. other-group) faces, whereas first-generation East Asian Canadians do not, but only when each cultural group was examined separately in each study, as no interaction with generational status emerged. In Study 2, and in a higher powered pre-registered Study 3, we also examined whether second- (vs. first-) generational status had a positive indirect effect on same-group face recognition through the effects of acculturation and perceived relational mobility in the immediate social environment, however this mediation model was not supported by the data. Overall, the results provide some additional evidence that the effect of mere social categorization on face recognition may not be as consistently found among East Asian participants."
https://openalex.org/W3030658392,"The incidence of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, has increased steadily worldwide. Diet, beverages, and food texture can all markedly influence these metabolic disorders. However, the combined effects of food texture and beverages on energy metabolism remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the effect of food texture on energy metabolism in mice administered high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Mice were fed a soft or hard diet along with 4.2% HFCS or tap water. Body weight and total caloric intake were not affected by food texture irrespective of HFCS consumption. However, caloric intake from HFCS (i.e., drinking volume) and diet were higher and lower, respectively, in the hard food group than in the soft food group. The hard food group’s preference for HFCS was absent in case of mice treated with the μ-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. Despite increased HFCS consumption, blood glucose levels were lower in the hard-diet group than in the soft-diet group. In HFCS-fed mice, insulin levels after glucose stimulation and insulin content in the pancreas were higher in the hard food group than the soft food group, whereas insulin tolerance did not differ between the groups. These food texture-induced differences in glucose tolerance were not observed in mice fed tap water. Thus, food texture appears to affect glucose tolerance by influencing pancreatic β-cell function in HFCS-fed mice. These data shed light on the combined effects of eating habits and food texture on human health."
https://openalex.org/W3032723816,"Rationale The RECIST guideline defines four categories of response to treatment for cancer patients according to post-baseline changes in tumor burden, hence ignoring disease history. However, if left untreated, tumors grow exponentially, implying that pretreatment changes in tumor size are key to thoroughly assess efficacy. We present a model-based approach to estimate the rates of changes in tumor mass, before and after treatment onset. Methods Sixty-eight patients were eligible for the analysis of tumor size data from a Phase 1 study evaluating the effect of emactuzumab. In addition to tumor size measured at baseline and every six weeks during treatment, a pre-baseline measurement was gathered for each patient. A longitudinal regression model was used to estimate the rates of tumor size change before and after treatment onset. Results The median pre-treatment tumor growth exponential rate was equal to 0.022 month-1, corresponding to a tumor size doubling time of 4 months, and the on-treatment median tumor shrinkage exponential rate was equal to 0.001 month-1. Among sixteen patients categorized as stable disease per RECIST, only five had similar slopes before and after treatment while nine actually improved. One patient in particular had a therapeutically induced stabilization of the disease. Conclusion Our analysis emphasizes the importance of collecting pre-baseline scans to distinguish therapeutically induced stable disease from cases where the tumor growth is not perturbed by treatment."
