https://openalex.org/W2038500217,"Deletions or mutations of the retinoblastoma gene, RB1, are common features of many tumors and tumor cell lines. Recently, the RB1 gene product, p105-RB, has been shown to form stable protein/protein complexes with the oncoproteins of two DNA tumor viruses, the adenovirus E1A proteins and the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen. Neither of these viruses is thought to be associated with human cancer, but they can cause tumors in rodents. Binding between the RB anti-oncoprotein and the adenovirus or SV40 oncoprotein can be recapitulated in vitro with coimmunoprecipitation mixing assays. These assays have been used to demonstrate that the E7 oncoprotein of the human papilloma virus type-16 can form similar complexes with p105-RB. Human papilloma virus-16 is found associated with approximately 50 percent of cervical carcinomas. These results suggest that these three DNA viruses may utilize similar mechanisms in transformation and implicate RB binding as a possible step in human papilloma virus-associated carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2065692062,"The major human rhinovirus receptor has been identified with monoclonal antibodies that inhibit rhinovirus infection. These monoclonal antibodies recognize a 95 kd cell surface glycoprotein on human cells and on mouse transfectants expressing a rhinovirus binding phenotype. Purified 95 kd protein binds to rhinovirus in vitro. Protein sequence from the 95 kd protein showed an identity with that of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1); a cDNA clone obtained from mouse transfectants expressing the rhinovirus receptor had essentially the same sequence as ICAM-1. Thus, the major human rhinovirus receptor is ICAM-1. The gene for this receptor maps to human chromosome 19, which also contains the genes for a number of other picornavirus receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2063613980,"Rhinoviruses, which cause common colds, possess over 100 serotypes, 90% of which (the major group) share a single receptor. Lymphocyte function associated molecule 1 (LFA-1) mediates leukocyte adhesion to a wide variety of cell types by binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). We demonstrate identity between the receptor for the major group of rhinoviruses and ICAM-1. A major group rhinovirus binds specifically to purified ICAM-1 and to ICAM-1 expressed on transfected COS cells, and binding is blocked by three ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that block ICAM-1-LFA-1 interaction, but not by an ICAM-1 MAb that does not block ICAM-1-LFA-1 interaction. This suggests that the ICAM-1 contact site(s) for LFA-1 and rhinoviruses is proximal or identical. In addition, ICAM-1 MAb block the cytopathic effect in HeLa cells mediated by representative major but not minor group rhinoviruses. ICAM-1 is induced by soluble mediators of inflammation, suggesting that the host immune response to rhinovirus may facilitate spread to uninfected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2047799300,"In the clam, Spisula, two previously described proteins known as cyclin A and B display the unusual property of selective proteolytic degradation at the end of each mitosis. We show here that clam oocytes and embryos contain a cdc2 protein kinase. This protein kinase is a component of the M phase promoting factor (MPF) in frog eggs and the M phase-specific histone H1 kinase in starfish. Clam cdc2 is found in association with both cyclin A and B, probably not as a trimolecular association, but as separate cdc2/cyclin A and cdc2/cyclin B complexes. Clam cdc2 and the associated cyclins bind to p13suc1-Sepharose. The p13-bound complex, and also anti-cyclin A or B immunoprecipitates, each display cell cycle-dependent histone H1 kinase activity. We suggest that in addition to the cdc2 protein kinase, the cyclins are further components of the M phase promoting factor and that cyclin proteolysis provides the mechanism of MPF inactivation and thus exit from mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1488599557,"Limited proteolysis of three distinct subspecies of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme, PKC), types I (γ), II (βI and βII), and III (α), with Ca2+-dependent neutral proteases I and II (calpains I and II) was studied. All forms of PKC (82 kDa) were converted to two major fragments: a 45–49-kDa catalytic fragment and a 36-kDa regulatory fragment. The cleavage of these PKC subspecies by calpain I (active in the micromolar range Ca2+/ion concentration), and, to a lesser extent, by calpain II (active in the millimolar range), was enhanced by the simultaneous presence of phospholipid and diacylglycerol or phorbol ester, suggesting that the activated form of PKC is the preferred target for proteolysis. Analysis of the NH2-terminal sequence of the resulting catalytic fragments indicated that both calpains I and II cleave at one or two specific sites in the third variable region (V3) of each PKC molecule. Under comparable conditions with calpains I and II, the relative rates of cleavage of types I, II, and III PKC were approximately 100:16:2 and 100:48:23, respectively. The results imply that within the cell various PKC subspecies may be cleaved at different rates under different physiological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1995430236,"Our previous work has shown that the amino-terminal residue of a short-lived protein is a distinct component of the protein's degradation signal. To define the complete signal, otherwise identical dihydrofolate reductase test proteins bearing different extensions and either a ""stabilizing"" or a ""destabilizing"" amino-terminal residue were expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae and their in vivo half-lives compared. The amino-terminal degradation signal is shown to comprise two distinct determinants. One, discovered previously, is the protein's amino-terminal residue. The second determinant, identified in the present work, is a specific lysine residue whose function in the degradation signal is not dependent on the unique amino acid sequences in the vicinity of the residue. The mechanistic significance of the second determinant is illuminated by the finding that in a targeted, short-lived protein, a chain of branched ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugates is confined to a lysine residue that has been identified in the present work as the second determinant of the degradation signal."

https://openalex.org/W2035244457,"ras and myc oncogenes were able to induce distinct phenotypic alterations, resembling different types of premalignant lesions, when introduced into approximately 0.1% of the cells used to reconstitute the mouse prostate gland. While ras induced dysplasia in combination with angiogenesis, myc induced a hyperplasia of the otherwise normally developed organ. ras and myc together induced primarily carcinomas. However, tumor progression was also associated with additional genetic alterations involving gene amplification. Our data indicate that specific types of benign premalignant lesions may reflect the activation of different single oncogenes, and that the consecutive activation of multiple oncogenes could be a causal event in the step-like progression of tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1547944371,"Ca2+-sensitive protein kinases are thought to play a pivotal role in Ca2+-mediated neuronal communication. We describe here the cloning, purification, and characterization of a major Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, brain-specific protein kinase which is particularly enriched in cerebellar granule cells. The enzyme is comprised of Mr 65,000 and 67,000 polypeptides which copurify to homogeneity and phosphorylate synapsin I. The protein kinase is coded for by two poly(A+) RNAs of 2.0 and 3.5 kilobases which probably derive from a single gene. Two cDNA inserts, one of 198 base pairs and one of 1225 base pairs, contain a total of 677 base pairs of the protein coding sequence which includes sequences homologous to other calmodulin-dependent protein kinases including part of the calmodulin-binding domain. The surprising presence of extended sequences which are enriched in glutamate residues may influence the subcellular distribution of this kinase. Immunohistochemical localization with an affinity-purified antibody reveals that whereas the enzyme is expressed in several neuronal subpopulations, it is exceptionally enriched in the granule cells of the cerebellum. The relevance of the biochemical, molecular, and histologic properties of this enzyme is discussed in the context of neuronal Ca2+ signaling."

The recently determined three-dimensional structure of the related protease from Rous sarcoma virus has been used to model the smaller HIV-1 dimer. The active site has been analyzed by comparison to the structure of the aspartic protease, rhizopuspepsin, complexed with a peptide inhibitor. The HIV-1 protease is predicted to interact with seven residues of the protein substrate. This information can be used to design protease inhibitors and possible antiviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1517210653,"Human eosinophils preferentially utilize bromide to generate a brominating agent, even at physiological halide concentrations, where chloride (140 mM) is over 1000-fold greater than bromide (20-100 microM). Under the same conditions, neutrophils use chloride to generate a chlorinating agent. The total amount of active halogen trapped by 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene from eosinophils increases by over 2-fold as the added bromide concentration increases from 0 to 100 microM, with approximately 40 nmol of halogen trapped per million cells at the highest bromide level. At least 25-35% of the oxygen consumed by stimulated eosinophils is directed toward the generation of halogenating species. Since the relative halogenating behavior of eosinophil peroxidase and neutrophil myeloperoxidase in this bromide range is essentially identical to that of the cells, the specificity of eosinophils toward bromide is intrinsic to eosinophil peroxidase and not to any special cellular properties. These results suggest that human eosinophils use bromide in vivo and that a deficiency of bromide may influence their ability to produce halogenating agents."
https://openalex.org/W1536225466,"Two species of folate binding protein (FBP), an integral membrane-associated form and a soluble secreted form, have been previously purified from cultured human KB cells. The complete nucleotide sequence of the complementary DNA (cDNA) clone for the coding region of the mature membrane-associated FBP has now been determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence has been computer-analyzed for a prediction of the secondary structure of the protein. The clone has 857 nucleotides of which 678 comprise the coding region for 226 amino acids. The deduced amino sequence contains the identical sequence of the published 18 NH2-terminal amino acids of the purified FBP from KB cells and the published partial amino acid sequence of the human milk FBP except for 1 residue. There was also over 90% homology with the published amino acid sequence of the bovine milk FBP. A total of 16 cysteine residues has been conserved in the three proteins indicating that this amino acid may provide a tertiary structure which is required for its ligand binding function. Northern blot analysis using the cDNA probe identified a single band of 1.28-kilobase pair mRNA in KB cells which was 4.7-fold more intense in folate-depleted cells than in normal cells. These results indicate that the membrane FBP and the soluble FBP in the medium are translation products of the same gene. Computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that there is only one stretch of amino acids of sufficient hydrophobicity and length to span the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, but it lacked a predictable helical structure. Those regions of the sequence which did have a predictable helical structure lacked sufficient hydrophobicity required for a membrane anchor. Thus, it is likely that the fatty acids previously reported to be present in the membrane-associated FBP from these cells rather than a peptide sequence provide an important membrane anchoring function."
https://openalex.org/W1488927573,"Abstract The sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) receptor was solubilized from the membranes of human prostate glands with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid). The binding activity of the soluble receptor was measured by allowing it to bind to 125I-SHBG and precipitating the complex with polyethylene glycol-8000. The binding activity was stable for at least 4 months at -20 degrees C and had a half-life of 23 days at 4 degrees C. Like the membrane-bound receptor, Scatchard analysis revealed two sets of binding sites for the soluble one. At equilibrium (24 h), the high affinity site had an association constant (KA) of 6.8 x 10(8) M-1 and a binding capacity of 1.4 pmol/mg protein, whereas the low affinity site had a KA of 4.7 x 10(6) M-1 and a binding capacity of 43 pmol/mg protein. At 37 degrees C, the association rate constant (k1) was 8.37 x 10(5) M-1 min-1 and the dissociation rate constant (k2) was 3.43 x 10(-4) min-1. The soluble receptor was retarded on Sepharose CL-6B and had an apparent Mr = 167,000."
https://openalex.org/W1503786837,"Abstract The receptor for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was characterized in highly enriched cultures of fetal hippocampal neurons. Two major components of binding could be distinguished. One component comprising about 70% of total binding was removed by 2 M NaCl, and by analogy to other cells could be presumptively attributed to glycosaminoglycans. The remaining 30% of binding which was resistant to 2 M NaCl reflects a high affinity receptor. Scatchard analysis indicated that the two components have Kd values of 500 and 120 pM, and densities of 165,000 and 35,000-60,000 sites/neuron, respectively. Cross-linking 125I-bFGF to neuronal cultures with disuccinimidyl suberate labeled a major membrane protein of 135 kDa and a minor protein of 85 kDa. Examination of neuronal cultures derived from multiple brain regions and membrane preparations from fetal brain suggested that the larger protein was widely distributed. The neuronal bFGF receptor was not blocked by heparin at concentrations up to 100 micrograms/ml. Twelve synthetic peptide fragments of bFGF were examined to determine the domain of bFGF interacting with the neuronal receptor. Inhibition was observed chiefly with a peptide including the sequence 103-146. The properties of the neuronal bFGF receptor were compared directly to those of the receptors characterized on BHK cells and other mesenchymal cells. Specific differences observed between neuronal and mesenchymal bFGF receptors are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520575681,"Cholera toxin stimulates adenylyl cyclase by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of the alpha chain (alpha s) of Gs, a guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein. In a rat pituitary cell line, GH3, the toxin-induced increase in GTP-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity is maximal at 1 h; adenylyl cyclase remains elevated for at least 32 h. Surprisingly, cholera toxin also induces a 74-95% decrease in the amount of immunoreactive alpha s in the same cells, as assessed on immunoblots probed with either of two antisera directed against separate alpha s peptide sequences. The decrease in immunoreactive alpha s, which begins after 1 h of toxin treatment and is complete by 8 h, is accompanied by a comparable decrease in the amount of biochemically active alpha s, as assessed by its ability to complement the biochemical defect of alpha s-deficient S49 cyc- membranes. Cholera toxin induces similar decreases in alpha s in wild type S49 lymphoma cells, in S49 kin- mutants, which lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and in S49 H21 a mutants, in which alpha s is unable to assume an active conformation upon binding GTP. The toxin-induced decrease in alpha s is somewhat temperature-dependent, but is not blocked by agents that increase lysosomal pH or by colchicine, which promotes breakdown of microtubules. alpha s in detergent-solubilized GH3 membranes is susceptible to proteolysis by an endogenous protease; this susceptibility is markedly increased in membranes from cells previously exposed to cholera toxin for 1 h. Taken together, these results suggest that cholera toxin-induced covalent modification of alpha s marks the protein for accelerated degradation. In addition, the persistence of elevated GTP-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity despite loss of a substantial fraction of alpha s suggests that the amount of alpha s membranes is greater than the amount necessary for maximal activation of cAMP synthesis by cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1503046421,"Monomolecular layers of lipid extracts of microsomal, mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, and pure lipid species have been used to measure their interaction with apo- and holocytochrome c. Large differences were observed both with respect to the nature and the lipid specificity of the interaction. The initial electrostatic interaction of the hemefree precursor apocytochrome c with anionic phospholipids is followed by penetration of the protein in between the acyl chains. Apocytochrome c shows similar interactions for all anionic lipids tested. In strong contrast the holoprotein discriminates enormously between cardiolipin for which it has a high affinity and phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol for which it has a much lower affinity. For these latter lipids the interaction with cytochrome c is primarily electrostatic. The cytochrome c-cardiolipin interaction shows several unique features which suggest the formation of a specific complex between the two molecules. These properties account for the preference in interaction of the apoprotein with the lipid extract of the outer mitochondrial membrane over that of the endoplasmic reticulum and the large preference of cytochrome c for the inner over that of the outer mitochondrial membrane lipid extract. Only apocytochrome c was able to induce close contacts between monolayers of the mitochondrial outer membrane lipids and vesicles of mitochondrial inner membrane lipids. Experiments with fragments of both protein and unfolding experiments with cytochrome c revealed that the differences in interaction between the two proteins are mainly due to differences in their tertiary structure and not the presence of the heme group itself. The initial unfolded structure of apocytochrome c is responsible for the high penetrative power of the protein and its ability to induce close membrane contact, whereas the folded structure of cytochrome c is responsible for the specific interaction with cardiolipin. The results are discussed in the light of the apocytochrome c import process in mitochondria and suggest that lipid-protein interactions contribute to targeting the precursor toward mitochondria and are important for its translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane and the final localization of cytochrome c toward the outside of the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1562632975,"The structural organization of the low molecular mass form (43 kDa) of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase was dissected taking advantage of the known sequence of the bacterial cya gene (Glaser, P., Ladant, D., Sezer, O., Pichot, F., Ullmann, A., and Danchin, A. (1988) Mol. Microbiol. 2, 19–30) and its low content of Trp and Met residues. Cleavage of the 43-kDa protein and of its complementary tryptic fragments (T25 and T18 peptides) with N-chlorosuccinimide and cyanogen bromide followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of digestion products allowed the following conclusions: (i) the catalytically active 43-kDa form of B. pertussis adenylate cyclase is within the first 400 residues of the protein encoded by the cya gene. T25 occupies the N-terminal domain of the protein (residues 1–235/237). Isolated T25 fragment exhibits a low but measurable enzymatic activity which indicates that it harbors the catalytic site; (ii) T18 which is the main calmodulin-binding domain, occupies the C-terminal segment of protein (residues 236/238–399) and is devoid of catalytic properties; (iii) the two complementary peptides T25 and T18 reassociated only in the presence of calmodulin, leading to significant recovery of the original activity. These results demonstrate that both fragments of the 43-kDa form of adenylate cyclase are essential for a high level of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589533444,"Minicircle DNA, the major component of the mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes (kinetoplast DNA), is linearized when living Trypanosoma equiperdum cells are treated with inhibitors of mammalian type II topoisomerases and then lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate. A variety of intercalating and nonintercalating compounds (the epipodophyllotoxins, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidine, 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticine, and acriflavine) are active, but novobiocin and specific gyrase inhibitors (the quinolones) are not. The linearized minicircles are in a DNA-protein complex, as their electrophoretic mobility is increased by Proteinase K treatment. They are digested by exonuclease III but not by lambda exonuclease, indicating that the protein must be linked to both 5' ends. Drug-induced cleavage sites vary with different compounds and are found throughout the minicircle sequence. These results indicate that trypanosome mitochondria contain a type II topoisomerase with some properties similar to those of type II topoisomerases in the nucleus of higher eukaryotes. A maximum of 12% of all minicircles is cleaved in the presence of VP16-213, indicating there are at least 600 molecules of mitochondrial type II topoisomerase/cell or about one enzyme/8 kilobases of minicircle DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1509760806,"The Drosophila visual mutant rdgA is known to show age-dependent retinal degeneration with defective diacylglycerol (DG) kinase activity. In this study we examined DG kinase activity of several visual mutants and found that only rdgA mutant eyes showed the lack of DG kinase activity in a gene dosage-dependent manner. The enzyme activity is already absent at the time of eclosion from pupal case when the degeneration is not yet apparent. To examine whether rdgA gene dosage effect holds for other enzymes related to the phosphatidylinositol turnover, phospholipase C was analyzed which did not show any gene dosage effect. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that rdgA gene correlates closely with DG kinase activity, and the defect of DG kinase activity is a primary cause of retinal degeneration in rdgA mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2158794967,"The rotavirus glycoprotein VP7 has a cleavable signal peptide and is normally resident as an integral membrane protein in the ER of infected cells. A gene was constructed in which the VP7 H2 signal peptide was replaced by one from influenza hemagglutinin. COS cells transfected with this gene produced VP7 with the correct amino terminus, but the protein was rapidly secreted. Uncleaved VP7 from either precursor was not detected in cells after brief pulse-labeling, suggesting that the signal peptide was not acting as a temporary anchor; rather, it exerted its effect despite rapid cleavage. By splicing the H2 signal peptide onto another reporter protein, the malaria S-antigen, we demonstrated that H2 was necessary, but not itself sufficient, for targeting and retention. We propose that an interaction between the cleaved signal peptide and other downstream sequences in VP7 is required for retention of this protein in the ER as an integral membrane polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1579824808,"Abstract 2-Methyl,8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo(1,2-a)pyridine 3-acetonitrile (SCH 28080) is a freely reversible K+ site inhibitor of the gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase. In the presence of 2 mMMgSO4, [14C]SCH 28080 bound saturably to gastric vesicle preparations containing the (H+ + K+)-ATPase and was displaced by lumenal K+. A binding stoichiometry of 2.2 +/- 0.1 mol of SCH 28080/mol of catalytic phosphorylation sites was observed. The affinity of SCH 28080 binding was increased approximately 10-fold (to 45 nM) in the presence of 2 mM ATP. High affinity binding also occurred with 2 microM ATP but not with up to 200 microM D-[beta, gamma-CH2]ATP, suggesting that high affinity binding was to a phosphorylated form of the enzyme. In the presence of ATP, the association rate constant was linearly related to the concentration of SCH 28080. However, the association and dissociation rates of SCH 28080 binding were slow, especially at low temperature (at 1.5 degrees C half-maximal binding of 50 nM SCH 28080 was calculated to occur after 232 s). Binding appeared to be predominantly entropy driven with a high activation energy (40 kJ/mol at 37 degrees C). In the absence of ATP, the association rate constant was not linearly related to the concentration of SCH 28080, suggesting that a conformational change in the enzyme was required before binding could occur."
https://openalex.org/W1486608709,"Abstract In order to study 1) the mechanisms responsible for generating free ubiquitin monomer and 2) the function of ubiquitin carboxyl extension proteins in eukaryotes, we have developed a system for expression of human ubiquitin carboxyl extension proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the intact ubiquitin carboxyl extension proteins were rapidly processed to free ubiquitin monomer and extension protein. Furthermore, expression in this host conferred a slow growth phenotype mediated by the extension protein. Expression in Escherichia coli did not result in processing of the fusion proteins. However, when the expressed fusion proteins were purified from E. coli and incubated with a rabbit reticulocyte extract, the proteins were rapidly processed to free ubiquitin monomer and extension protein. These results show that human ubiquitin carboxyl extension proteins are processed to ubiquitin and extension protein when expressed in eukaryotic but not prokaryotic cells and that pre- and co-translational events are not necessary for their processing. Establishment of this system will allow for large scale purification of these proteins which will aid future studies on the function and structure of ubiquitin carboxyl extension proteins, as well as the mechanisms responsible for their processing."
https://openalex.org/W1520539051,"The neurotensin receptor was purified from newborn mouse brain by affinity chromatography. Active neurotensin binding sites were solubilized from brain homogenates using the nondenaturing detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) in the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate. Chromatography of the soluble extract on SP-Sephadex C-25 and hydroxylapatite eliminated 50% of proteins without loss of neurotensin binding activity. This prepurified material was loaded into an affinity column prepared by coupling neurotensin (2-13) to glutaraldehyde-activated Ultrogel AcA22. Nonspecifically adsorbed proteins were eliminated by extensive washing, and the receptor was eluted with a buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 0.02% cholesteryl hemisuccinate. After desalting, the purified receptor bound 125I-labeled neurotensin with a dissociation constant of 0.26 nM and retained its specificity towards a series of neurotensin analogues. The desalted NaCl eluate appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a major band of molecular weight 100,000 which was identified as the receptor by affinity labeling with 125I-labeled neurotensin in the presence of disuccinimidyl suberate. The purity of the mouse brain receptor eluted from the affinity column was estimated to be 78%. Electroelution of the 100-kDa protein band gave an homogenous preparation of receptor. Very similar results were obtained with CHAPS-solubilized neurotensin receptors from rat and rabbit brain."
https://openalex.org/W1486377867,"Abstract A form of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) that was different from previously described cGK was purified from bovine aorta smooth muscle. The partial amino-terminal sequencing of this enzyme indicated that it was derived by endogenous proteolysis of the type I beta isozyme of cGK. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this form migrated as a smaller protein (Mr = 70,000) than the parent cGK (Mr = 80,000), and since the calculated nondenatured Mr was approximately 89,000 compared to Mr = 170,000 for the dimeric native enzyme, it represented a monomeric form of cGK. The monomer bound approximately 2 mol of [3H]cGMP per mol of monomer, although it had only one rapid component in [3H]cGMP dissociation assays as compared to one rapid and one slow component for the native cGK. The specific catalytic activity of the kinase was similar to that of the native enzyme, suggesting that the catalytic domain was essentially intact. The monomeric cGK incorporated significant 32P when incubated with Mg2+ and [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of cGMP, although the phosphorylation proceeded at a slower rate than that obtained with native cGK. In contrast to previous reports of monomeric forms of cGK, this monomer was highly cGMP-dependent, although it had a slightly higher Ka (0.8 microM) for cGMP than that of the native enzyme (0.4 microM) and a low Hill coefficient of 1.0 (1.6 for the native enzyme). The cGMP dependence of the monomer did not decrease with dilution, implying that the cGMP dependence was not due to monomer-monomer interactions in the assay. The results indicated that the catalytic domain, cGMP binding domain(s), and inhibitory domain of cGK interact primarily within the same subunit rather than between subunits of the dimer as previously hypothesized for dimeric cGK."

https://openalex.org/W1502398160,"Abstract We investigated cellular mechanisms mediating the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in isolated perfused rabbit connecting tubules. Prior and/or concomitant exposure to 0.5 mM of N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H-8), a cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, abolished the rise in [Ca2+]i produced by 0.1 nM PTH in five connecting tubules and suppressed it by approximately 50% in another five. In the latter, there was a delayed onset in the rise of [Ca2+]i. Such responses contrasted to the prompt increase in [Ca2+]i in PTH-stimulated control tubules. However, when H-8 was withdrawn, [Ca2+]i rose within minutes to reach a plateau value similar to the uninhibited response to PTH in controls, indicating rapidly reversible inhibition by H-8. In an otherwise identical protocol, 0.5 mM H-8 also reversibly suppressed the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by 0.175 mM 8-Br-cAMP. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of 8-Br-cAMP on [Ca2+]i, 1 mM 8-Br-cGMP caused no increase. At a concentration of 0.4 mM, the Rp diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS), a well-characterized cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, totally abolished the rise in [Ca2+]i caused by 0.1 nM PTH. We conclude that a cAMP-dependent protein kinase plays an important role in the PTH-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i in the rabbit connecting tubule. Since the increase in [Ca2+]i was shown previously to depend on extracellular Ca2+, we propose that cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation is important in mediating PTH-stimulated Ca2+ fluxes across plasma membranes of connecting tubule cells."
https://openalex.org/W1569714402,"Porcine leukocytes contain a novel pathway for the metabolism of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) which results in reduction of the conjugated triene chromophore to a conjugated diene. These cells converted LTB4 to two major metabolites, both of which exhibited maximal absorbance at 230 nm in their UV spectra. These products were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and identified as 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 and 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 on the basis of the mass spectra of various derivatives. The position of the double bond of LTB4 which had been reduced was established by cleaving the remaining double bonds of 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 with ozone followed by oxidation or reduction of the resulting ozonide and analysis of the products by mass spectrometry. Experiments with deuterium-labeled substrate indicated that LTB4 could be directly converted to 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 without the prior oxidation of either of its hydroxyl groups, as is required for the formation of dihydro metabolites of prostaglandins. Incubation of porcine leukocytes with 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 and 10, 11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 indicated that these two products can be interconverted and are in equilibrium with one another. The dihydro-oxo metabolite can therefore be formed from 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4, although we have not ruled out the possibility that it is also produced via 12-oxo-LTB4, which could be a transitory intermediate. These results indicate that porcine leukocytes contain a novel reductase/dehydrogenase pathway distinct from the pathway responsible for the metabolism of prostaglandins. This pathway is also different from the pathway in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes which converts 6-trans-isomers of LTB4 to dihydro products, since the latter pathway involves 5-oxo intermediates and results in a shift in the positions of the remaining double bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1529353354,"Evidence for the glyoxylate cycle in the mammalian rat liver was sought. Activity of two unique glyoxylate cycle enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, was found in rat liver homogenates. Vitamin D3 treatment of rachitic animals produced a five- and fourfold increase, respectively, in the activity of these enzymes. Vitamin D3 also increased the peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and the accumulation of glycogen in liver slices in the presence of palmitate. These data suggest that the mammalian rat liver can convert fatty acid carbon to carbohydrate carbon directly."
https://openalex.org/W1567216262,"Fluspirilene binds with high affinity to a single class of sites in purified porcine cardiac sarcolemmal membrane vesicles at a Kd of 0.6 nM and a Bmax that is in approximately 1:1 stoichiometry with other Ca2+ entry blocker receptors. Fluspirilene binding is modulated by various classes of L-type Ca2+ channel effectors. Metal ion channel inhibitors (e.g. Cd2+) stimulate binding primarily by increasing ligand affinity, whereas channel substrates (e.g. Ca2+) inhibit binding. Dihydropyridine, aralkylamine, and benzothiazepine Ca2+ entry blockers partially inhibit binding with Ki values equivalent to their respective Kd values, indicating close coupling between binding sites for the former agents and the diphenylbutylpiperidine site. All of these agents function as mixed inhibitors and affect both Kd and Bmax of fluspirilene binding. Only other substituted diphenylbutylpiperidines (e.g. pimozide) inhibit binding competitively. Diphenylbutylpiperidines, on the other hand, block nitrendipine, D-600, and diltiazem binding through a noncompetitive mechanism with Ki values much reduced from their measured Kd values, suggesting that coupling between the diphenylbutylpiperidine site and receptors for diverse Ca2+ entry blockers is more indirect. In addition, high affinity sites have been detected for fluspirilene in bovine aortic sarcolemmal vesicles, rat brain synaptic membranes, and GH3 rat anterior pituitary cell plasma membranes. Fluspirilene also effectively blocks Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channels in GH3 cells. Together, these results suggest that fluspirilene binds with high affinity to a unique fourth site in the Ca2+ entry blocker receptor complex and that substituted diphenylbutylpiperidines represent a new structural class of potent L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1509532314,"Abstract Antibodies to surface immunoglobulins activate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in B-lymphocytes, but very little is known concerning their effects on cAMP levels. In other cells, products from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can increase and/or potentiate cAMP accumulation. In this study we have examined whether goat anti-mouse IgM (mu-chain-specific) stimulates and/or potentiates increases in the cAMP levels of splenocytes from athymic nude mice. Goat anti-mouse IgM, by itself, stimulated a 60% increase in cAMP within 2 min. Pretreating the cell suspensions at 37 degrees C with anti-IgM produced opposite effects on the forskolin- and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-induced increase in cAMP. Anti-IgM (25 micrograms/ml) potentiated the rise in cAMP induced by 100 microM forskolin 76%, but it decreased the response to 50 nM PGE1 by 30%. Direct activation of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and/or sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol resulted in a similar pattern of responses. A 3-min preincubation with 97 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate potentiated the forskolin-induced response from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.6 pmol of cAMP/10(6) cells but reduced the PGE1 response from 0.98 +/- 0.06 to 0.51 +/- 0.03 pmol of cAMP/10(6) cells. Similarly, preincubating the cells for 3 min with 5 microM sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol increased the forskolin response from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 5.1 +/- 0.2 pmol of cAMP/10(6) cells but reduced the response to PGE1 from 1.15 +/- 0.03 to 0.75 +/- 0.04 pmol of cAMP/10(6) cells. Thus, activation of protein kinase C by hydrolysis products of inositol phospholipids, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, or exogenous diacylglycerols modified adenylate cyclase itself and sites upstream of adenylate cyclase such as the receptor or G proteins coupling the receptor to the cyclase. Furthermore, modification of the PGE1 response by anti-IgM provides a mechanism by which antigen can differentially regulate T- and B-cells responding to macrophage-produced prostaglandins during an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2121750936,"The antibiotic resistance gene neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) has been precisely targeted to a chromosomal region close to the cystic fibrosis (CF) locus on chromosome 7. The chromosomal target was the expressed SV40 array integrated at chromosome 7, band q31-q35 in a human-mouse hybrid cell line that contains chromosome 7 as the only human component. Stringent selection for neo expression by homologous recombination (3 of 11 correctly targeted) was achieved by fusing the SV40 large T antigen gene, in frame, to neo in a promoterless construct, such that G418 resistance depended on endogenous promoter function and read-through transcription. Chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT) with G418 selection was then used generate mouse hybrids that carried the targeted locus intact, but retained only a fragment of human chromosome 7. This gene targeting strategy will access new regions of the human (or other mammalian) genome, create precise mutations efficiently by gene disruption, and potentially restore normal gene function by mutation correction."
https://openalex.org/W1484472103,"Abstract The cytosolic fractions from epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated A431 cells exhibit a marked increase in activities of ATP.Mg-dependent protein phosphatase and its activating factor (protein kinase FA) when compared to controls in the absence of EGF. By contrast, the Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fractions from the same EGF-treated cells exhibit a corresponding decrease in protein kinase FA activity. The EGF-dependent activation of protein kinase FA and ATP.Mg-dependent protein phosphatase occurred within physiological concentrations of EGF (ED50 = 5 x 10(-10) M). The changes of kinase and phosphatase activities which were measured concomitantly exhibit very similar characteristics as to EGF sensitivity and time dependence. The EGF-induced kinase and phosphatase activation occurred very rapidly, reaching the maximal activity levels within 3 min. Moreover, the EGF effect is transient; both EGF-stimulated phosphatase and kinase activities returned to control levels within 30 min. Taken together, the results suggest that EGF may induce the activation of kinase FA in the membrane and thereby promotes the activation of ATP.Mg-dependent phosphatase in the cytosol. Exposure of A431 cells to exogenous phospholipase C also resulted in the activation of endogenous kinase FA and ATP.Mg-dependent phosphatase in a similar pattern produced by EGF. This further suggests that phospholipase C can mimic EGF to mediate the activation of kinase FA and ATP.Mg-dependent phosphatase in A431 cells. By its dual role as a multisubstrate protein kinase and as an activating factor of multisubstrate protein phosphatase, protein kinase FA may represent a transmembrane signal of EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1569016924,"According to its cDNA sequence, the product of the DUB1 gene of Dictyostelium discoideum, called ubex52, consists of a ubiquitin monomer with a basic COOH-terminal tail of 52 amino acids that includes a putative zinc finger motif. Antipeptide antibodies raised against the COOH-terminal end of the tail indicated that the ubex52 protein is present in all developmental stages of D. discoideum and that similar proteins with apparent molecular masses of 15 to 17 kDa are found in yeast, wheat germ, Drosophila, and mammals. Subcellular fractionation showed that the D. discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins recognized by the antibodies are associated with the ribosomal fraction. After separation and purification of the 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits of D. discoideum, the ubex52 protein was exclusively recovered in the small subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1572087673,"Abstract Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is known to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Collagen-induced binding of 125I-PDGF to human washed platelets was therefore investigated. It was found 1) to be time-dependent, reaching a plateau at 20 degrees C after 30 min, 2) collagen concentration-dependent, 3) specifically inhibited by unlabeled PDGF, and 4) saturable. Scatchard plot analysis showed a single class of sites with 3000 +/- 450 molecules bound/cell and an apparent KD of 1.2 +/- 0.2 10(-8) M. The effects of PDGF on collagen-induced phosphoinositide breakdown and protein phosphorylation were also investigated. At 50 ng/ml PDGF, a concentration which completely inhibited collagen-induced aggregation, the breakdown of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) and [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) was observed, but the subsequent replenishment of [32P]PIP2 was inhibited. The same PDGF concentration totally inhibited collagen-induced phosphatidic acid formation. PDGF also completely prevented phosphorylation of P43 and P20, as a result of protein kinase C activation consecutive to phosphoinositide metabolism. These results suggest that (i) a specific PDGF receptor can be induced by collagen, and (ii) PDGF can effect the early events of collagen-induced platelet activation by inhibiting PIP2 resynthesis and P43 and P20 phosphorylation. It is concluded that PDGF might be involved in a negative feed-back control of platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1515959698,"Abstract After incubation of confluent monolayer cultures of human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells with purified native human plasminogen in plasminogen-depleted serum-containing medium, bound plasmin activity could be specifically eluted from the cells with tranexamic acid, an analogue of lysine. Dexamethasone reduced the amount of recoverable bound plasmin activity in a dose-dependent manner. Dexamethasone was also found to induce a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the ability of the cells to bind added plasmin. Untreated HT-1080 cells bound added plasmin with a high capacity (600,000 molecules bound per cell), and this decreased to an undetectable level after treatment with 100 nM dexamethasone. The kinetics of the loss of plasmin binding by the dexamethasone-treated sarcoma cells, a clear decrease after 4 h, correlated with those for the loss of cell-bound urokinase (u-PA) activity. Plasmin was not, however, bound to the active site of u-PA: an anti-catalytic monoclonal antibody to u-PA had no effect on plasmin binding. Other glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and corticosterone, had a similar effect to dexamethasone on plasmin binding to HT-1080 cells. The effect of glucocorticoids on the plasmin receptor seemed to occur at least partly via a decrease in the affinity for plasmin, since the Kd for plasmin with untreated cells was 5.4 x 10(-9) M, and with cells treated with 5 nM dexamethasone, the Kd value for plasmin was 1.2 x 10(-7) M. These results show that glucocorticoids induce down-regulation of plasmin receptors on the surface of HT-1080 cells: a novel mechanism, in addition to the known effects of glucocorticoids on u-PA and PA inhibitors, by which human tumor cells may be disarmed of their pericellular proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1570064176,"Abstract Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46), which hydrolyzes fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and Pi, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from spinach leaves and found to be devoid of fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase activity. The isolated enzyme is a dimer (76 kDa determined by gel filtration) composed of two 33-kDa subunits. The enzyme is highly specific and displays hyperbolic kinetics with its fructose 2,6-bisphosphate substrate (Km = 32 microM). The products of the reaction, fructose 6-phosphate and Pi, along with AMP and Mg2+ are inhibitors of the enzyme. Nonaqueous cell fractionation revealed that, like the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate substrate, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase as well as fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase occur in the cytosol of spinach leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1503921645,"Abstract Mitochondria contain two Na+/H+ antiporters, one of which transports K+ as well as Na+. The physiological role of this non-selective Na+/H+ (K+/H+) antiporter is to provide mitochondrial volume homeostasis. The properties of this carrier have been well documented in intact mitochondria, and it has been identified as an 82,000-dalton inner membrane protein. The present studies were designed to solubilize and reconstitute this antiporter in order to permit its isolation and molecular characterization. Proteins from mitoplasts made from rat liver mitochondria were extracted with Triton X-100 in the presence of cardiolipin and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The reconstituted proteoliposomes exhibited electroneutral 86Rb+ transport which was reversibly inhibited by Mg2+ and quinine with K0.5 values of approximately 150 and 300 microM, respectively. Incubation of reconstituted vesicles with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide resulted in irreversible inhibition of 86Rb+ uptake into proteoliposomes. Incubation of vesicles with [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide resulted in labeling of an 82,000-dalton protein. These properties, which are also characteristic of the native Na+/H+ (K+/H+) antiporter, lead us to conclude that this mitochondrial carrier has been reconstituted into proteoliposomes with its known native properties intact."
https://openalex.org/W1489116359,"Rat insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a serum polypeptide with growth promoting activity, was isolated from rat serum by a combination of acid/ethanol extraction, affinity chromatography, and a series of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, cation exchange, and reversed phase. All peptide fragments produced by chymotrypsin digestion of reduced and carboxymethylated rat IGF-I were amino acid sequenced and compared with the sequence of human IGF-I. Three out of 70 of the rat amino acid residues differed from those of human IGF-I as follows: Asp20→Pro, Ser35→Ile and Ala67→Thr. Purified rat IGF-I cross-reacted with polyclonal anti-human IGF-I antibody 75% as compared to human IGF-I, but it cross-reacted only 3% with monoclonal anti-human IGF-I antibody. Thus, it is possible to monitor the metabolic fate of human IGF-I, when injected into rats, without interference by endogenous rat IGF-I. Rat IGF-I showed 65% activity in the radioreceptor, 28.6% activity in the lipogenesis and 22.5% activity in the free fatty acid release inhibition assays as compared to human IGF-I on a protein quantity basis."
https://openalex.org/W1548518023,"4-Benzoylbenzoic acid inhibits pyridoxal kinase activity competitively with respect to pyridoxal. The Ki was determined to be 5 x 10(-5) M. Binding studies showed that 4-benzoylbenzoic acid bound to pyridoxal kinase at a 1:1 molar ratio and with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.9 x 10(-5) M. Photoirradiation of pyridoxal kinase in the presence of a 10-fold excess of 4-benzoylbenzoic acid at pH 6.5 resulted in an irreversible loss of enzymatic activity; this photoinactivation was prevented by the presence of pyridoxal. Amino acid analysis revealed that 1 tyrosine residue/subunit was modified during photoinactivation. The presence of a tyrosine residue at the active site of pyridoxal kinase was confirmed by reaction with tetranitromethane. In the presence of 1 x 10(-4) M tetranitromethane, a complete loss of the kinase activity was observed after incubation at 25 degrees C for 8 min, with modification of a total of 3 tyrosine residues. The second-order rate constant (K2) of the reaction between the tyrosine residues and tetranitromethane was determined to be 53.3 s-1 M-1."
https://openalex.org/W1584860489,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown previously to enhance phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover and mobilize calcium in the rat aortic smooth muscle cell-line (A10; ATCC CRL 1476) via the V1 receptor (Aiyar, N., Nambi, P., Stassen, F. L., and Crooke, S. T. (1986) Life Sci. 39, 37-45). Exposure of A10 cells to AVP for periods ranging from 5 min to 2 h resulted in 30-40% loss in AVP-binding sites and an inhibition of the production of inositol di- and trisphosphates and the mobilization of calcium when the cells were rechallenged by addition of AVP. We now report that during the same time course AVP induces a dose- and time-dependent decrease in labeled PI, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate reaching a minimum after 30 min of incubation. After 2 h of exposure to AVP, the levels of labeled PI, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate increased to a new basal level approximately 30% less than the untreated cultures. The decrease in inositol lipid labeling mediated by AVP was inhibited when the V1 antagonist SK&F 100273 was included in the incubations with AVP. No decrease was observed when the V2 agonist 1-deamino, [8-D-arginine]vasopressin was used for pretreatment of the cells. Furthermore, when PI kinase activity was measured in cell extracts from untreated and AVP-treated (2 h) cells a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) was observed in the absence, but not in the presence, of added PI in the AVP-treated cells as compared with the control cells. Thrombin also stimulates PI metabolism and calcium mobilization in these cells and brought about both a prolonged decrease in inositol lipids and inhibition of PI kinase activity. AVP pretreatment affected the release of intracellular Ca2+ induced by AVP, thrombin, and ATP, differently. The time of AVP pretreatment required to induce half-maximal inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release in response to AVP, thrombin, and ATP was approximately 8, 24, and 30 min, respectively. Consequently, we suggest that the reduction in response to AVP with short term preincubation is due to homologous desensitization as reflected by 30-40% decrease in V1 receptors. Subsequently, a decrease in inositol lipid pools and PI kinase activity results in heterologous desensitization in response to AVP, thrombin, and ATP."

Synthesis of [125I]ACT-CoA from [125I]ACTP and CoA was further confirmed by monitoring the release of one of the products, thiopyridone, at 343 nm and concurrent formation of [125I] ACT-CoA. Beef heart mitochondria were incubated in the presence of the 125I-CoA derivative with or without specific inhibitors and/or substrates of the ADP/ATP carrier, and immediately photolyzed for 5 s. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of the separated proteins revealed exclusive photolabeling of a 30-kDa protein in the absence of inhibitors of the carrier. This specific photolabeling of the 30-kDa protein was prevented in a concentration-dependent manner by either carboxyatractylate or palmitoyl-CoA (0.1-5 microM), two known inhibitors of the ADP/ATP carrier. ADP reduced the extent of photolabeling of the 30-kDa protein, but palmitic acid, free CoASH, and dinitrophenol were ineffective, indicating the specificity of the reaction. CoA photolabels may be useful in probing ligand and/or substrate binding sites and in determining the structure-function relationship of the ADP/ATP carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1492848568,"Abstract Stable azide complex of cyanogen bromide-modified met-myoglobin (metMb) was prepared and crystallized. The principal values and eigen vectors of g-tensor were determined by single-crystal EPR spectroscopy at 77 K: gxx = 1.50, gyy = 2.32, and gzz = 2.91. These g values were similar to those of tetrazole derivative rather than azide derivative of native metMbs, suggesting that tetrazole derivative might be formed from N-cyanoimidazole of distal histidyl residue via nucleophilic attack of azide ion by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The orientation of the maximal g value (gzz) of the novel product was found to deviate about 13 degrees from the heme normal of native aquometMb. Thus, the orientation of the heme plane might be altered in passing from native metMb to cyanogen bromide-mediated metmyoglobin. The present EPR results demonstrated that the modification of the histidyl residue at the heme distal side causes the changes in the stereochemical and electronic natures of the ligand binding to the heme."
