https://openalex.org/W2156737316,"Molecular networks guide the biochemistry of a living cell on multiple levels: Its metabolic and signaling pathways are shaped by the network of interacting proteins, whose production, in turn, is controlled by the genetic regulatory network. To address topological properties of these two networks, we quantified correlations between connectivities of interacting nodes and compared them to a null model of a network, in which all links were randomly rewired. We found that for both interaction and regulatory networks, links between highly connected proteins are systematically suppressed, whereas those between a highly connected and low-connected pairs of proteins are favored. This effect decreases the likelihood of cross talk between different functional modules of the cell and increases the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2055864348,"Many proteins associated with the plasma membrane are known to partition into submicroscopic sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich domains called lipid rafts, but the determinants dictating this segregation of proteins in the membrane are poorly understood. We suppressed the tendency of Aequorea fluorescent proteins to dimerize and targeted these variants to the plasma membrane using several different types of lipid anchors. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in living cells revealed that acyl but not prenyl modifications promote clustering in lipid rafts. Thus the nature of the lipid anchor on a protein is sufficient to determine submicroscopic localization within the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2080192596,"Climate variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) is dominated by the SH annular mode, a large-scale pattern of variability characterized by fluctuations in the strength of the circumpolar vortex. We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau."

An arbitrary evolution of its quantum state can be programmed with a series of microwave pulses, and a projective measurement of the state can be performed by a pulsed readout subcircuit. The measured quality factor of quantum coherence Qphi approximately 25,000 is sufficiently high that a solid-state quantum processor based on this type of circuit can be envisioned."

The bacteriophage, which formed the basis of the self-ordering system, were selected to have a specific recognition moiety for ZnS crystal surfaces. The bacteriophage were coupled with ZnS solution precursors and spontaneously evolved a self-supporting hybrid film material that was ordered at the nanoscale and at the micrometer scale into approximately 72-micrometer domains, which were continuous over a centimeter length scale. In addition, suspensions were prepared in which the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase behavior of the hybrid material was controlled by solvent concentration and by the use of a magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2016927884,"The sequences of the human chromosomes 21 and 22 indicate that there are approximately 770 well-characterized and predicted genes. In this study, empirically derived maps identifying active areas of RNA transcription on these chromosomes have been constructed with the use of cytosolic polyadenylated RNA obtained from 11 human cell lines. Oligonucleotide arrays containing probes spaced on average every 35 base pairs along these chromosomes were used. When compared with the sequence annotations available for these chromosomes, it is noted that as much as an order of magnitude more of the genomic sequence is transcribed than accounted for by the predicted and characterized exons."

We report that long nanotube strands, up to several centimeters in length, consisting of aligned single-walled nanotubes can be synthesized by the catalytic pyrolysis of n-hexane with an enhanced vertical floating technique. The long strands of nanotubes assemble continuously from arrays of nanotubes, which are intrinsically long."
https://openalex.org/W2131472300,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Transcriptional dysregulation has been implicated in HD pathogenesis. Here, we report that huntingtin interacts with the transcriptional activator Sp1 and coactivator TAFII130. Coexpression of Sp1 and TAFII130 in cultured striatal cells from wild-type and HD transgenic mice reverses the transcriptional inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor gene caused by mutant huntingtin, as well as protects neurons from huntingtin-induced cellular toxicity. Furthermore, soluble mutant huntingtin inhibits Sp1 binding to DNA in postmortem brain tissues of both presymptomatic and affected HD patients. Understanding these early molecular events in HD may provide an opportunity to interfere with the effects of mutant huntingtin before the development of disease symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W2054769042,"We report the generation and observation of coherent temporal oscillations between the macroscopic quantum states of a Josephson tunnel junction by applying microwaves with frequencies close to the level separation. Coherent temporal oscillations of excited state populations were observed by monitoring the junction's tunneling probability as a function of time. From the data, the lower limit of phase decoherence time was estimated to be about 5 microseconds."
https://openalex.org/W2037341321,"Many central neurons possess large acid-activated currents, yet their molecular identity is unknown. We found that eliminating the acid sensing ion channel (ASIC) abolished H(+)-gated currents in hippocampal neurons. Neuronal H(+)-gated currents and transient acidification are proposed to play a role in synaptic transmission. Investigating this possibility, we found ASIC in hippocampus, in synaptosomes, and in dendrites localized at synapses. Moreover, loss of ASIC impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. ASIC null mice had reduced excitatory postsynaptic potentials and NMDA receptor activation during high-frequency stimulation. Consistent with these findings, null mice displayed defective spatial learning and eyeblink conditioning. These results identify ASIC as a key component of acid-activated currents and implicate these currents in processes underlying synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory."

https://openalex.org/W2054674800,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most prevalent dominantly inherited genetic diseases of the nervous system. NF1 encodes a tumor suppressor whose functional loss results in the development of benign neurofibromas that can progress to malignancy. Neurofibromas are complex tumors composed of axonal processes, Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineurial cells, and mast cells. Through use of a conditional (cre/lox) allele, we show that loss of NF1 in the Schwann cell lineage is sufficient to generate tumors. In addition, complete NF1-mediated tumorigenicity requires both a loss of NF1 in cells destined to become neoplastic as well as heterozygosity in non-neoplastic cells. The requirement for a permissive haploinsufficient environment to allow tumorigenesis may have therapeutic implications for NF1 and other familial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2126142381,"We have recently proposed a center-periphery organization based on resolution needs, in which objects engaging in recognition processes requiring central-vision (e.g., face-related) are associated with center-biased representations, while objects requiring large-scale feature integration (e.g., buildings) are associated with periphery-biased representations. Here we tested this hypothesis by comparing the center-periphery organization with activations to five object categories: faces, buildings, tools, letter strings, and words. We found that faces, letter strings, and words were mapped preferentially within the center-biased representation. Faces showed a hemispheric lateralization opposite to that of letter strings and words. In contrast, buildings were mapped mainly to the periphery-biased representation, while tools activated both central and peripheral representations. The results are compatible with the notion that center-periphery organization allows the optimal allocation of cortical magnification to the specific requirements of various recognition processes."
https://openalex.org/W2052725031,"Extracts of the resin of the guggul tree (Commiphora mukul) lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels in humans. The plant sterol guggulsterone [4,17(20)-pregnadiene-3,16-dione] is the active agent in this extract. We show that guggulsterone is a highly efficacious antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by bile acids. Guggulsterone treatment decreases hepatic cholesterol in wild-type mice fed a high-cholesterol diet but is not effective in FXR-null mice. Thus, we propose that inhibition of FXR activation is the basis for the cholesterol-lowering activity of guggulsterone. Other natural products with specific biologic effects may modulate the activity of FXR or other relatively promiscuous nuclear hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2104010831,"CREB is critical for long-lasting synaptic and behavioral plasticity in invertebrates. Its role in the mammalian hippocampus is less clear. We have interfered with CREB family transcription factors in region CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. This impairs learning in the Morris water maze, which specifically requires the dorsal hippocampus, but not context conditioning, which does not. The deficit is specific to long-term memory, as shown in an object recognition task. Several forms of late-phase LTP are normal, but forskolin-induced and dopamine-regulated potentiation are disrupted. These experiments represent the first targeting of the dorsal hippocampus in genetically modified mice and confirm a role for CREB in hippocampus-dependent learning. Nevertheless, they suggest that some experimental forms of plasticity bypass the requirement for CREB."

This family consists of the fossils Archaefructus liaoningensis and A. sinensis sp. nov. Complete plants from roots to fertile shoots are known. Their age is a minimum of 124.6 million years from the Yixian Formation, Liaoning, China. They are a sister clade to all angiosperms when their characters are included in a combined three-gene molecular and morphological analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2172189627,"Introns interrupt almost every eukaryotic protein-coding gene, yet how the splicing apparatus interprets the genome during messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is poorly understood. We designed microarrays to distinguish spliced from unspliced RNA for each intron-containing yeast gene and measured genomewide effects on splicing caused by loss of 18 different mRNA processing factors. After accommodating changes in transcription and decay by using gene-specific indexes, functional relationships between mRNA processing factors can be identified through their common effects on spliced and unspliced RNA. Groups of genes with different dependencies on mRNA processing factors are also apparent. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions confirm the array-based finding that Prp17p and Prp18p are not dispensable for removal of introns with short branchpoint-to-3' splice site distances."
https://openalex.org/W1981306263,"Chemical dynamics trajectory simulations were used to study the atomic-level mechanisms of the OH- + CH3F --> CH3OH + F- SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction. The reaction dynamics, from the [OH...CH3...F]- central barrier to the reaction products, are simulated by ab initio direct dynamics. The reaction's potential energy surface has a deep minimum in the product exit channel arising from the CH3OH...F- hydrogen-bonded complex. Statistical theories of unimolecular reaction rates assume that the reactive system becomes trapped in this minimum and forms an intermediate, with random redistribution of its vibrational energy, but the majority of the trajectories (90%) avoided this potential energy minimum and instead dissociated directly to products. This finding is discussed in terms of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) and the relation between IVR and molecular structure. The finding of this study may be applicable to other reactive systems where there is a hierarchy of time scales for intramolecular motions and thus inefficient IVR."

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and cotransfection in HepG2 cells using wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides revealed that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) binds and transactivates those xenobiotic-responsive elements (ER6, DR3, and DR4) previously identified in CYP3A4, CYP2B6, andCYP2C9 promoters and shown to be targeted by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and/or the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Full VDR response of various CYP3A4 heterologous/homologous promoter-reporter constructs requires both the proximal ER6 and the distal DR3 motifs, as observed previously with rifampicin-activated PXR. Cotransfection of a CYP3A4 homologous promoter-reporter construct (including distal and proximal PXR-binding motifs) and of PXR or CAR expression vectors in HepG2 cells revealed the ability of these receptors to compete with VDR for transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4.

It consists of an everted repeat of the nuclear receptor half-site AGGTCA separated by 6 nucleotides (ER6); this element is necessary but not sufficient for full transactivation of the CYP3A4 promoter. Indeed, full PXR-mediated induction requires the presence of a second distal xenobiotic-responsive element (dPXRE), located between –7800 and −7200 (9Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This element is composite and consists of two direct repeats separated by 3 nucleotides (DR3), encompassing an ER6 motif. In contrast to PXR, CAR is sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus upon activation, notably in response to phenobarbital (6Zelko I. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several groups have identified a complex phenobarbital-responsive element module that consists of two nuclear receptor-binding sites (termed NR1 and NR2) and one nuclear factor 1 binding site (12Sueyoshi T.

In human CYP2B6, the phenobarbital-responsive element module is located between –1684 and –1733 and has been shown to bind to and be transactivated by CAR and by PXR (12Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T.

Previous reports revealed that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1α,25-(OH)2D3), the most active metabolite of vitamin D3, behaves as a transcriptional inducer ofCYP3A4 in the colic carcinoma Caco-2 cell line and in the human intestinal LS180 cell line (16Schmiedlin-Ren P.

Vitamin D3function is mediated through the vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1), which, after binding 1α,25-(OH)2D3 with high affinity, forms heterodimers with RXR (18Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Carlberg C. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 10-14PubMed Google Scholar, 20Carlberg C. Saurat J.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 82-86PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimer then binds to and transactivates the vitamin D receptor-responsive elements (VDREs) present in the regulatory region of target genes (21Kato S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The classical VDREs consist of a direct repeat of nuclear receptor half-sites separated by 3 nucleotides (DR3) (18Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the classical vitamin D-responsive organs, including the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland, vitamin D3-activated VDR plays a central role in the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone mineralization and resorption, inhibition of cell growth, and parathyroid hormone synthesis (22Brown A.J. Dusso A. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F157-F175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VDR is also expressed in many other non-classical vitamin D-responsive organs, including the liver, muscle, skin, immune system, pancreas, and brain, and in cancer cells (23Berger U. Wilson P. McClelland R.A. Colston K. Haussler M.R. Pike J.W. Coombes R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), in which it controls a number of biological processes, including immunomodulation, tissue regeneration, inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis, and cell differentiation (24Miyaguchi S. Watanabe T. Hepato-gastroenterology. 2000; 47: 468-472PubMed Google Scholar, 25Shany S. Levy Y. Lahav-Cohen M. Steroids. 2001; 66: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Walters M.R. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 719-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an exploratory part of this work, we found that 1α,25-(OH)2D3 is an inducer ofCYP3A4 in human hepatocytes, as previously observed by others in intestinal cell lines (16Schmiedlin-Ren P. Thummel K.E. Fisher J.M. Paine M.F. Lown K.S. Watkins P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Thummel K.E. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Thottassery J. Senn T. Lin Y. Ishizuka H. Kharasch E. Schuetz J. Schuetz E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We therefore thought that VDR might be able to target PXR- and/or CAR-responsive elements ofCYP3A4. We further reasoned that, if the hypothesis is correct, 1α,25-(OH)2D3 could be an inducer of other CYP genes controlled by these receptors. The data presented here show that 1α,25-(OH)2D3induces not only CYP3A4, but also CYP2B6 andCYP2C9 in primary human hepatocytes. In addition, we show that VDR is able to bind and transactivate different motifs recognized by xenobiotic-activated PXR and CAR in the promoters of theseCYP genes.

The CYP3A4 5′-flanking fragment (−262/+11) containing the proximal ER6 (pER6) element was generated by PCR from a previously isolated genomic clone (27Jounaidi Y. Guzelian P.S. Maurel P.

Human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, England) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfection of plasmid DNA was performed in single batches with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Transfections were performed using 100,000 cells, 250 ng of reporter plasmid, and 50 ng of pSG5-hVDR expression vector (provided by Dr. P. Balaguer, INSERM U439, Montpellier, France). For competition experiments, we used 500 ng of reporter plasmid and 100 ng of pSG5-hVDR expression vector. Cotransfection of human PXR or mouse CAR was performed using increasing concentrations (10, 50, 100, and 300 ng) of both expression vectors, and pSG5 empty vector was added to normalize the total concentration of transfected plasmid DNA. As an internal control of transfection, 25 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) was used in all experiments. After 16 h, the medium was changed, and fresh medium containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide or inducers was added. Cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) after 24 h of incubation, and cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described (11Pascussi J.-M.

Hepatocytes were prepared from liver lobectomy segments resected from adult patients for medically required purposes unrelated to our research program. Three different cultures from three different liver donors were made in this work: FT181 (a 51-year-old male who became an organ donor after a car accident; the liver was not transplanted because of the presence of a kidney tumor), FT187 (a 67-year-old male who underwent a liver lobectomy for metastasis of a colon tumor), and FT189 (a 48-year-old male who underwent a liver lobectomy for metastasis of a sigmoid colon tumor). Hepatocytes were prepared and cultured according to the previously published procedure (29Pichard L. Fabre I. Fabre G. Domergue J. Saint A.B. Mourad G. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1990; 18: 595-606PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pichard L. Fabre I. Daujat M. Domergue J. Joyeux H. Maurel P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1047-1055PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were plated onto 100-mm plastic dishes precoated with collagen at 10 × 106 cells/plate in a total volume of 6 ml of a hormonally and chemically defined medium consisting of a mixture of Williams' medium E and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1 by volume). Forty-eight hours after plating, cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 for an additional 24 h. Total RNA and protein were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of mRNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the RT reaction was then subjected to PCR. Quantification of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and GAPDH mRNAs was performed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals Light Cycler apparatus. For CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and GAPDH, the following program was used: denaturation at 95 °C for 8 min and 40 cycles of PCR consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 70 °C for 6 s, and extension at 72 °C for 12 s. In all cases, the quality of the PCR product was assessed by monitoring a fusion step. For CYP2C9, the same program was used, except for the annealing, which was performed at 60 °C. Forward and reverse primers were as follows, respectively: CYP3A4, 5′-CACAAACCGGAGGCCTTTTG-3′ and 5′-ATCCATGCTGTAGGCCCCAA-3′; GAPDH, 5′-GGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′; CYP2B6, 5′-GGCCATACGGGAGGCCCTTG-3′ and 5′-AGGGCCCCTTGGATTTCCG-3′; CYP2C9, 5′-TCCTATCATTGATTACTTCCCG-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGTGTTTTCCAAGC-3′; and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, 5′-CCCCGCGCTCTACCCGGTTCA-3′ and 5′-TGTGTGAGACAAAAGGTCCA-3′ (31Fujisawa K.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using VDR and RXR prepared by in vitro translation using a coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). Proteins were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 50,000 cpm of T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). The mixture was then submitted to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× buffer containing 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The following oligonucleotides were used either as radiolabeled probes or as competitors (the sense strand is shown, with hexanucleotides in boldface): CYP3A4-pER6, 5′-TAGAATATGAACTCAAAGGAGGTCAGTGAGT-3′; CYP3A-5′dDR3, 5′-GAATGAACTTGCTGACCCTCT-3′; CYP3A4–5′dDR3mutant, 5′-GAATCCCCA TGCTAATCT TCT-3′; CYP3A4-dER6, 5′-CCCTTGAAATCATGTCGGTTCAAGCA-3′; CYP2B6-DR4, 3′-ACTGTACTTTCCTGACCCTGAAGA-5′; CYP2C9-DR4, 5′-AACCAAACTCTTCTGACCTCTCAATCTAGTCAACTGGG-3′; and rat atrial natriuretic factor (rANF) VDRE, 5′-GTCAGAGGTCATGAAGGACATTACA-3′ (32Toell A. Polly P. Carlberg C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Anti-RXRα antibody (N197, sc 774X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for the “supershift” assays. Autoradiography was carried out by exposing the dried gel to Kodak X-AR film. Forty-eight hours after plating, hepatocytes were treated either with increasing concentrations (1–100 nm) of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 or, in parallel, with 10 μm rifampicin for 24 h. CYP mRNAs were then analyzed by both classical and real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the Light Cycler apparatus. In a preliminary series of experiments, we verified that hepatocytes responded as expected to 1α,25-(OH)2D3 in our culture model. For this purpose, the expression of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene, a gene known to be induced through VDR activation (31Fujisawa K. Umesono K. Kikawa Y. Shigematsu Y. Taketo A. Mayumi M. Inuzuka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was evaluated in response to increasing concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Expression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA as assessed by RT-PCR analysis was induced as expected. Analysis of the same RNA samples revealed that 1α,25-(OH)2D3 was a potent and concentration-dependent inducer of CYP3A4 mRNA and a modest inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 mRNAs, the maximum accumulation being reached at 10 nm (Fig. 1 ). Next, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the induction ratios (mRNA levels in treated cells compared with control cells) obtained from the analysis of three different cultures from three different liver donors. Induction ratios were as follows: 15 ± 2 for CYP3A4 mRNA, 3.5 ± 1 for CYP2B6 mRNA, and 2.6 ± 1 for CYP2C9 mRNA. In comparison, rifampicin induction ratios were 50 ± 15 for CYP3A4 mRNA, 10 ± 3 for CYP2B6 mRNA, and 3.3 ± 1.5 for CYP2C9 mRNA. This last gene was recently shown to be positively regulated by rifampicin and phenobarbital through PXR/CAR activation (28Gerbal-Chaloin S. Daujat M. Pascussi J.-M. Pichard-Garcia L. Vilarem M.-J. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.-M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar). GAPDH mRNA levels used as quality controls of RNA preparations were not affected significantly by 1α,25-(OH)2D3. The finding that 1α,25-(OH)2D3 induced CYP mRNAs within the nanomolar concentration range suggested a classical vitamin D3 receptor-mediated mechanism of induction. Although the consensus VDRE is a DR3 motif, this nuclear receptor has been shown to bind other motifs, including DR4, DR6, and inverted palindromes (32Toell A. Polly P. Carlberg C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,34Carlberg C. Proceedings of the 10th International Vitamin D Workshop.in: Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M. 1997: 268-275Google Scholar). We therefore suspected that CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 induction by 1α,25-(OH)2D3 could be mediated by VDR through the previously identified PXR- and CAR-responsive elements. The PXR-responsive elements of CYP3A4 consist of pER6 (−160), hereafter referred to as 3A4-pER6, and a distal enhancer (−7800/−7200) containing three nuclear receptor motifs, referred to hereafter as 3A4–5′dDR3, 3A4-dER6, and 3A4–3′dDR3 (Fig.2). These elements correspond to dNR1, dNR2, and dNR3, identified by Goodwin et al. (9Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), respectively. dNR1 and dNR3 have been reported to be the key elements conferring enhancer activity. Gel mobility shift assays were performed to determine whether VDR interacts with these elements. First, we checked the binding of the in vitro translated VDR-RXR heterodimer to a consensus VDRE oligonucleotide (rANF-DR3) by gel shift assay as shown in Fig.3 A. As expected, a retarded band was observed when both VDR and RXR were incubated with the target oligonucleotide (lane 4), but not when these receptors were incubated alone (lanes 2 and 3). Anti-RXR antibodies produced a supershift (lane 5), whereas an excess of unlabeled rANF-DR3 oligonucleotide suppressed the retarded band (data not shown). In addition, the specific VDR·RXR·DNA complex was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner when incubated in the presence of a 5- or 50-molar excess of unlabeled 3A4–5′dDR3 (lanes 8 and 9) or 3A4-pER6 (lanes 10and 11). This suggests that these elements can be targeted by the VDR-RXR heterodimer. In contrast, an excess of the 3A4-dER6 oligonucleotide did not produce any suppression of the VDR·RXR·VDRE complex (lanes 6 and 7). In the next series of experiments, we used the same assay to investigate the binding of VDR to both the 3A4–5′dDR3 and 3A4-pER6 oligonucleotides. As expected, no complex was observed when the probes were incubated with VDR or RXR alone (Fig. 3, B, lanes 2 and 3; and C, lane 1). In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 3 A, a retarded band was observed when 3A4–5′dDR3 (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) or 3A4-pER6 (Fig. 3 C, lane 2) was incubated in the presence of the VDR·RXR complex, and anti-RXR antibodies produced a supershift of the band (Fig. 3, B,lane 5; and C, lane 3). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by competition experiments using 10- and 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotides, including consensus rANF-DR3 and 3A4-pER6 (Fig. 3, B,lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 8 and9, respectively; and C, lanes 4 and5). A 51-bp sequence termed the phenobarbital-responsive element has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for phenobarbital induction of the mouseCyp2B10 gene (35Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of variousCYP2B phenobarbital-responsive elements revealed the presence of two conserved imperfect DR4 motifs (NR1 and NR2) that appear to be essential for a full response to phenobarbital. In the human CYP2B6 gene, these elements are oriented in opposite directions with respect to those in the mouse and rat genes and are located in the –1733/–1684 region (12Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). They are hereafter referred to as 2B6–3′DR4 and 2B6–5′DR4, respectively. Recently, we identified a functional CAR-responsive element in the –1856/−1783 region of human CYP2C9 (28Gerbal-Chaloin S. Daujat M. Pascussi J.-M. Pichard-Garcia L. Vilarem M.-J. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of an imperfect DR4 motif, hereafter referred to as 2C9-DR4. This element was shown to bind to and be transactivated by CAR as well as by PXR, albeit to a lower extent. As shown in Fig. 4, the VDR-RXR heterodimer efficiently bound both the 2C9-DR4 and 2B6–3′DR4 motifs as assessed by gel mobility shift assay. This binding was observed only in the presence of the heterodimerization partner RXR, and the specificity of the interaction was confirmed by competition experiments using 10- and 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled consensus rANF-DR3 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lanes 4, 5,11, and 12). Note, however, that the binding of the VDR-RXR heterodimer to 2C9-DR4 seems to be of much lower affinity compared with the binding to the other CYP3A4 andCYP2B6 PXR/CAR elements. In sum, these observations show that the VDR-RXR heterodimer binds to the major PXR/CAR-responsive elements of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, andCYP2C9. Transactivation of the PXR-responsive elements ofCYP3A4 (shown to bind to the VDR-RXR heterodimer) by 1α,25-(OH)2D3-activated VDR was analyzed by transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells. Cells were cotransfected with the various CYP3A4-specific heterologous and homologous promoter-reporter plasmids and with the VDR expression plasmid or the empty expression plasmid as a control. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h, and reporter gene activities were measured. The results are shown in Fig.5. 1α,25-(OH)2D3 strongly increased the transcriptional activity of the heterologous promoter constructs containing 3A4–5′dDR3 and 3A4-pER6 (by factors of 12 and 40, respectively) in a concentration-dependent manner (the maximum being reached at 1 nm) (Fig. 5, A andB).

The finding that SREBP processing is controlled by different lipids in mammals and flies (sterols and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively) suggests that an essential function of SREBP is to monitor cell membrane composition and to adjust lipid synthesis accordingly."

We show that the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system that mediates endocrine and behavioral responses to stress plays a role in the control of long-term alcohol drinking. In mice lacking a functional CRH1 receptor, stress leads to enhanced and progressively increasing alcohol intake. The effect of repeated stress on alcohol drinking behavior appeared with a delay and persisted throughout life. It was associated with an up-regulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR2B. Alterations in the CRH1 receptor gene and adaptional changes in NR2B subunits may constitute a genetic risk factor for stress-induced alcohol drinking and alcoholism."

It is one of the key causes of life-threatening disease such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis (1Mufson M.A. Mandell G.L. Douglas R.G., Jr. Bennett J.E. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Levingstone, New York1990Google Scholar). It also causes less threatening diseases that are, however, very prevalent like otitis media and sinusitis (2Stool S.E. Field M.J. Pediatr. Infect. Dis.

Pneumococci interact with the host and its tissues through the surface sugars (capsule) and a variety of usually surface-exposed protein molecules. These interactions are essential for the full pathogenicity of these bacteria and are likely involved in the disease-causing processes. The proteins known to be involved in this interaction include, among others, hyaluronate lyase (3Berry A.M. Lock R.A. Thomas S.M. Rajan D.P. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lock R.A. Paton J.C. Hansman D. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 5: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), pneumolysin (5Paton J.C.

S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL)1 primarily degrades hyaluronan (HA), the predominant polysaccharide component of animal and human connective tissues and the nervous system, into unsaturated disaccharide units as the end products (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cells in the connective tissues are embedded in the strikingly viscoelastic HA matrix. Hyaluronan is a polymeric glycan composed of linear repeats of a few hundred to as many as 20,000 or more disaccharide units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. The glycosidic linkage present within the disaccharide unit is β-1,3, whereas the disaccharide units are connected with the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage. The HA metabolism seems to be more significant than the metabolism of other polysaccharides in vivo due to the large turnover of this sugar. In human, one-third of the HA (about 5 g) is turned over daily (10McCourt P.A.G. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rapid turnover rate facilitates the use of HA and its degradation products in many physiological processes, such as cell differentiation and development (11Toole B.P. Goldberg R.L. Chi-Rosso G. Underhill C.B. Orkin R.W. Trelstad R.C. The Role of Extracellular Matrix in Development. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar), cell proliferation, recognition, locomotion, and the immunological responses (12Laurent T.C. Fraser R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Enzymes of either mammalian (including host or human enzymes) or bacterial origin degrade HA at the β-1,4-linkage exerting the eno- and exogenous pressures on the host. Bacteria secrete hyaluronate lyases to degrade HA, and these enzymes usually produce unsaturated di-, tetra- (HA4), or hexasaccharides (HA6). The mechanism of this degradation by Streptococcus species hyaluronate lyase, which produces primarily unsaturated disaccharides of HA, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose, as the end products, was recently proposed and involves the elimination reaction introducing an unsaturated bond to the product (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mammals, on the other hand, express hyaluronidases to degrade HA and to produce relatively longer oligosaccharides (13Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The detailed atomic mechanism of HA degradation by mammal hyaluronidases is still largely unknown due, in part, to the lack of structural information. This process likely relies on the displacement mechanism based on hydrolysis, similar to that of cellulases, to degrade the HA substrate (13Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mammalian hyaluronidases (mainly bovine hyaluronidase) are, however, widely used in clinics, for example as an additive to the local anesthesia for the fast spreading and penetration of medications through tissues (14Courtiss E.H.

Briefly, the mechanism of catalysis, termed proton acceptance and donation, involves a five-step process involving neutralization of the carboxylate of a glucuronic moiety, extraction of a proton from C-5 followed by a double bond formation in the glucuronate and breaking of the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage. Additional comparison to other enzymes degrading glycans likeStreptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase (19Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol.

Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we report the structures of the S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase complexes with its substrates, the tetra- and hexasaccharide units of hyaluronan, and we discuss their implications for the mechanism of action of the enzyme. The SpnHL Y408F mutant cloning, overexpression in Escherichia coli (pMJJ004), and purification were reported previously (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol and stored at −80 °C until their use. The tetra- and hexasaccharide substrates were also obtained as described previously (17Kelly S.J. Taylor K.B., Li, S. Jedrzejas M.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To prevent degradation they were stored frozen at −80 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, until their use. The crystals of Y408F mutant version of SpnHL were obtained using the same conditions as for the native enzyme crystals (100 mmsodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0, 2.9 m ammonium sulfate) but with the addition of 5 mm EDTA (23Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Crystallization of Y408F mutant enzyme was accomplished using the vapor diffusion hanging drop method in 24-well Linbro culture plates using equal volumes of the protein sample and the reservoir solution (2 μl of each) at 22 °C (24-Google Scholar, 25McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Molecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1999Google Scholar). The protein and reservoir solution were mixed and equilibrated against 1.0 ml of reservoir solution. Diffraction quality rectangular block shaped crystals of Y408F (0.5 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm) were grown within several days. The crystals of Y408F SpnHL were then soaked at room temperature with 20 mm tetra- and hexasaccharide substrates (both in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0) for 10 h directly before the x-ray diffraction data collection. The crystal soaking solution contained the crystallization conditions (100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0) with increased concentration of the precipitation agent, ammonium sulfate, to 3.2 m. The crystal was cryo-protected using the same conditions as for the native crystals (23Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and flash freezing them at −170 °C in a nitrogen flow using a Cryostream Cooler (Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The diffraction data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation at the wavelength of 1.0 Å at the 19-BM beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory, Advanced Photon Source, Structural Biology Center using an Oxford 3 × 3 charged-coupled device detector. The diffraction limits of the crystals were 1.52- and 2.0-Å resolution for the tetra- and hexasaccharide complexes, respectively. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The crystals of complexes were isomorphous to the native ones.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was used as the model for the complex structure solution. The Rfree flag was assigned to 1 (1,249 reflections) and 2% (1,205 reflections) reflections for the tetra- and hexasaccharide complexes, respectively, to validate the refinement progress (27Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Initially, a round of rigid body refinements using only the model was performed using X-PLOR (28Brunger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The Tyr408 was manually mutated to Phe using the O program (29Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Refinements progress using program X-PLOR with the positional and simulated annealing protocols (28Brunger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The structures were refined against 124,927 and 60,437 reflections for the tetra- and hexasaccharide complexes, respectively, and utilizing all data from 50 Å to the highest resolution available and a 2ς(F) cut-off (Table I). The electron density for the substrates was then clearly identified, and the incorporation of the substrates into this density was followed. The topologies and parameter files for both substrates were manually created following our earlier studies with disaccharide substrates and carefully corrected to reflect ideal stereochemical values (16Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additional refinements including individual restrained B-factor refinements, inspection, and manipulation of structure on graphics using O together with incorporation of water molecules placed into 3ς peaks in ς-A weighted F o − F c maps following standard criteria were performed. After refinement, water molecules whose positions were not supported by electron density, at 1ς contouring, in ς-A weighted 2F o −F c maps were deleted. A variety of stereochemical (31Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and other analyses (29Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar, 32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was periodically performed in order to locate possible model errors. The tetra- and hexasaccharide substrate molecules and 685 and 590 waters were incorporated, respectively, into the final structures of these two complexes. Final refinement parameters are reported in Table I. The CONCOORD program (33de Groot B.L. van Aalten D.M. Scheek R.M. Amadei A. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 34de Groot B.L. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) generates uncorrelated protein structures fulfilling a set of upper and lower interatomic distance limits. These limits are derived from experimental structures through measurement of interatomic distances and prediction of the interaction strength of the involved atoms. Thus, the separation of strongly interacting atoms was allowed to vary only slightly from the observed value, whereas weaker interactions have more relaxed limits. Special consideration was given to interacting atoms within the same secondary structure element in order to ensure the preservation of secondary structure. Although detailed aspects of dynamic variation may not be reproduced by this method, good qualitative agreement has been found between the results of the conventional molecular dynamics and CONCOORD simulations (33de Groot B.L. van Aalten D.M. Scheek R.M. Amadei A. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 34de Groot B.L. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J. J. Mol.

Trajectories containing 500 conformations were calculated. The essential dynamics (ED) was performed by Gromacs 3.0 (36Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7260) Google Scholar, 37Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). This method is based on the diagonalization of the covariance matrix of atomic fluctuations, which yields a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (38Amadei A. Linssen A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). The eigenvectors indicate directions in a 3N dimensional space (whereN = number of atoms) and describe concerted fluctuations of the atoms, constructed such that the amount of fluctuation along a small number of eigenvectors is maximized. The eigenvalues reflect the magnitude of the fluctuation along with the respective eigenvectors. The central hypothesis of this method is that the motions along the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues are essential for describing the function. The motion along any desired eigenvector can be inspected by projecting the frames from the trajectory onto that eigenvector. The figures were prepared using Ribbons (39Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), Grasp (40Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar), O (29Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), and Molscript (41Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The nativeS. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase enzyme used in our studies was active in the crystallized form. When crystal was combined with the hyaluronan substrates, the degradation to disaccharides was observed. This led to three-dimensional structures for the complexes identical to that of the complex with the disaccharide product reported earlier (16Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The presence in crystals of EDTA, to chelate divalent cations such as calcium, which are required for full enzyme activity, was not sufficient to totally prevent substrate degradation by the enzyme (data not shown). The use of an inactive mutant of the enzyme was, therefore, necessary to obtain complexes of the hyaluronan-derived substrates larger than disaccharide HA with the enzyme. Our earlier studies (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) showed that the Y408F mutant of the enzyme is essentially inactive, and for this reason this mutant form of the enzyme was chosen for our studies. Indeed, the tetra- and hexasaccharide HA substrates were not degraded by the enzyme during complex formation in the crystals. The Y408F mutant enzyme consisted of residues Ala168 to Gln892 of the full-length protein and a C-terminal His6 tag engineered for the ease of purification (22Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The tetra- and hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrates were chosen because our earlier modeling studies (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggested that they should fit entirely within the catalytic cleft of the enzyme and not interfere with the crystallization process. These truncated hyaluronan substrates were produced in milligram quantities from a human umbilical cord hyaluronan by a controlled degradation with Streptomyces hyaluroliticus hyaluronate lyase as reported previously (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Park Y. Cho S. Linhardt R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

This enzyme is an eliminase and produces tetra- and hexasaccharides with an unsaturated uronic acid at their non-reducing end as the final degradation products. These products were identified using ion spray mass spectrometry experiments. The crystals of the inactive Y408F mutant form of the enzyme were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method and essentially the original crystallization condition of the native enzyme reported previously (23Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The crystals of the complexes were obtained by soaking the Y408F mutant enzyme crystals with 20 mm tetra- and hexasaccharides of HA for a relatively short time directly before the freezing the crystals and/or diffraction data collection. The best soaking time was determined to be 10 h. The diffraction data were collected and processed, and structures were solved and refined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data in TableI show well refined structures with excellent stereochemistry. In a Ramachandran plot (31Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a majority of the residues for the tetra- and hexasaccharide complexes are located in the most favored areas and none in the disallowed or generously allowed areas. These crystal structures were solved at 1.52- and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 1). The tetrasaccharide complex structure contains residues Lys171to Lys889, and three N-terminal residues and three C-terminal residues together with the C-terminal His6 tag were not seen in the electron density. For the hexasaccharide complex one additional residue on each end of the molecule was partially located in the electron density maps and was modeled as alanine. The electron density was very clear for the entire structure of both complexes, including the substrate molecules, with the exception of the very N and C termini of the enzyme where disorder was evident (Fig.2). The structure of the complex with the tetrasaccharide contained 685 ordered water molecules, whereas that of hexasaccharide includes 590 water molecules in addition to protein and substrate molecules. For both substrates, there was only one substrate molecule bound per molecule of the enzyme.Figure 2Electron density maps for the substrate molecules in the structure of their complexes with the enzyme.

Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein molecules are built from two structural domains connected only by one short and flexible linker peptide consisting from 11 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The structural domains are the N-terminal α-helical domain (α-domain) and the C-terminal β-sheet domain (β-domain). The α-domain is composed of 13 helices arranged in a α5/α5-barrel structure (Fig. 1). The larger end of this barrel is shaped as a deep and elongated cleft, which faces the β-domain. The β-domain is primarily composed of five anti-parallel β-sheet structures forming a β-sandwich. A part of this domain is in close proximity to the cleft present in the α-domain. However, its contribution to the shape of the cleft is minimal and restricted to two loops between the β-sheets of the β-domain, which contribute to the shape of a part of one edge of the cleft (Fig. 1). The cleft contains the substrate-binding site and catalytic residues. The detailed description of the native structure has been reported elsewhere (9Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The structures of both tetra- and hexasaccharide HA"

Although it is known that methionine oxidation in the protein active site results in a loss of biological activity, there is little specific knowledge regarding the reactivity of its unpaired thiol, Cys-232. In this study, the thiol-modifying reagent NBD-Cl (7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) was used to label peroxide-modified α1-antitrypsin and demonstrate that the Cys-232in vitro oxidation pathway begins with a stable sulfenic acid intermediate and is followed by the formation of sulfinic and cysteic acid in successive steps. pH-dependent reactivity with hydrogen peroxide showed that Cys-232 has a pK a of 6.86 ± 0.05, a value that is more than 1.5 pH units lower than that of a typical protein thiol. pH-induced conformational changes in the region surrounding Cys-232 were also examined and indicate that mildly acidic conditions induce a conformation that enhances Cys-232 reactivity. In summary, this work provides new insights into α1-antitrypsin reactivity in oxidizing environments and shows that a unique structural environment renders its unpaired thiol, Cys-232, its most reactive amino acid.

Powell M.F. Shire S.J. Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems. 1993; 10: 307-377PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation is one of the most prevalent forms of chemical modification, and the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, are susceptible to modification by a wide array of oxidants (1Cleland J.L. Powell M.F. Shire S.J. Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems. 1993; 10: 307-377PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, oxidation of these residues can be beneficial for modulation of biological activity. In vitro, however, oxidation is aberrant, and in the case of proteins produced for therapeutic purposes can lead to the degradation of an otherwise highly valuable and useful product. Therefore, it is important to understand amino acid reactivity not only within the context of physiological functioning but also within the context of in vitro stability.α1-Antitrypsin is the archetypal member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of plasma protease inhibitors (2Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Other members of this medically and biologically important family include antithrombin III, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, C1-inhibitor, and α1-antichymotrypsin (3Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). α1-Antitrypsin, which contains nine methionine residues and a single unpaired cysteine, has a primary physiological role of regulating the activity of human neutrophil elastase, a serine protease involved in the degradation of connective tissue components (4Ossanna P.J. Test S.T. Matheson N.R. Regiani S. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This protease inhibitor is exposed to mildly oxidizing conditions while circulating in the blood plasma and to a greater extent at sites of inflammation where its activity is essential for mitigating the extent of proteolytic tissue damage that may accompany the inflammatory response.Oxidation of either methionine 351 (Met-351) or methionine 358 (Met-358), the two active-site methionine residues of α1-antitrypsin, results in a significant loss of inhibitory activity against neutrophil elastase (5Taggart C.

Although the unquestionable physiological importance of methionine oxidation in α1-antitrypsin has led to intense study of this particular oxidation reaction (5Taggart C. Cervantes-Laurean D. Kim G.

Cooney C.L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 942: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, this residue is reactive under physiological conditions with proteins and small molecules such as cysteine, glutathione, myeloma immunglobulin light chains (11Laurell C.B. Immunochemistry. 1970; 7: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Laurell C.B. Thulin E.

Acta. 2000; 1477: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, neither disulfide-linked α1-antitrypsin dimers nor disulfide-linked complexes between α1-antitrypsin and albumin, the most abundant free-thiol-containing protein in human blood plasma, have been found (15Tyagi S.C. Simon S.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10584-10590Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it is clear that in environments containing oxidants and sterically compatible disulfides, Cys-232 is capable of undergoing many forms of covalent modification, the significance of which is only beginning to be elucidated (14Miyamoto Y. Akaike T. Maeda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Scott L.J. Russell G.I. Nixon N.B. Dawes P.T. Mattey D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Although modification of Cys-232 may have physiological implications and is extremely important with regard to in vitrodegradation, there have been no studies aimed at understanding the biochemical basis for the reactivity of this residue. However, there is an existing knowledge base pertaining to cysteine reactivity from which to begin an investigation. Recent work has described the role of sulfenic acid, the initial oxidation product formed when cysteine is exposed to an oxidant, in enzyme catalysis and redox regulation (17Claiborne A. Mallett T.C. Yeh J.I. Luba J. Parsonage D. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2001; 58: 215-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D.

Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). These studies have been facilitated by the development of analytical techniques capable of identifying this unstable oxidation intermediate (21Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this report, the Cys-232 oxidation pathway is determined by these and other techniques that exploit the biochemical properties of cysteine oxidation products. After establishing the Cys-232 oxidation pathway, its pKa and pH-dependent local structural environment are examined. These studies show that α1-antitrypsin possesses a unique structural environment around Cys-232 that confers a high degree of reactivity across a broad pH range. Furthermore, it is shown that the α1-antitrypsin unpaired thiol is the protein's most oxidation susceptible residue.DISCUSSIONA challenge in the biotechnology industry is the development of strategies for the stabilization of therapeutic proteins against chemical modification. However, a detailed understanding of these reactions is important not only in biotechnology but also in biology and medicine. A relevant example is the oxidation of α1-antitrypsin. Although it is established that methionine oxidation is the modification reaction of greatest significance within the context of the physiological functioning of α1-antitrypsin, the protein also contains a highly reactive cysteine residue, Cys-232. A detailed understanding of the reactivity of this residue is necessary to fully understand the oxidation susceptibility of α1-antitrypsin in oxidizing environments. In this study we employed a number of techniques that exploit the biochemical properties of Cys-232 oxidation products to achieve this goal.In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the first step in the Cys-232 oxidation pathway is the reversible formation of sulfenic acid. Reaction of oxidized α1-antitrypsin with NBD-Cl was used to determine that sulfenic acid is a relatively stable Cys-232 oxidation state. This sulfenic acid intermediate was not stable, however, in the presence of the high peroxide concentrations required to generate significant amounts of methionine oxidation in α1-antitrypsin (10Griffiths S.W. Cooney C.L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 942: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rather, it was quickly oxidized to sulfinic and cysteic acid, both of which are irreversible thiol oxidation products that alter the net surface charge of the protein (Fig. 3). This observation is significant because it is active site methionine oxidation and not cysteine oxidation that has been found in α1-antitrypsin recovered from inflammatory effusions (39Wong P.S. Travis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and lung secretions of smokers (8Carp H. Miller F. Hoidal J.R. Janoff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This raises the question of why in vitro experiments under conditions that are sufficient to oxidize methionine yield cysteine oxidation products that have not been observed in α1-antitrypsin recovered from highly oxidizing physiological environments. Discussion of this question requires consideration of reversible oxidation mechanisms found in physiological settings.Sulfenic acids are highly reactive not only as nucleophiles but also as electrophiles (18Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, a cysteine that has been oxidized to sulfenic acid under highly oxidizing conditions can be maintained in a reversible oxidation state by subsequent reaction with a reduced thiol. Although the possibility of finding reduced thiols under oxidizing conditions seems unlikely, this is the case in the airway lining fluid of the lungs where α1-antitrypsin is known to incur extensive methionine oxidation (8Carp H. Miller F. Hoidal J.R. Janoff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The concentration of reduced GSH in the lungs of smokers is maintained at a concentration of ∼775 μm, more than twice the concentration for non-smokers and more than 250 times the concentration of GSH found in blood plasma (40Cantin A.M. North S.L. Hubbard R.C. Crystal R.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 63: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Because GSH is known to react with sulfenic acids extremely quickly, oxidation of Cy232 to sulfenic acid in the lungs is likely to be followed by immediate reaction with GSH to yield a stable glutathione adduct (Cys–S–SG). Glutathiolation via a sulfenic acid intermediate in stress and signaling pathways is well established (20Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and, although not applicable to the in vitro studies presented here, may indeed be relevant to lung physiology.Regardless of whether in vivo or in vitrooxidation is considered, thiolate stabilization and local protein structure are the factors that determine the reactivity of Cys-232. We evaluated these parameters by measuring the rate at which Cys-232 is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide between pH 5 and 10. Kinetics of the reaction between Cys-232 and hydrogen peroxide were used to determine the pKa of Cys-232 and the intrinsic bimolecular rate constant for its reaction with hydrogen peroxide (k S−). The pKa , 6.86 ± 0.05, is ∼1.5 pH units lower than that of a typical protein thiol (∼8.5) (41Gilbert H.F. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. 63. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 69-172Google Scholar). Because this depressed pKa is clearly the major determinant of the reactivity of Cys-232, it is important to identify the means by which the thiolate is stabilized.There are a number of structural interactions capable of lowering the pKa of a thiol. One is ion pairing with a histidine residue. This type of interaction lowers the pKa values of papain (42Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 47: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), thiosubtilisin (43Polgar L. Halasz P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and glutathionine S-transferase (44Lo Bello M. Parker M.W. Desideri A. Polticelli F. Falconi M. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19033-19038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by up to 5 pH units. His-231 is next to Cys-232 in the linear sequence of α1-antitrypsin, but its side chain is not within 5 Å of the Cys-232 side chain in any x-ray structures. The thioredoxin fold has been shown to use elements of protein secondary structure to provide a decrease in thiol pKa (45Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For this to occur, however, the cysteine residue must be located at or near a helical dipole (45Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and this is not the case for Cys-232. Hydrogen bond formation, such as that observed for Cys-282 in muscle creatine kinase (46Wang P.F. McLeish M.J. Kneen M.M. Lee G. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11698-11705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), can also lower the pKa of a thiol, but once again, this does not appear to be possible for Cys-232. With these possibilities ruled out we considered electrostatic effects brought about by the presence of nearby positive charges.Analysis of the crystal structure of α1-antitrypsin shows that lysine residues 233, 234, and 274 are proximal to Cys-232 (Fig.7 B) and clearly provide a positively charged electrostatic environment. Thus, we suggest that it is the presence of these positively charged residues, and the absence of any nearby negatively charged residues, that provides Cys-232 with the thiolate stabilization required for a high degree of reactivity across the neutral pH range.Because of thiolate stabilization, Cys-232 is expected to be more reactive at low pH than most protein thiols. However, Fig.5 B shows that the residue is 2–3 times more reactive between pH 5 and 6 than would be expected solely on the basis of thiol ionization (see Equation 1), and this deviation is not within the limits of experimental error. Therefore, Equation 1 provides a reasonable estimation for pKa determination, but does not fully describe the pH-dependent reactivity of Cys-232 with hydrogen peroxide.Cysteine labeling with the fluorescent probe IANBD showed no sign of pH-dependent conformational changes that might affect reactivity under neutral or alkaline conditions (Fig. 6). This suggests that the structure around Cys-232 is not significantly altered by high pH. In contrast, IANBD labeling clearly indicated that the local environment of Cys-232 is altered at slightly acidic pH. At pH 5, the IANBD probe attached to Cys-232 is positioned in a more hydrophobic, less solvent accessible region than it is between pH 6 and 9.The extent to which IANBD is able to interact with the hydrophobic interior of a protein is assessed by changes in its fluorescence. The blue shift and reduced fluorescence quenching observed for IANBD-labeled α1-antitrypsin exchanged into pH 5 buffer are indicative of increased accessibility of the NBD fluorophore to the protein interior, suggesting a more open conformation in the immediate proximity of Cys-232 at slightly acidic pH (Fig. 7). This suggests that the reactivity of Cys-232 at acidic pH is enhanced by increased side-chain solvent accessibility. Between pH 5 and 5.5, however, Cys-232 is more reactive than even a completely solvent-exposed thiol with a pKa of 6.86. Therefore, it seems that conformational changes at acidic pH may affect the local electrostatic environment of Cys-232 as well. It was shown that such a structurally mediated change in local electrostatic environment is the basis of the pH-dependent ionization and reactivity of cysteine residues 31 and 32 in monomeric seminal ribonuclease (31Parente A. Merrifield B. Geraci G. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the case of Cys-232, acid-induced reorientation of the residues that determine its observed pKa , which we believe to be Lys-233, Lys-234, and Lys-274, alter its local electrostatic environment in a manner that further stabilizes the thiolate.Combined with our studies of methionine oxidation in α1-antitrypsin (47Griffiths S.W. Cooney C.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6245-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the work presented here allows us to conclude that Cys-232 is α1-antitrypsin's most oxidation-susceptible amino acid between pH 5 and 10, which is the pH range compatible with the global structural stability of the protein (48Saklatvala J. Wood G.C. White D.D. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Even when thiolate neutralization is maximized at pH 5, Cys-232 remains ∼20 times more reactive with hydrogen peroxide than the most reactive methionine, Met-358. Although the previously discussed mechanism for sulfenic acid reduction by small molecule thiols may aid in preventing irreversible oxidation under physiological conditions, the inability to suppress ionization by low pH makes Cys-232 a significant liability with regard to in vitro stabilization. Indeed, it has been necessary to use low temperature in conjunction with sub-neutral pH to prevent Cys-232 oxidation during bioprocessing studies.In summary, we present here a quantitative analysis of cysteine oxidation in α1-antitrypsin that provides new insights into the reactivity of the protein's unpaired thiol, Cys-232. These insights have been applied to the crystal structure of α1-antitrypsin in an effort to understand the structural factors that influence reactivity and to benefit future studies regarding the role that this residue may play in physiological functioning. We have also investigated the relationship between pH and Cys-232 oxidation and found that an unusually low pKa of 6.86 and altered conformation at acidic pH makes cysteine the most reactive of α1-antitrypsin's sulfur-containing amino acids. Therefore, even though the protein contains exposed and reactive methionine residues, cysteine oxidation is far more likely to occur in oxidizing environments. Because the results presented here are all directly related to aspects of the structure of α1-antitrypsin, this study should be useful not only to future work with α1-antitrypsin, but also to the consideration of cysteine oxidation in other medically important proteins with complex structural biochemistries. A common problem in the biotechnology industry is the degradation of protein therapeutics by chemical modification (1Cleland J.L. Powell M.F. Shire S.J. Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems. 1993; 10: 307-377PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation is one of the most prevalent forms of chemical modification, and the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, are susceptible to modification by a wide array of oxidants (1Cleland J.L. Powell M.F. Shire S.J. Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems. 1993; 10: 307-377PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, oxidation of these residues can be beneficial for modulation of biological activity. In vitro, however, oxidation is aberrant, and in the case of proteins produced for therapeutic purposes can lead to the degradation of an otherwise highly valuable and useful product. Therefore, it is important to understand amino acid reactivity not only within the context of physiological functioning but also within the context of in vitro stability. α1-Antitrypsin is the archetypal member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of plasma protease inhibitors (2Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Other members of this medically and biologically important family include antithrombin III, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, C1-inhibitor, and α1-antichymotrypsin (3Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). α1-Antitrypsin, which contains nine methionine residues and a single unpaired cysteine, has a primary physiological role of regulating the activity of human neutrophil elastase, a serine protease involved in the degradation of connective tissue components (4Ossanna P.J. Test S.T. Matheson N.R. Regiani S. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This protease inhibitor is exposed to mildly oxidizing conditions while circulating in the blood plasma and to a greater extent at sites of inflammation where its activity is essential for mitigating the extent of proteolytic tissue damage that may accompany the inflammatory response. Oxidation of either methionine 351 (Met-351) or methionine 358 (Met-358), the two active-site methionine residues of α1-antitrypsin, results in a significant loss of inhibitory activity against neutrophil elastase (5Taggart C.

Yet, the detailed molecular events remain unknown.Temporins represent a family of cationic, 10–13-residue-long antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skin of Rana temporaria (red frog), found in many regions of central Europe (12Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Temporins are related to peptides isolated from wasp venoms (13Argiolas A. Pisano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10106-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which have both hemolytic and chemotactic activities. Most temporins and in particular those containing a net positive charge are active against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (12Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Temporins induce the release of liposome-entrapped fluorescent probes, confirming direct interaction with lipid bilayers (14Mangoni M.L. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Mignogna G. Bozzi A. Barra D. Simmaco M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the structural changes in the bilayer, possible specific interactions with lipids, and the location of temporins in phospholipid membranes remain poorly understood. In our previous study, we could show that temporins B and L readily insert into lipid monolayers and that the intercalation was enhanced by increasing contents of the negatively charged bacterial phospholipid PG1 in the membranes (11Zhao H. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Simmaco M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4425-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Likewise, both peptides increased acyl chain order and induced lipid segregation in binary bilayers, composed of PG and PC.Several studies have revealed common features in most antimicrobial peptides to be an amphipathic character and a net positive charge (for a review, see Ref. 15Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Bacterial lipid membranes with net negative charge are thought to represent the putative molecular targets for the antimicrobial peptides (2Matsuzaki K. Harada M. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Matsuzaki K. Nakayama M. Fukui M. Otaka A. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Bessho K. Miyajima K.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5365-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Accordingly, several of the antimicrobial peptides preferentially bind to anionic lipids (2Matsuzaki K. Harada M. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Matsuzaki K. Nakayama M. Fukui M. Otaka A. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Bessho K.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14504-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This could provide a potential mechanism for microbial specificity, since most of the anionic lipids of mammalian membranes are sequestered on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (18Op den Kamp J.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), whereas in microbial membranes they are exposed to the external medium. In this study, we used liposomes composed of zwitterionic 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC), acidic phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), and cholesterol to study the membrane association of temporin L. Temporin L is the only temporin described so far containing a single tryptophan residue in its sequence (FVQWFSKFLGRIL-NH2), thus allowing us to use fluorescence spectroscopy to study its association with bilayers. Analysis of the emission spectra and fluorescence quenching of temporin L was used to characterize peptide-membrane interactions and to investigate the topology of this peptide in liposomes. Depth-dependent quenching of fluorescence by phosphatidylcholines brominated at different positions along the acyl chains (Br2-PCs) provides a sensitive technique to determine the depth of the Trp residue in bilayers (19Breukink E. van Kraaij C. van Dalen A. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. de Kruijff B. Kuipers O.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8153-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,20Jiang H. Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16963-16973Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and was used to study the location of temporin L in phospholipid liposomes. The structure, orientation, and depth of penetration of temporin L into membranes provided insight into the mode of its action and the effect of different lipids on its function and selectivity.DISCUSSIONThe characteristics of quenching of the Trp residue of temporin L by acrylamide and brominated phospholipid in the presence of SOPC liposomes demonstrate that this peptide inserts in part into the hydrophobic lipid phase of the bilayer. The fluorescence intensities of temporin L decrease upon its transfer from the buffer into a SOPC membrane. Temporin L could aggregate upon binding to SOPC LUVs. Accordingly, in these aggregates, the Trp residues may be in close proximity so as to result in Trp self-quenching and quenching by the positive charges of the peptide, as suggested for nisin, another antimicrobial peptide (19Breukink E. van Kraaij C. van Dalen A. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. de Kruijff B. Kuipers O.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8153-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A similar interpretation may apply to the decrement of fluorescence in POPG-containing membranes at lipid/peptide molar ratio of <10. However, quenching could also be due to the charged head group of POPG interacting directly with the π-orbitals of Trp (22De Kroon A.I.P.M. Soekarjo M.W., De Gier J. De Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8229-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Third and perhaps the most likely possibility is π-orbital-cation interaction (30Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar), which is suggested by the close proximity of Trp4 and K7 in α-helical temporin L (Fig.7). The observed decrement in the maxima λmax of Trp emission upon interaction with SOPC liposomes reveals that Trp4 becomes accommodated in a more hydrophobic environment. In this context, it is useful to note that the bilayer is highly dynamic. Accordingly, the interface between the polar aqueous phase and the nonpolar hydrocarbon region of the bilayer is not sharp but rather a transition zone, which accounts for ∼50% of the bilayer thickness (for a review, see Ref. 32White S.H. Wimley W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Due to its polarizable π-orbitals, Trp has been suggested to favor partitioning into this zone with an averaged polarity gradient (33Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Above a lipid/peptide stoichiometry of 10, the fluorescence of Trp4 increases with increasing contents of POPG in the liposomes. Insertion of temporin L in α-helical conformation into POPG-containing membranes at the above stoichiometries is suggested by the observed blue shifts in the Trp emission maxima λmax and the quenching profile by brominated PCs. At X POPG = 0.2 and 0.4, the highest Trp fluorescence is evident at a lipid/peptide molar ratio of 20. However, slight attenuation of fluorescence intensity was in evidence above this stoichiometry and could be due to reduced cooperative insertion of temporin L when the lipid/peptide molar ratio is increased. In the presence of cholesterol, Trp4fluorescence intensity was decreased by 30%. Accordingly, the environment of Trp4 appears to become more polar, and the fluorescence quantum yield decreases. Quenching by acrylamide and brominated lipids suggests that in the presence of cholesterol most of the temporin L bound to the membrane resides in the surface. Aggregation of the peptides in the surface of the cholesterol-containing membranes and self-quenching of Trp could provide another mechanism for the decrement of Trp fluorescence. Notably, the effects of temporin L on membranes were significantly decreased in the presence of cholesterol. Cholesterol increases membrane acyl chain order (34van Ginkel G. van Langen H. Levine Y.K. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the bilayer structure (35Cullis P.R. van Dijck P.W.M. de Kruijff B. de Gier J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which could prevent the penetration of temporin L into the lipid bilayer and decrease the extent of membrane perturbation by this peptide.The blue shifts of the emission maxima in the presence of SOPC and SOPC/POPG vesicles suggest that Trp4 inserts into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer. Compared with zwitterionic membranes, larger blue shifts in Trp emission and higher quenching efficiency by brominated PCs are evident for membranes containing the negatively charged POPG. These differences are most likely due to a larger amount of peptides being inserted or deeper penetration of the peptide into bilayers. The data on the quenching by brominated lipid suggest that the depth of insertion of Trp is insignificantly affected by POPG. Accordingly, the amount of temporin L inserting into bilayers should increase for POPG-containing membranes. Amphipathic α-helical peptides such as magainin, cecropin B, cecropin P, dermaseptin B, and dermaseptin S bind to and permeate into zwitterionic membranes, although 10-fold higher concentrations are needed compared with negatively charged membranes (2Matsuzaki K. Harada M. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 36Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 37Gazit E. Boman A. Boman H.G. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11479-11488Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Similarly, whereas temporin L binds to zwitterionic membranes, it has a higher affinity for POPG-containing membranes. These results further indicate that membrane penetration as well as cooperative interactions and aggregation of temporin L in bilayers are involved in the disruption of the bilayer by this antimicrobial peptide.Quenching by acrylamide reveals that Trp4 of temporin L is shielded in the presence of liposomes. However, although at a lipid/peptide molar ratio of 100 the data indicate the peptide to be quantitatively membrane-bound, this residue was not completely inaccessible to acrylamide. Experiments with brominated phospholipids further demonstrate the most efficient quenching by (9,10)-Br2-PC in both SOPC- and SOPC/POPG-containing membranes. However, significant quenching was also due to (6,7)-Br2-PC in which the bromines reside at a distance of 10.8 Å from the bilayer center. Combining these results with those from acrylamide-quenching experiments, we may conclude that not all of the peptides are bound within the lipid bilayer in a transbilayer state, and an equilibrium of orientational states (inserted and surface-associated) may exist. Calculation of the penetration depth indicates that Trp4 resides at a distance of 8.0 ± 0.5 Å from the bilayer center in SOPC and SOPC/POPG membranes. The length of temporin L in an α-helical conformation is approximately 19.5 Å, thus corresponding to about half of the thickness of a SOPC bilayer. In this α-helical peptide, the distance of Trp4from the N terminus is approximately 6 Å. Accordingly, the N terminus of temporin L is likely to reside deepest in the lipid bilayer (Fig.7). In the presence of cholesterol, most efficient quenching (maximum approximately 20%) was observed for (6,7)-Br2-PC. Together with the acrylamide quenching data, this suggests that under these conditions, most of the temporin L bound to this membrane is surface-associated. The behavior of this peptide interacting with liposomes containing a small amount of POPG (X POPG = 0.1) at low lipid/peptide molar ratios is also of interest. Temporin L induced lipid segregation in binary SOPC/POPG vesicles (11Zhao H. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Simmaco M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4425-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the local charge ratio between peptide and lipid head group is thus suggested to represent an important determinant for the topology of the peptide in bilayers.Our data show temporin L to bind efficiently to SOPC membranes, yet the interaction is further enhanced in the presence of POPG. Similar penetration depths in both zwitterionic and POPG-containing membranes were evident. This indicates that although electrostatic interactions between the positively charged residues of temporin L and the negatively charged phospholipids are important, hydrophobic interactions between the nonpolar surface of the helical peptide and the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer are also involved. The penetration of temporin L into lipid monolayers revealed a “crossover” point, a surface pressure of ∼43 millinewtons/meter, at which the value for Δπ is independent from X PG (11Zhao H. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Simmaco M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4425-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The asymmetric binding of this peptide to the outer leaflet of the bilayer at the first stage results in an augmented bending rigidity as well as negative spontaneous curvature in the membrane. Reorientation and insertion of this peptide into the lipid bilayers could occur at the crossover point and be independent from X PG.For several of the antimicrobial peptides studied so far, the formation of multimeric pores has been suggested to be responsible for membrane permeabilization. However, also alternative models, in which the peptides destroy the membrane barrier function without pore formation, have been proposed (for a review, see Ref. 38Bechinger B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 157-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For temporins as well as other short antimicrobial peptides, it would be particularly intriguing to discriminate between the different models proposed or to investigate whether they act by different mechanisms. Our studies reveal that temporin L inserts into the hydrophobic core of the membranes in a cooperative manner. Either a “toroidal” or “barrel stave” model would thus be feasible (39Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). One α-helical monomer of temporin L could span one half-leaflet of a bilayer. Accordingly, pore formation by this peptide is likely to require dimerization (14Mangoni M.L. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Mignogna G. Bozzi A. Barra D. Simmaco M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The toroidal model suggested for magainin 2 involves five peptide helices together with several surrounding phospholipids, which form a membrane-spanning pore (40Ludtke S.J., He, K. Heller W.T. Harroun T.A. Yang L. Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13723-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). For the latter mechanism, the concentration of bromines near the peptide would be rather different than in the bulk of the bilayer, particularly in POPG-containing membranes. This can be rationalized by the Br2-PCs being partially excluded from the predominantly negatively charged lipid domains where the peptide is preferentially bound. Such variation in the local distribution of the lipid probes could affect the analysis of the quenching data by the parallax method, whereas distribution analysis would remain unaffected (28Ladokhin A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 946-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, distance calculation of the distance d of Trp4 from the bilayer center by the parallax method and distribution analysis gave similar values for SOPC- and POPG-containing membranes, thus suggesting that partial segregation of lipids caused by temporin L (11Zhao H. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Simmaco M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4425-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has only insignificant effects on the quenching profiles by the brominated lipids. In combination with the data revealing that temporin L readily inserts into and perturbs zwitterionic SOPC bilayers (11Zhao H. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Simmaco M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4425-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the barrel stave model (39Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar) could be the most likely mechanism for its action, as suggested for other temporins (14Mangoni M.L. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Mignogna G. Bozzi A. Barra D. Simmaco M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Our data show that temporin L inserts into lipid bilayers as a well defined structure. The membrane is thus perturbed by the supramolecular complex formed by the peptide with its associated phospholipids. Association of α-helical peptides is likely to be primarily driven by van der Waals forces (for a review, see Ref. 41White S.H. Ladokhin A.S. Jayasinghe S. Hristova K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32395-32398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the antimicrobial peptides could lack specific knob-into-hole packing, which is a general characteristic of helical bundle membrane proteins (42Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins. 1998; 31: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and causes promiscuous aggregation. The latter may induce local phase transitions, such as the separation of lipid-peptide micelles from the bilayers or local changes of the membrane curvature due to the intercalating peptides, which would cause transient collapse of the bilayer structure. These processes could relate to the vesiculation of giant vesicles induced by temporin B and L observed in our previous study (11Zhao H. Rinaldi A.C., Di Giulio A. Simmaco M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4425-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More than 500 antimicrobial peptides have been discovered so far from animals as well as plants (a good collection of sequences, besides a wealth of other useful information, can be found on the World Wide Web at www.bbcm.univ.trieste.it/∼tossi/pag1.htm). These peptides are important components of innate defense mechanisms and are thought to kill bacteria by permeabilizing and/or disrupting their membranes. Experimental evidence suggests that direct peptide-lipid interactions are important for the expression of their antibiotic activity instead of specific association with a chiral receptor (1Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).

Polycystin-2 is functionally expressed in the apical membrane of the human syncytiotrophoblast, where it may play a role in the control of fetal electrolyte homeostasis. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms that regulate polycystin-2 channel function. In this study, the role of pH in the regulation of polycystin-2 was assessed by ion channel reconstitution of both apical membranes of human syncytiotrophoblast and the purified FLAG-tagged protein fromin vitro transcribed/translated material. A kinetic analysis of single channel currents, including dwell time histograms, confirmed two open and two close states for spontaneous channel behavior and a strong voltage dependence of the open probability of the channel (Po ). A reduction ofcis pH (pH cis ) decreasedPo and shifted the voltage dependence of channel function but had no effect on the single channel conductance. An increase in pH cis , in contrast, increased NPo (channel number timesPo ). Elimination of the H+chemical gradient did not reverse the low pH cis inhibition of polycystin-2. Similar findings confirmed the pH effect on the in vitro translated, FLAG-tagged purified polycystin-2. The data indicate the presence of an H+ ion regulatory site in the channel protein, which is accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the protein.

A kinetic analysis of single channel currents, including dwell time histograms, confirmed two open and two close states for spontaneous channel behavior and a strong voltage dependence of the open probability of the channel (Po ). A reduction ofcis pH (pH cis ) decreasedPo and shifted the voltage dependence of channel function but had no effect on the single channel conductance. An increase in pH cis , in contrast, increased NPo (channel number timesPo ). Elimination of the H+chemical gradient did not reverse the low pH cis inhibition of polycystin-2. Similar findings confirmed the pH effect on the in vitro translated, FLAG-tagged purified polycystin-2. The data indicate the presence of an H+ ion regulatory site in the channel protein, which is accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the protein. This protonation site controls polycystin-2 cation-selective channel activity. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease human syncytiotrophoblast 2-[N-morpholino]-ethanesulfonic acid 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid cis pH trans pH siemens farads Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)1 is a prevalent human genetic disorder affecting 1:400 to 1:1000 individuals worldwide. Mutations in at least two genes, PKD1 andPKD2, are responsible for more than 90% of all cases of the disease (1Arnaout M.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2001; 52: 93-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite little knowledge concerning the role(s) of the gene product of PKD1, polycystin-1, recent studies determined that polycystin-2, the gene product of PKD-2, is a Ca2+-permeable, non-selective cation channel (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is assumed that membrane-associated polycystin-1-polycystin-2 complexes may be part of a regulatory pathway involved in the control of membrane transport in target epithelia, including those of the kidney and the liver. Coiled-coil interactions between polycystin-1 and -2 are postulated to occur in vivo (4Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme Y.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and the two gene products, but neither one alone, were reported to increase the whole cell conductance when heterologously overexpressed in mammalian cells (5Hanaoka K.

Dysfunctional control of this transport-associated regulatory pathway has been implicated in cyst formation and cell proliferation. This may be partly explained by the cell location and developmental characteristics of the target tissue(s) in which polycystin-2 is expressed (6Markowitz G.S. Cai Y., Li, L., Wu, G. Ward L.C. Somlo S. D'Agati V.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F17-F25PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate, however, that polycystin-2 engages in ion channel activity in the absence of any other associated proteins (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E.

In this report, we investigated the regulatory role of pH in the control of polycystin-2 channel function. Human polycystin-2 from two different sources, including hST apical membranes and the in vitro transcribed/transduced human gene product, was functionally reconstituted in a lipid bilayer system where the effect(s) of pH on its cation channel activity was determined. The data indicate that polycystin-2 is strongly voltage-dependent and contains a regulatory site that is highly sensitive to H+ ions, enabling its regulation as an ion channel as a function of intracellular pH. Syncytiotrophoblast membrane vesicles were obtained from term human placentae as described (8Grosman C. Mariano M.I. Bozzini J.P. Reisin I.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L.

Apical membrane enrichment was ∼26-fold from the initial homogenate, and the final pellet was resuspended in a buffer solution containing HEPES-KOH (10 mm), pH 7.14, sucrose (250 mm), and KCl (20 mm). Both sides of the lipid bilayer were bathed with solution containing 10–15 μm Ca2+, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, and 10 mm MES-KOH, pH 7.14. The final K+ concentration in the solution was ∼15 mm. KCl was added to the cis side of the chamber to a final concentration of 150 mm. Whenever indicated, KCl was added to the trans compartment to a final concentration of 150 K+ and 135 Cl−, respectively. In vitro translated FLAG-tagged polycystin-2 was obtained as recently described (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 3.2-Kb XbaI-PstI fragment encoding the protein from pVL1393-PKD2 was transferred to the XbaI-NsiI site of pGEM-7zf (+) to generate the plasmid pGEM-PKD2. This cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro with the TnT-T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes. Plasmid DNA (1 μg) and the in vitroreaction mixture (50 μl), includingl-[35S]methionine (AmershamBiosciences), were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. In vitro translated 35S-labeled polycystin-2 and luciferase (as control) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lipid bilayers were formed with a mixture of synthetic phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) in N-decane following methods reported previously (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 8Grosman C. Mariano M.I. Bozzini J.P. Reisin I.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All phospholipids used were 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-based, including 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine. The lipid solution (∼20–25 mg/ml) was spread over the diameter aperture (250 μm) of a polystyrene cuvette (CP13–150) of a bilayer chamber (model BCH-13, Warner Instruments Corp.) with a thin glass rod. The cuvette was inserted into a polyvinyl chloride holder, thus defining two aqueous compartments of volumes 800 and 1,600 μl, respectively, and separated by a planar lipid film as originally described (9Alvarez O. Miller C. Ion Channel Reconstitution. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 115-130Crossref Google Scholar). Both sides of the lipid bilayer were bathed with a 10–15 μmCa2+ solution, which was buffered at pH 7.14 with 10 mm MOPS-KOH and 10 mm MES-KOH. The final K+ concentration in the solution was ∼15 mm. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were initiated by bathing thetrans side of the bilayer with this solution. 135 mm KCl was added to the cis side of the chamber to generate a trans bilayer osmotic gradient that promoted the vesicle-planar bilayer membrane fusion (10Hanke, Wolfgang, Ion Channel Reconstitution, (Miller, C., ed), pp. 141–153, Plenum Publishing Corp., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Changes in pH in the cis andtrans hemi-chambers of the lipid reconstitution chamber were conducted by addition of small volumes (1–10 μl) of concentrated solutions of either HCl or KOH, ranging between 0.5 and 2.0n. The final pH was calibrated with a pH mini-electrode, either by means of titration curves of comparable volumes and saline concentrations or directly from the final cis ortrans solutions. Holding potentials (V h ) were applied from the trans chamber with either a DC voltage source or a wave function generator having the opposite, cis side defined as virtual ground. Unless otherwise stated, a cis minus trans voltage convention was utilized throughout the study. Bilayer formation was monitored by applying a 2.5-mV peak-to-peak 20-Hz triangular wave with a typical membrane capacitance of 100–200 pF. All the experiments were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Electrical signals were recorded using a current-to-voltage converter with a 10-gigaohm feedback resistor. Output (voltage) signals were low pass filtered at 700 Hz (−3 db) with an eight-pole Bessel type filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Signals were displayed on an oscilloscope, and channel recordings were simultaneously digitized with a pulse code modulator (Sony PCM-501 ES) and stored in videotapes with a VCR (Toshiba HQ). Data were later transferred to a personal computer for subsequent analysis at 4 kHz (unless otherwise stated). Whenever indicated, single channel current tracings were further filtered (see “Results”) for display purposes only. Unless otherwise stated, pCLAMP Version 5.5.1 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for data analysis, and Sigmaplot Version 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) was used for statistical analysis and graphics. Single channel conductances (γ) under asymmetrical conditions were calculated by the best fitting of current-to-voltage experimental data to either a straight line or the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, such that γ = I/(V h −E r ) was obtained from Eq. 1, I(Vh)=(zi2F2PiVh/RT)(Ccis/1−exp(α))Equation 1 −(zj2F2PjVh/RT)/(Ctrans/1−exp(−β))where i represents the cation species (either K+ or Na+) in the trans compartment, and j represents the cation species in the ciscompartment. V h is the holding electrical potential in mV; z i and z j , are the charge for species i and j, respectively.C cis and C trans are thecis and trans concentrations of j andi, respectively, and α =RTV h /z i F, and β = RTV h /z j F. P i and P j represent the permeability coefficient for either species i orj, respectively. F is the Faraday constant, 96,500 coulombs/equivalent; R is the ideal gas constant, 0.082053 liter·atm/(mol K) or 1.9872 cal/(mol K); and T is the absolute temperature, 293 K in our calculations. The single channel open probability (P o ) was obtained from dwell time histograms by fitting experimental residence times with PClamp software. The voltage dependence of theP o was assessed by fitting P o versus V h , the holding voltage potential, to the Boltzmann equation, shown in Eq. 2,Po=Pmax/{1−exp(−kF(Vh−Vm)/RT)}Equation 2 where P max is the maximal value forP o , kF/RT represents the slope, k is equal to the z times δ product,z and δ are the charge of, and the fractional voltage drop sensed by, the gating particle, respectively. V m is the holding potential at which P o = 0.5.F, R, and T have their usual meaning. Whenever indicated, statistical significance was obtained by pairedt test comparison of sample groups of similar size (11Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. The Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa1973: 59-65Google Scholar). Average data values were expressed as the mean ± S.E. under each condition, and n represents the number of experiments analyzed. Statistical significance was accepted atp < 0.05. Patlak's mean versus variance analysis to enhance detection of brief subconductance states was conducted as originally described (12Patlak J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tracings of 12.5 s in duration (50,000 points) were used to perform this analysis. Five-point segments or “sliding windows” were considered where each window started one point later than the previous one. The mean versus variance of the windows was plotted by connecting lines following the temporal sequence in the original traces. Histograms were constructed for those mean current values whose variance was either less or equal to that corresponding to the closed state variance. Thus, mean current values corresponding to “in-between” substate transitions (large variance) were discarded (12Patlak J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To calculate the dissociation constant for the H+ ion blocking site with the polycystin-2 channel, the model proposed by Woodhull (12Patlak J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used following the reaction shown in Eq. 3, Hcis+↔b−1[H+]cisb1Hsite+↔[H+]transb+2b2Htrans+Equation 3 where Hcis+, Htrans+, and Hsite+ represent the H+ ions in the cis and trans compartments and the protonation site, respectively. [H+] cis and [H+] trans represent the H+concentrations in either compartment. Further,b 1, b −1,b 2, and b −2 are the voltage-independent (V h = 0 mV) components of the velocity constants for the reaction. Any departure from zero mV would entail a correction for each velocity constant, which is affected by an exponential factor taking into consideration the holding potential (13Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Following Woodhull's interpretation of this model for the pH inhibition of macroscopic Na+ currents in nerve cells (13Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), several assumptions were made. The H+ association and dissociation reactions with the channel site change exponentially with respect to the V h , as in Eyring rate constant theory (14Eyring H. Eyring E.M. Modern Chemical Kinetics. Van Norstrand Reinhold Co., New York1963Google Scholar). Whenever H+ occupies the blocking site, polycystin-2-permeable ions, in this case K+, do not permeate the channel. Thus, ions other than H+ do not interfere with the regulatory (protonation) site, and in this sense, K+ and H+ ions do not compete with each other. This model is not concerned with polycystin-2 opening and closing mechanisms but rather with the fractional probability of open channel blockage by H+ occupation of the regulatory site. Another important assumption of the Woodhull's model is that the current driven by H+ ions as they enter the channel is negligible as compared with that observed by K+ ions. Thus, H+ movement does not make a contribution to the open channel current. This is further supported by the fact that there is no change in the single channel conductance at different pHs. Finally, the H+ ion-H+ site system is in steady state, namely, the time constants for the open channel state are long as compared with the time taken by the H+ ion to reach a steady state concentration inside the channel. For holding potentials between −30 and 10 mV, for whichP o (V h ) is almost constant as a function of voltage, the equilibrium constant of the blocking reaction K(V h ) as a function of V h was calculated from experimental data with Eq. 4,IpH6.40IpH7.14=FpH6.40FpH7.14=10−7.14+K(Vh)10−6.40+K(Vh)Equation 4 where I pH6.40 andI pH7.14 are the mean currents obtained asP o × I, whereP o (V h ) andI(V h ) are the open probability and single channel currents obtained at different holding potentials, respectively. Values were obtained from fitted data of Figs.2 D and 3, D and E. TheF pH6.40 and F pH7.14, which represented the fractional number of open (non-blocked) channels at each pH in the original Woodhull's model, indicates the fractional change in channel current as measured by the change in open probability for the single channel currents. The equilibrium constant for the reaction, K(V h ), then takes the form shown in Eq.5,K(Vh)=[Htrans+]b−2b1exp−zFE2RT+b−1b1exp−zδFERT+b2b1exp−(2δ−1)zFE2RTEquation 5 In our study, b 2 andb −2 are negligible as compared withb 1 and b −1 such that K(V h ) can be reduced to Eq. 6,K(Vh)−b−1b1exp−zδFERTEquation 6 where z is the charge of the membrane potential sensor, δ is the electrical distance sensed from the cis(cytoplasmic) side of the channel, and F, R, andT have their usual meaning. Fitting the values to this equation, the zδ product was obtained, as well as the value K for V h = 0 mV, representing the dissociation constant K (0) = (b −1/b 1).Figure 3Effect of low pH cis on hST polycystin-2 channel currents. A, representative single channel currents in either symmetrical pH (top tracing,cis and trans compartments, pH 7.14) or after reduction of pH cis to pH 6.40 (lower tracing). InB, single channel current amplitude (all-point) histograms were obtained by fitting experimental values (circles) with two-Gaussian distributions (solid lines). Single channel amplitude did not change after reduction of pH cis . The holding potential was 20 mV. Data are representative of four experiments.C, closed and open state dwell histograms (leftand right, respectively) for tracings in panel A. The number of kinetic states (two) remained unchanged, but the time constants obtained by best fitting of the closed dwell histogram data with two exponentials were 0.79 and 44.4 ms for the closed states, and 1.78 and 16.7 ms for the open states, respectively. The data indicate that the second rate constant for the closed state increased after reduction in pH cis . D, current-to-voltage relationships for single channel currents under either control (pH cis and pH trans = 7.14, filled circles) or low pH cis (6.40, filled squares). Data are representative of five experiments. In E, voltage dependence of the open probability of the channel in the presence of pH cis = 6.40 (filled circles, n = 3) was fitted to the Boltzmann equation (solid line), showed a shift to the left, indicative of a change in voltage sensitivity as compared with normal pH cis (dashed line, see “Experimental Procedures” and “Results” for fitted values).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human syncytiotrophoblast apical membranes were reconstituted in the presence of asymmetrical KCl (150 mm) in the cis side and 15 mm K+ in thetrans side. Polycystin-2 single channel currents were obtained at different holding potentials (Fig.1 A), and current amplitudes and open probabilities were calculated from all-point histograms (Fig.1 B). The mean open probability (area under open state) largely depended on the holding potential. The main single channel conductance was 157 ± 4.90 pS (n = 7), as recently reported (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of single channel currents (Fig. 2, A and B) indicated that the channel had two open and closed states, as indicated by the closed and open dwell histograms (Fig. 2 C,left and right, respectively), which were best fitted with two exponentials for each state. The open probability of the channel (P o ) was strongly dependent on the holding potential (Fig. 2 D). The voltage dependence of theP o was further assessed by fitting experimental data to the Boltzmann equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fitted parameters indicated a P max of 0.72 ± 0.05 (n = 5) with k = −2.3 ± 0.7 (n = 5), and a V m = 29.4 ± 3.9 mV (n = 5). To assess the regulatory effect(s) of pH on polycystin-2 channel activity, the pH of the cis chamber was reduced by addition of a small volume of HCl (2.0 n). Single channel currents were reduced after lowering pH cis (Fig.3, A and B). The single channel current amplitude of hST polycystin-2 in symmetrical KCl (150 mm) did not change by reducing pH cis from 7.14 to 6.4 (Fig. 3 B). The kinetic behavior of the channel did not change because the dwell histograms were still best fitted by two exponentials (Fig. 3 C). However, a change in pH reduced the open probability of the channel, which decreased from 0.74 ± 0.11 (n = 5) at pH 7.14 to 0.24 ± 0.08 (n = 3) at pH 6.4 for a holding potential of 20 mV. This was a reflection of the increase in the dwell zero time (second rate constant), which increased as a function of lowered pH. The single channel conductance for these tracings was also similar between control and low pH cis , as measured by K+ currents in the presence of the KCl chemical gradient (Fig. 3 D). The non-selective cation channel conductance of hST polycystin-2 in symmetrical KCl (150 mm) was 135 ± 11.2 pS (n = 5), and it did not change by reducing pH cis from 7.14 to 6.4 (138 ± 21 pS, n = 3, p < 0.3). Fitting of the P o values as a function of the various holding potentials showed a displacement of the Boltzmann distribution determined after pH cis reduction (Fig. 3 E). The P o versus voltage function shifted to the left, fromV m = 29.4 ± 3.9 mV (n = 5) at pH cis 7.14 to V m = −14.7 ± 2.6 mV (n = 3) at pH cis 6.4, with a decrease in the slope k from −2.30 ± 0.70 (n = 5) at pH cis 7.14 to k = −1.06 ± 0.5 (n = 3) at pH cis 6.4. Further, the reduction in pH cis also increased the number of single channel substates (Fig. 4), which were further manifested by the transitions observed in the mean versus variance plots (Fig. 4, right) (12Patlak J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in H+ concentration induced more fluctuations between the channel substates, but the current amplitudes themselves did not change. Conversely, an increase in pH cis increased the mean current by 123% (n = 3, p < 0.045, Fig. 5) by increasing the open probability of the high conductance state of the channel but not the single channel conductance of hST polycystin-2 (Fig. 5 B, histograms). Elimination of the pH gradient (pH cis = pH trans = 6.4) at low pH, however, was without effect in reversing the inhibitory effect of pH cis reduction alone (n = 7, data not shown).Figure 5Effect of increased pH cis on hST polycystin-2 cation channel activity. A, representative single channel current tracings obtained in asymmetrical K+with 150 and 15 mm KCl in the cis andtrans compartments, respectively, at pH cis 7.14 (top tracing) and 8.0 (bottom tracing). The holding potential was 40 mV for both tracings. Data are representative of three experiments. Single channel open probability increased at pH cis 8.0. The single channel currents (showing substates) increased to a maximal single channel (constant) conductance of ∼100 pS at pH cis 8.0. B, log-linear plots of all-point histograms at control pH (left) and after increasing cis pH to 8.0. The single channel conductance switched to a maximal state at ∼10 pA. Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that a regulatory site for H+ions indeed exists in the polycystin-2 ion channel, the effect of changes in pH cis was further assessed on the ion channel activity of purified FLAG-tagged human polycystin-2, obtained from thein vitro transcribed/translated material (Fig.6). A reduction of pH cis decreased the single channel activity, including an increase in the subconductance state level of the channel (Fig. 6). A completely inhibited channel reactivated upon reinstating a higher pH in thecis side of the chamber (Fig. 6 B). The data are in agreement with the effect of an H+ ion titration site, which is likely intrinsic to the channel protein by comparison of the similar effect in the hST and in vitro preparations. To further assess the nature of the regulation by pH on hST polycystin-2 single channel tracings, the mean open probability (P o ) was assessed as a function of the pH in thecis compartment (Fig. 7). Experimental values were fitted to Eq. 7, Po(pH)=10pH10pH+10pKaEquation 7 which is based on the assumption that polycystin-2 presents a single H+ titration site accessible from the cytoplasmic domain. Orientation of the channel protein was confirmed in our original studies (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The experimental data were best fitted with this equation, indicating that a regulatory site indeed exists for the regulation by pH cis of polycystin-2 ion channel activity, which has an equilibrium constant pK a of ∼6.4. The equilibrium constant for the H+ regulatory site was validated by assessing the effect of pH on the single channel currents following a modification of the model described by Woodhull to assess the blocking effect of low pH on nerve Na+ currents (13Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Theoretical current-to-voltage (I/V) relationships (Fig. 7) were obtained for single channel currents at two different pHs, namely, 7.14 and 6.40, for which single channel currents and open probabilities were fitted to the Goldman-Hodgking-Katz and Boltzmann equations, respectively (Figs. 2 D and 3, D andE). The I/V plots, where the mean single channel currents are shown as I × P o versusholding potentials in the range of −20 to 10 mV showed a strong voltage dependence of the pH effect on the mean channel currents (Fig.7). By applying the Woodhull's model (13Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) to the pH 7.14versus 6.40 substracted currents (Fig. 7), the product zδ was calculated as 0.67, and the pKwas calculated at ∼6.5, where pK = −log Kfor the protonation reaction. The present study demonstrates that polycystin-2 cation channel function is voltage-dependent and highly sensitive to changes in pH. The data are most consistent with the assumption that polycystin-2 contains a highly sensitive pH site, which regulates its cation-selective channel activity by controlling the voltage dependence of the single channel kinetics. Dwell time histograms confirmed a two-open, two-closed state for the spontaneous channel at normal pH and the strong voltage dependence of the open probability. Although the single channel conductance did not change by modifying pH cis , the change in pH largely decreased the open probability of the channel. This effect was also voltage-dependent, being greater at a more positive V h such that the Boltzmann distribution of P o (V h ) was displaced to the left, as indicated by the decreased slope as a function of reducing pH cis . This suggests a placement of the titration site in the conductance pore of the channel. Conversely, an increase in pH cis increased the polycystin-2 mediated K+ currents also associated with an increased NP o but not the single channel conductance. The data further indicate that the changes induced by pH on polycystin-2 ion channel activity were not elicited by modifying the H+ chemical gradient but instead by a regulatory site in the channel protein because a decrease in pH such that the pH gradient was eliminated (pH cis = pH trans = 6.4) was without effect in reversing the inhibitory effect of reducing thecis pH alone. An effect of pH cis on polycystin-2 channel regulation was also observed with the purified protein from thein vitro translated material, confirming a pH-sensitive site in the channel protein itself. Taken together, these data suggest that an H+ ion (protonation) regulatory site, only accessible from the intracellular (cis) side of the channel where changes were made, controls the polycystin-2 cation channel from human placenta. The orientation of the reconstituted polycystin-2 channel was confirmed previously (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and further assessed in experiments where either addition of antibody to the cis side or amiloride to the trans side of the reconstitution chamber induced the expected blocking effect on either side of the channel (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To assess the affinity of the protonation site for pH regulation of polycystin-2, P o versus pH cis data were fitted to a Henderson-Hasselbach type equation (Fig. 7), indicating the presence of an equilibrium constant (pK a ) of ∼6.4, which was confirmed independently by applying a kinetic model for the protonation reaction on the single channel currents at different pHs (Woodhull model, Fig. 7). The data are in agreement with the presence of a regulatory site in the channel protein, which is only accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the channel, thus suggesting that pH regulation of polycystin-2 is largely intracellular. This is supported by the fact that changes in cis, but not trans, pH modified the polycystin-2 channel currents. Only one of five experiments where pH was lowered from the trans side showed a detectable change in channel function (data not shown). Thus, although the extracellular domain of the channel may also be sensitive to pH (which will require further experimentation), it is unlikely that this effect is associated with the same site described in this report, and it may be speculated that it is instead associated with changes in surface potential as reported previously for other channels (15Hess P. Prod'Hom B. Pietrobon D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Pietrobon D. Prod'Hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, polycystin-L, a channel homolog of polycystin-2 (17Chen X.Z. Vassilev P.M. Basora N. Peng J.B. Nomura H. Segal Y. Brown E.M. Reeders S.T. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Nature. 1999; 401: 383-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ADPKD-causing truncated R742X-polycystin-2 (7Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Basora N. Guo L. Peng J.B. Babakhanlou H. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were also blocked by a reduction in cytoplasmic pH, further suggesting a homologous topology in the ion channel, consistent with a pH regulatory site most likely present in the pore conduction structure of the channel protein. However, the L-type calcium channel, which shares homology with polycystin-2 (18Mochizuki T., Wu, G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) and is also sensitive to changes in pH (15Hess P. Prod'Hom B. Pietrobon D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), may have a regulatory site external to the conduction pore of the channel (16Pietrobon D. Prod'Hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The human syncytiotrophoblast, the most apical membrane barrier of the human placenta, provides the only natural epithelium where polycystin-2 function has been determined (2González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As a permeable selective barrier for the transfer of various solutes between mother and fetus (19Stulc J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 805-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the human syncytiotrophoblast may help maintain the fetal electrolytic homeostasis. As a non-selective cation channel, polycystin-2 may serve several purposes, including Na+absorption, K+ secretion, and the regulation of Ca2+ entry into the fetal environment. The particular nature of the epithelial hST, however, namely being syncytial, further requires specific and highly controlled regulatory mechanisms, essential for the maintenance of the hydroelectrolytic homeostasis of both the maternal blood and the fetal environments. The pH regulation of the polycystin-2 channel activity suggests the importance of H+ ions as second messengers whose presence may contribute to the control of hydroelectrolytic homeostasis. Further studies will be required to assess the metabolic role of this novel regulatory pathway in vivo and its role in the dysfunctional aspects associated with ADPKD.

Young A.J. Britton G. Carotenoids in Photosynthesis. Chapman and Hall, London1993: 16-71Crossref Google Scholar). Under conditions of low irradiance, three xanthophylls, namely lutein ((3R,3′R)-β,ε-caroten-3,3′-diol), violaxanthin ((3S,5R,6S,3′S,5′R,6′S)-5,6,5′,6′-diepoxy-5,6,5′,6′-tetrahydro-β,β-carotene-3,3′-diol), and 9′-cis neoxanthin ((3S,5R,6R,3′S,5′R,6′S)-5′,6′-epoxy-6,7-didehydro-5,6,5′,6′-tetrahydro-β,β-carotene-3,5,3′-triol) together with the carotene, β-carotene (β,β-carotene), are typically found. In addition, the leaves of some species may contain small amounts of one or more of the following carotenoids: lutein-5,6-epoxide (5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-β,ε-caroten-3,3′-diol), lactucaxanthin ((3S,3′S,6S,6′S)-ε,ε-caroten-3,3′-diol), and α-carotene (β,ε-carotene). The xanthophyll composition may alter in the short term when tissues are exposed to high irradiances by the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin into zeaxanthin ((3R,3′R)-β,β-carotene-3,3′-diol) and antheraxanthin (5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-β,β-carotene-3,3′-diol) (the xanthophyll cycle; see Ref. 2Demmig-Adams B. Adams III, W.W. Ebbert V. Logan B.A. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry Of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 245-269Google Scholar for a recent review). Changes in the carotenoid composition may also be observed over the long term, again in response to growth irradiance (sun/shade response). This may alter the xanthophyll cycle pool size but may also bring about alterations to the relative amounts of some carotenoids (e.g. the ratios of α-carotene/β-carotene or lactucaxanthin/lutein), perhaps simply reflecting changes to the pigment antenna bed and reaction center (so-called “regulation of light harvesting”) (3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 65-84Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar) and/or changes to the biosynthetic flux to form the β,β- or β,ε-carotenoids. The precise location of these pigments within the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants has been determined by a number of studies in recent years (e.g. Refs. 4Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Sandonà D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys.

Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The xanthophylls are associated with the various chlorophyll (Chl)1 a/b light-harvesting complexes of photosystems I and II (LHCI and LHCII, respectively). The major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II, LHCIIb, contains the bulk of chlorophyll and xanthophylls. The three-dimensional structure of this complex, determined at a resolution of 3.4 Å, revealed the presence of two xanthophylls occupying a central position in the complex (8Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). These two molecules were both tentatively identified as lutein (on the basis of the pigment stoichiometry of the complex) and have been assigned to binding sites L1 and L2 in the complex. It is, however, generally accepted that this particular pigment-protein complex has four binding sites (L1, L2, N1, and V1), one of which (V1) apparently binds its pigment rather loosely in vitro (7Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and may in fact only be occupied in vivo in plants maintained at high irradiances (9Bassi R. Caffari S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The precise location of N1 is not known but is thought to be in a domain located between helix C and the A and B cross-helix (10Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 42: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, the fourth (xanthophyll cycle) binding site may not always be fully occupied, especially in conditions of low irradiance (9Bassi R. Caffari S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The apparent strength of binding of these xanthophylls to native LHC has been determined (7Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The pigments show affinity to the native (trimeric) complex in the order Chl b > neoxanthin > Chl a > lutein > zeaxanthin > violaxanthin. This affinity can alter upon monomerization of the complex (e.g. neoxanthin is tightly bound to trimeric LHCIIb but not to monomers of the complex, suggesting that it occupies a site in the interior of the trimeric array). In contrast, violaxanthin appears to be loosely bound to LHCIIb, suggesting a location (V1) on the periphery of the complex. The relative affinity of violaxanthin is increased upon monomerization of the complex. In vitro reconstitution has proved to be a powerful tool in the study of pigment-protein complexes in higher plants (11Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), algae (13Meyer M. Wilhelm C. Z. Naturforsch. 1993; C48: 461-473Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), bacteria (14Todd J.B. Parkes-Loach P.S. Leykam J.F. Loach P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17458-17468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and crustaceans (15Britton G. Weesie R.J. Askin D. Warburton J.D. Gallardo-Guero L. Jansen F.J. de Grrot H.J.M. Lugtenburg J. Cornard J-P. Merlin J.C. Pure Appl. Chem. 1997; 69: 2075-2084Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The technique was first employed in the study of pigment binding in LHCIIb by Plumley and Schmidt (11Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution was achieved using denatured thylakoid polypeptides from dark-adapted spinach and a pigment mixture (also extracted from spinach) containing Chls a and band native xanthophylls (i.e. lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin). Paulsen et al. (12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) overexpressed the 28-kDa polypeptide from pea in Escherichia coli, enabling the production of large amounts of homogenous protein. Initial experiments demonstrated that maximum yields of reconstituted complex were obtained using a mixture containing native xanthophylls and Chls aand b. Complexes were also successfully produced using Chlsa and b in combination with only two of the three native xanthophylls and also using lutein as the only xanthophyll molecule. Yields of these complexes, however, were poor, and the complexes were less stable than the complex assembled using the full native complement of pigments. These studies indicated that lutein was an essential component for the assembly of LHCIIb. More recent evidence suggests that, in vivo, there is some plasticity with regard to the specificity of xanthophyll binding and that some plants deficient in lutein are indeed viable (16Pogson B.J. Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Dellapenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In vitro, some specificity for the preferential binding of lutein to reconstituted LHCIIb has been shown (10Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 42: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 17Hobe S. Niemeir H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The aim of the present investigation was to determine which structural features of the xanthophyll molecule facilitated reassembly of LHCIIb. In this investigation, a low stringency (detergent exchange) method was employed (12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The ability of a range of xanthophylls with different structural features including chain length, end group type and substituents, and in-chain substitutions together with a number of geometric and optical isomers to facilitate reassembly of LHCIIb was determined. Plasmids were constructed using standard techniques as previously described (12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The bacterial host was E. coli strain JM101 (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The method used was that of Paulsen et al. (12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Routinely, bacteria that had been transformed to accumulate LHCP from pea were grown at 37 °C in 100-ml flasks until the culture density gave anA 550 of 0.4–0.5. Bacteria were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium: 1% (w/v) Bactotryptone (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), 0.5% (w/v) Bactoyeast (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), and 1% (w/v) NaCl (Merck) to which ampicillin (50 μg ml−1) was added. Expression of LHCP was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm). After a further 4 h at 37 °C, the culture was cooled to 0 °C and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. Isolation of LHCP was carried out as detailed by Paulsen et al. (12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), except that Igepal CA-630 (ICN Biomedicals) was substituted for Nonidet P-40. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Xanthophylls were isolated from a range of natural sources. Prior to use, they were purified using a combination of TLC (silica and MgO), column chromatography, and HPLC. Final concentrations were quantified by UV-visible spectroscopy (HP8453; Agilent Technologies, Stockport, UK) using the appropriate extinction coefficient. Chls a and b were purchased from Sigma. cis isomers of lutein violaxanthin and zeaxanthin and chiral-isomers of lutein and zeaxanthin were isolated using a combination of TLC, column chromatography, and HPLC. Identification was made on the basis of R f andT R values together with UV-visible spectral characteristics in comparison with authenticated standards. Unless otherwise stated, all carotenoids are all-trans.

(18Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kühlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was used unless otherwise stated. LHCP (4 μg) was solubilized in buffer composed of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 11), 5 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 12.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 2% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate. The mixture was heated to 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Pigment mixes containing 50 μg of Chls aand b (1:1) and 4.0 μg of xanthophyll were dissolved in 2 μl of ethanol (giving a Chl/xanthophyll ratio of 12.5). This was introduced to the LHCP, and the solution was mixed. All procedures were carried out in glass test tubes on ice. Octyl glucoside was added to the solution to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) with vigorous mixing. The solution was allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 min. The majority of the dodecyl sulfate was precipitated by the addition of 200 mm KCl. The solution was centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 3 min), and the supernatant was retained. The reconstituted complex was isolated and purified by carrying out nondenaturing PAGE on the supernatant (see below). The high stringency protocol of Plumley and Schmidt (11Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also performed as follows. Isolated LHCIIb polypeptides or delipidated thylakoid polypeptides were resuspended in solubilization buffer (polypeptide concentration and solubilization composition was the same as used in the low stringency protocol detailed above). Following heating at 100 °C for 5 min and subsequent cooling, pigments (in ethanol) were introduced to the solubilized protein (see above for concentrations). Reconstitution was achieved by freezing the mixture at −20 °C. A series of three freeze-thaw cycles (6–12 h of freezing followed by 15 min of thawing) was employed to complete the reconstitution process. Reconstituted complexes were isolated as detailed below. Partially denaturing PAGE was carried out at 4 °C using discontinuous gels and the buffer system of Laemmli (in which lithium dodecyl sulfate replaced SDS in the electrode buffer) as previously described (19Paulsen H. Hobe S Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried using a Sigma midget vertical gel system with water cooling. Gels were run at 100 V until the free pigment band had migrated ∼7 cm into the resolving gel. Following partially denaturing PAGE, pigmented complexes were cut from the gel using a scalpel. The complex was electroeluted from the gel using the Blue Tank (Isco). The electrophoresis tank contained buffer with the same composition as that used during partially denaturing PAGE. The nanotraps contained the same buffer that had undergone a 10-fold dilution. Electroelution was carried out for 20–30 min with a current of 2 mA/trap. When electroelution was complete, room temperature absorption spectra were obtained using an Agilent Technologies 8453 spectrophotometer (Stockport, UK). Fully denaturing PAGE was carried out as previously described (12Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Green bands were excised from partially denaturing gels and heated to 100 °C for 2 min. The band was then placed in the gel slot of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. SDS replaced lithium dodecyl sulfate in the electrode buffer. Thylakoids were prepared from spinach by the method of Berthold et al. (20Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Acetone delipidation of the thylakoids was carried out as described by Plumley and Schmidt (11Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of solubilized delipidated thylakoids was carried out using the detergent exchange technique described above. Where more than one xanthophyll was used in the reconstitution mixture, HPLC analysis of the pigment content of the complex was carried out to determine the ratio of bound xanthophylls. Pigments were extracted from gel slices using the method of Martinson and Plumley (21Martinson T.M. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pigments in the complex were separated using an HPLC system (Spherisorb ODS2 column; 250 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) with an Agilent Technologies HP1040 diode array detector and Gynkotek 480 pump (Dionex Ltd., Leeds, UK). The solvent system used was as described in Ref. 6Phillip D. Young A.J. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 43: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Pigment-protein complexes were excised from gel slices following partially denaturing PAGE. Pigments were carefully extracted using acetone/ethanol (1:1, v/v), partitioned into diethyl ether, and washed several times with water. Following extraction the solvent was evaporated using oxygen-free nitrogen. Samples were resuspended in acetone and quantitative analysis of Chls a and b and xanthophylls was carried out using the method of Lichtenthaler and Wellburn (22Lichtentahler H.K. Wellburn A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 591-593Crossref Google Scholar). The yield of reassembled complex was calculated as a percentage of the recovery of total bound chlorophyll in the reassembled complex as a function of the level obtained in the complex reassembled with native xanthophylls. A comparison of the procedures for the in vitro reconstitution of the 28-kDa polypeptide from pea overexpressed in E. coli and the high stringency procedure utilizing solubilized spinach thylakoid polypeptides was initially performed. A 1:1 ratio of Chls aand b (50 μg) and a mixture of native xanthophylls (1.7 μg of lutein, 0.9 μg of 9′-cis neoxanthin, 1.4 μg of violaxanthin) were used, giving a Chl/xanthophyll ratio of 12.5:1. In the present study, the resulting stoichiometry of the reassembled complex using all three procedures was comparable with ratios of Chla/b in the range 1.11–1.18:1 and a ratio of Chl/xanthophyll of 4:1 (Table I). These are very close to that of native spinach LHCIIb (purified by isoelectric focusing) in which the ratio of Chla/b was 1.22:1 and the ratio of Chl/xanthophyll was 4.1:1. The room temperature absorption spectra of the complex reconstituted using a mixture of xanthophylls by the low stringency technique is almost identical to that seen for native LHCIIb (Fig.3).

This particular method was chosen for the remainder of this study, since it permitted a systematic analysis of the structural requirements for xanthophyll binding employing a range of carotenoids, many of which resulted in the formation of relatively unstable pigment-protein complexes.Table IComparison of different techniques for reassembly of a mixture of native xanthophylls (see “Results” for details) in reconstituted LHCII (10Croce R.

Open table in a new tab The xanthophyll stoichiometry is reported per 12 Chl molecules, and the S.E. never exceeded 6% of the mean. With the exception of lactucaxanthin (see below), all of the xanthophylls native to the photosynthetic tissues of higher plants were able to support reassembly of LHCIIb when used alone with Chlsa and b, using the low stringency procedure. Yields of the reassembled complex were, however, always lower than that achieved for the mixture of native xanthophylls (see above) at ∼60% for lutein, zeaxanthin, and antheraxanthin and dropping to only 40–45% for violaxanthin and 9′-cis neoxanthin (TableII). The relatively poor efficacy demonstrated by violaxanthin and 9′-cis neoxanthin was reflected in a reduction in the ratio of Chl a/b, especially with 9′-cis neoxanthin, as previously reported (17Hobe S. Niemeir H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, other low yielding complexes (e.g. with capsanthin; Table III) had a normal ratio for Chl a/b, so that efficiencies of complex reassembly and Chl stoichiometry are not linked. For carotenoids other than lutein and zeaxanthin, the xanthophyll stoichiometry was generally in the range of 2.3–2.7 per monomer, possibly reflecting partial filling of one binding site (probably N1 (21Martinson T.M. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). The room temperature difference absorption spectra for selected single xanthophyll Chla/b complexes are shown in Fig.4, A and B. The spectra for the lutein complex in particular is almost identical to that of the complex reassembled with a mixture of native xanthophylls. The difference spectra (native LHC minus reassembled complex) reveals only very small changes in intensity of absorption in the Soret region (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the difference spectra for complexes reassembled with other native xanthophylls reveal more marked changes in their UV-visible spectra (Fig. 4, A and B). The spectrum of the complex reconstituted with violaxanthin (Fig.4 A) shows marked changes in the Qy transition region at 650 (decrease), 661 (increase), and 678 nm (decrease). The spectra from the zeaxanthin, 9′-cis neoxanthin (both Fig. 4 B), and antheraxanthin (Fig. 4 A) complexes are similar, with marked changes at 648 (decrease), 662 (increase), and 682 nm (decrease). These spectra also reveal changes in the Soret region of the spectrum that are more profound than that seen in either the native or the lutein-Chla/b complex, with decreases in absorption at 470 nm (violaxanthin) and 487–488 nm (zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and 9′-cis-neoxanthin).Table IIStoichiometry of LHCIIb reconstituted using single native xanthophylls and Chls a and b using the low stringency (12Paulsen H.

The epoxide group at C-5–C-6 appears to be an important structural feature of the carotenoid molecule, since the furanoid derivatives (produced by acid treatment of isolated xanthophylls) of violaxanthin and antheraxanthin (namely auroxanthin (3,3′-dihydroxy-5,8,5′,8′-diepoxy-β-carotene) and mutatoxanthin (3,3′-dihydroxy-5,8-epoxy-β-carotene), respectively), in which the epoxide group is rearranged to C-5–C-8 (i.e.2,5-dihydrofurans), failed to support reconstitution. A number of other epoxides failed to support reassembly of the complex (see below). The diol lactucaxanthin, which is common in the LHC of a number of plants (e.g. lettuce (6Phillip D. Young A.J. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 43: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) but not pea from which the apoprotein was cloned, would not support complex assembly when used as the only xanthophyll. In addition, it would not support reassembly of the complex using thylakoids isolated from either spinach or lettuce. Lactucaxanthin could, however, be incorporated into LHCIIb provided that lutein was also present (see below). Neither β-carotene nor the acyclic carotene lycopene supported reassembly of the complex. The pigment-protein complexes of photosynthetic organisms show a high degree of selectivity toward certain geometric forms of carotenoids. In the present study, the ability of selected geometric isomers of lutein, zeaxanthin, and violaxanthin to support reassembly of LHCIIb was examined (see Fig. 1 for structures). In contrast to"

https://openalex.org/W1997344602,"Expression of a 74-kDa nuclear factor I (NFI) protein is triggered in early involution in the mouse mammary gland, and its expression correlates with enhanced occupation of a twin (NFI) binding element in the <i>clusterin</i> promoter, a gene whose transcription is induced at this time (Furlong, E. E., Keon, N. K., Thornton, F. D., Rein, T., and Martin, F. (1996) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 29688–29697). We now identify this 74-kDa NFI as an NFIC isoform based on its interaction in Western analysis with two NFIC-specific antibodies. A transition from the expression of a 49-kDa NFIC in lactation to the expression of the 74-kDa NFIC in early involution is demonstrated. We show that the 74-kDa NFIC binds specifically to concanavalin A (ConA) and that this binding can be reversed by the specific ConA ligands, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside and methyl α-d-glucopyranoside. In addition, its apparent molecular size was reduced to ∼63 kDa by treatment with the peptide<i>N</i>-glycosidase. The 49-kDa lactation-associated NFIC did not bind ConA nor was it affected by peptide <i>N</i>-glycosidase. Tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of <i>N</i>-glycosylation, blocked formation of the 74-kDa NFI in involuting mouse mammary gland<i>in vivo</i> when delivered from implanted Elvax depot pellets. Finally, the production of the ConA binding activity could be reiterated in ""mammospheres"" formed from primary mouse mammary epithelial cells associated with a laminin-rich extracellular matrix. Synthesis of the 74-kDa NFIC was also inhibited in this setting by tunicamycin. Thus, involution triggers the production of an NFIC isoform that is post-translationally modified by<i>N</i>-glycosylation. We further show, by using quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR, that there is increased expression of the major mouse mammary NFIC mRNA transcript, mNFIC2, in early involution, suggesting that the involution-associated change in NFIC expression also has a transcriptional contribution."
https://openalex.org/W2019350995,"To understand the role of the Ets-1 transcription factor during angiogenesis, we have overexpressed it in endothelial cells and analyzed the levels of expression of several candidate target genes involved in angiogenesis. The transcripts levels of the ETS transcription factor fli-1 are specifically up-regulated in endothelial cells, which overexpress Ets-1, but not in fibroblasts. Analysis of the promoter of the mouse fli-1 gene reveals that the 1-kb region that comprises the transcription starts and part of exon 1 is responsible for the response of the promoter to Ets-1. The −270/−41 fragment contains two known Spi-1-responding Ets binding sites (EBS), which are also necessary for the activation by Ets-1. In contrast to Spi-1, a third EBS is necessary for the full response of this promoter fragment to Ets-1. The rest of the promoter activity has been located in the −986/−505 region, where three active EBSs have been identified. Furthermore, endogenous Fli-1 was found to be bound to its own gene promoter and to be able to promote the transactivation of its gene. These results suggest that Ets-1 activates an auto-regulatory loop of expression of fli-1 in endothelial cells, a mechanism that could have significant implications for the endothelial cell fate.

Lionneton F. Soncin F. Vandenbunder B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Functional EBSs have been identified in numerous promoters of genes that are involved in angiogenesis, among which Tie-1 (2Iljin K. Dube A. Kontusaari S. Korhonen J. Lahtinen I. Oettgen P. Alitalo K.

Breier G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are directly regulated by Ets-1. In a previous work, we reported that Ets-1 lowered endothelial cell density at confluence and regulated the expression of the endothelial specific VE-cadherin gene (7Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by controlling two EBSs located in the proximal part of the promoter. Here, we investigated the changes in expression of several other angiogenesis-related genes in response to Ets-1 in endothelial cells and in fibroblasts. Among the analyzed genes, we found the novel Ets-1 target gene fli-1. Thefli-1 gene was first identified as a common site for retroviral integration in Friend virus-induced erythroleukemias (8Ben-David Y. Giddens E.B. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1332-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). During mouse embryonic development, fli-1 messengers are detected as soon as embryonic day 8.5 in the blood islands of the extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac, the structures that also express Ets-1 and give rise to the primary endothelial cells. Afterward,fli-1 is expressed in endothelial cells throughout the embryo and in the maternal decidua (9Melet F. Motro B. Rossi D.J. Zhang L. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2708-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). fli-1gene disruption leads to early embryonic mortality;fli-1−/− embryos display vascular defects evidenced by hemorrhages in brain tissues and changes in the expression of the endothelial specific receptor Tie-2 (10Spyropoulos D.D.

A similar Fli-1 overexpression is observed in mouse erythroleukemia resulting from SFFV retrovirus infection, which activates theSpi-1 gene, another member of the ETS family (16Moreau-Gachelin F.

Ets-1 activation of the fli-1 promoter is mediated by half through the region that includes the transcription start sites; the other half of the activity is a result of the interaction of Ets-1 with several EBSs located further up in the promoter. We also show that Fli-1 is a transactivator of its own promoter.

Paired sample t test statistical analysis was performed using Analyze-it software. MBE, H5V endothelial, and 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (HyClone), 8 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Sodium pyruvate (1 mm) was added to the MBE culture medium. Endothelial cells were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes. A 3.40-kb region of fli-1promoter and intron-1 sequence was amplified by PCR from mouse genomic DNA (Atlas, CLONTECH) using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) and the AGG AAT TGG GTA CCA ATG AAG TTC GGG GA and AGC ACT CGA GCC TTT CTG AAG CGT GAC AGG G oligonucleotides. The fragment was cloned into theKpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3basic reporter vector (Promega) and named pFli1+i-Luc.

Cells were washed once with Met- and Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) and incubated for 4 h in the same medium in the presence of 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine andl-[35S]cysteine mixture (>1000 Ci/mol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; lysed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); and scraped using cell lifters. Cellular extracts were passed several times through a 0.45 × 12 mm needle and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts (13.6 106 cpm) were incubated with 4 μg of rabbit anti-mouse Fli-1 antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz) for 12 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. 50% protein G-agarose slurry (20 μl) was added and the samples incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and boiled in 50 μl of reducing sample buffer.

The gel was soaked in Amplify (AmershamBiosciences), dried, and autoradiographed. Control 3T3 cells (∼2.5 106 cells/78 cm2) were transfected with 30 μg of pcDNA3-Fli-1 vector using Exgen 500 (Euromedex) for 6 h, subsequently cultured for 18 h, and treated as above. 3T3 cells (60,000 cells/well) were seeded in 4-cm2 culture dishes and transfected 16 h later with 32 fmol of either reporter vector, 0.8 fmol of pCMV-β-galactosidase, and 32 fmol of pMFG-TagEts1 (7Lelièvre E.

Total amount of DNA was adjusted to 600 ng with pUC19. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 2 days later using a Lumat luminometer (Berthold). The normalized data were calculated as follows: luciferase activity (relative light units) × 1000/β-galactosidase activity (relative light units). EMSA were performed as described (7Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using recombinant mouse Ets-1 (22Lionneton F. Drobecq H. Soncin F. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 21: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and nuclear extracts were prepared according to Ref. 23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W.

Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponded to the following oligonucleotides: EBS1, GAG ATA GGA CTT CCT CCC CGA TCG CA; EBS1mt, GAG ATA GGA CTA CCT CCC CGA TCG CA; EBS2, AGT CAC TTC CCA AAA TTA; EBS2mt, AGT CAC TTG GCA AAA TTA; EBS3, AAA GTT TCA TCC GGT TAA CT; EBS3 mt, AAA GTT TCA TGG GGT TAA CT; EBS4, CTT TTT CGA TCC GCT ACA AC; EBS4mt, CTT TTT CGA TGG GCT ACA AC; EBS A, TTC TTT CTT TCT TCC TTC; EBS B, TCC TTC CTT CCT TCC TTC; EBS C, TCC TTC CTT TTT AAA AAT; EBS D, GAT CTG CAT CCG AAT CTC; EBS E, CCA GGT TAT CCC CTG TTC; EBS F, CAA ACT CTT CCG CCG TCT. The pFli1-Luc vector was digested withHindIII, purified, labeled using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and further digested with HpaI. The resulting probe was purified by agarose gel (1.2%) electrophoresis, electro-elution, and phenol-chloroform extraction. The DNA probe (20,000 cpm) was either G/A sequenced (24Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) or mixed with BSA (12.7 pmol) or recombinant Ets1 (rEts-1, 18.6 pmol; Ref. 22Lionneton F. Drobecq H. Soncin F.

DNase I (1 Kunitz milliunit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added and the samples further incubated for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C; the samples were phenol-chloroform-extracted and analyzed by 6% PAGE-urea in 0.09m Tris, 0.09 mm boric acid, 2 mmEDTA; and gels were dried and autoradiographed. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described in Ref. 25Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholarwith minor modifications. H5V cells grown in 78-cm2 dishes were treated with 1% formaldehyde in culture medium for 30 min at room temperature before quenching with 125 mm glycine. Cells were harvested and lysed, and nuclei and chromatin extracts were prepared as in Ref. 25Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar. To immunoprecipitate endogenous Fli-1 cross-linked to DNA, the chromatin samples were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Fli-1 (sc-356X, Santa Cruz) or of nonrelevant (anti-VE-cadherin, Bender) antibody, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose. The protein/DNA cross-links were reversed (25Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar), and the co-immunoprecipitated and purified genomic DNA fragments were assayed by PCR amplification using the primer pair ATC TGT GGG AAG AAA CGG AA and GTT GTA GCG GAT CGA AAA AG (40 cycles, 2 mmMgCl2) for the EBS1–3 region and GAG ACC AGC GCT TAG ATG CA and GAA CAG GGG ATA ACC TGG (35 cycles, 2 mmMgCl2) for the EBS A–E region of the promoter. PCR samples were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Control and Ets-1-overexpressing cells were previously established following a retroviral strategy (7Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse brain capillary MBE endothelial cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were infected with a MFG-TagEts1 retrovirus that provides the cells with a stable expression of Ets-1 together with resistance to neomycin (MBE-Ets-1 and 3T3-Ets-1). Control cells are noninfected (3T3 and MBE) or infected with the control MFG-Neo retrovirus (MBE-Neo and 3T3-Neo). This expression strategy results in an homogenous population of infected cells, which express Ets-1 at relatively high levels (Fig.1, top lane) (7Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When RT-PCR analysis of expression of several endothelial specific or angiogenesis-related genes was performed, the sole gene that was significantly up-regulated in response to Ets-1 among those tested wasfli-1 (Fig. 1). Moreover, and in contrast to our previous study on VE-cadherin (7Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), fli-1 messenger levels increased in MBE-Ets-1 endothelial cells but not in 3T3-Ets-1 fibroblasts. The transcript levels of VEGF, VEGF-B, Flt-1, Flk-1, Tie-2, EphB4, ephrinB2, PECAM-1, and Tsp-1 and of the ETS factors Ets-2, Erg, and Tel did not vary in these cell lines (data not shown). fli-1 regulation is quite complex, as the gene gives rise to three transcripts through the use of alternative promoters and transcription start sites and to two proteins through the use of alternative translation start codons. In F-MuLV-infected cells,fli-1 transcripts are initiated at the −398 and −204 sites relative to the ATG+1 start codon (Fig.2 A), whereas, in SFFV-infected cells and in normal spleen, fli-1 transcripts are initiated mainly at position −204 (17Starck J. Doubeikovski A. Sarrazin S. Gonnet C. Rao G. Skoultchi A. Godet J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, in mice, fli-1messengers give rise to a 51- and a 48-kDa Fli-1 protein by the use of ATG+1 and a second in-frame ATG codon located 100 bp downstream of ATG+1 (20Sarrazin S. Starck J. Gonnet C. Doubeikovski A. Melet F. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2959-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Another fli-1 mRNA has been identified and named fli-1b. It is produced from a second promoter on the same gene and gives rise to a transcript that starts by the noncoding exon-1b and leads to the production of the 48-kDa Fli-1 protein only (26Dhulipala P.D. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To identify which transcripts are up-regulated in response to Ets-1 in MBE-Ets-1 endothelial cells, RT-PCR analyses were performed using oligonucleotides that specifically recognize either exon-1, to detect fli-1, or exon-1b, to detect fli-1b. MBE-Ets-1 cells clearly overexpress fli-1, as seen in Fig.2 A, whereas little to no fli-1 transcript is detected in control MBE or MBE-Neo cells. On the other hand,fli-1b is detected neither in control nor in Ets-1-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A, bottom). The form of fli-1 transcripts initiated at the −398 site is overexpressed in MBE-Ets-1 cells as evidenced by RT-PCR (Fig.2 B, top). This −398 site appears to be the preferential transcription initiation site in MBE-Ets-1 cells, as the transcripts levels detected using oligonucleotides that allow the amplification of both the −398 and −204 transcripts are not much different from those observed when specifically amplifying the −398 transcripts (Fig. 2 B). It remains possible that a minor amount of fli-1 messengers is initiated at the −204 site. Accordingly to the observed overexpression of the fli-1mRNA in MBE-Ets-1 cells, higher levels of the 51-kDa Fli-1 protein are seen in these cells after immunoprecipitation with an anti-Fli-1 antibody (Fig. 2 C). A 3.40-kb fragment of the fli-1 gene starting 660 bp into thefli-1b promoter and extending to intron-1 was isolated, cloned, and placed in front of a luciferase reporter gene. When used in transactivation experiments, this −2437/+954 fragment responds to Ets-1 activation by ∼2-fold (Fig. 3,pFli1+i-Luc). Successive 5′ deletions show that the region activated by Ets-1 is contained in the −986/+954 and that removal of the −986/−505 fragment results in the loss of approximately half of this activity, suggesting that both the −986/−505 and the −505/+954 regions contain Ets-1-responsive elements. On the other hand, activation of the promoter by Ets-1 is strongly increased when intron-1 is deleted from the construct (Fig. 3, pFli1-Luc), suggesting that intron-1 is involved in a negative regulation of thefli-1 promoter. Analysis of the fli-1 promoter was performed in two parts. First, we studied the −505/−11 fragment because it contains the −270/−41 region that has been shown to contain two essential Spi-1-responding EBSs (17Starck J. Doubeikovski A. Sarrazin S. Gonnet C. Rao G. Skoultchi A. Godet J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), named here EBS1 (EBS 5′ in Ref. 17Starck J. Doubeikovski A. Sarrazin S. Gonnet C. Rao G. Skoultchi A. Godet J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and EBS2 (EBS 3′ in Ref. 17Starck J. Doubeikovski A. Sarrazin S. Gonnet C. Rao G. Skoultchi A. Godet J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In EMSA, rEts-1 is able to specifically bind to EBS1, and, to a lower extent, to EBS2, but not to the mutated counterparts, binding to EBS1 is more efficient as unlabeled EBS2 is a less effective competitor of binding than unlabeled EBS1 (Fig. 4 A). In transactivation experiments, Ets-1 induces a significant response of the corresponding −270/−41 promoter fragment (Fig. 4 B) and mutation of EBS1 reduces this response by 25%, whereas mutation of EBS2 has a minor effect, consistent with the observed differences in binding. In contrast to the response to Spi-1 (17Starck J. Doubeikovski A. Sarrazin S. Gonnet C. Rao G. Skoultchi A. Godet J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), mutation of both EBS1 and EBS2 does not result in the complete loss of Ets-1 transcriptional activation of the promoter fragment (Fig. 4,EBS1/2mt), suggesting that other unidentified EBSs are involved in this response. The −270/−41 fragment contains two other potential EBSs, named EBS3 and EBS4, located downstream from EBS2 (Fig.5 A). EMSA analysis shows that rEts-1 is able to specifically bind to EBS3, a property that is lost upon mutation of its GGAT core sequence (Fig. 5 B); no binding of rEts-1 to EBS4 is detected. When used in transactivation experiments, mutation of EBS3 has only a minor effect on the response of the promoter to Ets-1 (Fig. 5 C, EBS3mt). However, when the mutation of EBS3 is combined with the mutations of EBS1 and EBS2, a complete loss of response of the promoter fragment to Ets-1 is observed (Fig. 5 C, EBS1/2/3mt). Mutation of EBS4 alone increases the responsiveness of the promoter fragment, but mutation of EBS1, EBS2, and EBS4 does not significantly alter the response from that obtained with the EBS1/2mt construct (Fig.5 B, EBS1/2/4mt). Therefore, EBS1, EBS2, and EBS3 mediate together the response of the −270/−41 promoter fragment to Ets-1. The second half of the promoter response to Ets-1 is provided by the −986/−505 region located immediately ahead of the −505/−11 fragment (Fig. 3), a region that has not been studied before. In footprint experiments using rEts-1 and the −1032/−195 promoter fragment as probe, several regions, named EBS ABC, EBS D, and EBS F are protected from DNase I digestion (Fig.6 A); others such as EBS E are not. EBS D, E, and F are single sites, whereas EBS ABC is a stretch of 12 concatenated EBSs, in which we distinguish a central region (EBS B) and the most 5′ and 3′ EBS, named EBS A and C, respectively (Fig.6 C). EMSA analysis shows that rEts-1 is able to bind to the EBS B stretch, but not to the flanking EBS A or C. rEts1 also binds to EBS D and to EBS F but not to EBS E (Fig. 6 B). Accordingly to the binding properties, the activation -fold of the −986/−11 promoter region by Ets-1 is reduced by 29% when EBS ABC is removed (Fig. 7, −817/−11-Luc), confirming that the EBS B stretch is important for the response of the promoter to Ets-1. Further deletion of the EBS DF leads to a 37% reduction in the -fold of activation of the fli-1 promoter by Ets-1 (Fig. 7, −719/−11-Luc). This construct and the −505/−11 Luc are still responding to Ets-1 because of the presence of the active −270/−41 region studied above.Figure 7Ets-1 promotes the −986/−505fli-1 promoter fragment. Ets-1 activates the intact promoter fragment 3.8-fold, whereas removal of the −986/−817 region, which contains EBS ABC, reduces the response by 29%. Deletion of the −2437/−719 region, which removes EBS D–F, further decreases the response to Ets-1. Each histogram represents the average -fold of induction of normalized values ± S.D. of triplicate points.Numbers indicate the normalized basal activity of the constructs ± S.D. The data are from one experiment representative of a set of four experiments performed in similar conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that Ets-1 was present on the Fli-1 EBS in endothelial nuclear extracts, we performed EMSA analysis using DNA probes that corresponded to the identified EBS and nuclear extracts from H5V cells, which express fli-1 under normal culture conditions. H5V nuclear extracts contain several ETS factors, which bind to the various identified EBSs. When adding a specific anti-Ets-1 antibody, a very discrete supershift (Fig. 8 A,lane 5, open arrow) of a complex formed by Ets-1 with EBS3 is observed. In addition, the antibody supershifts a faster migrating specific band (Fig. 8 A,lanes 5 and 7, open arrowhead), which most probably corresponds to a degradation product of Ets-1. Such discrete Ets-1 supershifts are also observed with EBS1, EBS2, and EBS F (data not shown). On the other hand, when testing for the presence of Fli-1 in these complexes, a strong supershift was detected with EBS3 (lanes 6 and 8in Fig. 8 A, filled arrow), with EBS B (lane 7 in Fig. 8 B, filled arrow), and with EBS1 and EBS2 (data not shown), together with the complete loss of a major band from the initial complex (Fig.8, filled arrowheads). This was rather unexpected and suggested that the act"

The antibody specifically stains the photoreceptor layer, where we recently reported an absence of PG-M/versican. In this study, we re-characterized the antibody and identified the molecule that reacts to MY-174 at the photoreceptor layer. Immunohistochemistry localized the antigen to the matrix surrounding photoreceptors. A variety of glycosidase digestions showed that the antigen is the 150-kDa glycoprotein that has sialylatedN- and O-linked glycoconjugates having a molecular mass of more than 30-kDa. The peptide sequences obtained from purified MY-174 antigen showed we had sequenced a full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 2787 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 928 amino acids, with 56 and 54% identities to human and mouse sialoprotein associated with cones and rods (SPACRs), respectively, and with the structural features observed in SPACRs. The specific sialylated O-glycoconjugates here are involved in the epitope structure for MY-174. SPACR first appeared by embryonic days 15–16, and expression increased with developmental age, paralleling the adhesion between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium. Thus, we concluded that the MY-174 antigen at the photoreceptor layer, a developmentally regulated glycoprotein, is identical to chick SPACR and may be involved in a novel system mediating adhesion between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium.

In the eye, MY-174 specifically stains the photoreceptor layer (1Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, recently we demonstrated an absence of PG-M/versican at the chick photoreceptor layer using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all alternatively spliced forms of PG-M/versican (5Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These inconsistent results suggest that MY-174 does not recognize PG-M/versican but another molecule in the photoreceptor layer.The IPM (interphotoreceptormatrix),1 resides in an extracellular compartment between the outer limiting membrane of the neural retina and apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium and is composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (6Adler A. Severin K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Adler A. Klucznik K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A variety of important reactions relating to vision, including visual pigment chromophore exchange, metabolite trafficking, photoreceptor alignment, and membrane turnover, is thought to be mediated by the IPM (8Hageman G.S. Johnson L.V. Osborne N.N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal Research. Pergamon, Oxford1991: 207-249Google Scholar). However, one of the most essential functions of IPM is that of a biological glue for retinal adhesion through its viscous adhesive properties (9Zauberman H. Berman E.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1969; 8: 276-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zauberman H. Zinn K.M. Marmor M.F. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1979: 192-204Google Scholar). Retinal adhesiveness can be weakened by treatments with enzymes such as neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, and chondroitinase ABC (11Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 498-503PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular blocking of glycosylation with xyloside also prevents the secretion of proteoglycans and results in retinal detachment (13Lazarus H.S. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 364-376PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, or glycoproteins of the IPM are involved in retinal adhesion. However, the specific IPM molecule that mediates adhesion has not been identified.SPACR (sialoprotein associated withcones and rods) is a hyaluronan-binding glycoprotein newly identified in adult human PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)-insoluble IPM (14Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Landers R.A. Myers K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Tien L. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp.

This 147- to 150-kDa glycoprotein was purified by wheat germ agglutinin-affinity chromatography and characterized (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been shown that (a) SPACR is heavily sialylated, (b) both N- andO-linked glycoconjugates are present in the molecule, and (c) glycoconjugates account for ∼30% of the molecular mass (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, mouse SPACR was also cloned and characterized (18Lee J.W. Chen Q. Rayborn M.E. Shadrach K.G. Crabb J.W. Rodriguez I.R. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both human and mouse SPACRs have a large central mucin-like domain flanked by consensus sites for N-linked oligosaccharide attachment, one EGF-like domain near the C-terminal, and several potential hyaluronan-binding motifs in common. Interestingly, biochemical studies showed that SPACR is a glycoprotein in human and a proteoglycan in mouse. Except for the ability of SPACR to bind hyaluronan (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), other properties or functional roles of SPACR remain unknown.In the present study, we first examined the localizations of the retinal antigen that binds to MY-174 in the photoreceptor layer. We then determined a full-length cDNA of MY-174 antigen at photoreceptor layer and showed that the antigen corresponded to chick SPACR. Finally, to investigate the biological significance of SPACR, we compared the expressions of chick SPACR and the occurrence of adhesion between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium during development.DISCUSSIONHere we showed that a MY-174 antigen in the IPM is the ortholog of human SPACR and that there is an increase in SPACR expression during chick development. We also showed that the expression increases in parallel with retinal adhesiveness, implying that SPACR might be involved in the adhesion between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium.We showed that sialylated O-linked glycoconjugates are involved in the epitope structure recognized by MY-174, which was developed as a monoclonal antibody to the core protein of PG-M/versican. The antigen was prepared by mild alkali treatment of the core protein of PG-M/versican, and the treatment eliminated glycoconjugates from the core protein (1Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, when we made fusion proteins for the full length of PG-M/versican (V0) by Escherichia coli, MY-174 showed no immunoreactivity to the fusion core protein (data not shown). No immunoreactive clones could be detected by a MY-174 in screening of the chick retina cDNA library (data not shown). Acharya et al. (16Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) mentioned that the major glycoconjugate on SPACR is the O-linked carbohydrate, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAc and that the O-linked sugar in SPACR could have a structure similar to that present in bone sialoprotein and aggrecan. At this stage we speculate that any residualO-glycans left on the core protein of PG-M/versican, specific but similar to those characteristic of SPACR, were the antigen for MY-174.Because our previous study using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all PG-M/versican forms showed no staining in the photoreceptor layers of adult chick retinas (5Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we also thought it unlikely that PG-M/versican would be a target for MY-174 in retina. We have repeated this published observation with 2B1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all human PG-M/versican forms (25Isogai Z. Shinomura T. Yamakawa N. Takeuchi J. Tsuji T. Heinegård D. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar), but again no specific staining of the human photoreceptor layer could be detected (data not shown). Furthermore, no specific staining at an adult mouse photoreceptor layer could be detected using polyclonal antibodies against mouse PG-M/versican (data not shown).MY-174 staining showed resistance to a combination of neuraminidase andO-glycanase treatments around the outer segments of photoreceptor cells. Tien et al. (15Tien L. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also reported that wheat germ agglutinin staining of SPACR is resistant to neuraminidase around the outer segments of photoreceptor cells in retinal sections. The reason for the resistance to enzymatic treatments is unclear, but the IPM seems to have different properties around inner or outer segments of photoreceptor cells.Acharya et al. (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed human SPACR has a functional hyaluronan-binding domain. This domain (RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif) corresponded to 280KEIHVLGFK288 in chick SPACR. It showed high consensus with human and mouse SPACR. This is a candidate for the RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif, because a single acidic group can be present in one residue inside either flanking basic residue in a B7XB RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif (26Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Our data showed chick SPACR can bind hyaluronan. Mutagenesis studies of the putative hyaluronan binding motif will be required to establish the site of hyaluronan binding in chick SPACR. Because hyaluronan is a prominent constituent of the IPM in all species studied except mouse (27Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 65: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi M. Tammi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we speculate that SPACR and hyaluronan form an adhesive complex in the matrix between the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium. Some reports have indeed shown that the insoluble-IPM is involved in the adhesion. A histochemical study using experimentally detached retinas showed that the insoluble cone matrix sheath was closely associated with both the cone photoreceptor and the apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting that this sheath mediated attachment (29Hollyfield J.G. Varner H.H. Rayborn M.E. Osterfeld A.M. Retina. 1989; 9: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Insoluble IPM constituents could be found in vitreous from eyes suffering from rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (30Russell S.R. Hageman G.S. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1997; 123: 386-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Fig. 7 (A–C) shows the expression levels of mRNA, core protein, and sialylated O-glycan that were analyzed by using labeled cDNA-probe, O-46F, and MY-174, respectively. Successively, each expression increased in a comprehensible order during the development, because the translation processes were followed by a glycosylation process. There are some different expression patterns between mRNA and the core protein. One possibility is that the processes for transcription and translation and the glycosylation that follows are regulated in different manners in SPACR expression. Another possibility is that, at earlier developmental stages, there might be an increased turnover of the protein, because the protein levels at E15–E16 are significantly lower than the corresponding mRNA levels at the same developmental stages.Adler and Gibson (23Adler A.J. Gibson B.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) showed that neural retinal adhesiveness starts at E17–E18 and that this is coincident with maturation of photoreceptor outer segments. In this study, we examined retinal adhesion using a peeling method (11Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 21Endo E.G. Yao X.Y. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 1390-1396PubMed Google Scholar, 22Marmor M.F. Prog. Retinal Res. 1993; 12: 179-204Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although there is no adhesion at E15, we detected substantial adhesiveness at E16 by this method. The expression of SPACR in adult retina is 1.9 times the newborn level, but retinal adhesiveness of adult retina is almost equal to the newborn one. We suggest that adhesiveness does not increase after a threshold SPACR expression level is reached.Chondroitin sulfates are major constituents of the IPM (31Porrello K. LaVail M.M. Curr. Eye. Res. 1986; 5: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chick SPACR is not a chondroitin-type proteoglycan, because the mobility of the chick SPACR band showed no significant change after chondroitinase ABC treatment. We used the antibodies for ΔDi6S-, ΔDi4S-, and ΔDi0S-chondroitin epitopes exposed following chondroitinase ABC digestion to determine whether a chick SPACR core protein is released. That there were no specific bands for each epitope suggested that chick SPACR is not a chondroitin-type proteoglycan (data not shown), whereas Fig. 4 showed SG residues, SGD residues, and DGS residues as candidates for chondroitin sulfate attachment consensus sequences. Intracellular blocking of the attachment of chondroitin sulfate chains with xyloside prevented the secretion of proteoglycans and resulted in retinal detachment (13Lazarus H.S. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 364-376PubMed Google Scholar). Retinal adhesiveness was also weakened by chondroitinase ABC (11Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are involved in the adhesion. However, our report implicates a different type of molecule in this process.Our present study showed that SPACR has a pericellular distribution reminiscent of cell membranes (Fig. 1 C). To clarify whether SPACR is associated with the cell membrane, we tried a similar immunohistochemical study using O46-F and O47-F. However, these antibodies were not available for immunohistochemical study. Two SEA modules (32Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) corresponding to 231–348 and 728–853 in amino acid sequence positions of chick SPACR are also conserved in human and mouse SPACR (Pfam data base). The SEA module found in a number of heavily O-linked glycosylated membrane-associated adhesive proteins is considered to regulate receptor-ligand alliance by proteolytic cleavage (33Wreschner D.H. McGuckin M.A. Williams S.J. Baruch A. Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N. Keydar I. Neophytou P. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Bishop et al. (34Bishop P.N. Boulton M. McLeod D. Stoddart R.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed sialylated glycans at the IPM and photoreceptor plasmalemmata by histochemical study. There is no evidence regarding the association of SPACR with the cell membrane, but SPACR is a molecule potentially associated with the cell membrane. To clarify the retinal adhesion mechanism and other biological functions of SPACR, we must establish anin vivo system.In summary, the present findings demonstrate that the MY-174 antigen at the photoreceptor layer is identical to chick SPACR. TheO-glycans on the core protein of PG-M/versican are similar to those characteristics of chick SPACR and are considered to be the antigen for MY-174. The correlation of the appearance of SPACR and the development of retinal adhesiveness suggests that SPACR may be a functional adhesive between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium. MY-174, a monoclonal antibody, has been shown to recognize chick PG-M/versican (1Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a member of the hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan family (2Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13517-13525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 4Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the eye, MY-174 specifically stains the photoreceptor layer (1Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, recently we demonstrated an absence of PG-M/versican at the chick photoreceptor layer using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all alternatively spliced forms of PG-M/versican (5Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These inconsistent results suggest that MY-174 does not recognize PG-M/versican but another molecule in the photoreceptor layer. The IPM (interphotoreceptormatrix),1 resides in an extracellular compartment between the outer limiting membrane of the neural retina and apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium and is composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (6Adler A. Severin K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Adler A. Klucznik K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A variety of important reactions relating to vision, including visual pigment chromophore exchange, metabolite trafficking, photoreceptor alignment, and membrane turnover, is thought to be mediated by the IPM (8Hageman G.S. Johnson L.V. Osborne N.N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal Research. Pergamon, Oxford1991: 207-249Google Scholar). However, one of the most essential functions of IPM is that of a biological glue for retinal adhesion through its viscous adhesive properties (9Zauberman H. Berman E.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1969; 8: 276-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zauberman H. Zinn K.M. Marmor M.F. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1979: 192-204Google Scholar). Retinal adhesiveness can be weakened by treatments with enzymes such as neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, and chondroitinase ABC (11Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 498-503PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular blocking of glycosylation with xyloside also prevents the secretion of proteoglycans and results in retinal detachment (13Lazarus H.S. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 364-376PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, or glycoproteins of the IPM are involved in retinal adhesion. However, the specific IPM molecule that mediates adhesion has not been identified. SPACR (sialoprotein associated withcones and rods) is a hyaluronan-binding glycoprotein newly identified in adult human PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)-insoluble IPM (14Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Landers R.A. Myers K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Tien L. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp.

This 147- to 150-kDa glycoprotein was purified by wheat germ agglutinin-affinity chromatography and characterized (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been shown that (a) SPACR is heavily sialylated, (b) both N- andO-linked glycoconjugates are present in the molecule, and (c) glycoconjugates account for ∼30% of the molecular mass (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, mouse SPACR was also cloned and characterized (18Lee J.W. Chen Q. Rayborn M.E. Shadrach K.G. Crabb J.W. Rodriguez I.R. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both human and mouse SPACRs have a large central mucin-like domain flanked by consensus sites for N-linked oligosaccharide attachment, one EGF-like domain near the C-terminal, and several potential hyaluronan-binding motifs in common. Interestingly, biochemical studies showed that SPACR is a glycoprotein in human and a proteoglycan in mouse. Except for the ability of SPACR to bind hyaluronan (17Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), other properties or functional roles of SPACR remain unknown. In the present study, we first examined the localizations of the retinal antigen that binds to MY-174 in the photoreceptor layer. We then determined a full-length cDNA of MY-174 antigen at photoreceptor layer and showed that the antigen corresponded to chick SPACR. Finally, to investigate the biological significance of SPACR, we compared the expressions of chick SPACR and the occurrence of adhesion between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium during development. DISCUSSIONHere we showed that a MY-174 antigen in the IPM is the ortholog of human SPACR and that there is an increase in SPACR expression during chick development. We also showed that the expression increases in parallel with retinal adhesiveness, implying that SPACR might be involved in the adhesion between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium.We showed that sialylated O-linked glycoconjugates are involved in the epitope structure recognized by MY-174, which was developed as a monoclonal antibody to the core protein of PG-M/versican. The antigen was prepared by mild alkali treatment of the core protein of PG-M/versican, and the treatment eliminated glycoconjugates from the core protein (1Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, when we made fusion proteins for the full length of PG-M/versican (V0) by Escherichia coli, MY-174 showed no immunoreactivity to the fusion core protein (data not shown). No immunoreactive clones could be detected by a MY-174 in screening of the chick retina cDNA library (data not shown). Acharya et al. (16Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) mentioned that the major glycoconjugate on SPACR is the O-linked carbohydrate, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAc and that the O-linked sugar in SPACR could have a structure similar to that present in bone sialoprotein and aggrecan. At this stage we speculate that any residualO-glycans left on the core protein of PG-M/versican, specific but similar to those characteristic of SPACR, were the antigen for MY-174.Because our previous study using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all PG-M/versican forms showed no staining in the photoreceptor layers of adult chick retinas (5Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we also thought it unlikely that PG-M/versican would be a target for MY-174 in retina. We have repeated this published observation with 2B1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all human PG-M/versican forms (25Isogai Z. Shinomura T. Yamakawa N. Takeuchi J. Tsuji T. Heinegård D. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar), but again no specific staining of the human photoreceptor layer could be detected (data not shown). Furthermore, no specific staining at an adult mouse photoreceptor layer could be detected using polyclonal antibodies against mouse PG-M/versican (data not shown).MY-174 staining showed resistance to a combination of neuraminidase andO-glycanase treatments around the outer segments of photoreceptor cells.

This domain (RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif) corresponded to 280KEIHVLGFK288 in chick SPACR. It showed high consensus with human and mouse SPACR. This is a candidate for the RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif, because a single acidic group can be present in one residue inside either flanking basic residue in a B7XB RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif (26Yang B.

Mutagenesis studies of the putative hyaluronan binding motif will be required to establish the site of hyaluronan binding in chick SPACR. Because hyaluronan is a prominent constituent of the IPM in all species studied except mouse (27Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi R. Exp.

Some reports have indeed shown that the insoluble-IPM is involved in the adhesion. A histochemical study using experimentally detached retinas showed that the insoluble cone matrix sheath was closely associated with both the cone photoreceptor and the apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting that this sheath mediated attachment (29Hollyfield J.G. Varner H.H. Rayborn M.E. Osterfeld A.M. Retina. 1989; 9: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Insoluble IPM constituents could be found in vitreous from eyes suffering from rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (30Russell S.R. Hageman G.S. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1997; 123: 386-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Fig. 7 (A–C) shows the expression levels of mRNA, core protein, and sialylated O-glycan that were analyzed by using labeled cDNA-probe, O-46F, and MY-174, respectively.

Although there is no adhesion at E15, we detected substantial adhesiveness at E16 by this method. The expression of SPACR in adult retina is 1.9 times the newborn level, but retinal adhesiveness of adult retina is almost equal to the newborn one. We suggest that adhesiveness does not increase after a threshold SPACR expression level is reached.Chondroitin sulfates are major constituents of the IPM (31Porrello K. LaVail M.M. Curr. Eye. Res. 1986; 5: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chick SPACR is not a chondroitin-type proteoglycan, because the mobility of the chick SPACR band showed no significant change after chondroitinase ABC treatment. We used the antibodies for ΔDi6S-, ΔDi4S-, and ΔDi0S-chondroitin epitopes exposed following chondroitinase ABC digestion to determine whether a chick SPACR core protein is released. That there were no specific bands for each epitope suggested that chick SPACR is not a chondroitin-type proteoglycan (data not shown), whereas Fig. 4 showed SG residues, SGD residues, and DGS residues as candidates for chondroitin sulfate attachment consensus sequences. Intracellular blocking of the attachment of chondroitin sulfate chains with xyloside prevented the secretion of proteoglycans and resulted in retinal detachment (13Lazarus H.S. Hageman G.S. Invest.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed human SPACR has a functional hyaluronan-binding domain. This domain (RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif) corresponded to 280KEIHVLGFK288 in chick SPACR. It showed high consensus with human and mouse SPACR. This is a candidate for the RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif, because a single acidic group can be present in one residue inside either flanking basic residue in a B7XB RHAMM-type hyaluronan binding motif (26Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Our data showed chick SPACR can bind hyaluronan. Mutagenesis studies of the putative hyaluronan binding motif will be required to establish the site of hyaluronan binding in chick SPACR. Because hyaluronan is a prominent constituent of the IPM in all species studied except mouse (27Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 65: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi M. Tammi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we speculate that SPACR and hyaluronan form an adhesive complex in the matrix between the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium. Some reports have indeed shown that the insoluble-IPM is involved in the adhesion. A histochemical study using experimentally detached retinas showed that the insoluble cone matrix sheath was closely associated with both the cone photoreceptor and the apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting that this sheath mediated attachment (29Hollyfield J.G. Varner H.H. Rayborn M.E. Osterfeld A.M. Retina. 1989; 9: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Insoluble IPM constituents could be found in vitreous from eyes suffering from rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (30Russell S.R. Hageman G.S. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1997; 123: 386-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 (A–C) shows the expression levels of mRNA, core protein, and sialylated O-glycan that were analyzed by using labeled cDNA-probe, O-46F, and MY-174, respectively. Successively, each expression increased in a comprehensible order during the development, because the translation processes were followed by a glycosylation process. There are some different expression patterns between mRNA and the core protein. One possibility is that the processes for transcription and translation and the glycosylation that follows are regulated in different manners in SPACR expression. Another possibility is that, at earlier developmental stages, there might be an increased turnover of the protein, because the protein levels at E15–E16 are significantly lower than the corresponding mRNA levels at the same developmental stages. Adler and Gibson (23Adler A.J. Gibson B.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) showed that neural retinal adhesiveness starts at E17–E18 and that this is coincident with maturation of photoreceptor outer segments. In this study, we examined retinal adhesion using a peeling method (11Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 21Endo E.G. Yao X.Y. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 1390-1396PubMed Google Scholar, 22Marmor M.F. Prog. Retinal Res. 1993; 12: 179-204Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although there is no adhesion at E15, we detected substantial adhesiveness at E16 by this method. The expression of SPACR in adult retina is 1.9 times the newborn level, but retinal adhesiveness of adult retina is almost equal to the newborn one. We suggest that adhesiveness does not increase after a threshold SPACR expression level is reached. Chondroitin sulfates are major constituents of the IPM (31Porrello K. LaVail M.M. Curr. Eye. Res. 1986; 5: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chick SPACR is not a chondroitin-type proteoglycan, because the mobility of the chick SPACR band showed no significant change after chondroitinase ABC treatment. We used the antibodies for ΔDi6S-, ΔDi4S-, and ΔDi0S-chondroitin epitopes exposed following chondroitinase ABC digestion to determine whether a chick SPACR core protein is released. That there were no specific bands for each epitope suggested that chick SPACR is not a chondroitin-type proteoglycan (data not shown), whereas Fig. 4 showed SG residues, SGD residues, and DGS residues as candidates for chondroitin sulfate attachment consensus sequences. Intracellular blocking of the attachment of chondroitin sulfate chains with xyloside prevented the secretion of proteoglycans and resulted in retinal detachment (13Lazarus H.S. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 364-376PubMed Google Scholar). Retinal adhesiveness was also weakened by chondroitinase ABC (11Yao X.Y. Hageman G.S. Marmor M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are involved in the adhesion. However, our report implicates a different type of molecule in this process. Our present study showed that SPACR has a pericellular distribution reminiscent of cell membranes (Fig. 1 C). To clarify whether SPACR is associated with the cell membrane, we tried a similar immunohistochemical study using O46-F and O47-F. However, these antibodies were not available for immunohistochemical study. Two SEA modules (32Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) corresponding to 231–348 and 728–853 in amino acid sequence positions of chick SPACR are also conserved in human and mouse SPACR (Pfam data base). The SEA module found in a number of heavily O-linked glycosylated membrane-associated adhesive proteins is considered to regulate receptor-ligand alliance by proteolytic cleavage (33Wreschner D.H. McGuckin M.A. Williams S.J. Baruch A. Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N. Keydar I. Neophytou P. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Bishop et al. (34Bishop P.N. Boulton M. McLeod D. Stoddart R.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed sialylated glycans at the IPM and photoreceptor plasmalemmata by histochemical study. There is no evidence regarding the association of SPACR with the cell membrane, but SPACR is a molecule potentially associated with the cell membrane. To clarify the retinal adhesion mechanism and other biological functions of SPACR, we must establish anin vivo system. In summary, the present findings demonstrate that the MY-174 antigen at the photoreceptor layer is identical to chick SPACR. TheO-glycans on the core protein of PG-M/versican are similar to those characteristics of chick SPACR and are considered to be the antigen for MY-174. The correlation of the appearance of SPACR and the development of retinal adhesiveness suggests that SPACR may be a functional adhesive between neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium."

H5 contains a stretch of eight residues that are similar in voltage-dependent K+ channels, Kvs, and this stretch is called the signature sequence of K+ channels. Because mutations in this sequence altered selectivity in Kvs, it has been designated as the selectivity filter. Previously, we used N-glycosylation substitution mutants to map the extracellular topology of a weak inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir1.1 or ROMK1, and found that the entire H5 segment was extracellular. We now report utilization of introducedN-glycosylation sites, NX(S/T), at positions Ser128 in E1, and Gln140, Ileu143, and Phe147 in the H5 sequence of a strong inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir2.1. Furthermore, we show that biotinylated channel proteins with N-linked oligosaccharides attached at positions 140 and 143 in the signature sequence are located at the cell surface. Mutant channels were functional as detected by whole-cell and single-channel recordings. Unlike Kir1.1, position Lys117 was not occupied.

These channels conduct current more efficiently in the inward than the outward direction due to a voltage-dependent block by intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines and have high selectivity for K+ over Na+ (1Ho K.

Kirs differ in the degree of rectification and in single-channel conductance (3Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Physiologically, Kirs maintain the resting membrane potential, regulate cellular excitability, and secrete K+ necessary for either K recycling or K excretion. Based on hydropathy plots, Kirs are predicted to have two α-helical transmembrane segments, M1 and M2, and cytoplasmic N and C termini (see Fig. 1 A, left panel). The putative pore-forming segment H5 is thought to be intramembranous and links the two extracellular loops, E1 and E2. Voltage-dependent K+ channels, Kvs, have a highly homologous H5 segment that appears to be the major pore determinant (see Fig. 1 B) (7Yellen G. Jurman M. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1991; 251: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Hartmann H.A. Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Taglialatela M. Joho R.H. Brown A.M.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). H5 contains eight highly conserved residues and has been proposed as the selectivity filter of K+ channels (see Fig.1 B) (9Heginbotham L., Lu, Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Three residues in the signature sequence G(Y/F)G are absolutely conserved among all K+ channels. The prediction of K selectivity by H5 is in agreement with the crystal structure of a K+ channel, KcsA, from Streptomyces lividans (11Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar) in which five residues, TVGYG, of the signature sequence are critical for selective permeation. In this structural model, residues TVGYG of KcsA, as well as the corresponding residues of other K+ selective channels, are proposed to orient their side chains away from the pore so that backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms form the selectivity filter, and thus GYG are absolutely required for K+ selectivity. However, for Kir6 and eag K+ channel families, the accuracy of this general K-selective pore design was challenged because a Phe is substituted at the Tyr position of the GYG sequence (see Fig. 1 B). In addition, a recent study of KcsA has shown that this same nonconserved substitution does not alter electrophysiological properties (12Splitt H. Meuser D Borovok I. Betzler M. Schrempf H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two recent studies of Kir2.1 also demonstrate that K+ selectivity was retained when Tyr was mutated to Phe (13So I. Ashmole I. Davies N.W. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the amide carbonyls of the invariant Gly residues were changed to ester carbonyls (14Lu T. Ting A.Y. Mainland J. Jan L.Y. Schultz P.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have mapped the topological structure of Kir1.1, a weak inwardly rectifying K+ channel, using biochemical methods to identify which novel N-glycosylation sites of Kirs are utilized (15Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The initial steps of N-glycosylation occur on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore only extracytoplasmic segments of membrane proteins can be glycosylated (18Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). Our findings for Kir1.1 were inconsistent with the accepted Kir topological model, because positions 117, 128, 133, 139, 144, 146, and 153 between M1 and M2, including the signature sequence, could be glycosylated. The results indicate that H5 is part of the extracellular loop between M1 and M2 and does not penetrate the membrane (15Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To assess whether this biochemically derived topological structure is an accurate description of other Kirs, we examined a different member of the Kir class, Kir2.1 (see Fig.1 B). These two distinct inward rectifiers were chosen based on their different biophysical properties; Kir2.1 is a strong inwardly rectifying channel and exhibits intrinsic gating, whereas Kir1.1 is a weak inwardly rectifying channel and lacks time-dependent gating (3Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutants were engineered to contain one novel site. Glycosylation was demonstrated by immunoband shift assays before and after either tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-glycosylation) or endoglycosidase H (an enzyme that cleaves high mannose oligosaccharides from glycoproteins) treatment. Cell surface expression was detected by biotinylation of surface proteins and whole-cell and single-channel currents. We found that introduced N-glycosylation sites at positions 140 and 143, in the middle of the signature sequence, were utilized and that both glycoforms were present in the plasma membrane. Positions 128 (E1) and 147 (H5) were also glycosylated (see Fig. 1 A,right panel). All mutant proteins produced functional channels at the cell surface. Taken together our findings indicate that H5, as well as the signature sequence, of the Kir class of K+ channels is topologically extracellular. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. A TA cloning kit was purchased from Invitrogen; TNM-FH insect medium was from JRH Biosciences; a BaculoGold transfection kit was from BD PharMingen; fetal bovine serum and pluronic F-68 10% solution were from Invitrogen; Zwittergent 3–10 was from Calbiochem; Tween 20, tunicamycin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aminobenzamidine, bovine serum albumin, gentamicin, M2 resin, M2 antibodies, and trypan blue solution were from Sigma Chemical Co.; endoglycosidase H was from New England BioLabs; and Qiagen columns were from Qiagen. PCR was used to fuse the oligonucleotide encoding the M2 FLAG epitope (peptide DYKDDDDK) to the N terminus of Kir2.1 cDNA. All Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutants were engineered by PCR overlap extension using FLAG/Kir2.1 cDNA as template (15Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PCR products were subcloned into pCRII and pCR2.1 for amplification and sequencing and subsequently subcloned into either NotI/BamHI double-digested baculovirus transfer vector (pVL1392) or EcoRI-digested baculovirus transfer vector (pACSG2). Standard procedures were followed for DNA amplification, isolation, and sequencing (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown under natural atmosphere at 27 °C in Hinks' TNM-FH insect medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.1% pluronic F-68. Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures and passaged every 3–7 days. Recombinant proteins were produced in suspension cultures at a cell density of 1–1.2 × 106 cells/ml using viral supernatant from suspension culture amplifications. The recombinant baculoviruses were generated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with baculovirus vectors encoding WT Kir2.1 and Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutant cDNAs, and BaculoGold viral DNA (modified Autography californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD PharMingen). Monolayer cultures were infected with the co-transfected viral supernatant to prepare viral seed stocks. High viral titers were produced by infecting suspension cultures (0.5–0.9 × 106 cells/ml) with viral seed stocks. The viral supernatant and the infected cells were collected 3–5 days and 1–3 days after infection, respectively. The occupancy of introduced N-glycosylation sites was verified by treating cells with tunicamycin. Tunicamycin (25 μg/ml) was added to infected cells in suspension cultures about 15 min after inoculation with viral supernatant. Infected Sf9 cells (4 × 107 to 5 × 107) were harvested ∼24–48 h post-infection (p.i.) by centrifugation at 2000 × gfor 10 min. Cell pellets were washed with PBS three times and then resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, pH 7.4, 0.3 m KCl, 2% Zwittergent 3–10, or Triton X-100, 1.5 ml) plus 80 μl of the M2 antibody affinity gel (Eastman Kodak) resuspended in PBS. M2 is an anti-mouse monoclonal IgG that recognizes the FLAG epitope attached to Kir2.1 proteins. The sample was gently rocked for 1 h at room temperature. Resin was washed thrice with the solubilization buffer without the detergent (1 ml) and then washed three times with PBS. Beads were resuspended in 125–150 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2×) and either heated at 90 °C for 4 min or incubated overnight at room temperature and then diluted appropriately with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1×) prior to separation on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes and probed with the M2 antibody (16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25217-25223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The gels were run until the 46-kDa rainbow marker was 0.25–2.5 cm from the bottom of the gel. Only the sections of the gels that contain Kir2.1 proteins are shown. Infected cells were harvested (2.2 × 107 or 4.4 × 107) after 24 h post-infection by spinning cells at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.1, 100 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 150 mm NaCl). The resultant cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS (pH 8.1). We next added 0.7 mg of sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) per milliliter of reaction volume and gently rocked the reaction at room temperature for 30 min. The biotinylated cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.1) to remove biotinylation reagent. Then the biotinylated cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS (pH 7.5, 20 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 0.5 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100/Zwittergent 3–10). The resultant sample was sonicated for 30–60 s to break up the large cell debris and shear genomic DNA and subsequently incubated on ice. 80 μl of streptavidin-agarose was then added to the sample, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h on a rotator and then the resin was washed three times with PBS (pH 7.5, 20 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 0.5m NaCl). For endoglycosidase H treatment, resin was washed three times with endoglycosidase H buffer. The reaction volume of endoglycosidase H reaction was 100 μl, plus or minus 2 μl of endoglycosidase H. The sample was washed twice with PBS (pH 7.5) then the resultant resin was resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Infected cells from suspension cultures were added 20–24 h p.i. to Petri dishes, containing glass coverslips, and subsequently analyzed at room temperature for up to 72 h p.i. Cells (about 1.25 × 106) for patch-clamp analysis were also directly infected on Petri dishes containing glass coverslips with similar incubations times and temperatures. Currents were measured at room temperature using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) with membrane capacitance and resistance compensations in cells. Fire-polished pipette electrodes had tip resistances of 3–10 MΩ for whole-cell recordings and 5–11 MΩ for single-channel recordings. The pClamp6 suite of programs (Axon Instruments) was used for voltage pulse protocols, data acquisition, and analysis. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and subsequently sampled at 2 kHz for whole-cell recording and 10 kHz for single-channel recording. Group data are presented as mean ± S.D. (number of observations). Origin 4.0 (Microcal Software) was used for statistical analysis and graphics. In our topological model of Kir1.1, the putative H5 segment is extracellular (15Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25217-25223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To assess whether the extracellularity of this segment is novel to Kir1.1 or is a general structural feature of Kirs, we have studied a strong inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir2.1, usingN-glycosylation tagging. N-Glycosylation sites were introduced one at a time in and near the pore-forming segment, H5 (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Each Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutant was designed to contain one unique site to minimize disruptions in the protein. The native consensus N-glycosylation site (NET, amino acid residues 190–192) was not removed, because it was not utilized (Fig. 2). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutants. Glycosylation was demonstrated by immunoband shift assays before and after tunicamycin treatment. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings evaluated channel structure and surface expression. Cell surface expression of glycosylated channel protein was detected by biotinylation of surface proteins and, subsequently, by immunoband shift assays, in the presence and absence of endoglycosidase H digestion. Proteins were immunoaffinity-purified and detected by Western blotting using the M2 FLAG epitope fused to the N terminus (WT Kir2.1, K117N, S128N, Q140N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T). One band was observed for WT Kir2.1 at ∼48 kDa, as well as for K117N (see Fig.2). The observed molecular mass was similar to the calculated molecular mass of 49,623 Da. Two bands were detected for S128N, Q140N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T. The lower band was similar to that of WT Kir2.1, whereas the upper band migrated to about 51 kDa. When cells were treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor ofN-glycosylation (20Elbein A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 219-222Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar), only the lower band at 48 kDa was present for WT Kir2.1 and Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutants (see Fig. 2). The absence of a band shift for WT Kir2.1 confirms that the native N-glycosylation site is not occupied and that the introduced site at position 117 was not utilized. Removal of the upper band for S128N, Q140N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T indicate that these sites are utilized. The ratio of glyco- to aglyco- forms differed with placement of the introduced N-glycosylation site. Novel sites at positions 140, in the middle of H5, and 147, at the tail of H5, were more accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase than position 128, site in E1, and much more than position 143, the central residue in the signature sequence. Whole-cell recordings of infected Sf9 cells expressing WT Kir2.1 show inward noninactivating currents with hyperpolarizing pulses (Fig.3 A, upper-left panel). The outward currents at pulses more positive to the zero-current potential (0 mV) were much smaller than the inward currents for the opposite driving force, which is a feature of Kir2.1, a strong inward rectifier. Similar current patterns were observed for K117N, S128N, Q140N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T (Fig. 3 A,left panel). However, the currents for Q140N and I143N/Y145T were much smaller. In control experiments, currents recorded from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, encoding the N terminus fragment of H, K-ATPase α2A (amino acid residues 1–110), were smaller than typical whole-cell currents of Q140N and I143N/Y145T (Fig. 3 B). When expression levels were low for F147N/C149T (Fig. 3 B), as well as WT Kir2.1 and other Kir2.1 mutants, the whole-cell currents were small and the patterns were similar to those of Q140N and I143N/Y145T. However, small currents were atypical for WT, K117N, S128N, and F147N/C149T, and due to a combination of low viral titers and short p.i. times (less than 22 h). Functional single-channel currents were recorded, prior to the whole-cell currents in some of the infected cells expressing WT Kir2.1 and Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutants, as shown in Fig. 3 A, right panel. Currents of WT Kir2.1, as well as K117N, S128N, and F147N/C149T, had long-lived openings and closures. Current amplitudes at −100 mV for K117N and S128N were similar to WT Kir2.1, whereas that of F147N/C149T was about 45% of the main conductance. Closures were very long and openings much less frequent in Q140N and I143N/Y145T channels, and the conductance was close to 20% of the main state of WT Kir2.1. The amount of blank tracings from similar time intervals was much higher for Q140N and I143N/Y145T than WT Kir2.1, K117N, S128N, and F147N/C149T. The decreased openings (large amount of blank tracings) and reductions in current amplitude of Q140N and I143N/Y145T channels correlated with the observed small whole-cell currents. To determine whether glycosylated and unglycosylated channels could be differentiated at the cell surface, whole-cell current measurements were made in the absence and presence of tunicamycin for each mutant (Table I). These measurements are intended to compare the steady state current at −120 mV for each mutant, with and without tunicamycin, and not to compare the mutants to WT Kir2.1. Steady-state current measurements at similar post-infection times, in the absence or presence of tunicamycin, were not significantly different (S128N, −297 ± 111 pA/picofarad (pF),n = 3; −275 ± 87 pA/pF, n = 4; Q140N, −2.18 ± 0.59 pA/pF, n = 5; −4.35 ± 3.5 pA/pF, n = 7; I143N/Y145T, −2.78 ± 1.17 pA/pF, n = 5; −3.98 ± 2.29 pA/pF,n = 7; and F147N/C149T, 311 ± 149 pA/pF,n = 6, 348 ± 94 pA/pF, n = 8, respectively). Significance was determined using Student'st test of two populations. Typical whole-cell current tracings of tunicamycin-treated infected cells are shown in Fig.3 C. Current patterns were similar to untreated infected cells.Table ISteady-state currents at −120 mV in the absence and presence of tunicamycinKir2.1S128NQ140NI143N/Y145TF147N/C149T−+1-aAbsence (−) and presence (+) of tunicamycin.−+−+−+I(ss)/cap (pA/pF)297 ± 111−275 ± 87−2.18 ± 0.6−1.78 ± 7.4−2.78 ± 1.2−3.98 ± 2.3−311 ± 149−348 ± 94 n34545768The steady-state currents (I(88)) at −120 mV were determined and divided by the cell capacitance (cap) in the absence (−) and presence (+) of tunicamycin (TM) for each N-glycosylation substitution mutant, as indicated.

The number of observations is indicated in the corresponding n columns. Kir2.1 is highly selective for potassium ions, and externally applied barium ions block the currents. Mutations andN-linked oligosaccharides introduced in or near the putative pore-forming segment may alter K+ selectivity. Ion selectivity was examined by replacing K+ with Na+ in the extracellular bath solution (Fig.4). Substitution of Na+produced large reductions in the inward currents and hyperpolarizing shifts of the reversal potential for WT Kir2.1 (−64.3 ± 10.9 mV,n = 4), K117N (−64.5 ± 4.2 mV, n= 4), S128N (−64.0 ± 8.7 mV, n = 4), and F147N/C149T (−64.3 ± 7.3 mV, n = 4). The experiments show that the reversal potential shifted in the potassium reversal potential direction, which suggests that theN-glycosylation substitution mutants are selective for K+ over Na+. Whole-cell currents detected from Sf9 cells expressing WT Kir2.1 and all of the Kir2.1 N-glycosylation substitution mutants were blocked by barium (Fig. 5). Barium blockade of Kir2.1 is time- and voltage-dependent (2Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The current-voltage (I–V) curve reveals outward currents at more positive pulses near the zero-current potential that become much smaller at more depolarized potentials (Fig. 5 A, right panel). The negative slope conductance at these potentials is characteristic of strong inwardly rectifying K+ channels, Kir2.1. It is less pronounced in the presence of extracellular Ba2+ or intracellular spermine when Kir2.1 is heterologously expressed inXenopus oocytes (4Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M.

This hump in the outward current was easily detectable when the current magnitudes were relatively large and it was blocked by barium as shown for S128N and F147N/C149T. The currents for WT, K117N, S128N, and F147N/C149T were quite large, so barium block is shown in the low K+ solution, whereas the currents for Q140N and I143N/Y145T were very small, so barium block studies were conducted using the high K+ solution. Previously, we have shown that glycosylated and unglycosylated Kir1.1 channels could be differentiated at the cell surface by reductions in whole-cell currents and opening probabilities before and after tunicamycin treatment (15Schwalbe R.A.

Tunicamycin treatment produced no significant changes in the currents for glycosylated Kir2.1N-glycosylation substitution mutants (S128N, Q140N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T, Table I). To demonstrate that glycosylated channels are transported to the plasma membrane, surface proteins were biotinylated and bulk-purified using streptavidin-agarose resin. Kir2.1 mutant proteins were detected by Western blotting using the M2 antibody (Fig. 6). Q140N migrated as a singlet. When Q140N samples were digested with endoglycosidase H, a doublet was observed. The lower band was the most prominent band, indicating that the majority of oligosaccharide was removed from glycosylated Q140N protein. I143N/Y145T ran as a doublet, and only the lower band was present after digestion with endoglycosidase H. In both cases, the amount of glycosylated protein was higher when glycosylation was assayed from surface-expressed Kir2.1 proteins than total Kir2.1 proteins. In fact, virtually all of the Q140N protein that was transported to the cell surface was found to be glycosylated. In this study, we conducted experiments on Kir2.1 channels in which N-glycosylation sites were introduced in and near the putative pore-forming segment, H5. Measurements of partially purified Kir2.1 proteins from total membranes showed a slower migrating immunoband for S128N, Q140N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T that was not present when cells were treated with tunicamycin or in WT Kir2.1 samples. Immunoband shift assays of partially purified Q140N and I143N/Y145T proteins from the plasma membrane also detected a slower migrating band that was substantially reduced when samples were digested with endoglycosidase H. These results indicate that introducedN-glycosylation sequons at positions 128, 140, 143, and 147 could be utilized and thus provide direct evidence that H5 is extracellular (Fig. 1 A, right panel). We propose one extracellular loop between the two transmembrane segments, because H5 is not in the membrane (Fig. 1 A, right panel), unlike the accepted topological model that proposes two extracellular loops because H5 is in the membrane (Fig. 1 A, left panel). According to the accepted topological model, theN-glycosylation sites at positions 117 and 128 should be glycosylated and those at positions 140, 143, and 147 should not be accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase (Fig. 1 A,left panel). However, all three introducedN-glycosylation sequons in the putative pore-forming segment were utilized but residue 117 was not. It may be that residue 117 is not accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase because it is too close to the M1 segment or the secondary structure does not support the oligosaccharyltransferase reaction (18Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 23Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Previously, cysteine scanning mutagenesis studies revealed that the side chains of residues 141–143, 145, 147, and 149 are accessible from the extracellular side (25Kubo Y. Yoshimichi M. Heinemann S.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Dart C. Leyland M.L. Spencer P.J. Stanfield P.R. Sutcliffe M.J. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, two independent approaches demonstrate that residues in H5, including the selectivity filter, are accessible to an endoplasmic reticulum luminal enzyme and externally applied modifying reagents, indicating that the selectivity filter is extracellular. In the case of voltage-gated K+ channels, Kvs, mutagenesis-electrophysiological and N-glycosylation studies used to evaluate the topological structure are not in agreement. Based on the substituted cysteine accessibility method (10Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), as well as internal tetraethylammonium blockade (7Yellen G. Jurman M. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1991; 251: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), central residues have been predicted to face the cytoplasmic side and thus penetrate the membrane. On the other hand, a Kv channel, Herg, has a utilized nativeN-glycosylation sequon that directly follows the invariant G(Y/F)G sequence (Fig. 1 B, 27Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), indicating that the signature sequence is topologically extracellular. This observation is entirely consistent with our findings for the Kirs, Kir1.1 F146N/F148S mutant (16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25217-25223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Kir2.1 F147N/C149T (Fig. 1 B). Functional measurements indicated that 117, 128, 140, 143, and 147 mutant channels are at the cell surface. In all cases, whole-cell currents showed strong inward rectification and were blocked by barium. In contrast, the single-channel current amplitudes were greatly reduced for Q140N and I143N/Y145T, and opening probabilities were also very low. These different current properties may indicate that the channels are folded incorrectly, and therefore glycosylation occurs only when the H5 region is folded abnormally. However, the current amplitude exhibited by these two mutants appears to be similar to the low subconductance state detected in Kir2.1 channels expressed inXenopus oocytes, HEK cells, and mouse cardiac myocytes (28Picones A. Keung E. Timpe L.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2035-2049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as rabbit ventricular myocytes (29Sakmann B. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1984; 347: 641-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the channels are folding properly but the WT Kir2.1 main open state is not stable. Furthermore, cysteine mutagenesis studies indicated that the H5 segment in the mature protein is accessible from the extracellular side (25Kubo Y. Yoshimichi M. Heinemann S.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Dart C. Leyland M.L. Spencer P.J. Stanfield P.R. Sutcliffe M.J. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immunoband shifts by endoglycosidase H showed that virtually all the Q140N protein in the plasma membrane was glycosylated and that a higher ratio of glycosylated I143N/Y145T was present at the plasma membrane than in total membranes. This result indicates that either more glycosylated protein is transported to the cell surface or that it is more stable. Taken together, the results suggest that glycosylated Q140N channels are correctly folded at the cell surface and functional, as well as the other glycosylated channels, S128N, I143N/Y145T, and F147N/C149T. A previous study of Kir2.1 reported that Arg148 and Glu138 form a salt bridge and that disruption of this bridge dramatically alters ion selectivity and permeation (30Yang J., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These observations are further supported by the Kir6 model, which was built from the crystal structure of KcsA (31Repunte V.P Nakamura H. Fujita A. Horio Y. Findlay I. Pott L. Kurachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study has demonstrated that K+ selectivity is maintained when a Met is substituted at Arg148 in Kir2.1 but permeation properties are changed (32Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Karschin A. FEBS Let. 2000; 466: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our study shows that nonconserved mutations on each side of Arg148 do not abolish K+ selectivity, but the current amplitudes are reduced by about 55% (see Fig. 3). K+ selectivity was also retained when the two corresponding residues were mutated in Kir1.1 (16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25217-25223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The double mutants also had N-linked oligosaccharide at positions 147 and 146 of Kir2.1 and Kir1.1, respectively. Taken together, this region appears to be either directly involved or tightly coupled to ion permeation, not ion selectivity. Our studies clearly demonstrate that introducedN-glycosylation sites in the putative pore-forming segment can be utilized and that the mutant channels retain function. At least two plausible explanations could explain glycosylation of these introduced sites. First, the selectivity filter is extracellular, and thus ion selectivity originates from an extracellular segment. Alternatively, ion selectivity does not originate from this segment. Mutagenesis-electrophysiological studies cannot clearly establish whether ion selectivity, ion permeation, and channel gating were altered as a result of those specific amino acids and modifications or were the result of allosteric effects. In other words, mutations or modifications outside the pore are coupled to the pore structure, and thus alter ion channel properties. It is possible that protein-protein contacts of the multimeric protein channel may affect the highly positive cooperativity of the transition between closed and main open states. Thus, disrupting protein-protein contacts of the multimeric protein channel would alter channel gating, ion permeation, and/or ion selectivity. In conclusion, our study of a strong inward rectifier, and our earlier study on a weak inward rectifier (15Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) show that H5, the putative pore-forming segment, of Kirs is an extracellular segment, because positions 128, 140, 143, and 147 of Kir2.1 and positions 117, 128, 139, 144, and 146 of Kir1.1 are glycosylated. Positions 139, 140, 143, 144, 146, and 147 reside in the signature sequence that is thought to form the selectivity filter. Occupancy of N-glycosylation sites at these sites places the selectivity filter of the signature sequence in an extracellular loop as depicted in Fig. 1 A (right panel), rather than within the membrane (Fig. 1, left panel). We speculate that the region containing the invariant G(Y/F)G sequence is topologically extracellular for all K+channels. We thank Dr. Arthur M. Brown for initial support of this work and Dr. Brian D. Cain for his discussions of and comments on the manuscript."
