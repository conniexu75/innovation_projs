https://openalex.org/W1601124709,"Recent evidence demonstrates that the protein kinase C zeta (zeta PKC) isoform is required for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogenic signaling in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. The mechanism whereby zeta PKC regulates NF-kappa B most probably involves the activation of a putative I kappa B kinase of molecular mass approximately 50 kDa, which phosphorylates and inactivates I kappa B. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1, besides activating the phospholipase C-mediated breakdown of phosphatidylcholine, also generate ceramide, which is produced by stimulation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis. We show here that exogenous addition of sphingomyelinase (SMase) to NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transactivates a kappa B-dependent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid, to an extent similar to that produced by TNF alpha or phosphatidylcholine/phospholipase C. More importantly, the ability of SMase to stimulate this parameter is severely impaired by transfection of a zeta PKC kinase-defective dominant negative mutant, which suggests a critical role of zeta PKC in SMase signaling. In keeping with this notion, we also demonstrate here that zeta PKC is activated in vitro by ceramide and in vivo by treatment of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with SMase."

https://openalex.org/W2121957273,"Extracellular agonists such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activate the sphingomyelin cycle leading to the generation of ceramide. Ceramide has been suggested as an important mediator of the effect of TNF-alpha on growth inhibition, c-myc down-regulation, apoptosis, and the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B. Although there is no clearly defined intracellular target for ceramide activity, previous studies have demonstrated the existence of a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) in vitro. Since c-myc is an early downstream cellular target for TNF-alpha, we examined the role of ceramide and CAPP in c-myc down-regulation. In intact HL-60 cells ceramide induced down-regulation of c-myc RNA levels. C2-ceramide was active at 1-10 microM and caused 40-80% inhibition of c-myc RNA levels at 30-120 min of treatment. In nuclear run-on studies, C2-ceramide induced a block to transcription elongation of the c-myc transcript without affecting transcription through the first exon. Therefore, ceramide appeared to inhibit c-myc expression via a mechanism identical with that of TNF-alpha. HL-60 cells contained CAPP which was inhibited by okadaic acid (0.1-10 nm). CAPP in HL-60 cells was activated by D-erythro-ceramide but not D-erythro-dihydroceramide. The specificity of activation of CAPP by ceramide in vitro was matched by a similar specificity of c-myc down-regulation in cells. Moreover, okadaic acid inhibited the effects of ceramide and TNF-alpha on c-myc down-regulation. On the other hand, okadaic acid did not inhibit the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to down-regulate c-myc, demonstrating the existence of at least two distinct pathways in the regulation of c-myc expression. These results demonstrate that CAPP is important for ceramide-induced down-regulation of c-myc in myeloid leukemia cells. The implications of these findings in further delineating a sphingomyelin signaling pathway with important anti-proliferative effects are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1527859504,"The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in macrophages and the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in MAP kinase activation was investigated in macrophages exposed to agents that have previously been shown to activate the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and induce arachidonic acid release. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and zymosan maximally stimulated MAP kinase activity by 5 and 15 min, respectively, whereas the response to okadaic acid was maximal by 60-90 min. MAP kinase activation correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of p44 MAP kinase in PMA-stimulated cells and p44 and p42 MAP kinases in zymosan- and okadaic acid-stimulated cells. MAP kinase activity was not elevated in A23187-stimulated macrophages. Inhibition of PKC with the inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (GF109203X), or by prolonged exposure to PMA suppressed both arachidonic acid release and MAP kinase activation in PMA- and zymosan-stimulated macrophages but not in okadaic acid or A23187-treated cells. However, prolonged exposure to PMA did not suppress the increased cytosolic PLA2 activity in agonist-treated macrophages. This approach was complicated since initial exposure to PMA to down-regulate PKC increased cytosolic PLA2 activity which remained elevated for 16 h. In contrast, GF109203X treatment suppressed the increase in cytosolic PLA2 activity in response to zymosan and PMA but not to okadaic acid or A23187. The results demonstrate that PMA and zymosan trigger PKC activation that leads to the activation of MAP kinase and PLA2, whereas these responses are PKC independent in okadaic acid-treated cells. In addition, the results are consistent with a role for MAP kinase activation in regulating the activation of the 85-kDa PLA2 and arachidonic acid release in PMA-, zymosan-, and okadaic acid-stimulated cells, whereas these responses in A23187-treated cells are MAP kinase-and PKC-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1956334452,"Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is a secretory SOD isoenzyme. 99% of EC-SOD is anchored to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the tissue interstitium, and 1% is located in the vasculature in equilibrium between the plasma and the endothelium. Analysis of EC-SOD in plasma samples from 504 random blood donors revealed a common (2.2%) phenotypic variant displaying 10-fold increased plasma EC-SOD content. The EC-SOD in the plasma of these individuals, collected both before and after intravenous injection of heparin, displayed a reduced heparin affinity when compared with samples from normal individuals. The specific enzymatic activity was the same as that of normal enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analyses of two of the affected subjects revealed a nucleotide exchange resulting in a substitution of Arg-213 by Gly. The substitution is located in the center of the carboxyl-terminal cluster of positively charged amino acid residues, which defines the heparin-binding domain. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction showed that all 11 affected individuals are heterozygous, carrying the same single-base mutation. Recombinant EC-SOD containing this mutation had a reduced heparin affinity similar to that of EC-SOD C from variant persons. The high plasma activity can be explained by an accelerated release from the tissue interstitium heparan sulfate to the vasculature and should thus be accompanied by significantly reduced tissue EC-SOD activities."
https://openalex.org/W1539168089,"Cultured fibroblasts express binding sites for the amino-terminal region of fibronectin on their cell surface that mediate the assembly of soluble fibronectin into disulfide-stabilized fibrils. These binding sites have been termed matrix assembly sites and have been studied in binding assays using a 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment derived from the amino terminus of fibronectin. In an attempt to isolate the protein(s) responsible for binding the 70-kDa fragment, cell surface proteins were cleaved from fibroblast monolayers by mild trypsinization. Trypsinization of monolayers generated a series of fibronectin fragments that bound the 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment by ligand blot assay and affinity chromatography. All of the fibronectin fragments that bound the 70-kDa fragment contained the III-1 module. In solid phase binding assays, the 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment bound preferentially to reduced fibronectin as compared with unreduced fibronectin fragments. Binding of the 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment to reduced fibronectin was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the III-1 domain. Isolated III-1, however, did not bind the 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment when adsorbed to plastic tissue culture wells. Heat denaturation of III-1 prior to adsorption conferred 70-kDa fragment binding properties on the isolated module. The 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment did not bind to heat-denatured III-2, suggesting that 70-kDa fragment binding was a property of the III-1 module and not a general characteristic of all type III modules. The binding of 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment to III-1 was of high affinity (KD = 1.8 x 10(-8) M). These results indicate that a binding site for the 70-kDa amino terminus of fibronectin is contained within a cryptic site found in the first type III module of fibronectin. Unfolding of the III-1 module on the cell surface may control matrix assembly site expression and represent an important step in the initiation of cell-dependent fibronectin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1589589448,"Previous studies have shown that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (AR) are present in rat ventricular myocytes, but stimulation of these receptor subtypes elicits qualitatively different cellular responses (Xiao, R.-P., and Lakatta, E. G. (1993) Circ. Res. 73, 286-300). In the present study, the biochemical mechanism underlying the distinct beta AR subtype actions have been investigated. Although both beta 1AR and beta 2AR stimulation increased total cellular cAMP in suspensions of rat ventricular myocytes to a similar extent, the maximum elevation of the membrane bound cAMP by beta 2AR stimulation was only half of that induced by beta 1AR stimulation, suggesting that stimulation the beta AR subtypes leads to different compartmentation of cAMP. The effects of beta 1AR stimulation on Ca2+ transient (indexed by the transient increase in indo-1 fluorescence ration after excitation) and contraction amplitude (measured via photodiode array) and their kinetics closely paralleled the increase in cAMP. In contrast, the increase in both membrane bound and total cAMP content after beta 2AR stimulation were completely dissociated from the effects of beta 2AR stimulation to increase the amplitudes of cytosolic Ca2+ transient and contraction. Furthermore, beta 2AR stimulation did not phosphorylate phospholamban to the same extent as did beta 1AR stimulation. This finding provides a mechanism for the failure of beta 2AR stimulation to accelerate the kinetics of the Ca2+i (cytosolic Ca2+) transient and contraction. These results indicate that the effects of beta 2AR stimulation on Ca2+i transient and contraction are uncoupled from the cAMP production and cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation and indicate that, in addition to coupling to adenylate cyclase, beta 2AR stimulation also activates other signal transduction pathway(s) to produce changes in cytosolic Ca2+ and contraction."

https://openalex.org/W1490917921,"Abstract To study how cells regulate the composition of glycosaminoglycan chains on proteoglycans, we have examined the assembly of chains on chimeric proteoglycans containing segments of betaglycan (transforming growth factor-beta Type III receptors) fused to protein A. Transient expression of the chimeras in Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that only two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites exist. One site at Ser535 supported both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate synthesis, whereas the site at Ser546 supported only chondroitin sulfate. The compositions of the chimeras were the same in CHO-K1, CHOP-C4, BHK-21, and HeLa S3 cells and in chimeras containing polyhistidine fused to the C terminus. Deletion experiments showed that the assembly of heparan sulfate chains on the chimeras required a peptide segment of < or = 16 amino acids (SPGDSS535-GWPDGYEDLE) and the first 5 amino acids were not essential. Truncation of the acidic cluster (EDLE), site-directed mutation of the acidic residues in the cluster, or deletion of the sequence between the cluster and the Ser attachment site decreased heparan sulfate assembly. Mutation of Trp537 adjacent to the site also decreased heparan sulfate assembly. More importantly, introducing tryptophan next to three different Ser-Gly dipeptides in betaglycan and syndecan-1 chimeras stimulated assembly of heparan sulfate. Thus, one type of heparan sulfate attachment site consists of a Ser-Gly dipeptide and a flanking cluster of acidic residues. An adjacent tryptophan residue can augment the proportion of heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1859189971,"Mannoproteins in the walls of mnn9 cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were released by laminarinase, and purified by concanavalin A affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that they contained N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, and glucose. An antiserum raised against beta (1-6)-glucan reacted with four proteins with molecular masses of 66, 100, 155, and 220 kDa, respectively. Recognition by the antiserum was competitively inhibited by beta (1-6)-glucan, but not by beta (1-3)-glucan, mannan, or dextran (an alpha (1-6)-glucan). Mild periodate treatment of the wall proteins completely abolished recognition by the antiserum. Glucose-containing side chains were isolated and compared with N- and O-carbohydrate side chains. The glucose-containing side chains consisted of about equal amounts of glucose and mannose and some N-acetylglucosamine, and were larger than N-chains. They were, however, not extended N-chains, because after acetolysis, which preferentially cleaves (1-6)-linkages, their elution profiles differed strongly. A model is presented of how glucose-containing side chains might anchor mannoproteins into the glucan layer of the cell wall."

https://openalex.org/W1503798699,"Recently developed CAAX peptidomimetic compounds have been shown to be potent and specific inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase activity and to block the growth of Ras-transformed cells. However, whether this growth inhibitory action is specifically a consequence of blocking oncogenic Ras signaling has not been determined. To address this question, we have utilized mutants of the normally farnesylated oncogenic Ras protein (Ras-F) that are modified by alternative lipids, a geranylgeranyl isoprenoid (Ras-GG) or the fatty acid myristate (Myr-Ras), to determine the specificity of the CAAX peptidomimetic compound, B581. Like Ras-F, both Ras-GG and Myr-Ras are membrane-associated and transforming. Unexpectedly, NIH 3T3 cells transformed by each of the three Ras mutants underwent morphological alteration to a less transformed, but not normal, morphology. However, B581 inhibited the ability of only Ras-F-transformed cells, but not Ras-GG- or Myr-Ras- (or Raf-) transformed cells, to grow in soft agar. Furthermore, although all three lipid-modified versions of Ras stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and both Jun and Elk-1 transcriptional activity, B581 inhibited only farnesylated Ras activation of these three downstream components of Ras signaling. Therefore, B581 prevents the growth of Ras-transformed cells by specifically antagonizing Ras-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W177177583,"Cysteine string proteins are relatively low mass components of synaptic vesicle membranes. Structurally, their primary sequence is distinguished by a remarkable, cysteine-rich motif. Investigations revealed an unprecedented degree of lipidation of these cysteine residues. At least 11 of the 13 cysteines of the Torpedo protein were modified, principally by palmitoyl moieties. This fatty acylation creates a prominent hydrophobic domain flanked by polar amino and carboxyl termini. An amphipathic structure of this type is uniquely suited to mediate events at membrane interfaces. Thus, cysteine string proteins are candidates to participate in exocytotic membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1554238701,"Link protein (LP) is an abundant protein of cartilage which stabilizes the interaction of aggrecan with hyaluronic acid (HA). In this study we report that LP is also present in a large number of embryonic non-cartilaginous tissues. We demonstrate, using RNase protection experiments, that the coding region of the LP mRNAs isolated from these tissues is identical to that present in cartilage. Furthermore, we show that the LP mRNAs are translated in non-cartilaginous tissues by the identification of LP polypeptides with monoclonal antibody 4B6/A5 in Western blots. LP is localized in the extracellular matrix of the mesoderm along the entire digestive tract and in the dermis of the embryonic skin as revealed by immunofluorescence analysis. Investigations on the interactions between LP and proteoglycans from skin and proventriculus demonstrate that LP can enhance the binding of proteoglycans from these tissues to HA. In addition, we find that the same proteoglycans bound to HA in the presence of LP are always more resistant to competition by soluble HA than in the absence of LP. Our results suggest that LP is involved in the stabilization of extracellular matrices of a wide variety of non-cartilaginous tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1575788337,"The mechanochemical motor proteins of the kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein families play important roles in microtubule-based intracellular motility. Although movement and distribution of organelles like secretory granules, vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, and chromosomes depend on the activity of these motor proteins, little is known about the regulation of this movement. We report here that the hyperphosphorylation of components of the kinesin complex by treatment with okadaic acid increases kinesin motor activity at least 2-fold. The stimulation was observed using both a granule motility assay and a microtubule gliding assay, indicating that phosphorylation enhances the activity of the motor itself, rather than the affinity of the motor for membrane organelles. Under stimulatory conditions, three proteins that co-purify with kinesin (with mobilities of 150, 79, and 73 kDa) are consistently hyperphosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of these proteins reduces kinesin activity to basal levels. Therefore, we conclude that kinesin motor activity is directly modulated by the phosphorylation state of kinesin-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1490569468,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is the major regulator of the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursors through interaction with its receptor (Epo-R). Although Epo-R lacks a tyrosine kinase consensus sequence within its intracellular domain, the addition of its ligand to Epo-responsive cells, UT-7/Epo, induces the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of 145-, 130-, 80-, and 40-kDa cellular proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins occurred dose- and time-dependently. We showed that the tyrosine phosphorylated 145- kDa protein is identical to phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein is detectable within 30 s and almost reaches the maximum at 1 min. This can last up to 10 min and declines thereafter. Additionally, in Epo-stimulated cells, PLC-gamma 1 become physically associated with 80- and 40-kDa proteins which have been tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to Epo. The activity of PLC-gamma 1 was also investigated using inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-P3) as an indicator. We found that stimulation of UT-7/Epo cells with Epo induces a significant accumulation of Ins-P3. This effect is dose-dependent and occurs very rapidly. The production of Ins-P3 can explain the Epo-induced mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores in these cells. These results demonstrate that Epo induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-gamma 1 to produce Ins-P3 and then it mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores. This signal transduction pathway may play a role in regulating the proliferation of erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561141192,"The liver plays a central role in the systemic acute phase response of an organism to injury. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a major regulator of fibrinolysis, is an important component of the acute phase response in humans. The source of plasma PAI-1 has been a matter of controversy, but recent in situ hybridization experiments have demonstrated that human hepatocytes express the PAI-1 gene in vivo. However, little is known about regulation of human hepatic PAI-1 gene expression by mediators of the acute phase response. We have analyzed the regulation of PAI-1 mRNA accumulation by interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and dexamethasone, known mediators of the acute phase response, in HepG2 cells, a highly differentiated human hepatoma cell line that produces a broad spectrum of acute phase proteins including PAI-1. Incubation of HepG2 cells with IL-1 resulted in a rapid and transient 40-fold induction of the 3.2-kilobase PAI-1 mRNA and a 30-fold induction of the 2.2-kilobase PAI-1 mRNA. Although IL-6 alone had only a modest effect on PAI-1 expression, in combination with IL-1, it caused a synergistic induction of PAI-1 mRNA accumulation. Dexamethasone alone did not increase PAI-1 mRNA accumulation but enhanced it in combination with IL-1. Using nuclear run-on experiments, we determined that the mechanism by which IL-1 alone, or in combination with IL-6, induced PAI-1 mRNA accumulation was to cause a 10-15-fold, transient stimulation of PAI-1 gene transcription. We found no evidence of an effect of these cytokines on PAI-1 mRNA stability. These data demonstrate that mediators of the acute phase response induce the accumulation of PAI-1 mRNA in human hepatoma cells by rapidly and transiently increasing the transcription of the PAI-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1510740341,"Transcriptional activation of genes containing the interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE) by IFN-alpha is known to be mediated through the post-translational activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and its subsequent interactions with the ISRE. We have identified an ISRE-ISGF3-independent signaling pathway used by IFN-alpha for the induction of the IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene. A minimal functional promoter of the IRF-1 gene does not contain an ISRE, but we have shown that transcription of the IRF-1 gene is activated by IFN-alpha in cell lines that do not produce ISGF3 activity due to the absence of functional ISGF3-gamma (p48) polypeptide. This ISRE-ISGF3-independent pathway for IFN-alpha signaling involves a cis-acting enhancer element located in the IRF-1 promoter, termed the inverted repeat (IR) element, and its cognate trans-acting factor, IR-binding factor alpha (IRBF-alpha). IFN-gamma also activates a transcription factor(s) that forms a different complex (IRBF-gamma) with the IR element. Protein-tyrosine kinase (tyk2) activity is required for the induction of IRBF-alpha, but not IRBF-gamma. The p91 subunit of ISGF3 is necessary for the formation of both IRBF-alpha and IRBF-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1522094189,"The assembly of laminin chains into double- and triple-stranded structures was studied with recombinant proteins derived from the C-terminal alpha-helical region of the long arm of laminin. Both affinity assays and structural studies demonstrated chain-specific assembly of the B1, B2, and A chains, while associations between homotypic and homologous chains could not be observed. These results suggest that chain selection is controlled by the C-terminal region. Deletion mapping in the B1e and B2e chains identified two sites important for dimer and trimer formation. These two sites were separated by 23 amino acids in the B1e chain, whereas they were adjacent in the B2e chain. The Ae and Am chains contained only one site for trimerization. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that charged amino acid residues within these sites were essential for association. These results suggest that distinct sites within the C-terminal alpha-helical region of the laminin long arm are critical for the chain-specific assembly of these macro-molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1541793869,"Phospholipase A1 (PLA1) was isolated from a soluble fraction of bovine brain. The purification included sequential DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose FF, and heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. Mono Q, Sephacryl S-300, and Mono S high resolution column chromatography in the presence of the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (10 mM) and glycerol (10%, v/v) was required to further separate the enzyme from contaminating material. The purified PLA1 eluted from the Sephacryl S-300HR column in a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 365 kDa and migrated as two bands (M(r) = 112,000 and 95,000) when separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Chromatofocusing, hydroxylapatite, and lectin affinity column chromatography and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were unsuccessful in separating the two electrophoretic bands, implying a close association or similarity. The purified enzyme was stable in solutions containing detergent and glycerol and was insensitive to metal chelators, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, but was inactivated by heat (60 degrees C) and ZnCl2. At pH 7.5, the purified enzyme showed highest specific activity, 23.8 mumol/min-mg, when 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine was the substrate. The rate of catalysis was optimal at a pH of 9.0 and could be enhanced 2-fold by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+, but not Mn2+. The enzyme catalyzed the specific hydrolysis of acyl groups from the sn-1 position of a broad range of phospholipid substrates, including lysophospholipids, and accounts for most of the soluble phospholipase A1 activity of bovine brain."
https://openalex.org/W1516035059,"NAP-22, a recently identified neural tissue-enriched acidic protein, was shown to be a substrate of protein kinase C in vitro. Its phosphorylation site was assigned as Ser6 using deleted mutants expressed in Escherichia coli. Calmodulin inhibited this phosphorylation reaction. This inhibitory effect of calmodulin was dose-dependent and much stronger than its inhibitory effect to the phosphorylation of neuromodulin (GAP-43) with protein kinase C. The dissociation constant of NAP-22 and calmodulin obtained using the fluorescence change of dansyl-labeled calmodulin was much lower than that of neuromodulin and calmodulin. The phosphorylation of NAP-22 inhibited the association with calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1631731482,"The gene encoding the calcitonin receptor (CTR) was isolated from a porcine kidney epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1) genomic library and found to span approximately 70 kilobases. Analysis of the gene sequence revealed that the CTR mRNA encompasses 14 exons with 12 exons encoding the protein. Two splicing acceptor sites separated by 48 nucleotides were found in intron 7. The expression of two mRNA species in LLC-PK1 cells was subsequently confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA sequencing. In LLC-PK1 cells the mRNA encoding the shorter CTR (CTR-1a) is approximately 1,000 times more abundant than the longer variant (CTR-1b), as estimated by the competitive RT-PCR. The transcription initiation site of the CTR gene was mapped by primer extension, S1 nuclease, and RT-PCR analysis. The proximal promoter region of 500 base pair is GC-rich (66%) and CpG-rich (CpG/GpC ratio 0.71). Transient transfection of CTR gene promoter-luciferase chimeras in LLC-PK1 cells led to the expression of luciferase activity. The CTR gene was mapped to chromosome band 9q11-q12."
https://openalex.org/W1522930227,"Purified FHLA, the transcriptional activator of the formate regulon from Escherichia coli, is able to efficiently stimulate transcription from the sigma 54-dependent promoters of the fdhF, hyp, and hyc transcriptional units. Expression was dependent on the presence of sigma 54, of the upstream activatory sequence (UAS), and of formate. Hypophosphite, a formate analogue, could substitute for formate in vitro suggesting that formate per se was active in regulation. The integration host factor (IHF) had a direct effect on the expression (in vivo and in vitro) of the hyp and hyc genes but not of the fdhF gene. Binding of IHF within the region between the hyp and the hyc operon could be shown. A model is proposed for the transcriptional regulation of the inversely oriented hyp and hyc operons. It involves two upstream regulatory sequences, one between the hyp and the hyc operon (IR1), and the other between hycA and hycB (IR2). The UAS situated within IR1 is responsible for activation of the hyc operon, that within IR2 for activation of the hyp operon. A supramolecular transcription complex is proposed which involves the binding of IHF to a site located between the UAS and the promoter responsible for transcription of the hyc operon."
https://openalex.org/W1579727814,"Scanning alanine mutagenesis of the cell surface protease receptor tissue factor suggested importance of residues Lys20, Ile22, Asp58, Arg135, and Phe140 for binding of ligand, the serine protease coagulation factor VIIa. Ligand binding by single alanine replacement mutants was characterized by functional assays which concordantly demonstrated a calculated 1-2.5 kcal/mol reduction in free energy of binding as a result of each of the mutations. Catalytic and proteolytic function appeared to be not impaired by the residue replacements, indicating that these residues are not specifically required for the catalytic enhancement of VIIa produced by the assembly with tissue factor. Multiple mutations were further combined in one mutant protein to assess whether these residues provide independent contacts with the ligand VIIa. The Lys20/Asp58 and the Arg135/Phe140 residue pairs did not independently contribute to the binding of ligand. In contrast, the combination with Ile22 consistently produced a further decrease in affinity for VIIa, demonstrating that this residue acts as an independent contact site for the ligand VIIa. The total contribution of the five residues to the free energy of binding of VIIa at 37 degrees C was calculated to be 5.4 kcal/mol representing approximately one-third of the total binding energy."
https://openalex.org/W1492026543,"Abstract The activation of a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is one of the earliest intracellular responses to T lymphocyte stimulation. We have used a human T cell line, Jurkat, and an antibody that recognizes the clonotype of its T cell receptor (TcR) to characterize the association of PI 3-kinase with the TcR and its activation in response to TcR cross-linking. We show that the TcR is constitutively associated with the alpha isoform of the PI 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit. Stimulation of Jurkat cells through the TcR results in the rapid and transient activation of the associated PI 3-kinase. In addition, our results indicate that the tyrosine kinase pp56lck is essential for PI 3-kinase activation via the TcR."
https://openalex.org/W145527516,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multi-functional cytokine that plays a role in the body's response to injury and infection. IL-6 expression is induced in young human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) in response to a number of agents including fetal bovine serum, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, double-stranded RNA, and forskolin. In contrast, we find that senescent HDF are markedly deficient in their ability to express IL-6 in response to serum, double-stranded RNA, and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, whereas forskolin is still an effective inducer for senescent cells. Thus, specific pathways for stimulating IL-6 expression appear to be blocked in senescent HDF. The basal amount of IL-6 mRNA in unstimulated senescent HDF is also much lower than in unstimulated young quiescent HDF. Likewise, the amount of IL-6 protein produced by senescent HDF is decreased at least 10-fold. Both the basal and induced levels of IL-6 declined progressively with aging of the HDF in culture, e.g. IL-6 cannot be induced above the young basal level by approximately 65% of life-span completed. If a similar decrease in IL-6 expression takes place in HDF in vivo, it could contribute to the decline in wound healing and the increase in the number and severity of infections experienced by aged individuals."

Here, we identify a transcriptional factor, NF(P), that binds a sequence from -75 to -69 (ATTTTCC) of the mouse IL-4 gene which corresponds to the human IL-4 gene P sequence. Expression of NF(P) was associated with positive regulation of the IL-4 gene and cyclosporin A sensitivity. The P sequence is homologous to the binding site for the positive transcriptional regulator of the IL-2 gene nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Binding of NF(P) to the P sequence was completely inhibited by an oligonucleotide corresponding to the NFAT binding site. Like NFAT, NF(P) was also found in the cytosol of resting T cells but translocated to the nucleus via a cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism after T cell activation. Overexpression of a constitutively active calcineurin caused translocation of NF(P) from the cytosol to the nucleus. NF(P) purified on an oligonucleotide affinity column was 90 kDa, which is smaller than the 120-kDa reported for cNFAT. Purified NF(P) did not bind the NFAT consensus sequence, even in the presence of AP-1 protein. Our results suggest that the NF(P) molecule is not identical to the cNFAT molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1571585865,"Abstract The monoclonal antibody AA4 (mAb AA4) recognizes novel alpha-galactosyl derivatives of GD1b on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The binding of mAb AA4 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylations without histamine release. Several of the same proteins including Fc epsilon RI beta, Fc epsilon RI gamma, p72syk, and phospholipase C-gamma 1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated by mAb AA4 binding and by the activation of the high affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RI. There was also activation of the p53/56lyn and p72syk protein-tyrosine kinases, but compared to direct Fc epsilon RI activation, mAb AA4 did not result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp105-115 or pp125FAK, and the receptor subunits (Fc epsilon RI beta and Fc epsilon RI gamma) were more heavily phosphorylated. Furthermore, the time course of the phosphorylations with mAb AA4 was slower than that induced by Fc epsilon RI aggregation. By immunofluorescence, the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after mAb AA4 stimulation were localized in patches at the cell membrane and in areas of cell-cell contact, whereas after Fc epsilon RI activation, there was a reticular cytoplasmic pattern. There were no protein tyrosine phosphorylations either when Fc epsilon RI was saturated with IgE or when F(ab')2 fragments of mAb AA4 were used, although the F(ab')2 fragments still induced morphological changes. There was also coprecipitation of the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI with the anti-ganglioside antibody. These data strongly suggest the involvement of Fc epsilon RI in the antiganglioside-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylations. Moreover, phosphorylations of these proteins including the beta and gamma chains of Fc epsilon RI and activation of p53/56lyn and p72syk did not result in histamine release."
https://openalex.org/W1551453372,"Affinity-based purification and characterization of the collagenolytic serine protease 1 from Uca pugilator (fiddler crab) hepatopancreas shows that the enzyme cleaves the native bovine alpha 1(I) collagen chain carboxyl-terminal to Gln and Arg residues adjacent to the metallocollagenase site. Cleavage carboxyl-terminal to Leu residues is observed in the alpha 2(I) chain and at a secondary site in alpha 1(I). These sites correlate with the preferences observed toward p-nitroanilide substrates varying at the P1 position, for which the specificity (kcat/Km) is Arg > Leu, Phe, Lys > Gln > Ala. Furthermore, collagen cleavage after Gln was found exclusively between two Gln-Arg bonds. The P'1-P'3 specificity of collagenase, as determined by nucleophile acyl transfer, indicated a strong preference for Arg in the P'1 position. Crab collagenase cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to Leu and Gln at the P1 position more efficiently than trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase. Moreover, the efficiency of collagenase toward P1-Arg substrates is equivalent to that of trypsin. Crystals of crab collagenase have been grown complexed with the protein inhibitor ecotin. These crystals diffract to better than 2.8 A resolution and belong to the space group P3(2)21 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 89.0 A, c = 291.7 A."
https://openalex.org/W1544780192,"Activins are multipotent hormones/growth factors that belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Like TGF-beta s, activins have 9 conserved cysteine residues and are disulfide-bonded dimers. Based on the three-dimensional structure of TGF-beta 2, we deduced Cys80 in activin A to form the intermolecular disulfide bond. To obtain a monomeric form of activin, Cys80 was exchanged for a serine residue by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The mutant protein was expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The molecular mass of this mutant activin was determined to be 13 kDa (consistent with a single chain form of the protein) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by laser desorption mass spectroscopy. When this mutant monomeric activin was incubated with cells that expressed either the activin type IIB receptor or both the type I and type IIB receptors, its affinity was found to be 20% of that of native activin on a mass basis. Binding affinity determined using the mouse pituitary cell line AtT 20 was 10% of that of native activin A. Biological potency, however, as determined by the mutant protein's ability to release FSH from anterior pituitary cells in primary culture and by its ability to suppress basal ACTH secretion form AtT 20 cells, was only 1% of that of the native protein. This discrepancy of an order of magnitude between binding and biological activity is consistent with a model in which dimerization of the hormone is not necessary for high affinity binding to its receptor(s) while being essential for efficient signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1517751447,"Abstract Placental expression of the alpha subunit gene of the human glycoprotein hormones requires a multicomponent enhancer composed of tandem cAMP-response elements and an adjacent upstream regulatory element. Based on recent studies indicating that the upstream regulatory element includes binding sites for more than one protein, we investigated how functional activity correlated with these binding sites. Through extensive replacement mutagenesis of the native promoter regulatory region, we provide the first functional map of the upstream regulatory element. Within this region, we find that distinct proteins interact with three overlapping binding sites. While each site is functionally significant, no single site is essential or displays clear dominance. This is surprising since one of the sites binds a placenta-specific protein that heretofore has been regarded as essential for activity of the human alpha subunit placenta-specific enhancer. Consequently, our refined functional map of the upstream regulatory element reveals a complex combinatorial code that directs expression of the human alpha subunit gene to placenta."

https://openalex.org/W1638798785,"Stable clones of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the cDNA of either the wild-type or deletion forms of the rat type I (or cerebellar) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) were investigated. The delta form, missing the NH2-terminal sequence that includes the IP3-binding site, is expected to be still assembled with wild-type subunits to yield a tetrameric Ca2+ channel across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane; the s form, missing the membrane-spanning sequences, is expected to remain as a soluble monomer in the cytosol. With respect to control clones transfected with the vector only, the synthesis fo IP3Rs was markedly stimulated in the receptor-transfected clones. The mass accumulation, however, was increased only moderately (deletion forms = 15-30% of the endogenous IP3R), apparently because of a compensatory increase in receptor turnover. Coordinate changes in IP3 generation and Ca2+ release were revealed in the delta clones by experiments in both intact and permeabilized cells. In these clones, the IP3R was more sensitive to IP3, and IP3 generation at the ATP P2u surface receptor was decreased. This latter effect was due neither to a defect in G protein coupling nor to changes in phospholipase C expression, but to down-regulation of the P2u receptor. In the cells expressing the s- and delta-IP3R subunits, no differences with respect to the controls were observed in epidermal growth factor-induced DNA synthesis, whereas long-term growth stimulated by serum was reduced. Even more marked, especially in the delta clones (-90%), was the inhibition of cell transformation induced by autocrine stimulation with transforming growth factor alpha of the overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptors or by other growth factor receptors and oncogenes (platelet-derived growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, HER2/neu, and v-erbB). These effects appear not to be connected to the signaling processes mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation since the latter was unchanged in the delta clones. These results demonstrate for the first time (a) that the changes in cellular homeostasis directly induced by deleted IP3R subunits (increased receptor synthesis and increased IP3R sensitivity) are largely compensated by indirect coordinate changes apparently aimed to keep near normal the signaling properties of the cells; (b) that modulation of intracellular Ca2+ channels induces profound consequences that differentially affect growth and oncogenesis; and (c) that IP3Rs and the Ca2+ stores are important cross-roads of intracellular signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1528904738,"High and low secreting variants of the rat basophilic leukemia cell line represent powerful tools to study the molecular basis of stimulus/secretion coupling via the high affinity receptor (Fc epsilon R1) complex for immunoglobulin E since an identification of the differences between these subclones may produce important information concerning the signaling pathways involved. A comparison between a variant supporting high mediator secretion (> 50%) and one with a 10-fold reduced response to antigen shows that the latter is associated with a defect in threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunits of the Fc epsilon R1 complex. The delayed onset and reduced mediator release in the low secretor facilitated a slow motion study of the early events following receptor activation. It showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a 72-kDa protein is an early event preceding threonine and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma-chain. This points to the activation of both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase(s) C as early events in signal transduction. The retarded onset and low intensity of phosphorylation in the low secreting variant is associated with reduced levels of inositol phosphate production, and this and the lack of the Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores indicate a defect upstream of teh activation of phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1545337555,"The 5-subunit form of the Escherichia coli F1-ATPase, characterized by the subunit composition alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon, failed to exhibit a rate acceleration when samples of the enzyme hydrolyzing substoichiometric concentrations of [gamma-32P]ATP were switched from unisite to multisite hydrolysis by the addition of a cold chase. A 4-subunit form of the enzyme lacking in the delta subunit (alpha 3 beta 3 gamma epsilon) did exhibit cold chase-promoted accelerations in the hydrolysis of ATP. Reconstitution of a 5-subunit enzyme by incubating the 4-subunit form of the enzyme with a purified preparation of subunit delta was accompanied by a disappearance in the response to a cold chase. The rate constants and equilibrium constants for unisite catalysis by the 4-subunit enzyme did not differ significantly from previously reported values that may have been based on a mixture of 4- and 5-subunit forms of the enzyme. The vesicular form of Escherichia coli F0F1-ATPase exhibited a response to a cold chase only if the vesicles were first extracted with KCl. [gamma-32P]ATP bound in the high affinity catalytic sites of KCl-extracted membranes partially dissociated in an energy-dependent manner when the vesicles oxidized NADH."

https://openalex.org/W1608738809,"We surveyed the calcium-requiring (C-type) lectins in alligator liver. The major lectin purified by affinity chromatography was termed alligator hepatic lectin (AHL) and was found to be specific for mannose/L-fucose. AHL contained approximately equal amounts of 21- and 23-kDa bands upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Binding characteristics of AHL were similar to those of hepatic lectins of other classes in that 1) only terminal monosaccharide was recognized, and 2) the affinity increased exponentially when neoglycoproteins containing increasing numbers of mannose or L-fucose were used as ligand. However, unlike mammalian and chicken hepatic lectins, which exist as hexamers in Triton-containing solutions, AHL was present mainly as monomers, although small amounts of dimer and higher oligomers were present in equilibrium. Mannose-binding proteins and mannose-specific lectins of macrophages bind N-acetylmannosamine, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine in addition to mannose, indicating that the nature and orientation of the C-2 substituent are not important to these lectins. In contrast, AHL shows a strict requirement for the presence of an axial hydroxyl group at the C-2 position (i.e. mannose)."

https://openalex.org/W1534976191,"Abstract In order to examine the function of the carboxyl terminus of UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol-P GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT), an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that synthesizes GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and, thus, catalyzes the committed step for N-linked glycosylation, a series of carboxyl-terminal truncation mutations was examined. Removal of the last 11 amino acids (398-408) from GPT had no significant effect on catalytic activity, thermal stability, tunicamycin binding, reticular localization, or consumption of cellular dolichol-P. However, in the absence of residues 398-408, the removal of three additional residues (Phe395-Ser396-Ile397), or their change to Leu395-Met396-Trp397 fully eliminated enzyme expression in vivo. By reattaching residues 398-408 to Leu395-Met396-Trp397, expression was restored. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal region of GPT is essential for stable expression. Either of two sequences (395-397 and 398-408) is sufficient for expression, but neither is necessary. Expression of GPT in the absence of residues 398-408 specifically required the Phe395-Ser396-Ile397 sequence, since most scramble and termination mutations within this sequence were inhibitory. One scramble mutant (Ile395-Ser396-Phe397-Stop398) was enzymatically active, but unusually thermolabile. Thus, the function of Phe395-Ser396-Ile397 may be to stabilize GPT."
