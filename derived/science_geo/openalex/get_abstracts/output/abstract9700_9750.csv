https://openalex.org/W1981609060,"IN patients with Parkinson's disease, the concentration of dopamine in the basal ganglia of the brain is markedly reduced in accordance with the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine-containing neurones1,2. This fact provided the basis for the successful clinical introduction of L-dopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalaline) for Parkinson's disease3,6. It has been suggested that one of the critical factors compensating for the loss of dopamine neurones may be the development of “denervation supersensitivity” in the striatum, as severe cases react more sensitively to L-dopa than milder cases or controls7–9. By measuring dopamine receptors in the putamen and caudate of postmortem brains from Parkinson patients, we report here evidence in support of the theory of dopaminergic supersensitivity in Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1971177897,"THE structure of HLA substances make it surprising that they provoke strong alloimmune responses1–3. They are composed of two chains, one invariant within the species, and the other bearing a single determinant defined by monospecific HLA sera4, or a few determinants defined by polyspecific sera4,5, and thus most closely resemble haptens on non-immunogenic carriers. If this is true generally of antigens determined by major histocompatibility systems (MHC), they could be expected to be poorly or non-immunogenic within a species. This, however, conflicts with the evidence that when present on viable tissue grafts, these antigens provoke strong humoral and cellular alloimmune responses6–8. But there is also evidence that their immunogenicity depends on additional factors9,10. Here, we present data which reconcile these seemingly conflicting lines of evidence, by showing that the induction of primary immune responses (humoral and cellular) against MHC antigens in vivo depends both on the presentation of alloantigen and on a second signal provided by a live cell. Without the latter, the small quantities of MHC antigen present on conventional allografts would not induce primary immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2021254990,"PHOTOPERIODISM in insects and mites depends on the presence of light-absorbing pigments, which are probably located in the central nervous system; photoperiodic responses are mediated by the direct action of light on these nervous elements1. Until now, pigments involved in photoperiodic processes such as diapause and polymorphism have not been identified. Different groups of pigments have been named by various authors as possible candidates for this function. A biologically active role based mainly on action spectra studies and the absorption characteristics of isolated pigments has been suggested for pterins2, carotenoids3, a combination of carotenoproteins, flavoproteins and haemoproteins4 and bile pigments5. Carotenoids, pterins and flavins have also been proposed as possible photoreceptor pigments in studies on the spectral sensitivity of circadian rhythms6. According to Lees1, however, the usefulness of action spectra in identifying the light acceptor is limited, as spectra for photoperiodic action cannot at present be matched against absorption curves. A different approach was used by Zimmerman and Goldsmith7, who reared Drosophila on a carotenoid-free diet and showed that in one generation the sensitivity of the visual receptors was lowered by 3 log units because of lack of rhodopsin. At the same time the photosensitivity of the rhythm of pupal eclosion in the cultures was not affected, from which it was concluded that the pigment involved in mediating light effects on the circadian rhythm in Drosophila is not a carotenoid derivative. We demonstrate here that carotenoids are functionally involved in the photoperiodic induction of diapause in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae using a method involving pigment mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2030194160,"VARIOUS inbred strains of mice exhibit different degrees of susceptibility to both spontaneous and glucocorticoid-induced cleft palate1,2, and specific genetic and biochemical factors that may be responsible for these differences have been identified. At the genetic level, variations at the H–2 locus have been associated with susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced cleft palate3,4, while at the biochemical level, evidence suggests that numbers and characteristics of glucocorticoid receptors in murine embryonic facial mesenchyme cells differ in the various strains. Specifically, Salomon and Pratt showed that facial mesenchyme cells cultured from fetuses of the A/J strain (which is highly susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced cleft palate) contain twice as many glucocorticoid receptors as do such cells from C57BL/6J, a low susceptibility strain5. They also reported that the glucocorticoid receptor of the A/J strain has a lower affinity for dexamethasone (KD = 1.7 × 10−8 M) than does that of the C57BL/6J strain (KD = 7.9 × 10−9M) (ref. 5). In an attempt to relate steroid receptor activity to H–2 haplotype, Goldman et al. used 3H-cortisol and isoelectric focusing to study glucocorticoid receptors in facial mesenchyme cells of these and several other strains6. They concluded that “a product of a gene in or near the H–2 locus seems to be the glucocorticoid receptor, the level of which must be increased for a congenital malformation to occur”. Such conclusions must be questioned, however, because the experimental procedure required microelectrofocusing of isolated protein–cortisol complex for 40 h. Receptor binding is reversible, and in the absence of free steroid, the half life of the receptor–cortisol complex is only about 1 h at 0 °C (ref. 7). It is unlikely that a peak of radioactivity detected by isoelectric focusing after 40 h represents binding to a specific receptor. Thus an association between H–2 haplotype and glucocorticoid receptor activity has not been established definitively. However, the possibility that H–2 might determine hormone receptor levels or characteristics is exciting. We have explored the relationship between H–2 and glucocorticoid receptors by examining the level of specific glucocorticoid-binding activity in liver cytosols prepared from different mouse strains."

https://openalex.org/W2076908106,"THE mutation THp at the T/t locus in the mouse is unique among mammalian genes because it has a sharply defined maternal effect. Like other known T/t locus dominant mutations, THp yields a short-tailed phenotype in heterozygotes of both sexes. However, THp/+ females when mated with wild type fail to give birth to short–tailed progeny; examination of embryos shows that heterozygous embryos die late in gestation with seemingly minor defects such as spina bifida and polydactyly1–3. The precise reason for death has not been determined, but must depend on some defect intrinsic to the egg, because THp/+ females successfully carry to term heterozygous embryos whose THp gene is paternally derived. I report here that lethal THp/+ maternal heterozygotes are readily rescued if they are aggregated with normal embryos, but that the germ cell defect persists, because the chimaeras fail, if female, to transmit THp to viable offspring."

https://openalex.org/W2009221548,"THE mechanisms of mental retardation are of critical interest to both basic developmental neurobiologists and those in the clinical community concerned with perinatal development. The possibility of a deleterious immunological interaction between mother and fetus has long been recognised as a potential developmental hazard1. However, there have been no reports of specific conditions which involve immunological injury to the developing brain. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a model disease that can be induced naturally or experimentally by grafting mature, immunocompetent lymphoid cells into an immature, immunoincompetent host. The failure of the host, for example a newborn rat pup, to recognise the graft as non-self leads to an attack by the grafted cells on host lymphomyeloid tissues, resulting in many symptoms, including wasting, anaemia, alterations of lymphoid organ weights, hyperex-citability and an ataxic-like gait2. The last two features suggest possible brain dysfunctions and have motivated our investigation of immunologically induced perinatal brain injury. The rat cerebellum was used here as a model system for the study of brain alterations during GVHD because of its well known cytoarchitecture3. In addition, its postnatal development renders it sensitive to many forms of perinatal stress4,5. In this study, we demonstrate that significant alterations in the cerebellar cellular content and capacity for DNA synthesis occur in rats suffering from neonatally induced GVHD."

https://openalex.org/W2004717130,"PEAK tension of an excised heart muscle increases with the frequency of contraction1. This ‘staircase’ phenomenon has been attributed to changes in the distribution of Ca ions; it has been proposed that the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ concentration increases with the frequency of contraction2–4. The increase in the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ is supposed to raise the peak tension by changing the behaviour of contractile proteins; however, no such molecular change has yet been clearly demonstrated. In the present study, we have investigated the behaviour of myosin projections during the staircase phenomenon by the X-ray diffraction method, in an attempt to clarify the underlying molecular events. The results have indicated that an increase in the contraction frequency causes an increase in the number of myosin projections transferred to the vicinity of the thin filaments during contraction."
