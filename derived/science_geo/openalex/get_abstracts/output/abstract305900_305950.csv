https://openalex.org/W2059358039,"Approximately 25 percent of the dissolved silica carried by the Amazon River is depleted through diatom production in the inner estuary. Annual production of opaline frustules is estimated to be 15 million tons. However, few diatoms accumulate in modern shelf sediments and chemical recycling appears to be slight. Instead, many frustules apparently are transported landward into the river system, where they deposit in dunes and layers on and within mud and sand bars."
https://openalex.org/W2000189498,"In Ge and Si, and also in Ge-Si alloys, there is extensive evidence for the stable binding of electrons and holes into a cold plasma of constant density, which undergoes a phase separation. Liquid metallic drops 1 to 300 μm in size are formed, with lifetimes ranging from 0.1 to 600 μsec. For Ge a surprising amount is known: the phase diagram, the surface energy, the work function, the decay kinetics. Much less is known for Si. There is good agreement between theoretical and experimental values of the liquid density, the critical density, the critical temperature, and the binding energy. The stability of the liquid phase is strikingly dependent on band structure. The multivalley structure and mass anisotropy of Si, Ge, and Ge-Si, together with their indirect band gap, are no doubt responsible for the observed stability in these crystals. In the similar semiconductor gallium phosphide, drops have not yet been observed, most likely because the high impurity content traps the excitons. In gallium arsenide the existence of drops is controversial. Undoubtedly drops will be found to exist in other semiconductors, perhaps at even higher temperatures. This is an exciting field for the experimentalist; new phenomena are being rapidly discovered, usually before they are predicted. For the theorist, the electron-hole drop is of high intrinsic interest. It represents the first example of a quantum liquid of constant density in a periodic crystal lattice. A number of challenging experimental and theoretical problems remain."

Its application requires a knowledge of the daily solar radiation and the maximum and minimum air temperatures (standard Weather Service measurements), moist surface albedo (readily estimated or obtainable from a one-time measurement), and maximum and minimum surface temperatures (obtainable from surface or airborne sensors). Tests of the technique on a bare field of Avondale loam at Phoenix, Arizona, have shown it to be independent of season."
https://openalex.org/W2048125773,"The skeletons of living specimens of the scleractinian coral Porites lobata have been found to contain up to 46 +/- 5 percent low-magnesium calcite even though free of gross detrital inclusions and boring or encrusting organisms. The calcite crystals occur in the interior of skeletal structures, have dimensions of 20 micrometers or less, and are surrounded by typical aragonite needles. Biogenic deposition seems to be the most likely source of the calcite, although the evidence does not rule out diagenesis of metastable."
