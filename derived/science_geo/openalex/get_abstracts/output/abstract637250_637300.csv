https://openalex.org/W2904994892,"The electronic properties of heterostructures of atomically-thin van der Waals (vdW) crystals can be modified substantially by Moir\'e superlattice potentials arising from an interlayer twist between crystals. Moir\'e-tuning of the band structure has led to the recent discovery of superconductivity and correlated insulating phases in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) near the so-called ""magic angle"" of $\sim$1.1{\deg}, with a phase diagram reminiscent of high T$_c$ superconductors. However, lack of detailed understanding of the electronic spectrum and the atomic-scale influence of the Moir\'e pattern has so far precluded a coherent theoretical understanding of the correlated states. Here, we directly map the atomic-scale structural and electronic properties of TBLG near the magic angle using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We observe two distinct van Hove singularities (vHs) in the LDOS which decrease in separation monotonically through 1.1{\deg} with the bandwidth (t) of each vHs minimized near the magic angle. When doped near half Moir\'e band filling, the conduction vHs shifts to the Fermi level and an additional correlation-induced gap splits the vHs with a maximum size of 7.5 meV. We also find that three-fold (C$_3$) rotational symmetry of the LDOS is broken in doped TBLG with a maximum symmetry breaking observed for states near the Fermi level, suggestive of nematic electronic interactions. The main features of our doping and angle dependent spectroscopy are captured by a tight-binding model with on-site (U) and nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions. We find that the ratio U/t is of order unity, indicating that electron correlations are significant in magic angle TBLG. Rather than a simple maximization of the DOS, superconductivity arises in TBLG at angles where the ratio U/t is largest, suggesting a pairing mechanism based on electron-electron interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2966214074,"Ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are among the most lethal diseases affecting women, with few targeted therapies and high rates of metastasis. Cancer cells are capable of evading clearance by macrophages through the overexpression of anti-phagocytic surface proteins called 'don't eat me' signals-including CD471, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)2 and the beta-2 microglobulin subunit of the major histocompatibility class I complex (B2M)3. Monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the interaction of 'don't eat me' signals with their macrophage-expressed receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in several cancers4,5. However, variability in the magnitude and durability of the response to these agents has suggested the presence of additional, as yet unknown 'don't eat me' signals. Here we show that CD24 can be the dominant innate immune checkpoint in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, and is a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate a role for tumour-expressed CD24 in promoting immune evasion through its interaction with the inhibitory receptor sialic-acid-binding Ig-like lectin 10 (Siglec-10), which is expressed by tumour-associated macrophages. We find that many tumours overexpress CD24 and that tumour-associated macrophages express high levels of Siglec-10. Genetic ablation of either CD24 or Siglec-10, as well as blockade of the CD24-Siglec-10 interaction using monoclonal antibodies, robustly augment the phagocytosis of all CD24-expressing human tumours that we tested. Genetic ablation and therapeutic blockade of CD24 resulted in a macrophage-dependent reduction of tumour growth in vivo and an increase in survival time. These data reveal CD24 as a highly expressed, anti-phagocytic signal in several cancers and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for CD24 blockade in cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2964696298,"The early prediction of deterioration could have an important role in supporting healthcare professionals, as an estimated 11% of deaths in hospital follow a failure to promptly recognize and treat deteriorating patients1. To achieve this goal requires predictions of patient risk that are continuously updated and accurate, and delivered at an individual level with sufficient context and enough time to act. Here we develop a deep learning approach for the continuous risk prediction of future deterioration in patients, building on recent work that models adverse events from electronic health records2–17 and using acute kidney injury—a common and potentially life-threatening condition18—as an exemplar. Our model was developed on a large, longitudinal dataset of electronic health records that cover diverse clinical environments, comprising 703,782 adult patients across 172 inpatient and 1,062 outpatient sites. Our model predicts 55.8% of all inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury, and 90.2% of all acute kidney injuries that required subsequent administration of dialysis, with a lead time of up to 48 h and a ratio of 2 false alerts for every true alert. In addition to predicting future acute kidney injury, our model provides confidence assessments and a list of the clinical features that are most salient to each prediction, alongside predicted future trajectories for clinically relevant blood tests9. Although the recognition and prompt treatment of acute kidney injury is known to be challenging, our approach may offer opportunities for identifying patients at risk within a time window that enables early treatment. A deep learning approach that predicts the risk of acute kidney injury may help to identify patients at risk of health deterioration within a time window that enables early treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2966854986,"We sought to determine whether pre-eclampsia, spontaneous preterm birth or the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age were associated with the presence of bacterial DNA in the human placenta. Here we show that there was no evidence for the presence of bacteria in the large majority of placental samples, from both complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies. Almost all signals were related either to the acquisition of bacteria during labour and delivery, or to contamination of laboratory reagents with bacterial DNA. The exception was Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), for which non-contaminant signals were detected in approximately 5% of samples collected before the onset of labour. We conclude that bacterial infection of the placenta is not a common cause of adverse pregnancy outcome and that the human placenta does not have a microbiome, but it does represent a potential site of perinatal acquisition of S. agalactiae, a major cause of neonatal sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2964871068,"Nutrition exerts considerable effects on health, and dietary interventions are commonly used to treat diseases of metabolic aetiology. Although cancer has a substantial metabolic component1, the principles that define whether nutrition may be used to influence outcomes of cancer are unclear2. Nevertheless, it is established that targeting metabolic pathways with pharmacological agents or radiation can sometimes lead to controlled therapeutic outcomes. By contrast, whether specific dietary interventions can influence the metabolic pathways that are targeted in standard cancer therapies is not known. Here we show that dietary restriction of the essential amino acid methionine-the reduction of which has anti-ageing and anti-obesogenic properties-influences cancer outcome, through controlled and reproducible changes to one-carbon metabolism. This pathway metabolizes methionine and is the target of a variety of cancer interventions that involve chemotherapy and radiation. Methionine restriction produced therapeutic responses in two patient-derived xenograft models of chemotherapy-resistant RAS-driven colorectal cancer, and in a mouse model of autochthonous soft-tissue sarcoma driven by a G12D mutation in KRAS and knockout of p53 (KrasG12D/+;Trp53-/-) that is resistant to radiation. Metabolomics revealed that the therapeutic mechanisms operate via tumour-cell-autonomous effects on flux through one-carbon metabolism that affects redox and nucleotide metabolism-and thus interact with the antimetabolite or radiation intervention. In a controlled and tolerated feeding study in humans, methionine restriction resulted in effects on systemic metabolism that were similar to those obtained in mice. These findings provide evidence that a targeted dietary manipulation can specifically affect tumour-cell metabolism to mediate broad aspects of cancer outcome."

https://openalex.org/W2965576600,"Cancer-associated systemic inflammation is strongly linked to poor disease outcome in patients with cancer1,2. For most human epithelial tumour types, high systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios are associated with poor overall survival3, and experimental studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between neutrophils and metastasis4,5. However, the cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms that dictate the substantial heterogeneity in systemic neutrophilic inflammation between tumour-bearing hosts are largely unresolved. Here, using a panel of 16 distinct genetically engineered mouse models for breast cancer, we uncover a role for cancer-cell-intrinsic p53 as a key regulator of pro-metastatic neutrophils. Mechanistically, loss of p53 in cancer cells induced the secretion of WNT ligands that stimulate tumour-associated macrophages to produce IL-1β, thus driving systemic inflammation. Pharmacological and genetic blockade of WNT secretion in p53-null cancer cells reverses macrophage production of IL-1β and subsequent neutrophilic inflammation, resulting in reduced metastasis formation. Collectively, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between the loss of p53 in cancer cells, secretion of WNT ligands and systemic neutrophilia that potentiates metastatic progression. These insights illustrate the importance of the genetic makeup of breast tumours in dictating pro-metastatic systemic inflammation, and set the stage for personalized immune intervention strategies for patients with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2966176854,"Exome-sequencing studies have generally been underpowered to identify deleterious alleles with a large effect on complex traits as such alleles are mostly rare. Because the population of northern and eastern Finland has expanded considerably and in isolation following a series of bottlenecks, individuals of these populations have numerous deleterious alleles at a relatively high frequency. Here, using exome sequencing of nearly 20,000 individuals from these regions, we investigate the role of rare coding variants in clinically relevant quantitative cardiometabolic traits. Exome-wide association studies for 64 quantitative traits identified 26 newly associated deleterious alleles. Of these 26 alleles, 19 are either unique to or more than 20 times more frequent in Finnish individuals than in other Europeans and show geographical clustering comparable to Mendelian disease mutations that are characteristic of the Finnish population. We estimate that sequencing studies of populations without this unique history would require hundreds of thousands to millions of participants to achieve comparable association power."
https://openalex.org/W2965102826,"The cooling of the Earth’s climate through the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds offsets an unknown fraction of greenhouse gas warming. An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth’s surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources—such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships—reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 23% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate."
https://openalex.org/W2964667254,"Background Endotoxin induces an inflammatory response, with secondary release of cytokines, which can progress to shock and multiple organ failure. We explored whether continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using a modified membrane (oXiris) capable of adsorption could reduce endotoxin and cytokine levels in septic patients. Methods Sixteen patients requiring CRRT for septic shock-associated acute renal failure and who had endotoxin levels >0.03 EU/ml were prospectively randomized in a crossover double-blind design to receive CRRT with an oXiris filter or with a standard filter. Endotoxin and cytokine levels were measured at baseline and 1, 3, 8, 16 and 24 hours after the start of CRRT. Norepinephrine infusion rate and blood lactate levels were monitored. Results During the first filter treatment period, endotoxin levels decreased in 7 of 9 (77.8%) oXiris filter patients, but in only 1 of 6 (16.7%) standard filter patients (P = 0.02). Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and interferon (IFN)γ decreased more with the oXiris filter than with the standard filter. Lactate concentration decreased with oXiris (-1.3[-2.2 to -1.1] mmol/l, P = 0.02), but not with the standard filter (+0.15[-0.95 to 0.6]). The norepinephrine infusion rate was reduced during oXiris CRRT, but not during standard filter CRRT. In the second filter treatment period, there was no significant reduction in endotoxin or cytokine levels in either group. Conclusions CRRT with the oXiris filter seemed to allow effective removal of endotoxin and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IFNγ in patients with septic shock-associated acute renal failure. This may be associated with beneficial hemodynamic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2964703879,"Both single and multicellular organisms depend on anti-stress mechanisms that enable them to deal with sudden changes in the environment, including exposure to heat and oxidants. Central to the stress response are dynamic changes in metabolism, such as the transition from the glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway-a conserved first-line response to oxidative insults1,2. Here we report a second metabolic adaptation that protects microbial cells in stress situations. The role of the yeast polyamine transporter Tpo1p3-5 in maintaining oxidant resistance is unknown6. However, a proteomic time-course experiment suggests a link to lysine metabolism. We reveal a connection between polyamine and lysine metabolism during stress situations, in the form of a promiscuous enzymatic reaction in which the first enzyme of the polyamine pathway, Spe1p, decarboxylates lysine and forms an alternative polyamine, cadaverine. The reaction proceeds in the presence of extracellular lysine, which is taken up by cells to reach concentrations up to one hundred times higher than those required for growth. Such extensive harvest is not observed for the other amino acids, is dependent on the polyamine pathway and triggers a reprogramming of redox metabolism. As a result, NADPH-which would otherwise be required for lysine biosynthesis-is channelled into glutathione metabolism, leading to a large increase in glutathione concentrations, lower levels of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidant tolerance. Our results show that nutrient uptake occurs not only to enable cell growth, but when the nutrient availability is favourable it also enables cells to reconfigure their metabolism to preventatively mount stress protection."
https://openalex.org/W2965595061,"Cation–chloride cotransporters (CCCs) mediate the electroneutral transport of chloride, potassium and/or sodium across the membrane. They have critical roles in regulating cell volume, controlling ion absorption and secretion across epithelia, and maintaining intracellular chloride homeostasis. These transporters are primary targets for some of the most commonly prescribed drugs. Here we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Na–K–Cl cotransporter NKCC1, an extensively studied member of the CCC family, from Danio rerio. The structure defines the architecture of this protein family and reveals how cytosolic and transmembrane domains are strategically positioned for communication. Structural analyses, functional characterizations and computational studies reveal the ion-translocation pathway, ion-binding sites and key residues for transport activity. These results provide insights into ion selectivity, coupling and translocation, and establish a framework for understanding the physiological functions of CCCs and interpreting disease-related mutations. The cryo-EM structure of the zebrafish cation–chloride cotransporter NKCC1 reveals the domain organization, ion translocation pathway, ion-binding sites and key residues for binding activity, providing insights into the activity of this family of transporter proteins with key roles in physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2966823177,"Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, a potentially lethal enteric bacterial infection1. Cholera toxin (CTX), a protein complex that is secreted by V. cholerae, is required for V. cholerae to cause severe disease. CTX is also thought to promote transmission of the organism, as infected individuals shed many litres of diarrhoeal fluid that typically contains in excess of 1011 organisms per litre. How the pathogen is able to reach such high concentrations in the intestine during infection remains poorly understood. Here we show that CTX increases pathogen growth and induces a distinct V. cholerae transcriptomic signature that is indicative of an iron-depleted gut niche. During infection, bacterial pathogens need to acquire iron, which is an essential nutrient for growth2. Most iron in the mammalian host is found in a chelated form within the porphyrin structure of haem, and the ability to use haem as a source of iron is genetically encoded by V. cholerae3. We show that the genes that enable V. cholerae to obtain iron via haem and vibriobactin confer a growth advantage to the pathogen only when CTX is produced. Furthermore, we found that CTX-induced congestion of capillaries in the terminal ileum correlated with an increased bioavailability of luminal haem. CTX-induced disease in the ileum also led to increased concentrations of long-chain fatty acids and l-lactate metabolites in the lumen, as well as the upregulation of V. cholerae genes that encode enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that contain iron–sulfur clusters. Genetic analysis of V. cholerae suggested that pathogen growth was dependent on the uptake of haem and long-chain fatty acids during infection, but only in a strain capable of producing CTX in vivo. We conclude that CTX-induced disease creates an iron-depleted metabolic niche in the gut, which selectively promotes the growth of V. cholerae through the acquisition of host-derived haem and fatty acids. Cholera toxin selectively promotes the growth of Vibrio cholerae through the acquisition of nutrients, including haem and fatty acids, from the host gut."
https://openalex.org/W2965378906,"Background People with multimorbidity have reduced functional capacity, lower quality of life, higher mortality rates and use healthcare resources more intensively than healthy people or those with a single chronic condition. Multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same person. The aim of this study was to explore associations between multimorbidity and use of healthcare services and the impact of socioeconomic status on utilization of hospitalizations and bed days. Methods The study population included all individuals aged 16 years and older who lived in the Capital Region of Denmark on January 1st, 2012. Data on chronic conditions, use of healthcare services and demographics were obtained from Danish national administrative and health registries. Zero-inflated models were used to calculate anticipated annual use of hospitalizations and bed days. Findings The study population comprised 1,397,173 individuals; the prevalence of multimorbidity was 22%. Prevalence was inversely related to educational attainment. For people with multimorbidity, utilization of hospitalizations and bed days increased approximately linearly with the number of chronic conditions. However, a steep increase in utilization of bed days was observed between five and six or more chronic conditions. An educational gradient in hospitalization rates and use of bed days was observed regardless of the number of chronic conditions. Educational attainment was strongly associated with healthcare utilization. Conclusion Multimorbidity was associated with a significant increase in utilization of all healthcare services in Denmark. In addition, a socioeconomic gradient was observed in utilization of hospitalizations and bed days."

We investigated face-to-face and telephone contact at three times (pre-diagnosis, at report of diagnosis, 2 years post-diagnosis) in individuals who developed dementia and a comparison group.Social engagement was assessed at waves 2-7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 4171 individuals aged 50 and older. Dementia was ascertained by either self-reported physician diagnosis or through an informant evaluation of a participant's functional and cognitive performance compared with a few years earlier. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine differences by group, time, and group-by-time interactions.The dementia group reported less face-to-face (p < 0.001) and telephone contact (p < 0.001) than the dementia-free group pre-diagnosis. The dementia group experienced greater reductions in social engagement leading up to dementia diagnosis and in the 2 years following diagnosis (p's < 0.001).Given that social engagement reduces dementia risk and supports the lived experience of people with dementia, it is important to find ways of promoting social interaction in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2964469325,"Background A general recommendation for adult pneumococcal vaccination with 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) for adults 60 and older has been in place in Germany since 1998, but uptake has been low. Just over a decade after the implementation of an infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recommendation, we examined indirect protection effects on adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Germany. Methods and findings Reported IPD cases decreased in children under two years of age from 11.09 per 100,000 in 2003–2006 to 5.94 per 100,000 in 2017/18, while in adult age groups, reported IPD cases rose across the board, most dramatically in adults 60 years of age and over, from 1.64 to 10.08 cases per 100,000. PCV13-type IPD represents 31% of all cases in this age group, the lion’s share of which is due to the rapid increase of serotype 3 IPD, which, by itself, has reached 2.11 reported cases per 100,000 and makes up 21% of all IPD cases in this age group. The two vaccine formulations currently in development (PCV15 and PCV20) would increase current (PCV13) coverage by 8.5% points and 28.0% points in children, while in adults coverage would increase by 10.4% points and 21.9% points, respectively. Conclusions While original models predicted that indirect effects of childhood vaccination would suffice for adults, it seems that the herd protection effect has reached its limit, with vaccine serotypes 4, 19F, and 19A IPD persisting in adults after initial reductions, and serotype 3 IPD not showing any herd protection effect at all."
https://openalex.org/W2922359247,"Drug-drug interactions are preventable causes of medical injuries and often result in doctor and emergency room visits. Computational techniques can be used to predict potential drug-drug interactions. We approach the drug-drug interaction prediction problem as a link prediction problem and present two novel methods for drug-drug interaction prediction based on artificial neural networks and factor propagation over graph nodes: adjacency matrix factorization (AMF) and adjacency matrix factorization with propagation (AMFP). We conduct a retrospective analysis by training our models on a previous release of the DrugBank database with 1,141 drugs and 45,296 drug-drug interactions and evaluate the results on a later version of DrugBank with 1,440 drugs and 248,146 drug-drug interactions. Additionally, we perform a holdout analysis using DrugBank. We report an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.807 and 0.990 for the retrospective and holdout analyses respectively. Finally, we create an ensemble-based classifier using AMF, AMFP, and existing link prediction methods and obtain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.814 and 0.991 for the retrospective and the holdout analyses. We demonstrate that AMF and AMFP provide state of the art results compared to existing methods and that the ensemble-based classifier improves the performance by combining various predictors. These results suggest that AMF, AMFP, and the proposed ensemble-based classifier can provide important information during drug development and regarding drug prescription given only partial or noisy data. These methods can also be used to solve other link prediction problems. Drug embeddings (compressed representations) created when training our models using the interaction network have been made public."
https://openalex.org/W2965517785,"There has been growing recognition of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) as a significant public health issue. However, research has predominately focused on the experiences of adolescent girls in school settings. The purpose of this research is to examine detailed accounts of menstruation for women in rural Odisha, India at various life stages with a view toward improving international monitoring of MHM. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted to understand women’s experiences of menstruation across four life stages (unmarried women, recently married women, married women, and older women). Thematic analysis was used to identify menstruation-related challenges and needs. We found women voiced needs that aligned with those captured by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) definition for MHM: access to clean materials, privacy for changing materials, soap and water for bathing, and disposal facilities for materials. However, we also found women require materials that are not only clean but comfortable and reliable; soap and water for more than bathing; privacy for the full spectrum of menstruation-related practices, not just when changing; and disposal facilities that are private and safe, not just accessible. Additionally, we identified needs that extend beyond the existing definition: pain management, social support, and an enabling sociocultural environment. Overall, women representing all life stages discussed menstruation challenges, including bathing, pain, and washing, drying, and storing cloth materials. Cloth management challenges were most acute for unmarried and recently married women, who were concerned that practices could reveal their menstrual status and harm their reputations, thus informing their preference for disposable materials, if attainable. We propose a revised definition of adequate MHM for this population that more comprehensively captures their needs. This definition may also prove useful for other populations, future research, creating measures of assessment, and guiding interventions and program priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2966083230,"Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species' vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent ~65% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species' thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species' body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While CTmax and CTmin had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their CTmax, 25% might be moderately affected and 70% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3°C temperature increase."
https://openalex.org/W2965029812,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between gender and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) among African Americans and to assess demographic, systemic, and behavioral factors that may contribute to differences between genders. The Primary Open-Angle African American Glaucoma Genetics (POAAGG) study had a case-control design and included African Americans 35 years and older, recruited from the greater Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Diagnosis of POAG was based on evidence of both glaucomatous optic nerve damage and characteristic visual field loss. Demographic and behavioral information, history of systemic diseases and anthropometric measurements were obtained at study enrollment. Gender differences in risk of POAG were examined using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 2,290 POAG cases and 2,538 controls were included in the study. The percentage of men among cases was higher than among controls (38.6% vs 30.3%, P<0.001). The subjects’ mean age at enrollment was significantly higher for cases compared to controls (70.2±11.3 vs. 61.6±11.8 years, P<0.003). Cases had lower rates of diabetes (40% vs. 46%, P<0.001), higher rates of systemic hypertension (80% vs. 72%, P<0.001), and lower body mass index (BMI) (29.7±6.7 vs. 31.9±7.4, P<0.001) than controls. In the final multivariable model, male gender was significantly associated with POAG risk (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.44–1.87; P<0.001), after adjusting for age, systemic hypertension, diabetes, and BMI. Within the POAAGG study, men were at higher risk of having POAG than women. Pending genetic results from this study will be used to better understand the underlying genetic variations that may account for these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2964554480,"One of the main concerns for online shopping websites is to provide efficient and customized recommendations to a very large number of users based on their preferences. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most famous type of recommender system method to provide personalized recommendations to users. CF generates recommendations by identifying clusters of similar users or items from the user-item rating matrix. This cluster of similar users or items is generally identified by using some similarity measurement method. Among numerous proposed similarity measure methods by researchers, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is a commonly used similarity measure method for CF-based recommender systems. The standard PCC suffers some inherent limitations and ignores user rating preference behavior (RPB). Typically, users have different RPB, where some users may give the same rating to various items without liking the items and some users may tend to give average rating albeit liking the items. Traditional similarity measure methods (including PCC) do not consider this rating pattern of users. In this article, we present a novel similarity measure method to consider user RPB while calculating similarity among users. The proposed similarity measure method state user RPB as a function of user average rating value, and variance or standard deviation. The user RPB is then combined with an improved model of standard PCC to form an improved similarity measure method for CF-based recommender systems. The proposed similarity measure is named as improved PCC weighted with RPB (IPWR). The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the IPWR similarity measure method is performed using five state-of-the-art datasets (i.e. Epinions, MovieLens-100K, MovieLens-1M, CiaoDVD, and MovieTweetings). The IPWR similarity measure method performs better than state-of-the-art similarity measure methods in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), precision, recall, and F-measure."
https://openalex.org/W2964508302,"Germline de novo mutations are the basis of evolutionary diversity but also of genetic disease. However, the molecular origin, mechanisms and timing of germline mutagenesis are not fully understood. Here, we define a fundamental role for DNA interstrand cross-link repair in the germline. This repair process is essential for primordial germ cell (PGC) maturation during embryonic development. Inactivation of cross-link repair leads to genetic instability that is restricted to PGCs within the genital ridge during a narrow temporal window. Having successfully activated the PGC transcriptional program, a potent quality control mechanism detects and drives damaged PGCs into apoptosis. Therefore, these findings define a source of DNA damage and the nature of the subsequent DNA repair response in germ cells, which ensures faithful transmission of the genome between generations."
https://openalex.org/W2966621525,"Decreased muscle strength is not only a risk factor for hip fracture in older patients, but plays a role in recovery of physical function. Our aim was to assess the role of grip strength measured early after hip fracture, and classified according to the EWGSOP2 criteria in predicting short- and long-term functional recovery. One hundred ninety-one patients with acute hip fracture consecutively admitted to an orthopaedic hospital have been selected. A multidimensional geriatric assessment evaluating sociodemographic variables, cognitive status, functional status and quality of life prior to fracture, as well as perioperative variables were performed. Follow-ups at 3 and 6 months after surgery were carried out to evaluate functional recovery. Multivariate regression models were used to assess the predictive role of handgrip strength. The mean age of the participants was 80.3 ±6.8 years. Thirty-five percent of our patients with clinically relevant hand grip strength weakness were significantly older, more often female, had a lower BMI, and were of worse physical health. They also had a lower cognitive level, lower Barthel index, and lower EQ5D scores before fracture. Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender revealed that hand grip weakness was an independent predictor of worse functional outcome at 3 and 6 months after hip fracture for both genders and in all age populations. Our study supports the prognostic role of hand grip strength assessed at hospital admission in patients with hip fracture. Thus, clinicians should be encouraged to include hand grip assessment in their evaluation of hip fracture patients in the acute setting in order to optimize treatment of high-risk individuals."

SUU5 used systems science methods (agent-based modeling, group model building, social network analysis) to design, facilitate, and evaluate the work of 16 multisector stakeholders ('the Committee'). In this paper, we describe the design and methods of SUU5 using the conceptual framework: the approach to data collection, and methods and rationale for study inputs, activities and evaluation, which together may further our understanding of the hypothesized processes within Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. We also present a generalizable conceptual framework for addressing childhood obesity and similar complex public health issues through whole-of-community interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2965318525,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to interact with microRNAs (miRNA) as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate target gene expression and participate in tumorigenesis. However, the role of circRNA-mediated ceRNAs in bladder cancer (BC) remains unknown. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms in BC based on construction of the ceRNA network.The RNA expression profiles were obtained from public datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and were used to establish a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. The interactions among proteins were analyzed using the STRING database and hubgenes were extracted using the cytoHubba application. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of differentially expressed mRNAs in BC and normal tissue samples were performed to determine the functions of the intersecting mRNAs.A total of 27 circRNAs, 76 miRNAs, and 4744 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between BC and normal tissues. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was established based on 21 circRNAs, 14 miRNAs, and 150 mRNAs differentially expressed in BC. We also established a protein-protein interaction network and identified 10 hubgenes, which were used to construct circRNA-miRNA-hubgene regulatory modules. The most enriched biological process GO term was strand displacement (P<0.05), and the homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways were significantly enriched (P<0.05) for the differentially expressed genes in BC.We screened several dysregulated circRNAs and established a circRNA-associated ceRNA network by bioinformatics analysis. The identified ceRNAs are likely critical in the pathogenesis of BC and may serve as future therapeutic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2965672783,"Non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is mostly caused by a pivot shift mechanism including valgus collapse and internal tibial rotation. In female athletes, the incidence of ACL rupture has been reported to be significantly higher than in their male counterparts. However, to date, there have been limited reports and controversy regarding sex differences underlying injury mechanisms of ACL and severity of injury. In this study, we hypothesized that 1) in patients with non-contact ACL rupture, the incidence and severity of pivot shift injury, which are determined by injury pattern on MRI, would be significantly higher in females, and 2) anatomical factors associated with pivot shift injury would be significantly associated with female sex. A total of 148 primary ACL ruptures (145 patients) caused by non-contact injury mechanisms were included in this study. Among them, 41 knees (41 patients) were female and 107 knees (104 patients) were male. The status of the osseous lesions, lateral and medial tibial slope, depth of the medial tibial plateau, collateral ligaments, and menisci were assessed by MRI and compared between sexes. The severity of osseous lesions at the lateral tibial plateau, lateral femoral condyle, medial tibial plateau, and medial femoral condyle were comparable between sexes. There were no significant differences between sexes in the location of tibial contusions (p = 0.21), femoral contusions (p = 0.23), or meniscus tears (p = 0.189). Lateral tibial slope was found to be significantly larger in females (8.95° vs. 6.82°; p<0.0001; odds ratio = 1.464), and medial tibial depth was significantly shallower in females (1.80mm vs. 2.41mm; p<0.0001; odds ratio = 0.145). In conclusion, females showed greater lateral tibial slope and shallower medial tibial depth compared to males, however it did not affect the sex differences in injury pattern."

The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of a structured HIV testing intervention (DRIVE), compared to HIV testing as routinely performed in clinical practice, in two different clinical settings: a primary care center and an emergency department.Prospective evaluation of an HIV testing strategy in two clinical settings from the same healthcare area. The DRIVE program included trained nurse practitioners to perform the screening, a questionnaire to assess the risk of exposure and HIV indicator conditions (RE&IC), and rapid HIV tests. The main variables between the DRIVE program and clinical practice were the absolute number of newly diagnosed HIV infections and testing coverage.The DRIVE program included 5,329 participants, of which 51.2% reported at least one positive answer in the questionnaire. The estimated HIV testing coverage was significantly higher in the DRIVE program than in the routine clinical practice (7.17% vs. 0.96%, p < 0.001), and was better in the primary care center than in the emergency department with the two strategies. Twenty-two HIV-positive people were identified, with a rate of 8.6‰ in the emergency department vs. 2.2‰ in the primary care center (p = 0.001). A higher rate of new HIV diagnoses was found in the DRIVE program compared to routine clinical practice (29.6 vs. 3.1 per 100,000 patients attended; p < 0.001).An easy-to-implement, structured intervention increased the absolute number of new HIV diagnoses and HIV tests, compared to routine clinical practice."

https://openalex.org/W2965249010,"When many events contributed to an outcome, people consistently judge some more causal than others, based in part on the prior probabilities of those events. For instance, when a tree bursts into flames, people judge the lightning strike more of a cause than the presence of oxygen in the air—in part because oxygen is so common, and lightning strikes are so rare. These effects, which play a major role in several prominent theories of token causation, have largely been studied through qualitative manipulations of the prior probabilities. Yet, there is good reason to think that people’s causal judgments are on a continuum—and relatively little is known about how these judgments vary quantitatively as the prior probabilities change. In this paper, we measure people’s causal judgment across parametric manipulations of the prior probabilities of antecedent events. Our experiments replicate previous qualitative findings, and also reveal several novel patterns that are not well-described by existing theories."
https://openalex.org/W2965614206,"Abortive cell cycle (ACC) re-entry of apoptotic neurons is a recently characterized phenomenon that occurs after central nervous system (CNS) injury or over the course of CNS disease. Consequently, inhibiting cell cycle progression is neuroprotective in numerous CNS pathology models. Primary cilia are ubiquitous, centriole-based cellular organelles that prevent cell cycling, but their ability to modulate abortive cell cycle has not been described. Here, we show that neuronal cilia are ablated in-vitro and in-vivo following injury by hypoxia or optic nerve transection (ONT), respectively. Furthermore, forced cilia resorption sensitized neurons to these injuries and enhanced cell death. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition or shRNA knockdown of the proteins that disassemble the cilia increased neuron survival and decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb), a master switch for cell cycle re-entry. Our findings show that the stabilization of neuronal primary cilia inhibits, at least transiently, apoptotic cell cycling, which has implications for future therapeutic strategies that halt or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and acute CNS injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2965451737,"Resolving the phylogenetic relationships of closely related species using a small set of loci is challenging as sufficient information may not be captured from a limited sample of the genome. Relying on few loci can also be problematic when conflict between gene-trees arises from incomplete lineage sorting and/or ongoing hybridization, problems especially likely in recently diverged lineages. Here, we developed a method using limited genomic resources that allows identification of many low copy candidate loci from across the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, design probes for target capture and sequence the captured loci. To validate our method we present data from Eucalyptus and Melaleuca, two large and phylogenetically problematic genera within the Myrtaceae family. With one annotated genome, one transcriptome and two whole-genome shotgun sequences of one Eucalyptus and four Melaleuca species, respectively, we identified 212 loci representing 263 kbp for targeted sequence capture and sequencing. Of these, 209 were successfully tested from 47 samples across five related genera of Myrtaceae. The average percentage of reads mapped back to the reference was 57.6% with coverage of more than 20 reads per position across 83.5% of the data. The methods developed here should be applicable across a large range of taxa across all kingdoms. The core methods are very flexible, providing a platform for various genomic resource availabilities and are useful from shallow to deep phylogenies."

In this paper we present a detailed evaluation of the memory hierarchy performance for both the CPU2006 and single-threaded CPU2017 benchmarks. The experiments were executed on an Intel Xeon Skylake-SP, which is the first Intel processor to implement a mostly non-inclusive last-level cache (LLC). We present a classification of the benchmarks according to their memory pressure and analyze the performance impact of different LLC sizes. We also test all the hardware prefetchers showing they improve performance in most of the benchmarks. After comprehensive experimentation, we can highlight the following conclusions: i) almost half of SPEC CPU benchmarks have very low miss ratios in the second and third level caches, even with small LLC sizes and without hardware prefetching, ii) overall, the SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks demand even less memory hierarchy resources than the SPEC CPU2006 ones, iii) hardware prefetching is very effective in reducing LLC misses for most benchmarks, even with the smallest LLC size, and iv) from the memory hierarchy standpoint the methodologies commonly used to select benchmarks or simulation points do not guarantee representative workloads."

We investigated the relationship between high-normal albuminuria and subclinical atherosclerosis in non-diabetic men with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2.In this cross-sectional study, 1,756 men with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) <30 mg/g, who attended general health checkups between April 2012 and March 2015, underwent blood sampling, urinalysis, and carotid ultrasonography. We excluded the subjects who were diabetic and/or received an anti-hypertensive drug. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and the number of focal atheromatous plaques were used as indicators of subclinical atherosclerosis. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify clinical factors associated with carotid IMT. Poisson regression analysis was used to assess the determinants of the carotid plaque number.Median UACR was 4.8 mg/g (interquartile range, 3.6-6.9 mg/g). Compared with subjects with low-normal UACR (<10.0 mg/g), subjects with high-normal UACR (10.0-29.8 mg/g) had greater IMT and higher carotid plaque number. High-normal UACR was independently associated with thickened IMT in the model adjusted for conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Moreover, participants with high-normal UACR were also more likely to be associated with increased plaque count (prevalence ratio: 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.14) after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors.Our results indicate that high-normal albuminuria is associated with both carotid IMT and plaque formation in the non-diabetic male population with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2."
https://openalex.org/W2965007447,"Background This prospective cohort investigation analyzed the long-term functional and neurologic outcomes of patients with Zika virus-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Barranquilla, Colombia. Methods Thirty-four Zika virus-associated GBS cases were assessed a median of 17 months following acute GBS illness. We assessed demographics, results of Overall Disability Sum Scores (ODSS), Hughes Disability Score (HDS), Zung Depression Scale (ZDS), and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaires; and compared outcomes indices with a normative sample of neighborhood-selected control subjects in Barranquilla without GBS. Results Median age at time of acute neurologic onset was 49 years (range, 10–80); 17 (50%) were male. No deaths occurred. At long-term follow-up, 25 (73%) patients had a HDS 0–1, indicating complete / near complete recovery. Among the group, HDS (mean 1.4, range 0–4), ODSS (mean 1.9, range 0–9) and ZDS score (mean 34.4, range 20–56) indicated mild / moderate ongoing disability. Adjusting for age and sex, Zika virus-associated GBS cases were similar to a population comparison group (n = 368) in Barranquilla without GBS in terms of prevalence of physical or mental health complaints, though GBS patients were more likely to have an ODSS of ≥ 1 (OR 8.8, 95% CI 3.2–24.5) and to suffer from moderate / moderate-severe depression (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.23–11.17) than the comparison group. Conclusions Long-term outcomes of Zika virus-associated GBS are consistent with those associated with other antecedent antigenic stimuli in terms of mortality and ongoing long-term morbidity, as published in the literature. Persons with Zika virus-associated GBS more frequently reported disability and depression after approximately one year compared with those without GBS."
https://openalex.org/W2966584750,"Background Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease with a global distribution, affecting a wide range of mammalian animals and humans. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the major vector-borne zoonotic disease in the Asia-Pacific region. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of serovar-specific Leptospira and JE in swine from 10 provinces in Vietnam. Methods Samples were initially collected for swine influenza surveillance from March to April 2017 at large-scale farms (with at least 50 sows and/or 250 fattening pigs) with pigs that tested positive for influenza in the previous surveillance period (2015–16). Findings A total of 2,000 sera samples were analyzed from 10 provinces. Overall, the seroprevalence of leptospirosis was 21.05% (95% CI: 19.28–22.90) using a cut-off titer of ≥ 1:100. The apparent prevalence of JE was 73.45% (95% CI: 71.46–75.37) while the true prevalence was slightly higher (74.46%, 95% credible interval: 73.73–86.41). We found a relatively high presence of leptospirosis and JE in pigs kept on large farms. Prevalence was comparable with other studies suggesting opportunistic testing of samples collected for other surveillance purposes can be a valuable tool to better understand and prevent the potential transmission of these zoonotic diseases from pigs to people in Vietnam. Conclusion Our study provides evidence to veterinarians and animal health professionals for evidence-based practice such as diagnosis, vaccination and zoonotic control. Further investigation into the possible role of different domestic animals, wildlife species or environmental factors is needed to identify the potential risk factors and transmission routes in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W2965637785,"Administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to rodents at varying concentrations and exposure times is commonly used to model human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Currently, the criteria used to assess IBD-like pathology seldom include surrogate measures of visceral pain. Thus, we sought to standardize the model and then identify surrogate measures to assess effects on visceral pain. We used various 4% DSS protocols and evaluated effects on weight loss, colon pathology, biochemistry, RNA signature, and open field behavior. We then tested the therapeutic potential of NPY Y1 and/or Y2 receptor inhibition for the treatment of IBD pathology using this expanded panel of outcome measures. DSS caused weight loss and colon shrinkage, increased colon NPY and inflammatory cytokine expression, altered behaviors in the open field and induced a distinct gene metasignature that significantly overlapped with that of human IBD patients. Inhibition of Y1 and/or Y2 receptors failed to improve gross colon pathology. Y1 antagonism significantly attenuated colon inflammatory cytokine expression without altering pain-associated behaviors while Y2 antagonism significantly inhibited pain-associated behaviors in spite of a limited effect on inflammatory markers. A protocol using 7 days of 4% DSS most closely modeled human IBD pathology. In this model, rearing behavior potentially represents a tool for evaluating visceral pain/discomfort that may be pharmacologically dissociable from other features of pathology. The finding that two different NPY receptor antagonists exhibited different efficacy profiles highlights the benefit of including a variety of outcome measures in IBD efficacy studies to most fully evaluate the therapeutic potential of experimental treatments."

We used Quantum Geographical Information System (QGIS) software to reconstruct and quantify its past distribution range and compare with its current one. Snow leopard was found more widely distributed in the past having a distribution range of approximately 10.47 million km2 against the current 3.20 million km2. Range contraction of the species approximates 69%. A total of 719 terrestrial protected areas of Asia (out of total 7209) had this species in the past whereas at current, only 311 protected areas support this species.

https://openalex.org/W2966615240,"Dps proteins (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) have been found to detoxify H2O2. At their catalytic centers, the ferroxidase center (FOC), Dps proteins utilize Fe2+ to reduce H2O2 and therefore play an essential role in the protection against oxidative stress and maintaining iron homeostasis. Whereas most bacteria accommodate one or two Dps, there are five different Dps proteins in Nostoc punctiforme, a phototrophic and filamentous cyanobacterium. This uncommonly high number of Dps proteins implies a sophisticated machinery for maintaining complex iron homeostasis and for protection against oxidative stress. Functional analyses and structural information on cyanobacterial Dps proteins are rare, but essential for understanding the function of each of the NpDps proteins. In this study, we present the crystal structure of NpDps4 in its metal-free, iron- and zinc-bound forms. The FOC coordinates either two iron atoms or one zinc atom. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that NpDps4 could oxidize Fe2+ utilizing O2, but no evidence for its use of the oxidant H2O2 could be found. We identified Zn2+ to be an effective inhibitor of the O2-mediated Fe2+ oxidation in NpDps4. NpDps4 exhibits a FOC that is very different from canonical Dps, but structurally similar to the atypical one from DpsA of Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Sequence comparisons among Dps protein homologs to NpDps4 within the cyanobacterial phylum led us to classify a novel FOC class: the His-type FOC. The features of this special FOC have not been identified in Dps proteins from other bacterial phyla and it might be unique to cyanobacterial Dps proteins."

Although, advances in genome-wide technologies have enabled the discovery of hundreds of genes associated with blood lipid phenotypes, most of the heritability remains unexplained. Here we performed targeted resequencing of 13 bona fide candidate genes of dyslipidemia to identify the underlying biological functions. We sequenced 940 Sikh subjects with extreme serum levels of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and 2,355 subjects were used for replication studies; all 3,295 participants were part of the Asian Indians Diabetic Heart Study. Gene-centric analysis revealed burden of variants for increasing HTG risk in GCKR (p = 2.1x10-5), LPL (p = 1.6x10-3) and MLXIPL (p = 1.6x10-2) genes. Of these, three missense and damaging variants within GCKR were further examined for functional consequences in vivo using a transgenic zebrafish model. All three mutations were South Asian population-specific and were largely absent in other multiethnic populations of Exome Aggregation Consortium. We built different transgenic models of human GCKR with and without mutations and analyzed the effects of dietary changes in vivo. Despite the short-term of feeding, profound phenotypic changes were apparent in hepatocyte histology and fat deposition associated with increased expression of GCKR in response to a high fat diet (HFD). Liver histology of the GCKRmut showed severe fatty metamorphosis which correlated with ~7 fold increase in the mRNA expression in the GCKRmut fish even in the absence of a high fat diet. These findings suggest that functionally disruptive GCKR variants not only increase the risk of HTG but may enhance ectopic lipid/fat storage defects in absence of obesity and HFD. To our knowledge, this is the first transgenic zebrafish model of a putative human disease gene built to accurately assess the influence of genetic changes and their phenotypic consequences in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2964644734,"Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein of Neisseria meningitidis and a component of the Bexsero vaccine. NHBA is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved Arg-rich region involved in binding to heparin and heparan sulphate proteoglycans present on the surface of host epithelial cells, suggesting a possible role of NHBA during N. meningitidis colonization. NHBA has been shown to be cleaved by the meningococcal protease NalP and by human lactoferrin (hLF), a host protease presents in different body fluids (saliva, breast milk and serum). Cleavage occurs upstream or downstream the Arg-rich region. Since the human nasopharynx is the only known reservoir of infection, we further investigated the susceptibility of NHBA to human proteases present in the saliva to assess whether proteolytic cleavage could happen during the initial steps of colonization. Here we show that human saliva proteolytically cleaves NHBA, and identified human kallikrein 1 (hK1), a serine protease, as responsible for this cleavage. Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) have a distinct domain structure and exist as a family of 15 genes which are differentially expressed in many tissues and in the central nervous system. They are present in plasma, lymph, urine, saliva, pancreatic juices, and other body fluids where they catalyze the proteolysis of several human proteins. Here we report the characterization of NHBA cleavage by the tissue kallikrein, expressed in saliva and the identification of the cleavage site on NHBA both, as recombinant protein or as native protein, when expressed on live bacteria. Overall, these findings provide new insights on NHBA as target of host proteases, highlights thepotential role of NHBA in the Neisseria meningitidis nasopharyngeal colonization, and of kallikrein as a defensive agent against meningococcal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2965011852,"Agricultural landscapes are seen as areas of extreme importance for studying and developing strategies which integrate biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services with food production. The main strategies for intensifying agriculture are based on conventional agricultural practices of frequently using inputs for fertilization and correcting soil pH. Some studies show that these practices generate impacts on nearby forest fragments through soil contamination and increasing nutrient content. The objective of this study was to identify the impacts on the functional groups of sciophilous (late successional/shade-tolerant species) and heliophilous (pioneer/sun-loving) species of a tree community of 14 forest fragments near pasture areas and agricultural areas under conventional practices, raising the hypothesis that higher-fertility forest fragments adjacent to intensive agriculture modify the floristic composition of the tree community. Consequently, this study is based on the following questions: i) Do forest fragments within intensive farming environments present differences in floristic composition of species?; ii) Does the soil fertility influence the tree species composition?; iii) Which variables influence species abundance and richness in the forest fragments with different types of use around their environment? The floristic composition of fragments close to agricultural areas are more similar to each other than the composition of fragments close to pasture areas. Furthermore, the General Linear Model (GLM) results show a clear influence of the intensive farming environment on the richness and abundance of the two functional groups in the forest fragments, directly benefiting the abundance of heliophilous species, which are also benefited by the greater declivity and smaller fragment area, while the abundance of sciophytes is negatively correlated with these last two variables. The increase of calcium content is beneficial for the richness of heliophilous species, while the increase in phosphorus content influences a reduction in the richness of sciophyte species, which also strongly respond to the isolation between fragments. The results indicate a dominance trend of pioneer species in fragments with nutritionally enriched soils, providing evidence that the intense adoption of inputs in cultivated areas causes concrete impacts on the diversity of the tree community."
https://openalex.org/W2966285211,"Background Previous studies have revealed an important role for the transcription factor GATA-1 in mast cell maturation and degranulation. However, there have been conflicting reports with respect to the requirement of GATA-1 function in mast cell dependent inflammatory processes. Herein, we examine the requirement of GATA-1 signaling in mast cell effector function and IgE-mast cell-dependent anaphylaxis. Objective To study the requirement of GATA-1 dependent signaling in the development and severity of IgE-mast cell-dependent anaphylaxis in mice. Methods Wild type (Balb/c) and mutant ΔdblGata (Balb/c) mice were employed to study the role of GATA-1 signaling in in vitro IgE-mediated activation of bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs). Murine models of passive IgE-mediated and oral antigen-induced IgE-mediated anaphylaxis were employed in mice. Frequency of steady state mast cells in various tissues (duodenum, ear, and tongue), peritoneal cavity, and clinical symptoms (diarrhea, shock, and mast cell activation) and intestinal Type 2 immune cell analysis including CD4+ Th2 cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and IL-9 secreting mucosal mast cells (MMC9) were assessed Results In vitro analysis revealed that ΔdblGata BMMCs exhibit a reduced maturation rate, decreased expression of FcεRIα, and degranulation capacity when compared to their wildtype (WT) counterparts. These in vitro differences did not impact tissue resident mast cell numbers, total IgE, and susceptibility to or severity of IgE-mediated passive anaphylaxis. Surprisingly, ΔdblGata mice were more susceptible to IgE-mast cell-mediated oral antigen induced anaphylaxis. The increased allergic response was associated with increased Type 2 immunity (antigen-specific IgE, and CD4+ TH2 cells), MMC9 cells and small intestine (SI) mast cell load. Conclusion Diminished GATA-1 activity results in reduced in vitro mast cell FcεRIα expression, proliferation, and degranulation activity. However, in vivo, diminished GATA-1 activity results in normal homeostatic tissue mast cell levels and increased antigen-induced CD4+ Th2 and iMMC9 cell levels and heightened IgE-mast cell mediated reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2966052052,"Background The cocirculation of duck hepatitis A virus subtypes 1 (DHAV-1) and 3 (DHAV-3) in ducklings has resulted in significant economic losses. Ducklings with DHAV-1 or DHAV-3 infection show similar clinical signs and gross lesions; hence, it is important to identify the viral subtypes in infected ducklings as early as possible for better clinical management. Methods and results Based on multiple 5’ noncoding region (5’-NCR) sequences of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 strain alignments, universal and type-specific primers were designed and synthesized. With three primers in one-tube reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), reference DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 isolates ranging over 60 years and across many different countries were successfully amplified, indicating that the primer sequences were completely conserved. The sequence results and the sizes of amplicons from reference DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 isolates are completely correlated with their subtypes. Moreover, with this one-tube RT-PCR system, amplicon sizes from liver samples of reference DHAV-1- or DHAV-3-infected birds fit closely with their subtypes, which was determined by virus isolation and neutralization testing. No other duck-origin RNA viruses were detected. The sensitivity of viral RNA detection was 10 pg. With this system, 20% subtype 1, 45% subtype 3, and 9% coinfection of two subtypes were detected in 55 clinical samples. Conclusions and significance This novel approach could be used for rapidly typing DHAV-1 or DHAV-3 infection in routine clinical surveillance or epidemiological screening."

While the mechanisms behind the sequential nature of the underlying brain activity are likely multifarious and multi-scale, in this work we attempt to characterize to what degree some of this properties can be explained as a consequence of simple associative learning. To this end, we employ a parsimonious firing-rate attractor network equipped with the Hebbian-like Bayesian Confidence Propagating Neural Network (BCPNN) learning rule relying on synaptic traces with asymmetric temporal characteristics. The proposed network model is able to encode and reproduce temporal aspects of the input, and offers internal control of the recall dynamics by gain modulation. We provide an analytical characterisation of the relationship between the structure of the weight matrix, the dynamical network parameters and the temporal aspects of sequence recall. We also present a computational study of the performance of the system under the effects of noise for an extensive region of the parameter space. Finally, we show how the inclusion of modularity in our network structure facilitates the learning and recall of multiple overlapping sequences even in a noisy regime."

The nature of signaling abnormalities in primary cells from PMF patients is poorly understood, since most of the work has been performed in cell lines or animal models. By flow cytometry we measured constitutive and cytokine induced phosphorylation of STAT5, STAT3, and ERK1/2 in circulating CD34+ cells from 57 patients with PMF (20 with prefibrotic-PMF) and 13 healthy controls (CTRLs). Levels of constitutive and TPO induced p-STAT5, and IL6 induced p-STAT3 were higher in patients than in CTRLs. Constitutive p-STAT5 values were lower in CALR than homozygous JAK2V617F mutated CD34+ cells from PMF patients. Moreover, constitutive p-STAT5 and IL6 induced p-STAT3 values correlated directly with circulating CD34+ cell number/L, and inversely with the frequency of circulating CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4. Constitutive p-STAT5 values of CD34+ cells were also inversely correlated with hemoglobin levels. When the patients were divided according with presence/absence of JAK2V617F mutation, all the correlations described characterized the JAK2V617F+ patients with prefibrotic-PMF (P-PMF). In conclusion, increased constitutive p-STAT5 and IL6 induced p-STAT3 values in circulating CD34+ cells characterize patients with PMF. Constitutive p-STAT5 and IL6 induced p-STAT3 values correlate with circulating CD34+ cell number/L, the frequency of circulating CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4 and hemoglobin levels within the prefibrotic JAK2V617F+ patient population. Our data point toward a complex activation of STAT5-dependent pathways in the stem/progenitor cell compartment, that characterize the phenotypic diversity of PMF."

When first implemented, MMP excluded persons living with HIV not receiving HIV care. This analysis will describe new case-surveillance-based methods to identify and recruit persons living with HIV who are out of care and at elevated risk for mortality and ongoing HIV transmission. Stratified random samples of all persons living with HIV were selected from the National HIV Surveillance System in five public health jurisdictions from 2012-2014. Sampled persons were located and contacted through seven different data sources and five methods of contact to collect interviews and medical record abstractions. Data were weighted for non-response and case reporting delay. The modified sampling methodology yielded 1159 interviews (adjusted response rate, 44.5%) and matching medical record abstractions for 1087 (93.8%). Of persons with both interview and medical record data, 264 (24.3%) would not have been included using prior MMP methods. Significant predictors were identified for successful contact (e.g., retention in care, adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 5.02; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.98-12.73), interview (e.g. moving out of jurisdiction, aOR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12-0.46) and case reporting delay (e.g. rural residence, aOR 3.18; 95% CI: 2.09-4.85). Case-surveillance-based sampling resulted in a comparable response rate to existing MMP methods while providing information on an important new population. These methods have since been adopted by the nationally representative MMP surveillance system, offering a model for public health program, research and surveillance endeavors seeking inclusion of all persons living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2966544621,"Single enzymatic cascade, ubiquitously found in cellular signaling networks, is a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction cycle causing a transition between inactive and active states of a protein catalysed by kinase and phosphatase, respectively. Steady-state information processing ability of such a cycle (e.g., MAPK cascade) has been classified into four qualitatively different operating regimes, viz., hyperbolic (H), signal-transducing (ST), threshold-hyperbolic (TH) and ultrasensitive (U). These four regimes represent qualitatively different dose-response curves, that is, relationship between concentrations of input kinase (e.g., pMEK) and response activated protein (e.g., pERK). Regimes were identified using a deterministic model accounting for population-averaged behavior only. Operating regimes can be strongly influenced by the inherently present cell-to-cell variability in an ensemble of cells which is captured in the form of pMEK and pERK distributions using reporter-based single-cell experimentation. In this study, we show that such experimentally acquired snapshot pMEK and pERK distribution data of a single MAPK cascade can be directly used to infer the underlying operating regime even in the absence of a dose-response curve. This deduction is possible primarily due to the presence of a monotonic relationship between experimental observables RIQR, ratio of the inter-quartile range of the pERK and pMEK distribution pairs and RM, ratio of the medians of the distribution pair. We demonstrate this relationship by systematic analysis of a quasi-steady state approximated model superimposed with an input gamma distribution constrained by the stimulus strength specific pMEK distribution measured on Jurkat-T cells stimulated with PMA. As a first, we show that introduction of cell-to-cell variability only in the upstream kinase achieved by superimposition of an appropriate input pMEK distribution on the dose-response curve can predict bimodal response pERK distribution in ST regime. Implementation of the proposed method on the input-response distribution pair obtained in stimulated Jurkat-T cells revealed that while low-dosage PMA stimulation preserves the H regime observed in resting cells, high-dosage causes H to ST regime transition."
