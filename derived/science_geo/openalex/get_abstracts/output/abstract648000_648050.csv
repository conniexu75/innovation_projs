https://openalex.org/W3005780203,"Ferroptosis is widely involved in degenerative diseases in various tissues including kidney, liver and brain, and is a targetable vulnerability in multiple primary and therapy-resistant cancers. Accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides in cellular membranes is the hallmark and rate-limiting step of ferroptosis; however, the enzymes contributing to lipid peroxidation remain poorly characterized. Using genome-wide, CRISPR–Cas9-mediated suppressor screens, we identify cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) as necessary for ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells exhibiting inherent and induced susceptibility to ferroptosis. By genetic depletion of POR in cancer cells, we reveal that POR contributes to ferroptosis across a wide range of lineages and cell states, and in response to distinct mechanisms of ferroptosis induction. Using systematic lipidomic profiling, we further map POR’s activity to the lipid peroxidation step in ferroptosis. Hence, our work suggests that POR is a key mediator of ferroptosis and potential druggable target for developing antiferroptosis therapeutics. Using genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9-mediated suppressor screens, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase was identified as a contributor to ferroptotic cell death by promoting phospholipid peroxidation in various cellular lineages."

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics. Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8αα+ T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment. Taken together, our data provide a comprehensive atlas of the human thymus across the life span with new insights into human T cell development."
https://openalex.org/W3006341053,"Ferroptotic death is the penalty for losing control over three processes-iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation and thiol regulation-that are common in the pro-inflammatory environment where professional phagocytes fulfill their functions and yet survive. We hypothesized that redox reprogramming of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) during the generation of pro-ferroptotic signal 15-hydroperoxy-eicosa-tetra-enoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (15-HpETE-PE) modulates ferroptotic endurance. Here, we have discovered that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/NO•-enrichment of activated M1 (but not alternatively activated M2) macrophages/microglia modulates susceptibility to ferroptosis. Genetic or pharmacologic depletion/inactivation of iNOS confers sensitivity on M1 cells, whereas NO• donors empower resistance of M2 cells to ferroptosis. In vivo, M1 phagocytes, in comparison to M2 phagocytes, exert higher resistance to pharmacologically induced ferroptosis. This resistance is diminished in iNOS-deficient cells in the pro-inflammatory conditions of brain trauma or the tumour microenvironment. The nitroxygenation of eicosatetraenoyl (ETE)-PE intermediates and oxidatively truncated species by NO• donors and/or suppression of NO• production by iNOS inhibitors represent a novel redox mechanism of regulation of ferroptosis in pro-inflammatory conditions."

Liu et al. modified this method by creating atomically flat gold layers on polymer supports. The strong van der Waals adhesion of the gold layer allowed monolayers to be exfoliated on the centimeter scale. Multilayers could be reassembled to artificial structures, such as a MoSe 2 /WSe 2 single-crystal bilayer with a twist angle chosen to quench intralayer exciton formation.

Unfortunately, such vaccines typically use attenuated active viruses, which may be unsafe for certain populations. Wang et al. report a vaccine using an inactivated virus that effectively induced heterosubtypic immunity in both mice and ferrets (see the Perspective by Herold and Sander). They coadministered the virus with 2′,3′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), a potent activator of the innate immune system, encapsulated in pulmonary surfactant–biomimetic liposomes. This adjuvant was taken up by alveolar epithelial cells, whose activation resulted in effective antiviral T cell and humoral immune responses without accompanying immunopathology.

Milly and Dunne used a hydrologic model and historical observations to show that this decrease is due mainly to increased evapotranspiration caused by a reduction of albedo from snow loss and the associated rise in the absorption of solar radiation (see the Perspective by Hobbins and Barsugli). This drying will be greater than the projected precipitation increases expected from climate warming, increasing the risk of severe water shortages in an already vulnerable region.

https://openalex.org/W3006922697,"The spatial distribution of large-scale functional networks on the cerebral cortex differs between individuals and is particularly variable in association networks that are responsible for higher-order cognition. However, it remains unknown how this functional topography evolves in development and supports cognition. Capitalizing on advances in machine learning and a large sample imaged with 27 min of high-quality functional MRI (fMRI) data (n = 693, ages 8–23 years), we delineate how functional topography evolves during youth. We found that the functional topography of association networks is refined with age, allowing accurate prediction of unseen individuals’ brain maturity. The cortical representation of association networks predicts individual differences in executive function. Finally, variability of functional topography is associated with fundamental properties of brain organization, including evolutionary expansion, cortical myelination, and cerebral blood flow. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the plasticity and diversity of functional neuroanatomy during development and suggest advances in personalized therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W3008156371,"Putting vertebrate development on hold Suspended animation is an often-used device in science fiction, but it also exists in several forms in nature: hibernation, torpor, and diapause. Hu et al. studied diapause in the African turquoise killifish, a vertebrate model system (see the Perspective by Van Gilst). They found that diapause protects a complex living organism without trade-offs for future growth, fertility, and even life span. Diapause is actively regulated, with a dynamic switch to specific Polycomb complex members. One Polycomb member, CBX7, is critical for the regulation of organ genes and is involved in muscle preservation and diapause maintenance.

Dyonisius et al. found that methane emissions from old, cold-region carbon reservoirs like permafrost and methane hydrates were minor during the last deglaciation (see the Perspective by Dean). They analyzed the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric methane trapped in bubbles in Antarctic ice and found that methane emissions from those old carbon sources during the warming interval were small. They argue that this finding suggests that methane emissions in response to future warming likely will not be as large as some have suggested. Science , this issue p. 907 ; see also p. 846"

Restricted rotation is generally valued in macrocycles because it can hold the molecule in functional conformations. Using a well-established lipase enzyme, Gagnon et al. developed a synthesis of planar chiral macrocycles with handles that can be easily functionalized. Computational docking suggests how using an enzyme as the catalyst for sequential acylation reactions can impart the observed stereochemistry. Science , this issue p. 917"

For example, an object out of view, but for which we have a mental image, can still be recognized by touch. Such cross-modal recognition is highly adaptive and has been recently identified in other mammals, but whether it is widespread has been debated. Solvi et al. tested for this behavior in bumble bees, which are increasingly recognized as having some relatively advanced cognitive skills (see the Perspective by von der Emde and Burt de Perera). They found that the bees could identify objects by shape in the dark if they had seen, but not touched, them in the light, and vice versa, demonstrating a clear ability to transmit recognition across senses.

https://openalex.org/W3008790393,"Facial mimicry is commonly defined as the tendency to imitate-at a sub-threshold level-facial expressions of other individuals. Numerous studies support a role of facial mimicry in recognizing others' emotions. However, the underlying functional mechanism is unclear. A prominent hypothesis considers facial mimicry as based on an action-perception loop, leading to the prediction that facial mimicry should be observed only when processing others' facial expressions. Nevertheless, previous studies have also detected facial mimicry during observation of emotional bodily expressions. An emergent alternative hypothesis is that facial mimicry overtly reflects the simulation of an ""emotion"", rather than the reproduction of a specific observed motor pattern. In the present study, we tested whether blocking mimicry (""Bite"") on the lower face disrupted recognition of happy expressions conveyed by either facial or body expressions. In Experiment 1, we tested participants' ability to identify happy, fearful and neutral expressions in the Bite condition and in two control conditions. In Experiment 2, to ensure that such a manipulation selectively affects emotion recognition, we tested participants' ability to recognize emotional expressions, as well as the actors' gender, under the Bite condition and a control condition. Finally, we investigated the relationship between dispositional empathy and emotion recognition under the condition of blocked mimicry. Our findings demonstrated that blocking mimicry on the lower face hindered recognition of happy facial and body expressions, while the recognition of neutral and fearful expressions was not affected by the mimicry manipulation. The mimicry manipulation did not affect the gender discrimination task. Furthermore, the impairment of happy expression recognition correlated with empathic traits. These results support the role of facial mimicry in emotion recognition and suggest that facial mimicry reflects a global sensorimotor simulation of others' emotions rather than a muscle-specific reproduction of an observed motor expression."
https://openalex.org/W3007100485,"Evolution of a kinase allosteric site Enzyme activity is often regulated by conformational changes coupled to binding of an effector at an allosteric site, a feature especially important for enzymes involved in signaling cascades. Hadzipasic et al. studied the origins of allosteric regulation of Aurora A, a kinase involved in progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Aurora A is allosterically regulated through the binding of an effector protein named TPX2, which also targets the kinase to spindle microtubules. By reconstructing ancestor kinase sequences, they found that TPX2 bound to an early Aurora A but had very weak activation that was gradually strengthened by evolution of an allosteric network within the kinase. An evolutionary advantage from localizing the active protein at the mitotic spindle may have driven the development of this regulatory mechanism. Science , this issue p. 912"
https://openalex.org/W2744748473,"Tumor cell metastasis to the brain involves cell migration through biochemically and physically complex microenvironments at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The current understanding of tumor cell migration across the BBB is limited. We hypothesize that an interplay between biochemical cues and physical cues at the BBB affects the mechanisms of brain metastasis. We found that astrocyte conditioned medium(ACM) applied directly to tumor cells increased tumor cell velocity, induced elongation, and promoted actin stress fiber organization. Notably, treatment of the extracellular matrix with ACM led to even more significant increases in tumor cell velocity in comparison with ACM treatment of cells directly. Furthermore, inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases in ACM reversed ACM’s effect on tumor cells. The effects of ACM on tumor cell morphology and migration also depended on astrocytes’ activation state. Finally, using a microfluidic device, we found that the effects of ACM were abrogated in confinement. Overall, our work demonstrates that astrocyte-secreted factors alter migration and morphology of metastatic breast tumor cells, and this effect depends on the cells’ mechanical microenvironment.—Shumakovich, M.

https://openalex.org/W2996597053,"Cholinesterase inhibitors, the current frontline symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are associated with low efficacy and adverse effects. M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1 mAChRs) represent a potential alternate therapeutic target; however, drug discovery programs focused on this G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) have failed, largely due to cholinergic adverse responses. Employing novel chemogenetic and phosphorylation-deficient, G protein-biased, mouse models, paired with a toolbox of probe molecules, we establish previously unappreciated pharmacologically targetable M1 mAChR neurological processes, including anxiety-like behaviors and hyper-locomotion. By mapping the upstream signaling pathways regulating these responses, we determine the importance of receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling in driving clinically relevant outcomes and in controlling adverse effects including ‘epileptic-like’ seizures. We conclude that M1 mAChR ligands that promote receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling would protect against cholinergic adverse effects in addition to driving beneficial responses such as learning and memory and anxiolytic behavior relevant for the treatment of AD. Use of receptor variants in knock-in mice to dissect phosphorylation-dependent signaling from G protein-dependent signaling mediated by acetylcholine receptor M1 mAChR defines the ability of receptor ligands to modulate anxiety and locomotion behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W3005998837,"The retrograde transport inhibitor Retro-2 has a protective effect on cells and in mice against Shiga-like toxins and ricin. Retro-2 causes toxin accumulation in early endosomes and relocalization of the Golgi SNARE protein syntaxin-5 to the endoplasmic reticulum. The molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved remain unknown. Here, we show that Retro-2 targets the endoplasmic reticulum exit site component Sec16A, affecting anterograde transport of syntaxin-5 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. The formation of canonical SNARE complexes involving syntaxin-5 is not affected in Retro-2-treated cells. By contrast, the interaction of syntaxin-5 with a newly discovered binding partner, the retrograde trafficking chaperone GPP130, is abolished, and we show that GPP130 must indeed bind to syntaxin-5 to drive Shiga toxin transport from the endosomes to the Golgi. We therefore identify Sec16A as a druggable target and provide evidence for a non-SNARE function for syntaxin-5 in interaction with GPP130."
https://openalex.org/W3006854633,"Soil microbial communities and enzyme activities together affect various ecosystem functions of soils. Fertilization, an important agricultural management practice, is known to modify soil microbial characteristics; however, inconsistent results have been reported. The aim of this research was to make a comparative study of the effects of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates and types (organic and inorganic) on soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and microbial attributes in a greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) system of Tianjin, China. Results showed that manure substitution of chemical fertilizer, especially at a higher substitution rate, improved soil physicochemical properties (higher soil organic C (SOC) and nutrient (available N and P) contents; lower bulk densities), promoted microbial growth (higher total phospholipid fatty acids and microbial biomass C contents) and activity (higher soil hydrolase activities). Manure application induced a higher fungi/bacteria ratio due to a lower response in bacterial than fungal growth. Also, manure application greatly increased bacterial stress indices, as well as microbial communities and functional diversity. The principal component analysis showed that the impact of manure on microbial communities and enzyme activities were more significant than those of chemical fertilizer. Furthermore, redundancy analysis indicated that SOC and total N strongly influenced the microbial composition, while SOC and ammonium-N strongly influenced the microbial activity. In conclusion, manure substitution of inorganic fertilizer, especially at a higher substitution rate, was more efficient for improving soil quality and biological functions."

https://openalex.org/W3008581549,"Activated oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors contribute to reprogrammed energy metabolism and induce aerobic glycolysis, also known as Warburg effect. MicroRNAs are profoundly implicated in human malignancies by inhibiting translation of multiple mRNA targets. Using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) molecular profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified a handful of dysregulated microRNA in HCC glycolysis, especially miR-34c-3p. Antagonization of miR-34c-3p inhibited the lactate production, glucose consumption, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and aggressive proliferation in HCC cells. Hijacking glycolysis by 2-deoxy-d-glucose or galactose largely abrogated the suppressive effects of miR-34c-3p inhibition in HCC. Membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW, and PDZ domain containing 3 (MAGI3) is then identified as a direct functional target of miR-34c-3p in regulating HCC glycolysis and oncogenic activities. Mechanistically, MAGI3 physically interacted with β-catenin to regulate its transcriptional activity and c-Myc expression, which further facilitates the Warburg effect by increasing expression of glycolytic genes including HK2, PFKL, and LDHA. Moreover, overexpressed miR-34c-3p and reduced MAGI3 predicted poor clinical outcome and was closely associated with the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) in HCC patients who received preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our findings elucidate critical several microRNAs implicated in HCC glycolysis and reveal a novel function of miR-34c-3p/MAGI3 axis in Warburg effect through regulating β-catenin activity."

The objective of this study was to understand healthcare provider perspectives regarding access to care and diagnostic delay amongst this patient population. Methods A healthcare provider survey comprising 24 questions was developed, tested, and subsequently disseminated online with recruitment to all members of The Association of Hemophilia Clinic Directors of Canada (N = 73), members of the Canadian Association of Nurses in Hemophilia Care (N = 40) and members of the Canadian Physiotherapists in Hemophilia Care (N = 44). Results There were 70 respondents in total, for a total response rate of 45%. HCPs felt that there were diagnostic delays for patients with mild symptomatology (71%, N = 50), women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding as their only or primary symptom (59%, N = 41), and patients living in rural Canada (50%, N = 35). Fewer respondents felt that factors such as socioeconomic status (46%, N = 32) or race (21%, N = 15) influenced access to care, particularly as compared to the influence of rural location (77%, N = 54). Discussion We found that healthcare providers identified patients with mild symptomatology, isolated abnormal uterine bleeding, and residence in rural locations as populations at risk for inequitable access to care. These factors warrant further study, and will be investigated further by our group using our nation-wide patient survey and ongoing in-depth qualitative patient interviews."

https://openalex.org/W3007417317,"This study measured automatic walking synchronization and how it associates with social impression. Previous studies discovered positive social consequence of motor synchrony with ecological paradigms (e.g. body movement synchrony between therapists and patients in clinical sessions, and the synchrony of side-by-side walkers). However, most studies of joint movement with high ecological validity face the same challenge, namely that conversations between participants might be the main or a partial contributor to the observed social benefits, as conversation is well documented to promote understanding and motor synchronization. We addressed this issue by using a novel paradigm to remove the conversation component and examined how synchrony per se interacted with social impression. Participants were paired to walk side by side in silence (i.e. without conversation) and their social impression toward each other was rated before/after the paired walk. Our results showed that walkers' first impression was positively associated with their step synchronization rate in the silent paired walk. Together with past findings, the bi-directional relation between body entrainment and social functions suggests that implicit nonverbal communication plays a significant role in providing a basis for interpersonal interaction."

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the possible function of sGAGs in scleral mechanical response by characterizing the tensile behavior of normal and sGAG-depleted samples. We used chondroitinase ABC solution to remove sGAGs from scleral samples that were dissected from posterior porcine eyes. We performed biochemical analyses for assessing the efficacy of sGAG removal protocol. Furthermore, we conducted stress-controlled uniaxial tensile tests to characterize the influence of sGAG removal on mechanical properties of sclera. The tensile behavior of scleral strips right after dissection and after being soaked in buffer was also determined. Biochemical analyses confirmed that 18 hour incubation in 0.125 U/ml Chondroitinase ABC solution removed over 90% of chondroitin and dermatan sGAGs. No significant difference was observed in the thickness/hydration of samples because of enzyme- and buffer-treated samples. Furthermore, it was found that sGAG depletion did not significantly alter the tangent modulus, energy dissipation, and peak strain of posterior scleral strips. It was concluded that sGAGs did not influence the stress-controlled viscoelastic tensile response of sclera."

However, usually basic and applied life-sciences tend to underestimate public perception of nature, which is better tackled by the fields of social-sciences. Therefore, more efforts are needed to link scientific questions and public ‘perception’ of nature. We designed a transversal project where research questions directly confront public concerns: i.e., even while addressing scientific knowledge gaps, our questions directly arise from public concerns. Social studies highlighted that appreciation of (exotic) plants is related to the impact they may have on the surrounding natural environment: therefore, we investigated links of native and exotic flowers to local pollinators. Other studies highlighted that scientific results need to link to everyday individual experience: therefore, we investigated pollination modes of the renown Salvia, native and exotic, largely used in cuisine and gardening.

Here, we report correlative analyses of blood and tissue specimens for signals of immune activation in trial subjects. Among 10 dogs treated with palliative radiotherapy (RT) and intra-tumoral adoptive NK transfer, we performed ELISA on serum cytokines, flow cytometry for immune phenotype of PBMCs, and PCR on tumor tissue for immune-related gene expression. We then queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate the association of cytotoxic/immune-related gene expression with human sarcoma survival. Updated survival analysis revealed five 6-month survivors, including one dog who lived 17.9 months. Using feeder line co-culture for NK expansion, we observed maximal activation of dog NK cells on day 17–19 post isolation with near 100% expression of granzyme B and NKp46 and high cytotoxic function in the injected NK product. Among dogs on trial, we observed a trend for higher baseline serum IL-6 to predict worse lung metastasis-free and overall survival (P = 0.08). PCR analysis revealed low absolute gene expression of CD3, CD8, and NKG2D in untreated OSA. Among treated dogs, there was marked heterogeneity in the expression of immune-related genes pre- and post-treatment, but increases in CD3 and CD8 gene expression were higher among dogs that lived > 6 months compared to those who did not. Analysis of the TCGA confirmed significant differences in survival among human sarcoma patients with high and low expression of genes associated with greater immune activation and cytotoxicity (CD3e, CD8a, IFN-γ, perforin, and CD122/IL-2 receptor beta). Updated results from a first-in-dog clinical trial of palliative RT and autologous NK cell immunotherapy for OSA illustrate the translational relevance of companion dogs for novel cancer therapies. Similar to human studies, analyses of immune markers from canine serum, PBMCs, and tumor tissue are feasible and provide insight into potential biomarkers of response and resistance."

The online survey used quota-based population sample matching of 2016 census targets for gender, age, region, language, visible minority status, and education level. We report general patterns of self-reported condom use, as well as results from zero-inflated negative binomial regression models on the relationship between condom use and social location, relationship status, and sexual health.Condom use varies by gender, age, education, visible minority status, and relationship status. Use of condoms is related to the perception of risk of being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the next six months and to the experience of receiving lessons in condom use. No significant associations were found between condom use and region, rural/urban residence, income, or religion. Among men, but not women, condom use is associated with language preference, past diagnosis with a sexually transmitted infection, and self-reported sexual health.Canadian adults report using a condom in approximately 30% of their sexual encounters involving penile-vaginal sex. Condom use is highest among young adults. Single people use condoms more often than people with marital or common-law partners. Condom use is higher among those with higher levels of education, among people belonging to visible minorities relative to white people, and for men relative to women. People who think they are likely to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the next six months are more likely to use condoms than those who do not."

A higher triacylglycerols (TG) content, ranging from 4.23±0.82 μg mgashfree Dry weight (DW)-1 at the beginning of the trial (T0) to 51±15.3 μg mgashfreeDW-1 in ISO, characterised significant growth in the spat, whereas, a reduction of TG (0.3±0.08 μg mgashfreeDW-1 in MONO), mono unsaturated FA–MUFA (from 8.52±1.02 μg mgFAashfreeDW-1 at T0 to 2.81±1.02 μg mgFAashfreeDW-1 in MONO) and polyunsaturated FA–PUFA (from 17.57±2.24 μg mgFAashfreeDW-1 at T0 to 6.19±2.49 μg mgFAashfreeDW-1 in MONO) content characterised poor performing groups. Untargeted lipidomics evidenced how the availability of dietary essential PUFA did not influence only neutral lipids but also the membrane lipids, with changes in lipid molecular species in relation to the essential PUFA provided via the diet. Such changes have the potential to affect spat production cycle and their ability to respond to the surrounding environment. This study evidenced the advantages of coupling different lipid analysis techniques, as each technique disclosed relevant information on nutritional requirements of M. edulis juveniles, expanding the existing knowledge on the physiology of this important species."

This study showed that diet-induced hepatosteatosis, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance can be completely prevented in mice with liver-specific HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) inactivation. Mechanistically, we showed that HAX-1 interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-1 (InsP3R1) in the liver, and its absence reduces InsP3R1 levels, thereby improving endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria calcium homeostasis to prevent excess calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction. As a result, HAX-1 ablation activates pyruvate dehydrogenase and increases mitochondria utilization of glucose and fatty acids to prevent hepatosteatosis, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. In contrast to the reduction of InsP3R1 levels, hepatic HAX-1 deficiency increases bile salt exporter protein levels, thereby promoting enterohepatic bile acid recirculation, leading to activation of bile acid–responsive genes in the intestinal ileum to augment insulin sensitivity and of cholesterol transport genes in the liver to suppress hyperlipidemia. The dual mechanisms of increased mitochondrial respiration and enterohepatic bile acid recirculation due to improvement of endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria calcium homeostasis with hepatic HAX-1 inactivation suggest that this may be a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disease intervention.

https://openalex.org/W3008090741,"Purpose Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary disorder that can lead to ophthalmic manifestations, including retinal capillary hemangioma (RCH). The diagnosis of RCH is often guided by wide-field fluorescein angiography. In some cases, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) serves as a non-invasive alternative to FA. Herein, we used OCT-A to examine the macular microvasculature in patients with VHL disease. Subjects Subjects were selected from patients with a diagnosis of VHL. The control group included eyes without retinal diagnosis from patients with an episode of unilateral retinal detachment or trauma and age ≤ 50 years old. Methods Subjects were scanned on the Optovue RTVue-XR device to acquire 3mm x 3mm OCT-A images of the superficial (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP). SCP and DCP vessel density (VD) were calculated after the images were binarized. Furthermore, for subjects with RCH, each OCT-A image was divided equally into four quadrants. SCP and DCP VD of quadrants with RCH were compared to those without RCH. T-tests were performed for statistical analysis. Results 67 eyes with a history of VHL disease were included as study subjects, while 16 eyes were included as controls. Significant increases in VD were found in patients with VHL disease for both the SCP (p = 0.0441) and DCP (p = 0.0344). When comparing quadrants with associated RCH development to those without, we found no significant difference in SCP VD (p = 0.160) or DCP VD (p = 0.484). Conclusions OCT-A can detect changes in the retinal microvasculature in the macula of patients with VHL disease. OCT-A imaging may be an additional tool for screening and early detection of patients at risk of developing ocular complications of VHL disease. Future studies should explore subtle progression on OCT-A associated with the pathogenesis and development of RCH, particularly with larger scan patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3008596000,"Crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) are among the most extensively studied coral reef taxa, largely owing to their devastating impacts on live coral cover during population outbreaks. Much of this research has however, been conducted in the western Pacific, although it is now apparent that there are several distinct species of Acanthaster spp. across the Indo-Pacific. The purpose of this study was to test for biogeographical variation in behaviour, comparing between Acanthaster planci at Lankanfushi Island in the Maldives and Acanthaster cf. solaris at Rib Reef on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. The extent to which CoTS were exposed (cf. concealed within or beneath coral substrates) was substantially higher (63.14%) for A. planci at Lankanfushi Island, compared to 28.55% for A. cf. solaris at Rib Reef, regardless of time of day. More importantly, only 52% of individuals were exposed at night at Rib Reef compared to >97% at reefs around Lankanfushi Island. Biogeographic variation in the behaviour of Acanthaster spp. was independent of differences in the size structure of starfish and coral cover at specific study sites, but may be attributable to other environmental factors such as habitat complexity or prey availability. This is the first study to explicitly test for biogeographical differences in the biology and behaviour of Acanthaster spp., potentially linked to species-specific differences in the causes and explanations of population outbreaks. However, we did not find evidence at this stage of differences in behavior among regions, rather behavioural differences observed were most likely products of different environments."
https://openalex.org/W3007575427,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related disease in women. Cumulative evidence supports a causal role of alcohol intake and breast cancer incidence. In this study, we explore the change on expression of genes involved in the biological pathways through which alcohol has been hypothesized to impact breast cancer risk, to shed new insights on possible mechanisms affecting the survival of breast cancer patients. Here, we performed differential expression analysis at individual genes and gene set levels, respectively, across survival and breast cancer subtype data. Information about postdiagnosis breast cancer survival was obtained from 1977 Caucasian female participants in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium. Expression of 16 genes that have been linked in the literature to the hypothesized alcohol-breast cancer pathways, were examined. We found that the expression of 9 out of 16 genes under study were associated with cancer survival within the first 4 years of diagnosis. Results from gene set analysis confirmed a significant differential expression of these genes as a whole too. Although alcohol consumption is not analyzed, nor available for this dataset, we believe that further study on these genes could provide important information for clinical recommendations about potential impact of alcohol drinking on breast cancer survival."
https://openalex.org/W3008022774,"The paraoxonase (PON) family comprises three highly conserved members: PON1, PON2, and PON3. They are orthologs of Caenorhabditis elegans MEC-6, an endoplasmic reticulum–resident chaperone that has a critical role in proper assembly and surface expression of the touch-sensing degenerin channel in nematodes. We have shown recently that MEC-6 and PON2 negatively regulate functional expression of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), suggesting that the chaperone function is conserved within this family. We hypothesized that other PON family members also modulate ion channel expression. Pon3 is specifically expressed in the aldosterone-sensitive distal tubules in the mouse kidney. We found here that knocking down endogenous Pon3 in mouse cortical collecting duct cells enhanced Na+ transport, which was associated with increased γENaC abundance. We further examined Pon3 regulation of ENaC in two heterologous expression systems, Fisher rat thyroid cells and Xenopus oocytes. Pon3 coimmunoprecipitated with each of the three ENaC subunits in Fisher rat thyroid cells. As a result of this interaction, the whole-cell and surface abundance of ENaC α and γ subunits was reduced by Pon3. When expressed in oocytes, Pon3 inhibited ENaC-mediated amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents, in part by reducing the surface expression of ENaC. In contrast, Pon3 did not alter the response of ENaC to chymotrypsin-mediated proteolytic activation or [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate–induced activation of αβS518Cγ, suggesting that Pon3 does not affect channel open probability. Together, our results suggest that PON3 regulates ENaC expression by inhibiting its biogenesis and/or trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W3008276372,"In the mature rodent brain, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates stem and progenitor cell maintenance, neuronal and glial circuitry and brain repair. However, the sources and distribution of Shh mediating these effects are still poorly characterized. Here, we report in the adult mouse brain, a broad expression pattern of Shh recognized by the specific monoclonal C9C5 antibody in a subset (11-12%) of CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes that do not express carbonic anhydrase II. These cells express also Olig2 and Sox10, two oligodendrocyte lineage-specific markers, but not PDGFRα, a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitors. In agreement with oligodendroglial cells being a source of Shh in the adult mouse brain, we identify Shh transcripts by single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization in a subset of cells expressing Olig2 and Sox10 mRNAs. These findings also reveal that Shh expression is more extensive than originally reported. The Shh-C9C5-associated signal labels the oligodendroglial cell body and decorates by intense puncta the processes. C9C5+ cells are distributed in a grid-like manner. They constitute small units that could deliver locally Shh to its receptor Patched expressed in GFAP+ and S100β+ astrocytes, and in HuC/D+ neurons as shown in PtcLacZ/+ reporter mice. Postnatally, C9C5 immunoreactivity overlaps the myelination peak that occurs between P10 and P20 and is down regulated during ageing. Thus, our data suggest that C9C5+CC1+ oligodendroglial cells are a source of Shh in the mouse postnatal brain."
https://openalex.org/W3007805066,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a devastating lung disease caused by inactivating gene mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 that result in hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). As LAM occurs predominantly in women during their reproductive age and is exacerbated by pregnancy, the female hormonal environment, and in particular estrogen, is implicated in LAM pathogenesis and progression. However, detailed underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, utilizing human pulmonary LAM specimens and cell culture models of TSC2-deficient LAM patient-derived and rat uterine leiomyoma-derived cells, we tested the hypothesis that estrogen promotes the growth of mTORC1-hyperactive cells through pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Estrogen increased the phosphorylation of PKM2 at Ser37 and induced the nuclear translocation of phospho-PKM2. The estrogen receptor antagonist Faslodex reversed these effects. Restoration of TSC2 inhibited the phosphorylation of PKM2 in an mTORC1 inhibitor-insensitive manner. Finally, accumulation of phosphorylated PKM2 was evident in pulmonary nodule from LAM patients. Together, our data suggest that female predominance of LAM might be at least in part attributed to estrogen stimulation of PKM2-mediated cellular metabolic alterations. Targeting metabolic regulators of PKM2 might have therapeutic benefits for women with LAM and other female-specific neoplasms."

https://openalex.org/W3008161531,"Background External loading of the ligamentous tissues induces mechanical creep, which modifies neuromuscular response to perturbations. It is not well understood how ligamentous creep affects athletic performance and contributes to modifications of knee biomechanics during functional tasks. Hypothesis/purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanical and neuromuscular responses to single leg drop landing perturbations before and after passive loading of the knee joint. Methods Descriptive laboratory study. Male (n = 7) and female (n = 14) participants’ (21.3 ± 2.1 yrs., 1.69 ± 0.09 m, 69.3 ± 13.0 kg) right hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were assessed during drop landings performed from a 30 cm height onto a force platform before and after a 10 min creep protocol. Electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), semimembranosus (SM), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. The creep protocol involved fixing the knee joint at 35° during static loading with perpendicular loads of either 200 N (males) or 150 N (females). Maximum, minimum, range of motion (ROM), and angular velocities were assessed for the hip, knee, and ankle joints, while normalized EMG (NEMG), vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF), and rate of force development (RFD) were assessed at landing using ANOVAs. Alpha was set at 0.05. Results Maximum hip flexion velocity decreased (p < 0.01). Minimum knee flexion velocity increased (p < 0.02). Minimum knee ad/abduction velocity decreased (p < 0.001). Ankle ROM decreased (p < 0.001). aVGRF decreased (p < 0.02). RFD had a non-significant trend (p = 0.076). NAEMG was significant between muscle groups (p < 0.02). Conclusion Distinct changes in velocity parameters are attributed to the altered mechanical behavior of the knee joint tissues and may contribute to changes in the loading of the leg during landing."
https://openalex.org/W3007521476,"Alkaline ionic liquid aqueous solutions were used to extract biphenyl cyclooctene lignans derivatives, and hydrolyze to the free-state biphenyl cyclooctene lignans simultaneously from Schisandra chinensis by microwave-assisted heating. The hydrogen bonds formatted between ionic liquid and water molecular attacks the amorphous region of cellulose. Selective heating by microwave produce the more polar regions, which results in swelling and fragmentation of raw materials near the hot spots. Therefore, ionic liquid-microwave-assisted extraction method of free-state biphenyl cyclooctene lignans was set up. The solid residue after treatment was characterized by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, which showed that cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were removed partially. The water content of ionic liquid solution affected its viscosity and diffusivity, and in turns the extraction efficiency of lignans. The IL solutions with different mole fractions of IL were detected by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, the result shows that IL solutions with higher water contents (>0.6) won't form clusters. The optimum hydrolysis conditions were 0.2 g of ionic liquid catalyst per 5.0 g of S. chinensis fruits, a microwave irradiation power of 600 W, and heating time of 12 min, which gave a yield of free-state biphenyl cyclooctene lignans of 4.12±0.37 mg g-1. Besides, a hydrolysis mechanism of ester-bond biphenyl cyclooctene lignans and decreasing ""biomass recalcitrance effect"" by ionic liquid microwave-assisted method was proposed."

https://openalex.org/W3008430066,"It was nearly 20 years ago, but I remember the day clearly. I sat down and wrote a letter resigning from my faculty position in Turkey. “I have been subjected to injustices,” I wrote in Turkish. “I want to resign from my duty as of 17 September 2001.” I had spent the preceding 5 years fighting for the pay raise that I was owed when I was promoted to associate professor. University administrators argued that I hadn't completed my military service, and the dispute eventually went to court. I was fed up, so my wife and I decided to make a new beginning—on the other side of the world.



> “I'm glad that I took a risk to rebuild my career from scratch in another country.” 

After completing my Ph.D. in the United Kingdom, I had returned to my home country—Turkey—to fulfill the conditions of a scholarship that I received to study abroad. As the first person in my family to attend a university, I was looking forward to serving as an educator and academic leader in the place where I was raised; I wanted to make a difference. Within a few months, I was appointed to a tenure-track faculty position, and I began to teach courses and ramp up my research lab.

My career seemed to be sailing along until the salary dispute. I no longer felt valued by my university, which made it hard to stay motivated. But I carried on with my research, at one point attending a conference in Colombia. There I met a professor from an Australian university who shared many of my research interests, and we stayed in touch.

Over the next few years, we swapped occasional emails. Then one day, he wrote to offer me a postdoc position in his lab. The rank was well below my position; at that point, I was 6 months away from being eligible to apply for a promotion to full professor. But the position in Australia offered me a chance to get out of my work situation in Turkey, which was making me profoundly unhappy, so I took it seriously.

My wife liked the idea of moving to Australia. We had one small child at the time—with plans to have another—and she thought we'd have better opportunities to raise our family there. So, with her encouragement, I took a leave of absence from my faculty position to do a reconnaissance trip to Australia. Before I left, I typed out a resignation letter, signed a printed copy, and gave it to my wife for safekeeping.

After a month, it was clear to me that we'd enjoy living in Australia and that it was the right career move for me. My wife agreed. So she put my letter in the mail; our decision was final.

When I look back now, I realize what a daring decision that was—for both of us. My wife couldn't speak a word of English and, as a trained lawyer, couldn't practice her profession in Australia, which has a very different legal system. It was hard for us to say goodbye to our relatives in Turkey. Our finances also tightened. The cross-continent move was expensive, and my postdoc salary was our only source of income in Australia.

But we never looked back with regret. My wife quickly became proficient in English and eventually went back to school part-time to study accounting. And I've been much happier professionally. I left my legal disputes behind and got a chance to work with supportive colleagues on a research project that I was excited about. My postdoc adviser also entrusted me with co-supervising some of his Ph.D. students, which made me feel as though my expertise was valued.

When I quit my faculty position in Turkey, I was hopeful that I could work my way back up the academic ladder. And, indeed, that's what happened: After 2.5 years, I secured a tenure-track job at another university in Australia, which is where I am now.

I hope that others can gain inspiration from my nontraditional career path. It was devastating when my professional life appeared to crumble. But that challenge set me on a new path, one that has led to a productive and enjoyable career. I'm glad I took a risk to rebuild my career from scratch in another country—and that my wife was excited to make a change along with me. As Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, “A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.”"
