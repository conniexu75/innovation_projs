https://openalex.org/W3000662632,"About 62,000 dead or dying common murres (Uria aalge), the trophically dominant fish-eating seabird of the North Pacific, washed ashore between summer 2015 and spring 2016 on beaches from California to Alaska. Most birds were severely emaciated and, so far, no evidence for anything other than starvation was found to explain this mass mortality. Three-quarters of murres were found in the Gulf of Alaska and the remainder along the West Coast. Studies show that only a fraction of birds that die at sea typically wash ashore, and we estimate that total mortality approached 1 million birds. About two-thirds of murres killed were adults, a substantial blow to breeding populations. Additionally, 22 complete reproductive failures were observed at multiple colonies region-wide during (2015) and after (2016-2017) the mass mortality event. Die-offs and breeding failures occur sporadically in murres, but the magnitude, duration and spatial extent of this die-off, associated with multi-colony and multi-year reproductive failures, is unprecedented and astonishing. These events co-occurred with the most powerful marine heatwave on record that persisted through 2014-2016 and created an enormous volume of ocean water (the ""Blob"") from California to Alaska with temperatures that exceeded average by 2-3 standard deviations. Other studies indicate that this prolonged heatwave reduced phytoplankton biomass and restructured zooplankton communities in favor of lower-calorie species, while it simultaneously increased metabolically driven food demands of ectothermic forage fish. In response, forage fish quality and quantity diminished. Similarly, large ectothermic groundfish were thought to have increased their demand for forage fish, resulting in greater top-predator demands for diminished forage fish resources. We hypothesize that these bottom-up and top-down forces created an ""ectothermic vise"" on forage species leading to their system-wide scarcity and resulting in mass mortality of murres and many other fish, bird and mammal species in the region during 2014-2017."
https://openalex.org/W2998874562,"Secondary manifestations of spinal cord injury beyond motor and sensory dysfunction can negatively affect a person's quality of life. Spinal cord injury is associated with an increased incidence of depression and anxiety; however, the mechanisms of this relationship are currently not well understood. Human and animal studies suggest that changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) are associated with mood disorders. The objective of the current study is to establish a model of anxiety following a cervical contusion spinal cord injury in rats and to determine whether the microbiota play a role in the observed behavioural changes. We found that spinal cord injury caused dysbiosis and increased symptoms of anxiety-like behaviour. Treatment with a fecal transplant prevented both spinal cord injury-induced dysbiosis as well as the development of anxiety-like behaviour. These results indicate that an incomplete unilateral cervical spinal cord injury can cause affective disorders and intestinal dysbiosis, and that both can be prevented by treatment with fecal transplant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2999195718,"Nepal has achieved a significant reduction of TB incidence over the past decades. Nevertheless, TB patients continue to experience barriers in access, diagnosis and completion of the treatment. The main objective of this study was to explore the factors affecting the access to the health services, diagnosis and the treatment completion for TB patients in central and western Nepal.Data were collected using in-depth interviews (IDI) with the TB patients (n = 4); Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with TB suspected patients (n = 16); Semi Strucutred Interviews (SSIs) with health workers (n = 24) and traditional healers (n = 2); and FGDs with community members (n = 8). All data were audio recorded, transcribed and translated to English. All transcriptions underwent thematic analysis using qualitative data analysis software: Atlas.ti.Barriers to access to the health centre were the long distance, poor road conditions, and costs associated with travelling. In addition, lack of awareness of TB and its consequences, and the belief, prompted many respondents to visit traditional healers. Early diagnosis of TB was hindered by lack of trained health personnel to use the equipment, lack of equipment and irregular presence of health workers. Additional barriers that impeded the adherence and treatment completion were the need to visit health centre daily for DOTS treatment and associated constraints, complex treatment regimen, and the stigma.Barriers embedded in health services and care seekers' characteristics can be dealt by strengthening the peripheral health services. A continuous availability of (trained) human resources and equipment for diagnosis is critical. As well as increasing the awareness and collaborating with the traditional healers, health services utilization can be enhanced by compensating the costs associated with it, including the modification in current DOTS strategy by providing medicine for a longer term under the supervision of a family member, peer or a community volunteer."
https://openalex.org/W3000211686,"Individuals with serious mental illness experience changes in their clinical states over time that are difficult to assess and that result in increased disease burden and care utilization. It is not known if features derived from speech can serve as a transdiagnostic marker of these clinical states. This study evaluates the feasibility of collecting speech samples from people with serious mental illness and explores the potential utility for tracking changes in clinical state over time. Patients (n = 47) were recruited from a community-based mental health clinic with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients used an interactive voice response system for at least 4 months to provide speech samples. Clinic providers (n = 13) reviewed responses and provided global assessment ratings. We computed features of speech and used machine learning to create models of outcome measures trained using either population data or an individual's own data over time. The system was feasible to use, recording 1101 phone calls and 117 hours of speech. Most (92%) of the patients agreed that it was easy to use. The individually-trained models demonstrated the highest correlation with provider ratings (rho = 0.78, p<0.001). Population-level models demonstrated statistically significant correlations with provider global assessment ratings (rho = 0.44, p<0.001), future provider ratings (rho = 0.33, p<0.05), BASIS-24 summary score, depression sub score, and self-harm sub score (rho = 0.25,0.25, and 0.28 respectively; p<0.05), and the SF-12 mental health sub score (rho = 0.25, p<0.05), but not with other BASIS-24 or SF-12 sub scores. This study brings together longitudinal collection of objective behavioral markers along with a transdiagnostic, personalized approach for tracking of mental health clinical state in a community-based clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2999505629,"The impact of rising drug use on US mortality may extend beyond deaths coded as drug-related to include excess mortality from other causes affected by drug use. Here, we estimate the full extent of drug-associated mortality. We use annual death rates for 1999–2016 by state, sex, five-year age group, and cause of death to model the relationship between drug-coded mortality—which serves as an indicator of the population-level prevalence of drug use—and mortality from other causes. Among residents aged 15–64 living in the 50 US states, the estimated number of drug-associated deaths in 2016 (141,695) was 2.2 times the number of drug-coded deaths (63,000). Adverse trends since 2010 in midlife mortality are largely attributable to drug-associated mortality. In the absence of drug use, we estimate that the probability of dying between ages 15 and 65 would have continued to decline after 2010 among men (to 15% in 2016) and would have remained at a low level (10%) among women. Our results suggest that an additional 3.9% of men and 1.8% of women died between ages 15 and 65 in 2016 because of drug use. In terms of life expectancy beyond age 15, we estimate that drug use cost men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average. In the hardest-hit state (West Virginia), drug use cost men 3.6 and women 1.9 life years. Recent declines in US life expectancy have been blamed largely on the drug epidemic. Consistent with that inference, our results imply that, in the absence of drug use, life expectancy at age 15 would have increased slightly between 2014 and 2016. Drug-associated mortality in the US is roughly double that implied by drug-coded deaths alone. The drug epidemic is exacting a heavy cost to American lives, not only from overdoses but from a variety of causes."
https://openalex.org/W3000286989,"CrAssphage (cross-assembly phage) is a bacteriophage that was first discovered in human gut metagenomic data. CrAssphage belongs to a diverse family of crAss-like bacteriophages thought to infect gut commensal bacteria belonging to Bacteroides species. However, not much is known about the biogeography of crAssphage and whether certain strains are associated with specific human populations. In this study, we screened publicly available human gut metagenomic data from 3,341 samples for the presence of crAssphage sensu stricto (NC_024711.1). We found that crAssphage prevalence is low in traditional, hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru, as compared to industrialized, urban populations. Statistical comparisons showed no association of crAssphage prevalence with variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and health status of individuals. Phylogenetic analyses show that crAssphage strains reconstructed from the same individual over multiple time-points, cluster together. CrAssphage strains from individuals from the same study population do not always cluster together. Some evidence of clustering is seen at the level of broadly defined geographic regions, however, the relative positions of these clusters within the crAssphage phylogeny are not well-supported. We hypothesize that this lack of strong biogeographic structuring is suggestive of an expansion event within crAssphage. Using a Bayesian dating approach, we estimate that this expansion has occurred fairly recently. Overall, we determine that crAssphage presence is associated with an industrialized lifestyle and the absence of strong biogeographic structuring within global crAssphage strains is likely due to a recent population expansion within this bacteriophage."
https://openalex.org/W2999854354,"The Lightning Network (LN) was released on Bitcoin's mainnet in January 2018 as a solution to favor scalability. This work analyses the evolution of the LN during its first year of existence in order to assess its impact over some of the core fundamentals of Bitcoin, such as: node centralization, resilience against attacks and disruptions, anonymity of users, autonomous coordination of its members. Using a network theory approach, we find that the LN represents a centralized configuration with few highly active nodes playing as hubs in that system. We show that the removal of these central nodes is likely to generate a remarkable drop in the LN's efficiency, while the network appears robust to random disruptions. In addition, we observe that improvements in efficiency during the sample period are primarily due to the increase in the capacity installed on the channels, while nodes' synchronization does not emerge as a distinctive feature of the LN. Finally, the analysis of the structure of the network suggests a good preservation of nodes' identity against attackers with prior knowledge about topological characteristics of their targets, but also that LN is probably weak against attackers that are within the system."
https://openalex.org/W2997135118,"The end of deep reading is a commonplace in public debates, whenever societies talk about youth, books, and the digital age. In contrast to this, we show for the first time and in detail, how intensively young readers write and comment literary texts at an unprecedented scale. We present several analyses of how fiction is transmitted through the social reading platform Wattpad, one of the largest platforms for user-generated stories, including novels, fanfiction, humour, classics, and poetry. By mixed quantitative and qualitative methods and scalable reading we scrutinise texts and comments on Wattpad, what themes are preferred in 13 languages, what role does genre play for readers behaviour, and what kind of emotional engagement is prevalent when young readers share stories. Our results point out the rise of a global reading culture in youth reading besides national preferences for certain topics and genres, patterns of reading engagement, aesthetic values and social interaction. When reading Teen Fiction social-bonding (affective interaction) is prevalent, when reading Classics social-cognitive interaction (collective intelligence) is prevalent. An educational outcome suggests that readers who engage in Teen Fiction learn to read Classics and to judge books not only in direct emotional response to character’s behaviour, but focusing more on contextualised interpretation of the text."
https://openalex.org/W3000635581,"Background mHealth technologies are proliferating globally to address quality and timeliness of health care delivery by Community Health Workers (CHWs). This study aimed to examine CHW and beneficiaries’ perceptions of a new mHealth intervention (Common Application Software [CAS] for CHWs in India. The objectives of the study were to seek perspectives of CHWs and beneficiaries on the uptake of CAS, changes in CHW-beneficiary interactions since the introduction of CAS and potential barriers faced by CHWs in use of CAS. Further, important contextual factors related to CHW-beneficiary interface and dynamics that may have a bearing on CAS have been described. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in two states of India (Bihar and Madhya Pradesh) from March-April 2018 with CHWs (n = 32) and beneficiaries (n = 55). All interviews were conducted and recorded in Hindi, transcribed and translated into English, and coded and thematically analysed using Dedoose. Findings The mHealth intervention was acceptable to the CHWs who felt that CAS improved their status in the communities where they worked. Beneficiaries’ views were a mix of positive and negative perceptions. The divergent views between CHWs and beneficiaries surrounding the use and impact of CAS highlight an underlying mistrust, socio-cultural barriers in engagement, and technological barriers in implementation. All these contextual factors can influence the perception and uptake of CAS. Conclusions mHealth interventions targeting CHWs and beneficiaries have the potential to improve performance of CHWs, reduce barriers to information and potentially change the behaviors of beneficiaries. While technology is an enabler for CHWs to improve their service delivery, it does not necessarily help overcome social and cultural barriers that impede CHW-beneficiary interactions to bring about improvements in knowledge and health behaviors. Future interventions for CHWs including mHealth interventions should examine contextual factors along with the acceptability, accessibility, and usability by beneficiaries and community members."
https://openalex.org/W3000501819,"Previously unrecognized anatomical features of the cone scales of the enigmatic Early Cretaceous conifer Krassilovia mongolica include the presence of transversely oriented paracytic stomata, which is unusual for all other extinct and extant conifers. Identical stomata are present on co-occurring broad, linear, multiveined leaves assigned to Podozamites harrisii, providing evidence that K. mongolica and P. harrisii are the seed cones and leaves of the same extinct plant. Phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of the reconstructed Krassilovia plant place it in an informal clade that we name the Krassilovia Clade, which also includes Swedenborgia cryptomerioides–Podozamites schenkii, and Cycadocarpidium erdmanni–Podozamites schenkii. All three of these plants have linear leaves that are relatively broad compared to most living conifers, and that are also multiveined with transversely oriented paracytic stomata. We propose that these may be general features of the Krassilovia Clade. Paracytic stomata, and other features of this new group, recall features of extant and fossil Gnetales, raising questions about the phylogenetic homogeneity of the conifer clade similar to those raised by phylogenetic analyses of molecular data."
https://openalex.org/W2998878362,"Excavated in 1949, Grotta dei Moscerini, dated MIS 5 to early MIS 4, is one of two Italian Neandertal sites with a large assemblage of retouched shells (n = 171) from 21 layers. The other occurrence is from the broadly contemporaneous layer L of Grotta del Cavallo in southern Italy (n = 126). Eight other Mousterian sites in Italy and one in Greece also have shell tools but in a very small number. The shell tools are made on valves of the smooth clam Callista chione. The general idea that the valves of Callista chione were collected by Neandertals on the beach after the death of the mollusk is incomplete. At Moscerini 23.9% of the specimens were gathered directly from the sea floor as live animals by skin diving Neandertals. Archaeological data from sites in Italy, France and Spain confirm that shell fishing and fresh water fishing was a common activity of Neandertals, as indicated by anatomical studies recently published by E. Trinkaus. Lithic analysis provides data to show the relation between stone tools and shell tools. Several layers contain pumices derived from volcanic eruptions in the Ischia Island or the Campi Flegrei (prior to the Campanian Ignimbrite mega-eruption). Their rounded edges indicate that they were transported by sea currents to the beach at the base of the Moscerini sequence. Their presence in the occupation layers above the beach is discussed. The most plausible hypothesis is that they were collected by Neandertals. Incontrovertible evidence that Neandertals collected pumices is provided by a cave in Liguria. Use of pumices as abraders is well documented in the Upper Paleolithic. We prove that the exploitation of submerged aquatic resources and the collection of pumices common in the Upper Paleolithic were part of Neandertal behavior well before the arrival of modern humans in Western Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2999808970,"Phyllanthus niruri L. is a widespread tropical plant which is used in Ayurvedic system for liver and kidney ailments. The present study aims at specifying the most active hepatoprotective extract of P. niruri and applying a bio-guided protocol to identify the active compounds responsible for this effect. P. niruri aerial parts were extracted separately with water, 50%, 70% and 80% ethanol. The cytoprotective activity of the extracts was evaluated against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in clone-9 and Hepg2 cells. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the aqueous extract (AE) was accomplished for the isolation of the active compounds. Antioxidant activity was assessed using DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging method and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The in vivo hepatoprotective activity of AE was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats at different doses after determination of its LD50. Pretreatment of clone-9 and Hepg2 with different concentrations of AE (1, 0.1, 0.01 mg/ml) had significantly reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) against CCl4 injures, and restored the activity of the natural antioxidants; glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) towards normalization. Fractionation of AE gave four fractions (I-IV). Fractions I, II, and IV showed a significant in vitro hepatoprotective activity. Purification of I, II and IV yielded seven compounds; corilagin C1, isocorilagin C2, brevifolin C3, quercetin C4, kaempferol rhamnoside C5, gallic acid C6, and brevifolin carboxylic acid C7. Compounds C1, C2, C5, and C7 showed the highest (p< 0.001) hepatoprotective potency, while C3, C4, and C6 exhibited a moderate (p< 0.001) activity. The AE exhibited strong antioxidant DPPH (IC50 11.6 ± 2 μg/ml) and FRAP (79.352 ± 2.88 mM Ferrous equivalents) activity. In vivo administration of AE in rats (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) caused normalization of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total cholesterol (TC), triglycyrides (TG), total bilirubin (TB), glucose, total proteins (TP), urea and creatinine levels which were elevated by CCl4. AE also decreased TNF-α, NF-KB, IL-6, IL-8, IL10 and COX-2 expression, and significantly antagonizes the effect of CCl4 on the antioxidant enzymes SOD, catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GSP). The histopathological study also supported the hepatoprotective effect of AE. P. niruri isolates exhibited a potent hepatoprotective activity against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in clone-9 and Hepg2 cell lines through reduction of lipid peroxidation and maintaining glutathione in its reduced form. This is attributable to their phenolic nature and hence antioxidative potential."
https://openalex.org/W3000347847,"Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)–a gut-microbiota metabolite–is a biomarker of cardiometabolic risk. No studies have investigated TMAO as an early biomarker of longitudinal glucose increase or prevalent impaired glucose regulation. In a longitudinal cohort study, 300 diabetes-free men and women (77%) aged 20–55 years (mean = 34±10) were enrolled at baseline and re-examined at 2-years to investigate the association between TMAO and biomarkers of diabetes risk. Plasma TMAO was measured using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. After an overnight fast, FPG was measured longitudinally, HbA1C and insulin were measured only at baseline. Insulin resistance was defined using HOMA-IR. Multivariable generalized linear models regressed; i) FPG change (year 2 minus baseline) on baseline TMAO tertiles; and ii) HOMA-IR and HbA1c on TMAO tertiles. Multivariable relative risk regressions modeled prevalent prediabetes across TMAO tertiles. Mean values of 2-year longitudinal FPG±SE across tertiles of TMAO were 86.6±0.9, 86.7±0.9, 86.4±0.9 (p = 0.98). Trends were null for FPG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, cross-sectionally. The prevalence ratio of prediabetes among participants in 2nd and 3rd TMAO tertiles (vs. the 1st) were 1.94 [95%CI 1.09–3.48] and 1.41 [95%CI: 0.76–2.61]. TMAO levels are associated with increased prevalence of prediabetes in a nonlinear fashion but not with insulin resistance or longitudinal FPG change."

https://openalex.org/W3000392079,"IgE-primed mast cells in peripheral tissues, including the skin, lung, and intestine, are key initiators of allergen-triggered edema and inflammation. Particularly in severe forms of allergy, this inflammation becomes strongly neutrophil dominated, and yet how mast cells coordinate this type of response is unknown. We and others have reported that activated mast cells––a hematopoietic cell type––can produce IL-33, a cytokine known to participate in allergic responses but generally considered as being of epithelial origin and driving Type 2 immune responses (e.g., ILC2 and eosinophil activation). Using models of skin anaphylaxis, our data reveal that mast cell-derived IL-33 also initiates neutrophilic inflammation. We demonstrate a cellular crosstalk mechanism whereby activated mast cells crosstalk to IL-33 receptor–bearing basophils, driving these basophils to adopt a unique response signature rich in neutrophil-associated molecules. We further establish that basophil expression of CXCL1 is necessary for IgE-driven neutrophilic inflammation. Our findings thus unearth a new mechanism by which mast cells initiate local inflammation after antigen triggering and might explain the complex inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe allergic diseases. Moreover, our findings (i) establish a functional link from IL-33 to neutrophilic inflammation that extends IL-33–mediated biology well beyond that of Type 2 immunity, and (ii) demonstrate the functional importance of hematopoietic cell–derived IL-33 in allergic pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2999507628,"Taxes on unhealthy foods and sweetened beverages, as well as subsidies to healthy foods, have become increasingly popular strategies to curb obesity and related non-communicable diseases. The existing evidence on the welfare effects of such fiscal policies is mixed and almost uniquely focused on tax schemes. Using the 2016-2017 Chilean Household Budget Survey, we estimate a censored Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) incomplete demand system and simulate changes in purchases, tax incidence, and consumer welfare of three different policy scenarios: (1) a 5 percentage point additional tax on sweetened beverages (currently taxed at 18%) and a new 18% tax on sweets and snacks, (2) a healthy subsidy by zero-rating fruits and vegetables from the current 19% value-added tax, and (3) a combined (tax plus subsidy) policy. Under full pass-through of these policies, the combined scheme captures the incentives to switch purchases from both single-policy alternatives, resulting in a net welfare gain and subsidy transfer for the average Chilean household. In terms of welfare, low-income households strictly benefit from a combined policy, while high-income households experience a small consumer welfare loss, resulting in re-distributional effects."
https://openalex.org/W2999639651,"Structural variation (SV) is typically defined as variation within the human genome that exceeds 50 base pairs (bp). SV may be copy number neutral or it may involve duplications, deletions, and complex rearrangements. Recent studies have shown SV to be associated with many human diseases. However, studies of SV have been challenging due to technological constraints. With the advent of third generation (long-read) sequencing technology, exploration of longer stretches of DNA not easily examined previously has been made possible. In the present study, we utilized third generation (long-read) sequencing techniques to examine SV in the EGFR landscape of four haplotypes derived from two human samples. We analyzed the EGFR gene and its landscape (+/- 500,000 base pairs) using this approach and were able to identify a region of non-coding DNA with over 90% similarity to the most common activating EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. Based on previously published Alu-element genome instability algorithms, we propose a molecular mechanism to explain how this non-coding region of DNA may be interacting with and impacting the stability of the EGFR gene and potentially generating this cancer-driver gene. By these techniques, we were also able to identify previously hidden structural variation in the four haplotypes and in the human reference genome (hg38). We applied previously published algorithms to compare the relative stabilities of these five different EGFR gene landscape haplotypes to estimate their relative potentials to generate the EGFR exon 19, 15 bp canonical deletion. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to use the differences in genomic architecture between targeted cancer-linked phased haplotypes to estimate their relative potentials to form a common cancer-linked driver mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2999935505,"The long-term effects of early life adversities on social capacities have been documented in humans and wild-caught former laboratory chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). However, former pet and entertainment chimpanzees have received little attention to date. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of early life experience on 18 former pet and entertainment chimpanzees, based on social grooming data collected at a primate rescue centre over a 12-year period. Moreover, we also focused on the possible short-term effects that alterations to group composition might have on grooming patterns. For this purpose, we compared stable and unstable periods (i.e. where alterations to group composition occurred). We used two individual social network measures to analyse the grooming activity and the distribution of grooming among group mates for each individual. We could show that wild-caught chimpanzees were significantly more selective regarding their grooming partners and spent less time grooming when compared to their captive born companions. We also found that individuals who were predominantly housed without conspecifics during infancy spent less time grooming compared to those who were predominantly housed with conspecifics during infancy. Furthermore, we found that alterations to the group composition had short-term effects on the distribution of social grooming from a more equal distribution during periods with a stable group composition towards a more unequal and selective distribution during unstable periods. Thus, we conclude that the social grooming networks of former pet and entertainment chimpanzees are shaped not only by long-term effects such as early life experience, but also by short-term effects such as alterations to group composition. Remarkably, we found not only captive born chimpanzees but also wild-caught individuals to adjust their grooming to socially challenging situations by modifying their grooming distribution in a similar way."
https://openalex.org/W3000424650,"The small first digit (D1) of the mouse’s hand resembles a volar pad, but its thumb-like anatomy suggests ethological importance for manipulating small objects. To explore this possibility, we recorded high-speed close-up video of mice eating seeds and other food items. Analyses of ethograms and automated tracking with DeepLabCut revealed multiple distinct microstructural features of food-handling. First, we found that mice indeed made extensive use of D1 for dexterous manipulations. In particular, mice used D1 to hold food with either of two grip types: a pincer-type grasp, or a “thumb-hold” grip, pressing with D1 from the side. Thumb-holding was preferentially used for handling smaller items, with the smallest items held between the two D1s alone. Second, we observed that mice cycled rapidly between two postural modes while feeding, with the hands positioned either at the mouth (oromanual phase) or resting below (holding phase). Third, we identified two highly stereotyped D1-related movements during feeding, including an extraordinarily fast (~20 ms) “regrip” maneuver, and a fast (~100 ms) “sniff” maneuver. Lastly, in addition to these characteristic simpler movements and postures, we also observed highly complex movements, including rapid D1-assisted rotations of food items and dexterous simultaneous double-gripping of two food fragments. Manipulation behaviors were generally conserved for different food types, and for head-fixed mice. Wild squirrels displayed a similar repertoire of D1-related movements. Our results define, for the mouse, a set of kinematic building-blocks of manual dexterity, and reveal an outsized role for D1 in these actions."
https://openalex.org/W3000623193,"A Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES, for Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud Familiar in Spanish) is carried out annually in Peru. Based on it, the anemia prevalence was 43.6% in 2016 and 43.8% in 2017 using the WHO cutoff value of 11 g/dL and the altitude-correction equation.To assess factors contributing to anemia and to determine its prevalence in Peruvian children 6 to 35 months old.We used the MEASURE DHS-based ENDES survey to obtain representative data for11364 children from 6 to 35 months old on hemoglobin and health determinants. To evaluate normal hemoglobin levels, we used the original WHO criterion of the 5th percentile in children without chronic malnutrition and then applied it to the overall population. Relationships between hemoglobin and altitude levels, usage of cleaning methods to sanitize water safe to drink, usage of solid fuels and poverty status were tested using methodology for complex survey data. Percentile curves were made for altitude intervals by plotting hemoglobin compared to age. The new anemia rates are presented in graphs by Peruvian political regions according to the degree of public health significance.Hemoglobin increased as age and altitude of residence increased. Using the 5th percentile, anemia prevalence was 7.3% in 2016 and 2017. Children from low altitudes had higher anemia prevalence (8.5%) than those from high altitudes (1.2%, p<0.0001). In the rainforest area of Peru, anemia prevalence was highest (13.5%), while in the highlands it was lowest (3.3%, p<0.0001). With access to safe drinking water and without chronic malnutrition, anemia rates could be reduced in the rainforest by 45% and 33%, respectively.Anemia prevalence in Peruvian children from 6 to 35 months old was 7.3% in 2016 and 2017."
https://openalex.org/W3000718216,"Introduction Receiving results for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing and counselling during antenatal care (ANC) is critical for eliminating mother-to-child transmission. We investigated the educational attainment of women and receiving results for HIV testing and counselling (HTC) during ANC in Ghana. Materials and methods We extracted data from the women’s files of the 2008 and 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys. The study sampled 2,660 women aged 15–49 with complete data on receiving HIV testing results during ANC. We computed the highest educational attainment and receipt of HTC results for each of the surveys and presented it with a dot plot. Two Binary Logistic Regression Models were fitted to determine the likelihood of receiving HTC results by the educational attainment of the women. Results We found that receiving HTC results was highest among women with secondary or higher education (87.4% in 2008 and 89.5% in 2014) and least among those with no education (69.9% in 2008 and 76.8 in 2014). From the regression analysis, women with secondary or higher level of education [AOR = 1.535; CI = 1.044, 2.258], richest women [AOR = 5.565; CI = 2.560, 12.10], and women aged 30–34 years [AOR = 1.693; CI = 1.171, 2.952], were more likely to receive HTC results. However, those who did not know that a healthy-looking person can have HIV or not [AOR = 0.322; CI = 0.161, 0.646] were less likely to receive HTC results. Conclusion Despite the relatively high receipt of HTC results at ANC observed between 2008 and 2014, our findings revealed disparities driven by educational attainment, wealth status, age, ANC visits and residence. This indicates that women with no education, those from rural areas, younger and poor women are missing out on the full continuum of HTC service at ANC. The Health Promotion Unit of Ghana Health Service through Community Health Nurses and the Community-Based Health Planning and Services, should intensify their education programs on HIV and make full utilisation of HIV testing and counselling service appealing to women during ANC. This is particularly to be prioritised among the least educated, younger women and rural dwellers."
https://openalex.org/W2999039882,"We examine characteristics and experiences of women who considered, but did not have, an abortion for this pregnancy. Participants were recruited at prenatal care clinics in Louisiana and Maryland for a mixed-methods study (N = 589). On self-administered surveys and structured interviews, participants were asked if they had considered abortion for this pregnancy and, if so, reasons they did not obtain one. A subset (n = 83), including participants who considered abortion for this pregnancy, completed in-depth phone interviews. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined characteristics associated with having considered abortion and experiencing a policy-related barrier to having an abortion; analyses focused on economic insecurity and of mental health/substance use as main predictors of interest. Louisiana interviews (n = 43) were analyzed using modified grounded theory to understand concrete experiences of policy-related factors. In regression analyses, women who reported greater economic insecurity (aOR 1.21 [95% CI 1.17, 1.26]) and more mental health diagnoses/substance use (aOR 1.29 [1.16, 1.45] had higher odds of having considered abortion. Those who reported greater economic insecurity (aOR 1.50 [1.09, 2.08]) and more mental health diagnoses/substance use (aOR 1.45 [95% CI 1.03, 2.05] had higher odds of reporting policy-related barriers. Interviewees who considered abortion and were subject to multiple restrictions on abortion identified material and instrumental impacts of policies that, collectively, contributed to them not having an abortion. Many described simultaneously navigating economic insecurity, mental health disorders, substance use, and interpersonal opposition to abortion from family and the man involved in the pregnancy. Current restrictive abortion policies appear to have more of an impact on women who report greater economic insecurity and more mental health diagnoses/substance use. These policies work in concert with each other, with people's individual complex situations-including economic insecurity, mental health, and substance use-and with anti-abortion attitudes of other people to make abortion care impossible for some pregnant women to access."
https://openalex.org/W2999235273,"Diabetes is a growing challenge in Thailand. Data to assess health system response to diabetes is scarce. We assessed what factors influence diabetes care cascade retention, under universal health coverage.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2014 Thai National Health Examination Survey. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥126mg/dL or on treatment. National and regional care cascades were constructed across screening, diagnosis, treatment, and control. Unmet need was defined as the total loss across cascade levels. Logistic regression was used to examine the demographic and healthcare factors associated with cascade attrition.We included 15,663 individuals. Among Thai adults aged 20+ with diabetes, 67.0% (95% CI 60.9% to 73.1%) were screened, 34.0% (95% CI 30.6% to 37.2%) were diagnosed, 33.3% (95% CI 29.9% to 36.7%) were treated, and 26.0% (95% CI 22.9% to 29.1%) were controlled. Total unmet need was 74.0% (95% CI 70.9% to 77.1%), with regional variation ranging from 58.4% (95% CI 45.0% to 71.8%) in South to 78.0% (95% CI 73.0% to 83.0%) in Northeast. Multivariable models indicated older age (OR 1.76), males (OR 0.65), and a higher density of medical staff (OR 2.40) and health centers (OR 1.58) were significantly associated with being diagnosed among people with diabetes. Older age (OR 1.80) and higher geographical density of medical staff (OR 1.82) and health centers (OR 1.56) were significantly associated with being controlled.Substantial attrition in the diabetes care continuum was observed at diabetes screening and diagnosis, related to both individual and health system factors. Even with universal health insurance, Thailand still needs effective behavioral and structural interventions, especially in primary health care settings, to address unmet need in diabetes care for its population."
https://openalex.org/W2965605008,"Isomer search or molecule enumeration refers to the problem of finding all the isomers for a given molecule. Many classical search methods have been developed in order to tackle this problem. However, the availability of quantum computing architectures has given us the opportunity to address this problem with new (quantum) techniques. This paper describes a quantum isomer search procedure for determining all the structural isomers of alkanes. We first formulate the structural isomer search problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The QUBO formulation is for general use on either annealing or gate-based quantum computers. We use the D-Wave quantum annealer to enumerate all structural isomers of all alkanes with fewer carbon atoms (n < 10) than Decane (C10H22). The number of isomer solutions increases with the number of carbon atoms. We find that the sampling time needed to identify all solutions scales linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the alkane. We probe the problem further by employing reverse annealing as well as a perturbed QUBO Hamiltonian and find that the combination of these two methods significantly reduces the number of samples required to find all isomers."
https://openalex.org/W2999191237,"The primeval function of the mammalian hippocampus (HPC) remains uncertain. Implicated in learning and memory, spatial navigation, and neuropsychological disorders, evolutionary theory suggests that the HPC evolved from a primeval chemosensory epithelium. Deficits in sensing of internal body status ('interoception') in patients with HPC lesions argue that internal sensing may be conserved in higher vertebrates. We studied the expression patterns in mouse brain of 250 endocrine receptors that respond to blood-borne ligands. Key findings are (i) the proportions and levels of endocrine receptor expression in the HPC are significantly higher than in all other comparable brain regions. (ii) Surprisingly, the distribution of endocrine receptor expression within mouse HPC was found to be highly structured: receptors signaling 'challenge' are segregated in dentate gyrus (DG), whereas those signaling 'sufficiency' are principally found in cornu ammonis (CA) regions. Selective expression of endocrine receptors in the HPC argues that interoception remains a core feature of hippocampal function. Further, we report that ligands of DG receptors predominantly inhibit both synaptic potentiation and neurogenesis, whereas CA receptor ligands conversely promote both synaptic potentiation and neurogenesis. These findings suggest that the hippocampus acts as an integrator of body status, extending its role in context-dependent memory encoding from 'where' and 'when' to 'how I feel'. Implications for anxiety and depression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2999195511,"Background Hypertension-related mortality has been increasing in recent years; however, limited information exists concerning rate, temporal, secular, and geographic trends in the United States. Methods and results Using CDC death certificate data spanning 1999–2016, we sought to delineate trends in deaths attributable to an underlying cause of hypertension using joinpoint regression and proportion testing. From 1999–2016, the hypertension-related mortality rate increased by 36.4% with an average annual percent change (AAPC) of 1.8% for individuals ≥ 35 years of age. Interestingly, there was a notable acceleration in the AAPC of hypertension mortality between 2011 and 2016 (2.7% per year). This increase was due to a significant uptick in mortality for individuals ≥ 55 years of age with the greatest AAPC occurring in individuals 55–64 (4.5%) and 65–74 (5.1%) years of age. Increased mortality and AAPC were pervasive throughout sex, ethnicity, and White and American Indian or Alaska Native race, but not Black or African American race. From 2011–2016, there were significant increases in AAPC for hypertension-related mortality with contributing causes of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes, obesity, and vascular dementia. Elevated mortality was observed for conditions with a contributing cause of hypertension that included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and all types of falls. Geographically, increases in AAPCs and mortality rates were observed for 25/51 States between 2011 and 2016. Conclusions Our results indicate hypertension-related mortality may have accelerated since 2011 for middle-aged and older Americans, which may create new challenges in care and healthcare planning."
https://openalex.org/W2999897831,"Forested fire refugia (trees that survive fires) are important disturbance legacies that provide seed sources for post-fire regeneration. Conifer regeneration has been limited following some recent western fires, particularly in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. However, the extent, characteristics, and predictability of ponderosa pine fire refugia are largely unknown. Within 23 fires in ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Colorado Front Range (1996-2013), we evaluated the spatial characteristics and predictability of refugia: first using Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) burn severity metrics, then using landscape variables (topography, weather, anthropogenic factors, and pre-fire forest cover). Using 1-m resolution aerial imagery, we created a binary variable of post-fire conifer presence ('Conifer Refugia') and absence ('Conifer Absence') within 30-m grid cells. We found that maximum patch size of Conifer Absence was positively correlated with fire size, and 38% of the burned area was ≥ 50m from a conifer seed source, revealing a management challenge as fire sizes increase with warming further limiting conifer recovery. In predicting Conifer Refugia with two MTBS-produced databases, thematic burn severity classes (TBSC) and continuous Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) values, Conifer Absence was high in previously forested areas of Low and Moderate burn severity classes in TBSC. RdNBR more accurately identified post-fire conifer survivorship. In predicting Conifer Refugia with landscape variables, Conifer Refugia were less likely during burn days with high maximum temperatures: while Conifer Refugia were more likely on moister soils and closer to higher order streams, homes, and roads; and on less rugged, valley topography. Importantly, pre-fire forest canopy cover was not strongly associated with Conifer Refugia. This study further informs forest management by mapping post-fire patches lacking conifer seed sources, validating the use of RdNBR for fire refugia, and detecting abiotic and topographic variables that may promote conifer refugia."
https://openalex.org/W3000504572,"Background Hypertension (HTN) is the single leading risk factor for human mortality worldwide, and more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region [1]–although resources for HTN screening, treatment, and control are few. Most regional pilot studies to leverage HIV programs for HTN control have achieved blood pressure control in half of participants or fewer [2,3,4]. But this control gap may be due to inconsistent delivery of services, rather than ineffective underlying interventions. Methods We sought to evaluate the consistency of HTN program delivery within the SEARCH study (NCT01864603) among 95,000 adults in 32 rural communities in Uganda and Kenya from 2013–2016. To achieve this objective, we designed and performed a fidelity evaluation of the step-by-step process (cascade) of HTN care within SEARCH, calculating rates of HTN screening, linkage to care, and follow-up care. We evaluated SEARCH’s assessment of each participant’s HTN status against measured blood pressure and HTN history. Findings SEARCH completed blood pressure screens on 91% of participants. SEARCH HTN screening was 91% sensitive and over 99% specific for HTN relative to measured blood pressure and patient history. 92% of participants screened HTN+ received clinic appointments, and 42% of persons with HTN linked to subsequent care. At follow-up, 82% of SEARCH clinic participants received blood pressure checks; 75% received medication appropriate for their blood pressure; 66% remained in care; and 46% had normal blood pressure at their most recent visit. Conclusion The SEARCH study’s consistency in delivering screening and treatment services for HTN was generally high, but SEARCH could improve effectiveness in linking patients to care and achieving HTN control. Its model for implementing population-scale HTN testing and care through an existing HIV test-and-treat program–and protocol for evaluating the intervention’s stepwise fidelity and care outcomes–may be adapted, strengthened, and scaled up for use across multiple resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3000478617,"Objective To estimate healthcare expenditures that could be impacted by advanced diagnostic testing for patients hospitalized with meningitis or encephalitis Methods Patients hospitalized with meningitis (N = 23,933) or encephalitis (N = 7,858) in the U.S. were identified in the 2010–2014 Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database using ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. The database included an average of 40.8 million commercially insured enrollees under age 65 per year. Clinical, demographic and healthcare utilization criteria were used to identify patient subgroups early in their episode who were at risk to have high inpatient expenditures. Healthcare expenditures of patients within each subgroup were bifurcated: those expenditures that remained five days after the patient could be classified into the subgroup versus those that had occurred previously. Results The hospitalization episode rate per 100,000 enrollee-years for meningitis was 13.0 (95% CI: 12.9–13.2) and for encephalitis was 4.3 (95% CI: 4.2–4.4), with mean inpatient expenditures of $36,891 (SD = $92,636) and $60,181 (SD = $130,276), respectively. If advanced diagnostic testing had been administered on the day that a patient could be classified into a subgroup, then a test with a five-day turnaround time could impact the following mean inpatient expenditures that remained by subgroup for patients with meningitis or encephalitis, respectively: had a neurosurgical procedure ($83,337 and $56,020), had an ICU stay ($34,221 and $46,051), had HIV-1 infection or a previous organ transplant ($37,702 and $62,222), were age <1 year ($35,371 and $52,812), or had a hospital length of stay >2 days ($18,325 and $30,244). Discussion Inpatient expenditures for patients hospitalized with meningitis or encephalitis were substantial and varied widely. Patient subgroups who had high healthcare expenditures could be identified early in their stay, raising the potential for advanced diagnostic testing to lower these expenditures."
https://openalex.org/W3000624054,"Impaired myocardial bioenergetics is a hallmark of many cardiac diseases. There is a need of a simple and reproducible method of assessment of mitochondrial function from small human myocardial tissue samples. In this study we adopted high-resolution respirometry to homogenates of fresh human cardiac muscle and compare it with isolated mitochondria. We used atria resected during cardiac surgery (n = 18) and atria and left ventricles from brain-dead organ donors (n = 12). The protocol we developed consisting of two-step homogenization and exposure of 2.5% homogenate in a respirometer to sequential addition of 2.5 mM malate, 15 mM glutamate, 2.5 mM ADP, 10 μM cytochrome c, 10 mM succinate, 2.5 μM oligomycin, 1.5 μM FCCP, 3.5 μM rotenone, 4 μM antimycin and 1 mM KCN or 100 mM Sodium Azide. We found a linear dependency of oxygen consumption on oxygen concentration. This technique requires < 20 mg of myocardium and the preparation of the sample takes <20 min. Mitochondria in the homogenate, as compared to subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar isolated mitochondria, have comparable or better preserved integrity of outer mitochondrial membrane (increase of respiration after addition of cytochrome c is up to 11.7±1.8% vs. 15.7±3.1%, p˂0.05 and 11.7±3.5%, p = 0.99, resp.) and better efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (Respiratory Control Ratio = 3.65±0.5 vs. 3.04±0.27, p˂0.01 and 2.65±0.17, p˂0.0001, resp.). Results are reproducible with coefficient of variation between two duplicate measurements ≤8% for all indices. We found that whereas atrial myocardium contains less mitochondria than the ventricle, atrial bioenergetic profiles are comparable to left ventricle. In conclusion, high resolution respirometry has been adapted to homogenates of human cardiac muscle and shown to be reliable and reproducible."
https://openalex.org/W2998797839,"Plasmids are potent vehicles for spread of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial populations and often persist in the absence of selection due to efficient maintenance mechanisms. We previously constructed non-conjugative high copy number plasmid vectors that efficiently displace stable plasmids from enteric bacteria in a laboratory context by blocking their replication and neutralising their addiction systems. Here we assess a low copy number broad-host-range self-transmissible IncP-1 plasmid as a vector for such curing cassettes to displace IncF and IncK plasmids. The wild type plasmid carrying the curing cassette displaces target plasmids poorly but derivatives with deletions near the IncP-1 replication origin that elevate copy number about two-fold are efficient. Verification of this in mini IncP-1 plasmids showed that elevated copy number was not sufficient and that the parB gene, korB, that is central to its partitioning and gene control system, also needs to be included. The resulting vector can displace target plasmids from a laboratory population without selection and demonstrated activity in a mouse model although spread is less efficient and requires additional selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3000415121,"The objective of this study was to gain information from egg donors in South Africa (SA) which could be pertinent to policy development on egg donation. The study was conducted on egg donors in the database of a Cape Town-based egg donation agency who donated within a year preceding the study. 150 egg donors from the population of 226 participated in an online survey. The main results are: 95% of respondents experienced egg donation as being positive. However, 7% of respondents report not giving proper informed consent, and a similar percentage of respondents also report not knowing whether any medical risks actually materialised as sequelae to their donations. This is a cause for concern and should be investigated further. Regarding donor anonymity, which is currently the legal position in SA, 79% of respondents indicated that they would still have donated had they been legally required to release their identities. Accordingly, possible legal reform away from the current system of donor anonymity seems unlikely to significantly impact the supply of donated eggs. Regarding motivation, respondents report being primarily motivated by wanting to help infertile women. However, respondents believe that a fair and realistic amount of compensation would be about 60% higher than what is currently paid as the national standard fixed amount. This fixed-amount compensation system should be further investigated in terms of its legality, impact on donor profile, and its current amount."
https://openalex.org/W2999126076,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with acute coronary syndromes accounting for most of the cases. While the benefit of early revascularization has been clearly demonstrated in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), diagnostic pathways remain unclear in the absence of STEMI. We aimed to characterize OHCA patients presenting to 2 tertiary cardiology centers and identify predicting factors associated with survival.We retrospectively analyzed 519 patients after OHCA from February 2003 to December 2017 at 2 centers in Munich, Germany. Patients undergoing immediate coronary angiography (CAG) were compared to those without. Multivariate regression analysis and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to identify predictors for improved outcome in a matched population.Immediate CAG was performed in 385 (74.1%) patients after OHCA with presumed cardiac cause of arrest. As a result of multivariate analysis after propensity score matching, we found that immediate CAG, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at admission, witnessed arrest and former smoking were associated with improved 30-days-survival [(OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.84), (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.10-0.45), (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26-0.97), (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.81)], and 1-year-survival [(OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.82), (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.7), (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.2-1.00), (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.14-0.63)].In our study, immediate CAG, ROSC at admission, witnessed arrest and former smoking were independent predictors of survival in cardiac arrest survivors. Improvement in prehospital management including bystander CPR and best practice post-resuscitation care with optimized triage of patients to an early invasive strategy may help ameliorate overall outcome of this critically-ill patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2999934576,"Bistable stimuli can give rise to two different interpretations between which our perception will alternate. Recent results showed a strong coupling between eye movements and reports of perceptual alternations with motion stimuli, which provides useful tools to objectively assess perceptual alternations. However, motion might entrain eye movements, and here we check with a static picture, the Necker cube, whether eye movements and perceptual reports (manual responses) reveal similar or different alternation rates, and similar or different sensitivity to attention manipulations. Using a cluster analysis, ocular temporal windows were defined based on the dynamics of ocular fixations during viewing of the Necker cube and compared to temporal windows extracted from manual responses. Ocular temporal windows were measured also with a control condition, where the physical stimulus presented to viewers alternated between two non-ambiguous versions of the Necker cube. Attention was manipulated by asking subjects to either report spontaneous alternations, focus on one percept, or switch as fast as possible between percepts. The validity of the ocular temporal windows was confirmed by the correspondence between ocular fixations when the physical stimulus changed and when the bistable Necker cube was presented. Ocular movements defined smaller time windows than time windows extracted from manual responses. The number of manual and ocular windows both increased between the spontaneous condition and the switch condition. However, only manual, and not ocular windows, increased in duration in the focus condition. Manual responses involve decisional mechanisms, and they may be decoupled from automatic oscillations between the two percepts, as suggested by the fact that both the number and duration of ocular windows remained stable between the spontaneous and focus conditions. In all, the recording of eye movements provides an objective measure of time windows, and reveals faster perceptual alternations with the Necker cube and less sensitivity to attention manipulations than manual responses."
https://openalex.org/W3000031661,"Due to the popularity of Web-based applications, various developers have provided an abundance of Web services with similar functionality. Such similarity makes it challenging for users to discover, select, and recommend appropriate Web services for the service-oriented systems. Quality of Service (QoS) has become a vital criterion for service discovery, selection, and recommendation. Unfortunately, service registries cannot ensure the validity of the available quality values of the Web services provided online. Consequently, predicting the Web services’ QoS values has become a vital way to find the most appropriate services. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for predicting Web service QoS using source code metrics. The core component is aggregating software metrics using inequality distribution from micro level of individual class to the macro level of the entire Web service. We used correlation between QoS and software metrics to train the learning machine. We validate and evaluate our approach using three sets of software quality metrics. Our results show that the proposed methodology can help improve the efficiency for the prediction of QoS properties using its source code metrics."

https://openalex.org/W2999472873,"Pachacamac is the name of the 15th-16th century Inca sanctuary on the Peruvian coast as well as the name of one of the principal oracles of Inca divinities. This effigy would have been destroyed by Pizarro in 1533 during his visit to the great monumental complex, and as such the originality and antiquity of the wooden statue—the so-called Pachacamac Idol—have been the subject of much controversy and debate. We present here previously unpublished dates that confirm its manufacture during the Middle Horizon (AD 500–1000), as well as evidence of its original polychromy. Traces of colors were observed on its different sections with portable microscopy and analyses with two different X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry techniques, leading to identification of yellow, white, and red mineral pigments, including the presence of cinnabar. Dated between the 8th and 9th centuries, the statue would have been worshipped for almost 700 years, from the time of its creation to the time of the Spanish conquest, when Pachacamac was a major place of pilgrimage. These data not only offer a new perspective on Pachacamac’s emblematic sacred icon, but also on the colorful practices of the Pre-Hispanic Andes."
https://openalex.org/W2999747858,"We report the discovery that Bombus terrestris audax (Buff-tailed bumblebee) locomotor trajectories adhere to a speed-curvature power law relationship which has previously been found in humans, non-human primates and Drosophila larval trajectories. No previous study has reported such a finding in adult insect locomotion. We used behavioural tracking to study walking Bombus terrestris in an arena under different training environments. Trajectories analysed from this tracking show the speed-curvature power law holds robustly at the population level, displaying an exponent close to two-thirds. This exponent corroborates previous findings in human movement patterns, but differs from the three-quarter exponent reported for Drosophila larval locomotion. There are conflicting hypotheses for the principal origin of these speed-curvature laws, ranging from the role of central planning to kinematic and muscular skeletal constraints. Our findings substantiate the latter idea that dynamic power-law effects are robust, differing only through kinematic constraints due to locomotive method. Our research supports the notion that these laws are present in a greater range of species than previously thought, even in the bumblebee. Such power laws may provide optimal behavioural templates for organisms, delivering a potential analytical tool to study deviations from this template. Our results suggest that curvature and angular speed are constrained geometrically, and independently of the muscles and nerves of the performing body."

We aimed to capture the current opinion of German General Practitioners (GPs) to medical overuse.A quantitative online study was conducted. The questionnaire was developed based on a qualitative study and literature search. GPs were asked to estimate prevalence of medical overuse as well as to evaluate drivers and solutions of medical overuse. GPs in Bavaria were recruited via email (750 addresses). A descriptive data analysis was performed. Additionally the association between doctors' attitudes and (1) demographic variables and (2) interest in campaigns against medical overuse was assessed.Response rate was 18%. The mean age was 54 years, 79% were male and 68% have worked as GP longer than 15 years. Around 38% of medical services were considered as medical overuse and nearly half of the GPs (47%) judged medical overuse to be the more important problem than medical underuse. Main drivers were seen in ""patients´ expectations"" (76%), ""lack of a primary care system"" (61%) and ""defensive medicine"" (53%), whereas ""disregard of evidence/guidelines"" (15%) and ""economic pressure on the side of the doctor"" (13%) were not weighted as important causes. Demographic variables did not have an important impact on GPs´ response pattern. GPs interested in campaigns like ""Choosing Wisely"" showed a higher awareness for medical overuse, although these campaigns were only known by 50% of the respondents.Medical overuse is an important issue for GPs. Main drivers were searched and found outside their own sphere of responsibility. Campaigns as ""Choosing Wisely"" seem to have a positive effect on GPs attitude, but knowledge is still limited."

https://openalex.org/W2999412227,"Researchers have extensively studied the social mechanisms that drive the formation of networks observed among preschool children. However, less attention has been given to global network structures in terms of blockmodels. A blockmodel is a network where the nodes are groups of equivalent units (according to links to others) from a studied network. Cugmas et al. (2019) showed that mutuality, popularity, assortativity, and different types of transitivity mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed asymmetric core-cohesive blockmodel. Yet, they did not provide any evidence that such a global network structure actually appears in any empirical data. In this paper, the symmetric version of the core-cohesive blockmodel type is proposed. This blockmodel type consists of three or more groups of units. The units from each group are internally well linked to each other while those from different groups are not linked to each other. This is true for all groups, except one in which the units have mutual links to all other units in the network. In this study, it is shown that the proposed blockmodel type appears in empirical interactional networks collected among preschool children. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the most often studied social network mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed symmetric blockmodel type. The units' attributes are not considered in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2999504308,"Analysis of neuronal compartments has revealed many state-dependent changes in geometry but establishing synapse-specific mechanisms at the nanoscale has proven elusive. We co-expressed channelrhodopsin2-GFP and mAPEX2 in a subset of hippocampal CA3 neurons and used trains of light to induce late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in area CA1. L-LTP was shown to be specific to the labeled axons by severing CA3 inputs, which prevented back-propagating recruitment of unlabeled axons. Membrane-associated mAPEX2 tolerated microwave-enhanced chemical fixation and drove tyramide signal amplification to deposit Alexa Fluor dyes in the light-activated axons. Subsequent post-embedding immunogold labeling resulted in outstanding ultrastructure and clear distinctions between labeled (activated), and unlabeled axons without obscuring subcellular organelles. The gold-labeled axons in potentiated slices were reconstructed through serial section electron microscopy; presynaptic vesicles and other constituents could be quantified unambiguously. The genetic specification, reliable physiology, and compatibility with established methods for ultrastructural preservation make this an ideal approach to link synapse ultrastructure and function in intact circuits."

The environment temperature for it's ideal growth range is between 32 and 42°C, thus hot water pipes represent ideal environment for spread of Legionella. The bacteria are dormant below 20°C and do not survive above 60°C. The primary method used to control the risk from Legionella is therefore water temperature control. There are several other effective treatments to prevent growth of Legionella in water systems, however current disinfection methods can be applied only intermittently thus allowing Legionella to grow in between treatments. Here we present an alternative disinfection method based on antibacterial coatings with Cu-TiO2 nanotubes deposited on preformed surfaces. In the experiment the microbiocidal efficiency of submicron coatings on polystyrene to the bacterium of the genus Legionella pneumophila with a potential use in a water supply system was tested. The treatment thus constantly prevents growth of Legionella pneumophila in presence of water at room temperature. Here we show that 24-hour illumination with low power UVA light source (15 W/m2 UVA illumination) of copper doped TiO2 nanotube coated surfaces is effective in preventing growth of Legionella pneumophila. Microbiocidal effects of Cu-TiO2 nanotube coatings were dependent on the flow of the medium and the intensity of UV-A light. It was determined that tested submicron coatings have microbiocidal effects specially in a non-flow or low-flow conditions, as in higher flow rates, probably to a greater possibility of Legionella pneumophila sedimentation on the coated polystyrene surfaces, meanwhile no significant differences among bacteria reduction was noted regarding to non or low flow of medium."
https://openalex.org/W2998844227,"Botswana offers publicly financed HIV treatment to citizens, but not migrants, who comprised about 7% of the population in 2016. However, HIV incidence is not declining in proportion to Botswana's HIV response. In 2018, Botswana had 86% of citizens living with HIV diagnosed, 95% of people diagnosed on treatment, and 95% viral suppression among those on treatment. We hypothesised that continued exclusion of migrants is hampering reduction of HIV incidence in Botswana. Hence, we modelled the impact of including migrants in Botswana's HIV response on achieving 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 Fast-Track targets by 2020 and 2030, respectively.The Optima HIV model, with demographic, epidemiological, and behavioural inputs, was applied to citizens of and migrants to Botswana. Projections of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths were compared for three scenarios to the end of 2030: (1) continued status quo for HIV testing and treatment coverage, and maintenance of levels of linkage to care, loss to follow-up, and viral suppression among citizens and migrants (baseline); (2) with scaled-up budget, optimised to achieve 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 Fast-Track targets by 2020 and 2030, respectively, for citizens only; and (3) scaled-up optimised budget to achieve these targets for both citizens and migrants.A baseline of 172,000 new HIV infections and 8,400 HIV-related deaths was projected over 2020-2030. Scaling up to achieve targets among citizens only averted an estimated 48,000 infections and 1,700 deaths. Achieving targets for both citizens and migrants averted 16,000 (34%) more infections and 442 (26%) more deaths. Scaling up for both populations reduced numbers of new HIV infections and deaths by 44% and 39% respectively compared with 2010 levels. Treating migrants when scaling up in both populations was estimated to cost USD 74 million over 2020-2030.Providing HIV services to migrants in Botswana could lead to further reductions in HIV incidence and deaths. However, even with an increased, optimised budget that achieves 95-95-95 targets for both citizens and migrants by 2030, the 90% incidence reduction target for 2020 will be missed. Further efficiencies and innovations will be needed to meet HIV targets in Botswana."
https://openalex.org/W2999323743,"This paper compares and categorizes historical ideas about trees showing relationships among biological entities. The hierarchical structure of a tree is used to test the global consistency of similarities among these ideas; in other words we assess the “treeness” of the tree of historical trees. The collected data are figures and ideas about trees showing relationships among biological entities published or drawn by naturalists from 1555 to 2012. They are coded into a matrix of 235 historical trees and 141 descriptive attributes. From the most parsimonious “tree” of historical trees, treeness is measured by consistency index, retention index and homoplasy excess ratio. This tree is used to create sets or categories of trees, or to study the circulation of ideas. From an unrooted network of historical trees, treeness is measured by the delta-score. This unrooted network is used to measure and visualize treeness. The two approaches show a rather good treeness of the data, with respectively a retention idex of 0.83 and homoplasy excess ratio of 0.74, on one hand, and a delta-score of 0.26 on the other hand. It is interpreted as due to vertical transmission, i.e. an inheritance of shared ideas about biological trees among authors. This tree of trees is then used to test categories previously made. For instance, cladists and gradists are « paraphyletic ». The branches of this tree of trees suggest new categories of tree-thinkers that could have been overlooked by historians or systematists."
https://openalex.org/W3000083268,"An elevated gamma gap (>4 g/dL), the difference between serum total protein and albumin, can trigger testing for chronic infections or monoclonal gammopathy, despite a lack of evidence supporting this clinical threshold.Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2014, gamma gap was derived in three subpopulations based on availability of testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; N = 25,680), hepatitis C (HCV; N = 45,134), and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS; N = 6,118). Disease status was confirmed by HIV antibody and Western blot, HCV RNA test, or electrophoresis with immunofixation. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated for different gamma gap thresholds. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance and cubic splines were used to characterize the relationship between the gamma gap and each disease.Mean gamma gaps of participants with HIV, HCV, or MGUS ranged from 3.4-3.8 g/dL. The AUC was 0.80 (95%CI: 0.75,0.85) for HIV, 0.74 (0.72,0.76) for HCV, and 0.64 (0.60,0.69) for MGUS. An elevated gamma gap of over 4 g/dL corresponded to sensitivities of 39.3%, 19.0%, and 15.4% and specificities of 98.4%, 97.8%, and 95.4% for HIV, HCV, and MGUS, respectively. A higher prevalence of all three diseases was observed at both low and high gamma gaps.An elevated gamma gap of 4 g/dL is insensitive for HIV, HCV, or MGUS, but has a high specificity for HIV and HCV, suggesting that the absence of an elevated gamma gap does not rule out HIV, HCV, or MGUS. Conversely, an elevated gap may justify further testing for HIV and HCV, but does not justify electrophoresis in the absence of additional clinical information."
https://openalex.org/W3000145149,"Species introduced outside their natural range threaten global biodiversity and despite greater awareness of invasive species risks at ports and airports, control measures in place only concern anthropogenic routes of dispersal. Here, we use the Harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, an invasive species which first established in the UK from continental Europe in 2004, to test whether records from 2004 and 2005 were associated with atmospheric events. We used the atmospheric- chemistry transport model SILAM to model the movement of this species from known distributions in continental Europe and tested whether the predicted atmospheric events were associated with the frequency of ladybird records in the UK. We show that the distribution of this species in the early years of its arrival does not provide substantial evidence for a purely anthropogenic introduction and show instead that atmospheric events can better explain this arrival event. Our results suggest that air flows which may assist dispersal over the English Channel are relatively frequent; ranging from once a week from Belgium and the Netherlands to 1–2 times a week from France over our study period. Given the frequency of these events, we demonstrate that atmospheric-assisted dispersal is a viable route for flying species to cross natural barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2999551978,"Fifty-one adults evaluated visually-perceived emotions from 32 masks. These masks (held in the collection of the Kentucky Museum, located on the campus of Western Kentucky University) were created by artists from a wide variety of cultures spanning multiple continents. Each participant evaluated every mask along six dimensions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. No previous scientific study has ever studied the general effectiveness of masks (other than Japanese Noh masks) in producing perceptions of human emotion. The results showed that the masks were effective in producing substantial variations in perceived happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. The ability of the masks to produce effective perceptions of emotion was due to the artists’ inclusion of facial features that reliably signal emotions in everyday life."
https://openalex.org/W3000177887,"Although hypertension is the most common risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), whether blood pressure (BP) control varies across the spectrum of stroke risk in patients with AF or by adequacy of their thromboprophylaxis management is unclear.We examined data from the RE-LY AF registry conducted at 164 emergency departments (EDs) in 47 countries between December 2007 and October 2011.Of the 15,400 patients in the registry, we analyzed the 9929 (mean age 67.5 years, 51.9% men) with a prior history of AF and complete BP data. While 6508 (66.5%) AF patients had hypertension, the prevalence varied widely depending on comorbidity profiles: from 45.4% in those without other cardiovascular risk factors to 82.5% in those with AF and diabetes. Although 93.9% of AF patients with hypertension were on at least one antihypertensive agent, fewer than half had BP levels ≤ 140/90 with no difference across risk profiles: 45.9% of those with NVAF and CHADS2 scores of 1 and 45.6% of those with NVAF and CHADS2 scores of 2 or more (46.9% and 45.3% for CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 1 versus 2 or more). BP control rates were not significantly better in those NVAF patients receiving guideline concordant thromboprophylaxis management (47.2%, aOR 1.03, 95%CI 0.89-1.20) than in those not receiving guideline-concordant antithrombotic therapy (45.3%).Hypertension was common in patients with AF but BP control rates were sub-optimal and varied little across the spectrum of stroke risk or by adequacy of thromboprophylaxis. This highlights the need for an increased focus on total atherosclerotic risk rather than just thromboprophylaxis management in AF patients."
