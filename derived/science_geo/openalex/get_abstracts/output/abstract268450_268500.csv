https://openalex.org/W2008767530,"The elevations and ages of a sequence of three uplifted Pleistocene coral reefs on the Northwest Peninsula of Haiti have been determined. With the assignment of a sea level of +6 meters (relative to the present day) at 130,000 years before present and constant uplift of the reefs, the data indicate that sea level stood -10 and -13 meters at 108,000 and 81,000 years before present, respectively. These results are in substantial agreement with those reported for Barbados and New Guinea and support the hypothesis of constant uplift for each area. Sea level data from raised reefs indicate that the interglacial marine oxygen isotope oscillations during oxygen isotope stage 5 are a result of 30 percent ice volume effects and 70 percent temperature effects."
https://openalex.org/W2077269300,"The fossil sequences from cores across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary show a, range of transition times and transition time intervals depending on the fossil indicators and the location of the site. These variations, together with the pattern of iridium distribution with depth at some sites, differences in total amounts of iridium, variations in noble metal abundances normalized to extraterrestrial concentrations, the depositional effects that might be expected in a reducing environment, and the clay mineralogy of the boundary layer clays, put into question the interpretation that an extraterrestrial event was the cause of the faunal changes and the iridium anomaly in the vicinity of the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition. It seems more likely that an explanation for the changes during the transition will come from continued examination of the great variety of terrestrial events that took place at that time, including extensive volcanism, major regression of the sea from the land, geochemical changes, and paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic changes."

The influence of the southern westerlies may have been greater at this time, and the effect of the Pacific anticyclone was apparently weakened. The climate today, wet in winter and dry in summer, supports broad sclerophyll vegetation that developed during the Holocene with the arrival of paleo-Indians and the extinction of mastodon and horse."
https://openalex.org/W1997329494,"Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) is a serious weed problem in the United States and other countries. An indigenous rust fungus [Puccinia canaliculata (Schw.) Lagerh.], pathogenic on yellow nutsedge, was released in early spring as a potential biological control agent. The fungus inhibited nutsedge flowering and new tuber formation. The fungus also dehydrated and killed nutsedge plants. The successful control of yellow nutsedge by a rust epiphytotic under experimental conditions demonstrates the potential use of the rust in an integrated weed management system."

This activity, possibly associated with magma injection, began 6 weeks after several strong (magnitude 6+) earthquakes in an area south of the caldera and has continued sporadically to the present time. The earthquake sequence and magmatic activity are part of a broad increase in tectonic activity in a 15,000-square-kilometer region surrounding the ""White Mountains seismic gap,"" an area with high potential for the next major earthquake in the western Great Basin."

https://openalex.org/W2091425076,An empirical relation between residential firewood use and population density was developed from survey data for 64 counties in New England and was corroborated by data from other states. The results indicate that usage is concentrated in urbanized areas of the Northeast and north central states and that about 9.0 to 11.0 percent of U.S. space heating input is from firewood. No constraints due to the supply of wood were apparent in 1978-1979. These findings have implications for effects on air quality.

During a 5-year study of two natural watersheds in Florida that were converted to plantations, woody species diminished, but herbaceous species increased. Number of plant species on permanent transects and plots increased. Diversity of cover, frequency, and biomass did not diminish or else increased after harvest."
https://openalex.org/W1983060546,"Small clusters of naked (no ligand attached) atoms or single atoms are seen as the ultimate catalyst for achieving different types of hydrocarbon reactions (i.e. Fischer-Tropsch reactions) without catalyzing the production of undesirable materials. Recently published works aim at the production of single atoms or clusters of naked atoms, and the characterization of these is surveyed. Attempts to answer the question of how many atoms of a specific material must cluster to bring about the transition to bulk material properties are also reported. This transition of properties occurs at different numbers of atoms/cluster for physics and chemistry. (BLM)"

The areas in which Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology selected to focus a national development program include the following: scholarships for middle- as well as high-level researchers and technicians; indicative programs to support research and basic or new industries in fields such as energy, electronics, metalworking, and agronomy; a government-industry shared risk program; research centers, many located in the provinces; and international scientific agreements. The translation of scientific classics and contemporary publications into Spanish and their widespread dissemination in Mexico have received special attention as has the dissemination of Mexico's work worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W1965006509,"To the Editor: â€”In the last two numbers of theAmerican Journal, of Physical Anthropology(Vistar Institute, Philadelphia), I publish the account, with illustrations, of eleven children who, before walking upright, have spontaneously developed the habit of running effectively on all fours. This is a highly interesting phenomenon of nonpathologic nature, and I should be thankful for further reliable reports. The principal points on which information is desired are as follows: race and nationality; sex; health and robustness; what child in numerical order; whether the phenomenon has been noticed in any other child of the same parents or among relatives; at what age the child began to run on all fours, and how long it has continued; to which should be added a description, as detailed as possible, of the performance itself, supplemented, when this can be done, by a photograph of the child in the act.
