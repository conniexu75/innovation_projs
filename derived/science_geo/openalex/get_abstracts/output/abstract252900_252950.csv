https://openalex.org/W2114340103,"Recent behavioral experiments aimed at understanding the evolutionary foundations of human cooperation have suggested that a willingness to engage in costly punishment, even in one-shot situations, may be part of human psychology and a key element in understanding our sociality. However, because most experiments have been confined to students in industrialized societies, generalizations of these insights to the species have necessarily been tentative. Here, experimental results from 15 diverse populations show that (i) all populations demonstrate some willingness to administer costly punishment as unequal behavior increases, (ii) the magnitude of this punishment varies substantially across populations, and (iii) costly punishment positively covaries with altruistic behavior across populations. These findings are consistent with models of the gene-culture coevolution of human altruism and further sharpen what any theory of human cooperation needs to explain."
https://openalex.org/W2158930854,"Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) misfolding is associated with several devastating neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In yeast cells and in neurons αSyn accumulation is cytotoxic, but little is known about its normal function or pathobiology. The earliest defect following αSyn expression in yeast was a block in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–to–Golgi vesicular trafficking. In a genomewide screen, the largest class of toxicity modifiers were proteins functioning at this same step, including the Rab guanosine triphosphatase Ypt1p, which associated with cytoplasmic αSyn inclusions. Elevated expression of Rab1, the mammalian YPT1 homolog, protected against αSyn-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in animal models of PD. Thus, synucleinopathies may result from disruptions in basic cellular functions that interface with the unique biology of particular neurons to make them especially vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W2092638438,"Multiple enzymatic activities are required for transcriptional initiation. The enzyme DNA topoisomerase II associates with gene promoter regions and can generate breaks in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Therefore, it is of interest to know whether this enzyme is critical for regulated gene activation. We report that the signal-dependent activation of gene transcription by nuclear receptors and other classes of DNA binding transcription factors, including activating protein 1, requires DNA topoisomerase IIβ-dependent, transient, site-specific dsDNA break formation. Subsequent to the break, poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase–1 enzymatic activity is induced, which is required for a nucleosome-specific histone H1–high-mobility group B exchange event and for local changes of chromatin architecture. Our data mechanistically link DNA topoisomerase IIβ–dependent dsDNA breaks and the components of the DNA damage and repair machinery in regulated gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2067432938,"The accumulation of somatic DNA damage has been implicated as a cause of ageing in metazoa. One possible mechanism by which increased DNA damage could lead to cellular degeneration and death is by stochastic deregulation of gene expression. Here we directly test for increased transcriptional noise in aged tissue by dissociating single cardiomyocytes from fresh heart samples of both young and old mice, followed by global mRNA amplification and quantification of mRNA levels in a panel of housekeeping and heart-specific genes. Although gene expression levels already varied among cardiomyocytes from young heart, this heterogeneity was significantly elevated at old age. We had demonstrated previously an increased load of genome rearrangements and other mutations in the heart of aged mice. To confirm that increased stochasticity of gene expression could be a result of increased genome damage, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in culture with hydrogen peroxide. Such treatment resulted in a significant increase in cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, which was found to parallel the induction and persistence of genome rearrangement mutations at a lacZ reporter locus. These results underscore the stochastic nature of the ageing process, and could provide a mechanism for age-related cellular degeneration and death in tissues of multicellular organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2163832574,"Long-term variations in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation are generally thought to control glaciation. But the intensity of summer insolation is primarily controlled by 20,000-year cycles in the precession of the equinoxes, whereas early Pleistocene glacial cycles occur at 40,000-year intervals, matching the period of changes in Earth's obliquity. The resolution of this 40,000-year problem is that glaciers are sensitive to insolation integrated over the duration of the summer. The integrated summer insolation is primarily controlled by obliquity and not precession because, by Kepler's second law, the duration of the summer is inversely proportional to Earth's distance from the Sun."

https://openalex.org/W2128686747,"The formation of the neuromuscular synapse requires muscle-specific receptor kinase (MuSK) to orchestrate postsynaptic differentiation, including the clustering of receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Upon innervation, neural agrin activates MuSK to establish the postsynaptic apparatus, although agrin-independent formation of neuromuscular synapses can also occur experimentally in the absence of neurotransmission. Dok-7, a MuSK-interacting cytoplasmic protein, is essential for MuSK activation in cultured myotubes; in particular, the Dok-7 phosphotyrosine-binding domain and its target in MuSK are indispensable. Mice lacking Dok-7 formed neither acetylcholine receptor clusters nor neuromuscular synapses. Thus, Dok-7 is essential for neuromuscular synaptogenesis through its interaction with MuSK."

https://openalex.org/W2025997795,"We propose that from approximately 3 to 1 million years ago, ice volume changes occurred in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, each controlled by local summer insolation. Because Earth's orbital precession is out of phase between hemispheres, 23,000-year changes in ice volume in each hemisphere cancel out in globally integrated proxies such as ocean delta18O or sea level, leaving the in-phase obliquity (41,000 years) component of insolation to dominate those records. Only a modest ice mass change in Antarctica is required to effectively cancel out a much larger northern ice volume signal. At the mid-Pleistocene transition, we propose that marine-based ice sheet margins replaced terrestrial ice margins around the perimeter of East Antarctica, resulting in a shift to in-phase behavior of northern and southern ice sheets as well as the strengthening of 23,000-year cyclicity in the marine delta18O record."
https://openalex.org/W2063253418,"During neurotransmitter release at the synapse, influx of calcium ions stimulates the release of neurotransmitter. However, the mechanism by which synaptic vesicle fusion is coupled to calcium has been unclear, despite the identification of both the core fusion machinery [soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)] and the principal calcium sensor (synaptotagmin). Here, we describe what may represent a basic principle of the coupling mechanism: a reversible clamping protein (complexin) that can freeze the SNAREpin, an assembled fusion-competent intermediate en route to fusion. When calcium binds to the calcium sensor synaptotagmin, the clamp would then be released. SNARE proteins, and key regulators like synaptotagmin and complexin, can be ectopically expressed on the cell surface. Cells expressing such “flipped” synaptic SNAREs fuse constitutively, but when we coexpressed complexin, fusion was blocked. Adding back calcium triggered fusion from this intermediate in the presence of synaptotagmin."
https://openalex.org/W2078798630,"The San Andreas fault in California is a mature continental transform fault that accommodates a significant fraction of motion between the North American and Pacific plates. The two most recent great earthquakes on this fault ruptured its northern and central sections in 1906 and 1857, respectively. The southern section of the fault, however, has not produced a great earthquake in historic times (for at least 250 years). Assuming the average slip rate of a few centimetres per year, typical of the rest of the San Andreas fault, the minimum amount of slip deficit accrued on the southern section is of the order of 7-10 metres, comparable to the maximum co-seismic offset ever documented on the fault. Here I present high-resolution measurements of interseismic deformation across the southern San Andreas fault system using a well-populated catalogue of space-borne synthetic aperture radar data. The data reveal a nearly equal partitioning of deformation between the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, with a pronounced asymmetry in strain accumulation with respect to the geologically mapped fault traces. The observed strain rates confirm that the southern section of the San Andreas fault may be approaching the end of the interseismic phase of the earthquake cycle."

Reverse-transcribed whole-genome shotgun sequencing was used to characterize the diversity of uncultivated marine RNA virus assemblages. A diverse assemblage of RNA viruses, including a broad group of marine picorna-like viruses, and distant relatives of viruses infecting arthropods and higher plants were found. Communities were dominated by distinct genotypes with small genome sizes, and we completely assembled the genomes of several hitherto undiscovered viruses. Our results show that the oceans are a reservoir of previously unknown RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2048552633,"Humans are highly social animals and often help unrelated individuals that may never reciprocate the altruist's favour. This apparent evolutionary puzzle may be explained by the altruist's gain in social image: image-scoring bystanders, also known as eavesdroppers, notice the altruistic act and therefore are more likely to help the altruist in the future. Such complex indirect reciprocity based on altruistic acts may evolve only after simple indirect reciprocity has been established, which requires two steps. First, image scoring evolves when bystanders gain personal benefits from information gathered, for example, by finding cooperative partners. Second, altruistic behaviour in the presence of such bystanders may evolve if altruists benefit from access to the bystanders. Here, we provide experimental evidence for both of the requirements in a cleaning mutualism involving the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. These cleaners may cooperate and remove ectoparasites from clients or they may cheat by feeding on client mucus. As mucus may be preferred over typical client ectoparasites, clients must make cleaners feed against their preference to obtain a cooperative service. We found that eavesdropping clients spent more time next to 'cooperative' than 'unknown cooperative level' cleaners, which shows that clients engage in image-scoring behaviour. Furthermore, trained cleaners learned to feed more cooperatively when in an 'image-scoring' than in a 'non-image-scoring' situation."

https://openalex.org/W1581289874,"During fasting, increased concentrations of circulating catecholamines promote the mobilization of lipid stores from adipose tissue in part by phosphorylating and inactivating acetyl–coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Here, we describe a parallel pathway, in which the pseudokinase Tribbles 3 (TRB3), whose abundance is increased during fasting, stimulates lipolysis by triggering the degradation of ACC in adipose tissue. TRB3 promoted ACC ubiquitination through an association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein 1 (COP1). Indeed, adipocytes deficient in TRB3 accumulated larger amounts of ACC protein than did wild-type cells. Because transgenic mice expressing TRB3 in adipose tissue are protected from diet-induced obesity due to enhanced fatty acid oxidation, these results demonstrate how phosphorylation and ubiquitination pathways converge on a key regulator of lipid metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1969696561,"Interleukin (IL)-17 is the founding member of a novel family of inflammatory cytokines. Although produced by T cells, IL-17 activates genes and signals typical of innate immune mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β. Most IL-17 target genes characterized to date are cytokines or neutrophil-attractive chemokines. Our recent microarray studies identified an acute phase response gene, 24p3/lipocalin 2, as a novel IL-17-induced gene. Here we describe a detailed analysis of the 24p3 promoter. We find that, unlike cytokine or chemokine gene target genes, 24p3 is regulated primarily at the level of transcription rather than mRNA stability and that synergy between IL-17 and TNFα occurs at the level of the 24p3 promoter. Two key transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were identified, corresponding to NF-κB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Deletion of either site eliminated 24p3 promoter activity in response to IL-17. These findings were strikingly similar to the IL-6 promoter, where IL-17-mediated regulation of both NF-κB and C/EBP is essential. To determine whether joint use of NF-κB and C/EBP is common to all IL-17 target genes, we performed a computational analysis on 18 well documented IL-17 target promoters to assess statistical enrichment of specific TFBSs. Indeed, NF-κB and C/EBP sites were over-represented in these genes, as were AP1 and OCT1 sites. Moreover, these promoters fell into three definable subcategories based on TFBS location and usage. Analysis of IL-17 target gene regulation is key for understanding this important host-defense molecule and also contributes to an understanding of upstream signaling mechanisms used by IL-17, either alone or in concert with TNFα.

The process of inflammation is coordinated by soluble effectors, primarily cytokines and chemokines, which trigger vascular changes to activate and recruit leukocytes and other host defense mechanisms. In the early stages of inflammation, the innate immune system and a network of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promote phagocytosis and neutrophil recruitment to infected sites. Within days, innate immune mechanisms in turn activate the adaptive immune system to mount a specific memory response involving antigen-specific lymphocytes.

To date, six IL-17 family ligands (IL-17A-F) and five receptors (IL-17RA-IL-17RD and SEF) have been identified (1Kolls J.K. Linden A. Immunity. 2004; 21: 467-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar, 2Kawaguchi M. Adachi M. Oda N. Kokubu F. Huang S.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2004; 114: 1265-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). By far the best characterized is IL-17 (CTLA-8 or IL-17A), which is secreted primarily by CD4+ T helper cells. Recent reports have demonstrated that the IL-12 family cytokine IL-23, in conjunction with transforming growth factor β and IL-6, drives IL-17 expression in a unique CD4+ T cell subset, now termed “Th17” (3Veldhoen M. Hocking R.J. Atkins C.J. Locksley R.M. Stockinger B. Immunity. 2006; 24: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 4Bettelli E. Kuchroo V.K. J. Exp.

Although produced by the adaptive arm of the immune system, IL-17 functions as a classic effector of innate immunity, similar to IL-1β, TNFα, or Toll-like receptor agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (1Kolls J.K. Linden A. Immunity. 2004; 21: 467-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Specifically, IL-17 induces expression of many innate inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, CXC chemokines, acute phase proteins, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, prostaglandin E2, and cyclooxygenase-2. IL-17 also synergizes potently with inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, amplifying its effects by orders of magnitude (6Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2559-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Miossec P. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-17 is a means by which the adaptive immune system communicates with the innate immune system to promote inflammation. Like most inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 plays opposing roles in vivo, depending on disease context (8O'Shea J. Ma A. Lipsky P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). On one hand, considerable evidence links IL-17 to pathology in autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn disease (9Gaffen S.L. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Lubberts E. Koenders M.I. van den Berg W.B. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2005; 7: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Blocking IL-17 with antibodies or soluble receptors reduces inflammatory symptoms in animal models of arthritis such as collagen-induced arthritis, whereas excess IL-17 exacerbates disease (11Lubberts E. Joosten L.A. van de Loo F.A. Schwarzenberger P. Kolls J. van den Berg W.B. Inflamm. Res. 2002; 51: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Lubberts E. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 572-577PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chabaud M. Lubberts E. Joosten L. van Den Berg W. Miossec P. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). IL-17-deficient mice are also resistant to collagen-induced arthritis, and spontaneous arthritis in IL-1ra-deficient mice is dependent on IL-17 (14Nakae S. Saijo S. Horai R. Sudo K. Mori S. Iwakura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5986-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-17 is essential for mounting effective immune responses to many infectious organisms. In most cases, this has been linked to a failure to expand and/or recruit neutrophils (1Kolls J.K. Linden A. Immunity. 2004; 21: 467-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar, 15Linden A. Laan M. Anderson G. Eur. Respir. J. 2005; 25: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Consequently, IL-17RA-deficient mice show an increased susceptibility to bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens (16Ye P. Rodriguez F.H. Kanaly S. Stocking K.L. Schurr J. Schwarzenberger P. Oliver P. Huang W. Zhang P. Zhang J. Shellito J.E. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Charrier K. Peschon J.J. Kolls J.K. J. Exp.

In the course of recent microarray studies, we found that another gene induced potently by IL-17 is 24p3, also known as lipocalin 2 or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Lipocalins are small, secreted proteins with a common tertiary structure that binds lipophilic molecules such as prostaglandins and cholesterol. 24p3 was originally identified as an acute phase response gene induced in the liver, mainly by inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα and lipopolysaccharide (20Flo T.H. Smith K.D. Sato S. Rodriguez D.J. Holmes M.A. Strong R.K. Akira S. Aderem A. Nature. 2004; 432: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 21Liu Q. Nilsen-Hamilton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22565-22570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Diverse activities have been ascribed to 24p3, including roles in apoptosis, tissue involution, and ischemia-reperfusion injury (22Mori K. Lee H.T. Rapoport D. Drexler I.R. Foster K. Yang J. Schmidt-Ott K.M. Chen X. Li J.Y. Weiss S. Mishra J. Cheema F.H. Markowitz G. Suganami T. Sawai K. Mukoyama M. Kunis C. D'Agati V. Devarajan P. Barasch J. J. Clin.

Sci. 2003; 995: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the most convincing function of 24p3 is its role in innate immune defense via iron sequestration. Most pathogenic organisms require host-derived iron for survival and have developed complex systems for its acquisition (for review, see Ref. 25Richardson D.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1175-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, an important mammalian host defense mechanism involves preventing bacterial access to free iron. 24p3 was recently shown to bind to catecholate-type siderophores and thereby block iron acquisition by certain types of bacteria (26Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, 24p3-deficient mice are highly sensitive to organisms that use catecholate-type siderophores such as Escherichia coli (20Flo T.H. Smith K.D. Sato S. Rodriguez D.J. Holmes M.A. Strong R.K. Akira S. Aderem A. Nature. 2004; 432: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 27Berger T. Togawa A. Duncan G.S. Elia A.J. You-Ten A. Wakeham A. Fong H.E. Cheung C.C. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that another antimicrobial signal regulated by IL-17 involves the acute phase response and control of bacterial access to free iron. Despite its functional similarity to the IL-1 and TNF families, IL-17 and its receptor IL-17RA are unique in structure and sequence (28Aggarwal S. Gurney A.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, few predictions about molecular signal transduction can be made simply on the basis of primary amino acid sequence. Although little is known about IL-17RA structure, IL-17 clearly activates genes and signaling pathways typical of pro-inflammatory effectors such as TNFα, lipopolysaccharide, and IL-1β. Numerous experiments both in vitro and in vivo have shown that IL-17 exerts potent effects on neutrophils, primarily by regulating genes encoding chemokines, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and granulopoietic cytokines such as granulocyteand granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (15Linden A. Laan M. Anderson G. Eur. Respir. J. 2005; 25: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Knowing gene targets of signaling pathways allows inferences to be made about signaling pathways activated by the inducing receptor. Although few IL-17-induced genes have been characterized in detail, most of those examined contain an essential NF-κB DNA binding site in their proximal promoters (6Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2559-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 29Kao C.Y. Chen Y. Thai P. Wachi S. Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3482-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, IL-17 has been shown to activate NF-κB nuclear import and DNA binding in certain cell types via the adaptor TRAF6 (30Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 31Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We recently showed that IL-17-induced activation of the IL-6 promoter involves NF-κB activation in conjunction with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP, also known as NF-IL6) transcription factor family (6Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2559-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, information about IL-17-mediated signaling is still very limited. The present study describes a detailed analysis of the 24p3 proximal promoter and its activation by IL-17 and TNFα, in which we found that IL-17 uses both NF-κB and C/EBP to activate the 24p3 promoter. Given the similarity between the IL-6 and 24p3 promoters in terms of IL-17 regulation, we performed a computational analysis of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) using multiple mouse and orthologous human IL-17 target genes. Results revealed statistical over-representation of TFBSs common to IL-17 target gene promoters, including NF-κB and C/EBP. Moreover, a phylogenetic comparison of IL-17-target gene promoters in human and mouse identified three subcategories of promoter based on TFBS location and usage. Strikingly, these promoter subgroups correlated with gene function, in that one category of promoter contained only chemokines, whereas another contained only immuno-regulatory molecules such as 24p3. These studies suggest that IL-17 may use different signaling cascades to specifically direct different categories of gene expression. Cell Culture, Reagents, Transfections, and Stimulations—ST2 and MC3T3-E1 and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland CA), penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Recombinant human IL-17 and TNFα were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For stimulation, ST2 or IL-17RKO MF cells were seeded on 10-cm plates at 70% confluence. After attachment (∼16 h), cells were stimulated with the indicated cytokines for the designated time periods. Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was performed as described (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J.

Primer pairs were as follows: 24p3, 5′-CAG CTT TCA GAT GTA CAG CAC C-3′ and 5′-CAT GGC GAA CTG GTT GTA GTC-3′; CXC chemokine ligand 1 (Groα/CXCL1), 5′-CAC CCA AAC CGA AGT CAT AG-3′ and 5′-AAG CCA GCG TTC ACC AGA-3′; LIX/CXCL5, 5′-GGT CCA CAG TGC CCT ACG-3′ and 5′-GCG AGT GCA TTC CGC TTA-3′; C/EBPβ, 5′-TGC CAT GTA CGA CGA CGA G-3′ and 5′-GCC GCT TTG TGG TTG CTG-3′; C/EBPδ, 5′-CGC ACC ACG ACT TCC TCT-3′ and 5′-CGA GGC TCA CGT AAC CGT-3′. For measuring RNA stability, ST2 cells were stimulated for 4 h without cytokines or with IL-17 (200 ng/ml). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, Sigma) for the durations indicated. Luciferase Assays—Construction of the luciferase reporter assay plasmid containing 1.4 kb upstream of the 24p3 gene (24p3-1400-luc) based on sequence information from the genomic data base (accession number NC_000068) was described previously (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Serial 5′ truncations of the 24p3 promoter were generated by PCR and subcloned in the MluI and XhoI sites of the pGL3 Basic reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Upstream primers were: 24p3–1088-luc, 5′-GGA ACG CGT AAG GAG AAG GTA GAA ACT TGC-3′; 24p3–716-luc, 5′-CTA ACG CGT ACA GGA GAG GGT GAG TCC-3′; 24p3–282-luc, 5′-TGC ACG CGT CCT GCC AGA ATC CAA AGC-3′; 24p3–213-luc, 5′-TTC ACG CGT CTC AAC CTT GCA CAG TTC CG-3′; 24p3–144-luc, 5′-ACA ACG CGT ACT GGC AAT TAC TTC ATG G-3′; 24p3–78-luc, 5′-CAA CAC GCG TGC TGG CAG CCA GGT AGG CC-3′. The downstream primer was 5′-GAC CTC GAG GGC CAT GGT TTC CAC-3′. Site directed mutations were performed on 24p3–282-luc using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to create the NF-κB mutation were: 5′-AGA ATC CAA AGC CCT GCG AAT GTC CCT CTG GTC CC-3′ and 5′-GAG GGG GAC CAG AGG GAC ATT CGC AGG GCT TTG GAT-3′. Primers used to create the C/EBP mutation were 5′-CAG CCC TTC CTG GCA CTTGGC CTT GCA CAG TTC CGA C-3′ and 5′-AAC TGT GCA AGG CCA AGT GCC AGG AAG GGC TGC AGG G-3′ (mutation sites are underlined). For luciferase assays cells were seeded on 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and co-transfected with 0.2 μg of the 24p3 luciferase plasmid and 10 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal standard. Cells were stimulated with cytokines for 6 h and lysed, and supernatants were analyzed for luciferase using a Veritas Microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). EMSA—NF-κB EMSAs were performed as described (6Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2559-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) with 10 μg/lane nuclear extracts and 105 cpm/lane 32P-labeled double-stranded probe. The WT NF-κB probe (top strand) is 5′-AAG CCC TGG GAA TGT CCC TCT G-3′, and the mutant NF-κB sequence is 5′-AAG CCC TGC GAA TGT CCC TCT G-3′ (the mutation is underlined). The sequence of the WT C/EBP probe (top strand) is 5′-CTT CCT GTT GCT CAA CCT TGC A-3′, and the mutant C/EBP sequence is 5′-CTT CCT GGC ACT TGG CCT TGC A-3′ (the mutation is underlined). The composite NF-κB-C/EBP composite long probe is 5′-AAG CCC TGG GAA TGT CCC TCT GGT CCC CCT CTG TCC CCT GCA GCC CTT CCT GTT GCT CAA CCT TGC A-3′. EMSA for C/EBP and the composite long probe were performed in a modified binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4% glycerol, 1% Ficoll 70, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA pH 8.0), and nuclear extracts were incubated with the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe at room temperature for 40 min. For supershifts, nuclear extracts were prein-cubated with 2 μg of antibodies to NF-κB p65 (sc-109, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), C/EBPβ (sc-150), and C/EBPδ (sc-151) for 30 min at room temperature before EMSA. Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts, whole cell lysates or culture supernatants were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with antibodies to C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-150, 1:1000), C/EBPδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-151, 1:1000), histone H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8030, 1:1000), 24p3 (R&D systems, AF1857, 1:400), or tubulin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA 1:1000). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Flow Cytometry—Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in α-minimal essential medium plus10% FBS (Gemini Biosystems, Woodland, CA). After attachment, cells were incubated with the cytokines for 6 and 24 h. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed in triplicate using commercial kits (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For fluorescence-activated cell sorter, 1 × 106 cells were incubated on ice with monoclonal antibody M177 (1.1 mg/ml rat anti-mouse IL-17R IgG2a, provided by Amgen) at 1:50 followed by goat anti-ratphycoerythrin (BD Pharmingen). Data were analyzed on a FACSCalibur with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). TFBS Enrichment Analysis—Promoter sequences defined as 1 kb upstream of the annotated transcription start site (TSS) for the 18 selected human and mouse genes were downloaded from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Mammalian Promoter data base (32Xuan Z. Zhao F. Wang J. Chen G. Zhang M. Genome Biology 2005. 2005; 6: R72Google Scholar). For genes with multiple mRNA reference sequences, we selected the sequence with a TSS determined from experimentally identified promoter regions (33Yamashita R. Suzuki Y. Wakaguri H. Tsuritanj K. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For reference sequences with alternative promoters, we selected that defined as “best” by Xuan et al. (32Xuan Z. Zhao F. Wang J. Chen G. Zhang M. Genome Biology 2005. 2005; 6: R72Google Scholar). For background sequences, we randomly selected 6600 mouse and 7350 human unique mRNA RefSeq genes and obtained 1 kb upstream of the TSS promoter sequences (32Xuan Z. Zhao F. Wang J. Chen G. Zhang M. Genome Biology 2005. 2005; 6: R72Google Scholar). For enrichment analysis of TFBSs, the program CLOVER (34Frith M. Fu Y. Yu L. Chen J. Hansen U. Weng Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1372-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) was used with 565 vertebrate position weight matrices from the professional TRANSFAC9.1 data base. Parameters of CLOVER were set for 1000 randomizations and a p value threshold of 0.05. 24p3 Is a Gene Target of IL-17—To date, surprisingly little is known about IL-17-mediated signal transduction. The end point of most signaling pathways is transcriptional initiation of specific genes. Until recently, relatively few IL-17 target genes had been identified, with IL-6 the prototypical target and the basis for the standard IL-17 bioassay (30Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M.

Med. 1996; 183: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Recently, more comprehensive studies of IL-17-induced genes have been performed in osteoblasts and fibroblasts, which are considered to be among the most IL-17-responsive cell types (5Dong C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 36Park H. Li Z. Yang X.O. Chang S.H. Nurieva R. Wang Y.H. Wang Y. Hood L. Zhu Z. Tian Q. Dong C. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3454) Google Scholar). These and other reports indicate that IL-17 is a potent regulator of cytokine and chemokine gene expression. However, IL-17 also regulates other aspects of host defense, including the acute phase response, but far less is known about the mechanisms by which this occurs. In this regard, results from our previous microarray study revealed that the acute phase response gene 24p3/lipocalin 2 (hereafter referred to as 24p3) is a novel IL-17 target gene (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Specifically, expression of 24p3 is induced 2–60-fold by IL-17 in a variety of non-immune cell types, including pre-osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1), MEF, and bone marrow stromal cells (ST2) (Fig. 1A). In addition, IL-17 enhanced 24p3 gene expression synergistically when combined with suboptimal doses of TNFα (2 ng/ml), up to 700-fold over base line (Fig. 1A) (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). 24p3 mRNA expression was activated by IL-17 as early as 30 min and peaked 1 h post-stimulation (data not shown). Among cell lines tested, 24p3 was most strongly up-regulated in ST2 cells both by IL-17 alone and IL-17 together with TNFα. The increased sensitivity of ST2 cells to IL-17 stimulation seems to be a general phenomenon, as all other IL-17-induced genes tested follow the same trend (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This finding can be at least partly explained by IL-17RA expression, as ST2 cells express considerably more IL-17RA than MEFs or MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 1B). Up-regulation of 24p3 mRNA could be due to new transcription, enhanced mRNA stability, or both. IL-17-mediated induction of several genes is due to activation of the proximal promoter as well as enhanced mRNA stability (37Witowski J. Pawlaczyk K. Breborowicz A. Scheuren A. Kuzlan-Pawlaczyk M.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-17 contributes to 24p3 message levels by enhancing transcript stability, ST2 cells were stimulated with IL-17 for 4 h to induce 24p3 mRNA and then treated with actinomycin D for various time points up to 8 h in the presence or absence of IL-17. To demonstrate that actinomycin D successfully inhibited mRNA synthesis, 24p3 mRNA levels were tested at 0 and 8 h in the presence or absence of drug (Fig. 1C, inset). As shown, the 24p3 message appears to be very stable, and IL-17 stimulation does not alter the degradation kinetics of 24p3 mRNA. In contrast, IL-17 signals do mediate stability of the LIX/CXCL5 message, consistent with our previous findings (Fig. 1C) (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-17 does not appear to control 24p3 mRNA degradation. To determine whether production of the 24p3 protein correlates with mRNA production, we tested 24p3 protein expression by Western blotting in ST2 cell lysates and conditioned media. As expected, 24p3 protein expression showed a similar profile to mRNA expression. Specifically, the 24p3 protein was induced after stimulation with IL-17 alone and IL-17 with TNFα (Fig. 1D). Because 24p3 is a secreted protein, we also tested its expression in cell supernatants. Although IL-17 treatment by itself did not trigger high levels of 24p3 secretion, IL-17 + TNFα stimulation did so. Thus, ST2 cells produce and secrete 24p3 in response to inflammatory cytokines. IL-17 Regulates the 24p3 Promoter via NF-κB and C/EBP—These results indicated that IL-17 regulates 24p3 at the level of transcription initiation. To define regulatory elements in the 24p3 proximal promoter responsive to IL-17, we subcloned 1.4 kb of genomic DNA upstream of the 24p3 transcriptional start site by PCR into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (19Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This putative promoter shows a 5–10-fold IL-17-inducible activity in all cell types tested (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a low dose of TNFα (2 ng/ml) stimulates 24p3 promoter activity only weakly (2-fold) (Fig"

https://openalex.org/W1964557069,"Organisms ranging from bacteria to humans synchronize their internal clocks to daily cycles of light and dark. Photic entrainment of the Drosophila clock is mediated by proteasomal degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). We have identified mutations in jetlag —a gene coding for an F-box protein with leucine-rich repeats—that result in reduced light sensitivity of the circadian clock. Mutant flies show rhythmic behavior in constant light, reduced phase shifts in response to light pulses, and reduced light-dependent degradation of TIM. Expression of JET along with the circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) in cultured S2R cells confers light-dependent degradation onto TIM, thereby reconstituting the acute response + of the circadian clock to light in a cell culture system. Our results suggest that JET is essential for resetting the clock by transmitting light signals from CRY to TIM."

We found that β-actin was arginylated in vivo to regulate actin filament properties, β-actin localization, and lamella formation in motile cells. Arginylation of β-actin apparently represents a critical step in the actin N-terminal processing needed for actin functioning in vivo. Thus, posttranslational arginylation of a single protein target can regulate its intracellular function, inducing global changes on the cellular level, and may contribute to cardiovascular development and angiogenesis."

Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognizes lipids, activates proinflammatory pathways, and is genetically associated with inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to examine the role of TLR2 in palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes. Treatment with palmitate rapidly induced the association of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) with the TLR2 receptor, activated the stress-linked kinases p38, JNK, and protein kinase C, induced degradation of IκBα, and increased NF-κB DNA binding. The activation of these pathways by palmitate was sensitive and temporally regulated and occurred within the upper physiologic range of saturated fatty acid concentrations in vivo, suggesting a receptor-mediated event and not simple lipotoxicity. When compared with an equimolar concentration of palmitate, fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1, a known TLR2 ligand, was a slightly more potent activator of signal transduction and interleukin (IL)-6 production. Palmitate inhibited insulin signal transduction in C2C12 cells beginning 1–2 h after exposure and reached a maximum at 12–16 h. An antagonist TLR2 antibody, mAb 2.5, led to a 50–60% decrease in palmitate-induced IL-6 production and partially restored insulin signal transduction, whereas an isotype-matched control antibody had no effect. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of TLR2 and MyD88 expression in C2C12 muscle cells resulted in a near complete inhibition of palmitate-induced insulin resistance and IL-6 production. This study provides strong evidence that TLR2 mediates the initial events of fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in muscle.

Insulin resistance is recognized as an important component of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (1Bray G.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2583-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The prevalence of this condition is increasing rapidly, and it is thought that the spread of the Western diet leading to obesity may be the cause. The mechanism(s) by which obesity couples to insulin resistance has only recently begun to be understood. Free fatty acids and triglycerides are elevated in obese individuals and animals, and they play a critical role in the etiology of the disease (2Boden G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2003; 111: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Much experimental evidence points to free fatty acids being a primary trigger of insulin resistance in both animal models and humans (3Liu R.H. Mizuta M. Kurose T. Matsukura S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2002; 26: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) 2The abbreviations used are: NEFA, non-esterified fatty acids; FSL-1, fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1; IκBα, inhibitor of κB binding α; IL-6, interleukin-6; JNK, c-Jun terminal kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa binding; PKC, protein kinase C; TLR, Tolllike receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin.2The abbreviations used are: NEFA, non-esterified fatty acids; FSL-1, fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1; IκBα, inhibitor of κB binding α; IL-6, interleukin-6; JNK, c-Jun terminal kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa binding; PKC, protein kinase C; TLR, Tolllike receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin. have been shown experimentally to directly affect insulin sensitivity in adipocytes, muscle, hepatocytes, pancreatic islets, and other non-traditional insulin-responsive cell types (for review, see Ref. 4Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 599-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). NEFA exposure leads to the activation of intracellular signaling via stress-related kinases such as p38, JNK, atypical PKCs, and others. Exposure to elevated NEFAs also caused an elevation in reactive oxygen species, activation of proinflammatory pathways such as the transcription factor NF-κB, the production of cytokines, and mitochondrial dysfunction. All of these observations have been correlated with the effects on the insulin receptor signal transduction pathway, leading to decreased activation of signal transduction events (tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 or phosphorylation of AKT) and Glut4 translocation, resulting in inhibited glucose uptake and utilization. However, many questions remained unanswered in this area.Recent research has focused on the role of the inflammatory signals observed during the development of insulin resistance (5Perseghin G. Petersen K. Shulman G.I. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As briefly mentioned before, NEFAs have been observed to activate inflammatory signal transduction and the production of cytokines in multiple cell types and have also been observed to be elevated before the development of the observed inflammatory signals in animals and humans (5Perseghin G. Petersen K. Shulman G.I. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Ajuwon K.M. Spurlock M.E. J.

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although several mechanisms have previously been proposed for NEFA-induced inflammatory signals, new research in the field on innate immunity has suggested that saturated fatty acids may serve as a ligand for several members of the Toll-like receptor family (9Lee J.Y. Plakidas A. Lee W.H. Heikkinen A. Chanmugam P. Bray G. Hwang D.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 10Lee J.Y. Zhao L. Youn H.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16971-16979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).There are at least 11 members of the Toll-like receptor family in humans and mice (11Takeda K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors are characterized by an extracellular ligand binding domain consisting of multiple leucine-rich repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that contains a highly conserved TollInteracting region (12Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the TLR receptor subunits associate, leading to the formation of a complex of Toll-interacting region domain containing adaptor proteins of the MyD88 family. Subsequent downstream signal transduction events lead to the activation of multiple members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, in some cell types atypical PKCs and eventually the activation of transcription factors including NF-κB, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factor, leading to the transcription of multiple proinflammatory cytokines (13Fan H. Cook J.A. J. Endotoxin Res. 2004; 10: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).The TLRs recognize a diverse repertoire of ligands. TLRs 2 and 4 are hypothesized to recognize components of the bacterial cell wall such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycans and lipopeptides, but also interact with a large number of other lipid containing molecules such as oxidized low density lipopeptide and endogenous proteins like heat shock protein 60 (for review, see Ref. 14Zuany-Amorim C. Hastewell J. Walker C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The critical component of lipopolysaccharide involved in stimulating activation of TLRs is the lipid A subunit, which is composed almost entirely of long-chain fatty acids. The specific fatty acid composition (triacyl or diacyl) appears to determine which receptor (TLR-2 or -4) is activated (15Muller S.D. Muller M.R. Huber M. Esche Uv U. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Bessler W.G. Mittenbuhler K. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2004; 4: 1287-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activation of these receptors on cells of the innate immune system leads to the production of cytokines, chemokines, and the up-regulation of cell surface molecules.Toll-like receptors are expressed in multiple tissues (16Muzio M. Polentarutti N. Bosisio D. Manoj Kumar P.P. Mantovani A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The predominant site of TLR expression is on cells of the innate immune system, especially macrophage/monocyte cells (for review, see Ref. 17Muzio M. Mantovani A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, TLRs, particularly TLR2 and -4 are found on a large number of other cells including adipose, muscle, and liver cells where they can activate signal transduction (18Netea M.G. van der Graaf C.

Interestingly, recent studies have shown a significantly higher frequency of polymorphisms in the TLR2 gene that seem to correlate to populations at higher risk of insulin resistance and diabetic-related disease (21Yim J.J.

The data suggest a novel hypothesis that TLRs, present in insulin-sensitive tissues and macrophage/monocyte cells, are activated by saturated NEFAs and induce proinflammatory pathways leading to NEFA-induced insulin resistance.This study investigates the ability of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, to activate the TLR2 receptor pathway in an insulinsensitive model, the C2C12 mouse myotube, and examines the contribution of this receptor pathway to the development of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in these cells. The results suggest that the TLR2 receptor mediates palmitate-induced insulin resistance in this model. These findings provide a rational basis for the development of inflammation and insulin resistance in response to elevations in fatty acids and a novel pharmacologic target to modulate the development of insulin resistance.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). All chemicals were obtained from SigmaAldrich. Antibodies to TLR2, monoclonal antibody 2.5, and MyD88 were obtained from Cell Sciences (Canton, MA). Antibodies to Ser(P)-473 AKT, phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2, phospho PKC, p38, JNK, IκBα, and E4F2a were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Palmitate in the free acid form was obtained from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). Insulin receptor antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Total PKC antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotech (Lake Placid, NY). Low endotoxin-fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was purchased from Sigma. ELISA kits for mouse IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). NF-κB ELISA kit was purchased from Active Motif (San Diego, CA). siRNA to TLR2 and MyD88 and control siRNA to glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Control siRNA) were purchased as predesigned siRNA from Ambion (Austin, TX). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Diagnostics.Preparation of Palmitate for Use in Experiments—The free fatty acid form of palmitate was dissolved in 100% ethanol to a final stock solution concentration of 75 mm. This solution was then added directly to media in subsequent experiments at the indicated doses by serially diluting this stock in ethanol as a vehicle, and then 10 μl of each solution (to maintain an exact concentration of ethanol) was directly added to cell culture media. Ethanol (vehicle) was added to all control samples. Treatments of cells were consistently made in 1 ml of cell culture media with the addition of 10 μl of palmitate/EtOH (1:100 dilution). Palmitate was used at final concentrations of 0.75 mm to 0.75 nm.Cell Culture and Differentiation—C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM (high glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate) with the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for growth at 370 ina5%CO2, humidified atmosphere. C2C12 cells were differentiated into mature myotubes by allowing them to reach confluence and then switching to differentiation media (DMEM, 10% horse serum) for 4 days for use in subsequent experiments.Induction of Insulin Resistance with Palmitate—Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were placed in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum with the addition of 0.75 μm palmitate for 0–24 h. Cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 2% NEFA-free BSA plus 0.75 μm NEFA for 3 h before treatment with insulin or control medium. All cells were, including controls, were cultured in the presence of NEFA-free BSA.Treatment with Monoclonal Antibody TLR 2.5 or Nonspecific IgG—Mature myotubes were treated as described above except that at the time of serum starvation 10 μg/ml concentrations of either nonspecific mouse IgG2a or monoclonal antibody TLR 2.5 were added to the culture media. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C before exposure to palmitate.siRNA Knockdown of TLR2 and MyD88—C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with 50 nm siRNA to either TLR2 or MyD88 purchased from Ambion using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer. The treated cells were immediately subjected to differentiation into mature myotubes as described above. Cells were then subjected to the treatments described under “Results” and in the legend to Fig. 5 and analyzed for TLR2 and MyD88 expression by Western blot.Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Mature myotubes were treated with palmitate as described above. At each time point cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in cell lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) containing 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates was cleared of debris by centrifugation, the protein was normalized using the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar), and normalized samples were utilized for immunoprecipitation or Western blot. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antiTLR2 antibody by using the Pierce seize primary mammalian immunoprecipitation kit. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were placed in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated via SDS-PAGE. The resulting Western blots were probed using the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C overnight then imaged by conjugation with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). All experiments were performed in triplicate with similar results.IL-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α ELISA—Cell culture supernatants from the 0.75 mm treated or 2% NEFA-free BSAtreated control C2C12 differentiated myotubes were harvested at times ranging from 30 min to 24 h. The 0-h treatment time represents media harvested at the conclusion of the experiment (24 h) from BSA-treated cells. Supernatants were stored at –70 and subsequently analyzed by ELISA as per manufacturer's instructions. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.NF-κB Activation ELISA—ELISA kits to detect activated NF-κB were purchased from Active Motif (San Diego, CA). Cells were treated for the indicated times with 0.75 mm palmitate, nuclear protein extracts were prepared using the technique described by the manufacturer, and the proteins were normalized and subjected to ELISA analysis.Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Densitometry was performed using an Epson 1610 Scanner and the associated software. Statistical analysis of the data resulting from ELISA experiments was analyzed using an analysis of variance test on STATAQUEST software package. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSPalmitate Treatment Activates TLR2 Signal Transduction in a Time-dependent Manner—A recent report indicated that saturated fatty acids activate TLR2/6 heterodimers when overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (9Lee J.Y.

We chose to utilize the well characterized insulin-sensitive C2C12 mouse myotube model to investigate the effect of palmitate treatment on TLR activation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, we examined the time-dependent association of the adaptor protein MyD88 with the TLR2 receptor after exposure to 0.75 mm palmitate, a concentration of palmitate that has been published previously to induce insulin resistance in this model. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1A, MyD88·TLR2 complexes are detected within 15 min of palmitate exposure and persisted for up to 8 h. A slight increase in the absolute protein level of TLR2 is detectable after 15 min of exposure to palmitate, but this increase is does not continue (middle panel) and MyD88 protein (lower panel) levels do not change throughout the duration of this experiment, indicating that the observed association is most probably due to activation of the receptor pathway and not a significant increase in protein expression.FIGURE 1Palmitate treatment temporally activates TLR-related signal transduction pathways in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 myoblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM (high glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum, differentiated in DMEM (high glucose) containing 10% horse serum, then cultured in NEFA-free media (DMEM, high glucose) with the addition of 2% NEFA-free BSA before exposure to 750 μm palmitate for the times indicated. A, at each time point indicated cellular protein was harvested, and protein was normalized and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-TLR 2.5 monoclonal antibody. The subsequent precipitates were separated using SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted (IB) to determine whether there was association of the MyD88 adaptor protein with the receptor as indicated. B, C2C12 myotubes were exposed to 750 μm (0.75 mm) palmitate as indicated, and cellular protein was analyzed by Western for the activation of p38 (upper panel), PKC (middle panel), and JNK (lower panel) kinases using phospho-specific antibodies. C, lysates were analyzed by Western for the presence of IκBα to analyze the activation of the NF-κB pathway (upper) or for protein loading using E4F2a (lower panel). D, nuclear protein was isolated from C2C12 myotubes treated for the indicated times with palmitate and analyzed using a commercially available ELISA kit for the DNA binding/activation state of NF-κB. E, cell culture supernatant was harvested from C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate for the indicated times and analyzed for IL-6 production. All blots represent three independent experiments and for IL-6 production (n = 9, control versus treated (*, p < 0.01). p-JNK, phosphorylated JNK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the activation of several downstream components of the TLR2 signal transduction pathway, the stress-linked kinases p38, JNK, and PKC and the NF-κB pathway. As shown in Fig. 1B, p38 and JNK (top and bottom blots, respectively) are rapidly phosphorylated (3 min) in response to palmitate treatment in C2C12 cells with no change in total protein mass. PKC has been suggested to be activated by palmitate in several models, and a pan phosphor-PKC antibody indicated that PKC was weakly phosphorylated after ∼5 min of palmitate exposure (middle panel, Fig. 1B). It is possible that the specific PKC isoform previously suggested to be activated is not recognized by the pan-PKC antibody or that it is activated after longer term exposure to palmitate. Additionally, the upper panel of Fig. 1C illustrates that palmitate induced the degradation of IκBα, an NF-κB inhibitor, within 30 min, and it decreased to near undetectable levels by 12–24 h. These changes were not associated with changes in protein levels (Fig. 1C, lower panel).Finally, we analyzed NF-κB DNA binding activity and observed a significant increase in NF-κB DNA binding 1 h after palmitate treatment (Fig. 2D). This activity reached a maximum at 2 h but remained detectable until 8 h, similar to previously published reports (28Sinha S. Perdomo G. Brown N.F. O'Doherty R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41294-41301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the TLR2 signal transduction pathway is rapidly activated in response to palmitate treatment in C2C12 myotubes, possibly leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (13Fan H. Cook J.A. J. Endotoxin Res. 2004; 10: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Palmitate dose-dependently actives signal transduction in C2C12 myotubes. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were exposed to palmitate at concentrations ranging from 0 to 75 μm for 10 min. At this time cellular protein was harvested, and protein was normalized for use in immunoprecipitation (IP; A) of TLR2 receptor analysis of intracellular signal transduction (JNK phosphorylation (upper panel) or degradation of IκBα (lower panel) by Western blot (B). All data represent at least three independent experiments. p-JNK, phosphorylated JNK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous reports have indicated that treatment of human myotubes or the L6 muscle cell line with palmitate resulted in the production of IL-6 (28Sinha S.

Machicao F. Haring H.U. Schleicher E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23942-23952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether palmitate treatment induced a similar increase in IL-6 production from C2C12 mouse myotubes. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes for 2 h resulted in an increase in IL-6 secretion (Fig. 1B) from near undetectable levels to ∼20 pg/ml, correlating with the onset of significant NF-κB activation. IL-6 production continued to increase in the presence of palmitate and reached a maximum of 200–300 pg/ml after 24 h. We also investigated the production of tumor necrosis factor-α but found no significant tumor necrosis factor-α production induced by palmitate over the time course observed (data not shown). After exposure to 0.75 mm palmitate for 24 h no significant toxicity was observed.Palmitate Dose-dependently Activates TLR2 Signal Transduction in C2C12 Myotubes—To investigate whether the activation of TLR2-related signaling events in response to palmitate was due to exposure to toxic or “pharmacologic” doses of palmitate, we treated C2C12 myotubes with multiple doses of palmitate ranging from 0.75 nm to 0.75 mm. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with doses of palmitate as low as 0.75 nm were capable of inducing a weak but detectable association of TLR2 and its adaptor protein, which increased in abundance with increasing palmitate concentration, reaching a maximum at 0.75 μm as detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This occurred with no change in the absolute level of MyD88 protein or TLR2 receptor mass (lower panel and data not shown). A phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and a degradation of the IκBα protein (Fig. 2B, middle panel) were also observed after treatment with 75 nm to 75 μm palmitate with no change in total protein levels (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The activation of these specific pathways occurs relatively dose-responsively, reaching a maximum level of activation and stabilizing. This experiment suggested that palmitate was capable of activating the TLR2 pathway at concentrations which could be found in vivo.FSL-1, a Known TLR2:6 Ligand, Activates a Similar TLR2related Pathway in C2C12 Myotubes at Concentrations Comparable with Palmitate—FSL-1 is a synthetic ligand similar to the known TLR2 lipoprotein ligand macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2. We examined if FSL-1 was capable of activating TLR2 signal transduction in C2C12 myotubes and compared this activation with that observed for palmitate. FSL-1 rapidly (10 min) and dose-dependently induced association of TLR2 with its adaptor protein MyD88 at concentrations of 1 nm and increased steadily to a maximum at 10 μm FSL-1 (Fig. 3A, upper panel). This association occurred with no detectable changes in TLR2 mass (Fig. 3A, lower panel).FIGURE 3Comparison of the potency of FSL-1 (known TLR2 ligand) versus palmitate to activate TLR2 signal transduction. C2C12 myotubes were treated with FSL-1, a potent TLR2 agonist, at concentrations of 0–7.5 μm for 10 min. At this point cellular protein was harvested and normalized. A, association of MyD88 with the TLR2 receptor after treatment with FLS-1 by immunoprecipitation (IP) as described in Fig. 1. B, phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK; upper panel), p38 (middle panel), and the degradation of IκBα (lower panel) were measured by Western blot (WB) from the cellular lysates described. C2C12 myotubes were treated with 0.75 μm FSL-1 or palmitate to analyze the relative potency of these ligands to activate TLR2 signal transduction. C, comparison of FSL-1 (0.75 μm) and palmitate (0.75 μm) induced association of TLR2 with MyD88. D, comparison of FSL and palmitate induced JNK (upper) and p38 (middle) phosphorylation or IκBα degradation (lower). Total protein levels were also measured but not shown.

The binding and release of iron result in a large conformational change in which two subdomains in each lobe close or open with a rigid twisting motion around a hinge. We report the structure of human serum transferrin (hTF) lacking iron (apo-hTF), which was independently determined by two methods: 1) the crystal structure of recombinant non-glycosylated apo-hTF was solved at 2.7-Å resolution using a multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing strategy, by substituting the nine methionines in hTF with selenomethionine and 2) the structure of glycosylated apo-hTF (isolated from serum) was determined to a resolution of 2.7Å by molecular replacement using the human apo-N-lobe and the rabbit holo-C1-subdomain as search models. These two crystal structures are essentially identical. They represent the first published model for full-length human transferrin and reveal that, in contrast to family members (human lactoferrin and hen ovotransferrin), both lobes are almost equally open: 59.4° and 49.5° rotations are required to open the N- and C-lobes, respectively (compared with closed pig TF). Availability of this structure is critical to a complete understanding of the metal binding properties of each lobe of hTF; the apo-hTF structure suggests that differences in the hinge regions of the N- and C-lobes may influence the rates of iron binding and release. In addition, we evaluate potential interactions between apo-hTF and the human transferrin receptor.

In addition, we evaluate potential interactions between apo-hTF and the human transferrin receptor. The transferrins are a family of bilobal iron-binding proteins that play the crucial role of binding ferric iron and keeping it in solution, thereby controlling the levels of this important metal in the body (1Harris D.C.

The entire hTF ·TFR complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis culminating in iron release within the endosome (3Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. van Renswoude J. Harford J.B. Bridges K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2263-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Essential to the re-utilization of hTF, iron-free hTF (apo-hTF) remains bound to the TFR at low pH. When the apo-hTF ·TFR complex is returned to the cell surface, apo-hTF is released to acquire more iron. Strong homologies exist, both between TF family members, and between the two lobes of any given TF (4Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 5Lambert L.A. Perri H. Meehan T.J. Comp. Biochem Physiol. B. 2005; 140: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Each N- and C-lobe is divided into two subdomains (designated N1 and N2, and C1 and C2) connected by a hinge that gives rise to a deep cleft containing the iron-binding ligands. Iron is coordinated by four highly conserved amino acid residues: an aspartic acid (the sole ligand from the N1- or C1-subdomain), a tyrosine in the hinge at the edge of the N2- or C2-subdomain, a second tyrosine within the N2- or C2-subdomain, and a histidine at the hinge bordering the N1- or C1-subdomain. In addition, the iron atom is bound by two oxygen atoms from the synergistic anion (carbonate), which is itself stabilized by a conserved arginine residue (6Lambert L.A. Perri H. Halbrooks P.J. Mason A.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2005; 142: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A key feature of iron binding and release by TF family members is the large conformational change involving not only opening of the two subdomains in each lobe but also a twist between the N1- and N2-, or C1- and C2-subdomains (7Kurokawa H.

Although the N- and C-lobes of hTF share 56% sequence similarity, many studies show that the rate of iron release from the C-lobe is considerably slower than the rate of release from the N-lobe, particularly at the putative endosomal pH of ∼5.6 (9Princiotto J.V.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8013-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At least some of the difference is attributed to the presence of a “dilysine trigger” in the N-lobe, which is replaced by a triad of residues in the C-lobe (14Halbrooks P.J. He Q.Y. Briggs S.K.

The dilysine trigger is composed of Lys206 in the N2-subdomain and Lys296 in the N1-subdomain, which reside on opposite sides of the iron binding cleft and are oriented with side chains extending toward one another allowing them to share a hydrogen bond in the iron-bound (closed) conformation (16Dewan J.C.

In the C-lobe, a triad of residues (Lys534 in the C2-subdomain, Arg632 and Asp634 in the C1-subdomain) replaces the lysine pair (14Halbrooks P.J. He Q.Y. Briggs S.K. Everse S.J. Smith V.C.

The release of iron from hTF depends upon a number of factors, including pH, a chelator (physiologically relevant chelators include citrate, pyrophosphate, and ATP), and ionic strength, as well as the specific TFR (19He Q.-Y.

A 7.5-Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) model of diferric hTF bound to TFR was created by docking a human TF N-lobe structure and a rabbit TF C-lobe structure into the electron density map of the complex (because there is no full-length human TF structure available) (23Cheng Y. Zak O. Aisen P. Harrison S.C. Walz T. Cell. 2004; 116: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This model offers a preliminary view of the regions of hTF and TFR that interact; it is suggested that both the N1- and N2-subdomains of the hTF N-lobe contact the TFR, whereas only the C1-subdomain of the hTF C-lobe appears to be involved in the interaction. Interestingly, a translation of ∼9 Å of the ferric N-lobe (relative to the ferric C-lobe) is required to dock the two lobes into the cryo-EM density. Of relevance, at pH 7.4, the TFR discriminates between diferric, the two monoferric species, and apo-hTF, although the basis of this discrimination has not been explained (24Young S.P. Bomford A. Williams R. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Mason A.B. He Q.-Y. Tam B.M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12512-12520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Significantly, our studies with authentic monoferric hTF constructs established that each lobe contributes equally (and non-additively) to the binding energy of this interaction with the TFR (15Mason A.B. Halbrooks P.J. James N.G. Connolly S.A. Larouche J.R. Smith V.C. MacGillivray R.T.A. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8013-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Clearly a structure of apo-hTF is required to determine whether a change in orientation of the two lobes could provide both a rationale for discrimination and further insight into the receptor interaction. Here we report the structure of full-length apo-hTF that has been independently determined by two methods; both a nonglycosylated recombinant form of hTF (pH 6.5) and a glycosylated native form of hTF (pH 7.0) were solved to a resolution of 2.7 Å. These two structures, which are identical within the limits of the resolution, find both the N- and C-lobes in the open conformation. This work represents the first mammalian TF structure with an apo-C-lobe, the first published structure of full-length hTF, and the first report of a baby hamster kidney expression system to substitute the methionine residues in hTF with selenomethionine (SeMet). The apo-hTF structure allows comparisons to other relevant structures, including those for diferric pig (2.15 Å, 72% identical) and rabbit TF (2.6 Å, 79% identical) (27Hall D.R. Hadden J.M. Leonard G.A. Bailey S. Neu M. Winn M. Lindley P.F. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and an unpublished model for an unrefined monoferric hTF with iron in the C-lobe (3.3 Å) (28Zuccola H.J. The Crystal Structure of Monoferric Human Serum Transferrin. Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA1993Google Scholar). Production of hTF-NG—To produce recombinant non-glycosylated hTF (hTF-NG) with SeMet substituted for methionine, baby hamster kidney cells transfected with the pNUT plasmid containing the sequence of the N-His-tagged hTF-NG were placed into four expanded surface roller bottles (13Mason A.B. He Q.Y. Halbrooks P.J. Everse S.J. Gumerov D.R. Kaltashov I.A. Smith V.C. Hewitt J. MacGillivray R.T.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9448-9454Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Addition of culture media containing SeMet results in a significant deterioration of the cells within 24-48 h. To maximize the incorporation, medium containing SeMet was added when production of hTF was at a maximum as determined by a competitive immunoassay (29Mason A.B. He Q.-Y. Adams T.E. Gumerov D.R. Kaltashov I.A. Nguyen V. MacGillivray R.T.A. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 23: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent baby hamster kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. This medium was changed twice at 2-day intervals, followed by addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 1% Ultroser G and 1 mm butyric acid. After one or two changes in this medium, 200 ml of SeMet containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (lacking normal methionine), with butyric acid and Ultroser G was added to each roller bottle. Following a 4-h wash-in period this media was discarded and replaced with 250 ml of the same medium for an additional 48 h of incubation. The recombinant hTF-NG was purified from the medium as described in detail (30Mason A.B. Halbrooks P.J. Larouche J.R. Briggs S.K. Moffett M.L. Ramsey J.E. Connolly S.A. Smith V.C. MacGillivray R.T.A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 36: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In two production runs between 8 and 16 mg of SeMet containing N-His hTF-NG was produced, of which approximately half was recovered. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis indicated a mass consistent with incorporation of 8-9 SeMet residues (data not shown). Purification of Apo-hTF-Gly—In independent experiments, lyophilized human serum TF lacking iron (apo-hTF-Gly) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and reconstituted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm sodium carbonate at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. The protein was applied to a 10-ml Q-Sepharose High Performance column (GE HealthCare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm sodium carbonate. The apo-hTF was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 150 mm NaCl over 3 column volumes. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm sodium carbonate, and 200 mm sodium chloride. Crystallization—Recombinant diferric hTF-NG (with or without a His tag) at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution composed of 0.3 m ammonium citrate (pH 6.5) and 16-18% PEG 3350 at 20 °C. The SeMet N-His hTF-NG required slightly lower levels of PEG 3350 and streak seeding using the non-SeMet labeled hTF-NG crystals. Clear crystals (0.2 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.4 mm) formed in 3-5 weeks. Crystals of the SeMet-labeled protein were essentially isomorphous with those of the native protein, showing similar cell dimensions and crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). All crystals were cryoprotected by addition to the hanging drop of 0.5 μl of a solution of 25% PEG 3350/30% ethylene glycol.TABLE 1Data collection, crystallographic refinement, and model statisticsProteinNative 1 hTF-GlyNative 2 hTF-NGInflection hTF-NGPeak hTF-NGRemote hTF-NGCell parametersSpace groupP212121P212121P212121P212121P212121a, b, c (Å)88.3288.9988.4988.2888.47103.26102.16103.35103.39103.55200.36197.04199.17198.94198.38Data collection statisticsLocationAPSChess A1BNLBNLBNL22IDBNL X26X25X26CX26CWavelength (Å)1.00000.935, 1.1000.97940.97900.9641Resolution range (Å)30-2.750-2.750-2.925-3.250-3.3Unique reflections49,87147,96837,49831,12428,343Completeness (%)96.7 (90.5)95.9 (83.6)99.9 (98.9)99.4 (93.8)100 (99.9)Redundancy6.6 (6.5)6.0 (4.5)6.0 (5.3)7.1 (6.5)7.3 (7.5)Rmerge (%)aRmerge = ΣΣI(h)j - <I(h)>/ΣI(h), where I(h)j is the jth measurement of diffraction intensity of reflection h, and <I(h)> is the average intensity of reflection h for all j measurements.6.87.18.211.612.7I/σ22.8 (2.0)41.0 (5.3)12.6 (0.9)23.6 (3.4)22.8 (4.0)DetectorMar300Q210 Q4Q315Q4Q4Integration softwareHKL2000HKL v1.98.2HKL2000HKL2000HKL2000Molecular replacementSearch models1A8E (N-lobe)1H76 (C-lobe)MAD phasesFigure of merit (FOM)100-2.9 ÅAcentrics0.41Centrics0.38Density-mod. mean FOM0.80Model statisticsResolution (Å)15-2.715-2.7RworkbRwork = Σ(|Fo| - |Fc|)/Σ|Fo|.23.227.3RfreecRfree is calculated using a test set of 5% of the reflection excluded from refinement.29.332.3Refined modelNo. amino acid residues1,3521,352No. citrate molecules74No. glycerol molecules42No. atoms, non-hydrogenProtein10,48610,488Ligand11564r.m.s. deviation, bonds (Å)0.0090.009r.m.s. deviation, angles (°)1.571.33Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored regions77.078.2Additionally allowed20.619.4Generously allowed1.91.9Disallowed regions0.50.5Average B factor (Å2)75.267.4Range of B factors (Å2)32-12514-135a Rmerge = ΣΣI(h)j - <I(h)>/ΣI(h), where I(h)j is the jth measurement of diffraction intensity of reflection h, and <I(h)> is the average intensity of reflection h for all j measurements.b Rwork = Σ(|Fo| - |Fc|)/Σ|Fo|.c Rfree is calculated using a test set of 5% of the reflection excluded from refinement. Open table in a new tab Native apo-hTF-Gly was concentrated in a Centriprep 30 concentrator (Millipore) to 30 mg/ml and screened against commercially available 96-condition screens using a Mosquito crystallization robot (TTP Labtech) with a hanging drop format (drop size, 200 nl of protein plus 200-nl well solution). Conditions yielding the best crystals were then further refined using 24-well VDX plates (Hampton Research). The crystals used for native data collection were obtained from hanging drops with a well solution of 0.2 m ammonium citrate, pH 7.0, 20% PEG 3350, and 15% glycerol, incubated at 21 °C. Drop sizes varied from 2to 16 μl and consisted of equal parts of protein and well solution. Crystals grew in ∼24 h and were flash frozen in propane cooled to -170 °C. Data Collection and Refinement—For the apo-hTF-NG crystals that contained SeMet, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected at -170 °C on beamlines X26C (peak and remote) and X25 (inflection) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The data were reduced, scaled, and merged using DENZO/SCALEPACK (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) (Table 1). To find the selenium sites, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data were prepared with XPREP and analyzed with ShelxD (32Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). The data sets were combined, and refinement of the selenium sites was carried out using autoSHARP (33La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 34Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Doublie S. Crystallographic Methods. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2006: 215-230Google Scholar). Profess (35Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar) was used to find NCS, which revealed two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Following a round of density modification, the structure of apo-hTF N-lobe (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1BP5) was used as a search model for a phased translation and rotation function using MOLREP (36Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta. Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Subsequent model building of the C-lobe was done using O (37Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) in a stepwise manner by incorporating fragments of pig holo-TF (converted to the human sequence). Iterative rounds of density modification and phase recombination were performed with SOLOMON (38Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Refinement was accomplished using both CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (35Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Native diffraction data from an apo-hTF-Gly crystal were collected at the Advanced Photon Source on SER-CAT beamline 22ID at -170 °C. The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2B1B2B1B2B1B, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 59.3%. The images were reduced, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) (Table 1), and the structure was solved using the molecular replacement program Phaser (41McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). A search model consisting of the human apo-N-lobe structure (1BP5) and the rabbit holo-C1-subdomain (residues 342-424 and 579-676 from 1JNF) was used, leading to a single solution containing two copies of each component. After a single round of rigid body refinement using the program REFMAC (35Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar, 40Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar) the rabbit C2-subdomain was fit into the electron density. The C1- and C2-subdomains were then mutated to the human sequence, and the linker regions between the N- and C-lobes and between the C1- and C2-subdomains were built into the electron density. This structure was further refined with REFMAC using medium NCS restraints initially, followed by release of NCS restraints. After building in the glycerol and citrate molecules, final rounds of refinement were performed in CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar). Comparison of (Recombinant) Apo-hTF-NG and (Native) Apo-hTF-Gly—Both protein preparations crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121, having almost identical unit cell dimensions and two molecules per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The recombinant and native structures had an r.m.s. deviation of only 0.73 Å for 1352 equivalent CPαP positions, and therefore we are, for the most part, presenting and discussing them as a single structure (apo-hTF). As in all other serum TF structures, no electron density for residues 1-3 is visible. Even the His-tagged recombinant apo-hTF-NG, with 14 extra amino acids at the N terminus, showed no density in this region, implying that the amino terminus is very flexible. Additionally, no density is found in the vicinity of Asn413 and Asn611 in the native apo-hTF-Gly, indicating that the glycan moieties are flexible and/or present in multiple conformations. Clearly our recombinant hTF lacks carbohydrate due to the mutation of the asparagine linkage sites to aspartic acid residues. Significantly, the presence or absence of carbohydrate has no effect on either iron release or interaction with the TFR (42Mason A.B. Miller M.K. Funk W.D. Banfield D.K. Savage K.J. Oliver R.W.A. Green B.N. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43Gumerov D.R. Mason A.B. Kaltashov I.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5421-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Quality of Final Model—Data collection, refinement, and model statistics are summarized in Table 1. No breaks in the main-chain density were observed in apo-hTF and, as shown in Table 1, the geometry is good. The Ramachandran plot of the mainchain torsion angles shows that 97.6% of the residues lie in most favored or allowed regions and that only 6 of the 1352 residues of the two non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecules reside in the disallowed region. Four of these residues are Leu294 and Leu630 in each of the molecules, comprising the central residues in classic γ-turns (Leu-Leu-Phe) with phi and psi angles of ∼77° and -46°, respectively (44Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). This structural feature was first noted in the hTF N-lobe (45MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y.G. Bewley M. Smith C.A. Murphy M.E. Wang Y. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brayer G.D. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and subsequently has been observed in each lobe of all mammalian and avian TF molecules and in the C-lobe of all fish TFs (5Lambert L.A. Perri H. Meehan T.J. Comp. Biochem Physiol. B. 2005; 140: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Lambert L.A. Perri H. Halbrooks P.J. Mason A.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2005; 142: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Leu-Leu-Phe sequence is not conserved in any insect TF N-lobe and is only partially conserved in the insect C-lobe sequences (5Lambert L.A. Perri H. Meehan T.J. Comp. Biochem Physiol. B. 2005; 140: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Lambert L.A. Perri H. Halbrooks P.J. Mason A.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2005; 142: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, because the function of insect TF remains unknown, the importance of this finding is unclear. Although the role of the γ-turn in mammalian TFs has not been definitively established, we believe that it is significant that it immediately precedes the dilysine trigger residue Lys296 in the N-lobe and triad residue Arg632 in the C-lobe (45MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y.G. Bewley M. Smith C.A. Murphy M.E. Wang Y. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brayer G.D. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Within this context, the γ-turn may help to stabilize the orientation of these two residues to provide better repulsion or a triggering action, aiding in opening of the cleft. Overall Organization—As with all TF family members, the structure of hTF illustrates the bilobal nature of the molecule (Fig. 1) with an amino-terminal lobe (N-lobe, residues 1-331) and a carboxyl-terminal lobe (C-lobe, residues 339-679). The lobes are connected by a linker peptide (residues 332-338) that is unstructured, but visible in our model (although missing in the diferric pig TF structure (27Hall D.R. Hadden J.M. Leonard G.A. Bailey S. Neu M. Winn M. Lindley P.F. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)). Each of the lobes is further separated into two subdomains: the N1-(1-92 and 247-331) and C1-(339-425 and 573-679) subdomains are each composed of two discontinuous sections of the polypeptide chain, whereas the N2-(93-246) and C2-(426-572) subdomains are each composed of a single region of continuous polypeptide (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. S1).

https://openalex.org/W1982571441,"Melanin plays an important role in protecting the skin against UV radiation, and melanomas and basal/squamous cell carcinomas occur more frequently in individuals with fair/light skin. We previously reported that levels of melanin correlate inversely with amounts of DNA damage induced by UV in normal human skin of different racial/ethnic groups. We have now separately examined DNA damage in the upper and lower epidermal layers in various types of skin before and after exposure to UV and have measured subsequent apoptosis and phosphorylation of p53. The results show that two major mechanisms underlie the increased photocarcinogenesis in fair/light skin. First, UV-induced DNA damage in the lower epidermis (including keratinocyte stem cells and melanocytes) is more effectively prevented in darker skin, suggesting that the pigmented epidermis is an efficient UV filter. Second, UV-induced apoptosis is significantly greater in darker skin, which suggests that UV-damaged cells may be removed more efficiently in pigmented epidermis. The combination of decreased DNA damage and more efficient removal of UV-damaged cells may play a critical role in the decreased photocarcinogenesis seen in individuals with darker skin."
https://openalex.org/W2125373960,"Melatonin, which can be produced in the skin, exerts a protective effect against damage induced by UV radiation (UVR). We have investigated the effect of UVB, the most damaging component of UVR, on melatonin metabolism in HaCaT keratinocytes and in a cell-free system. Four metabolites were identified by HPLC and LC-MS: 6-hydroxymelatonin, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), 2-hydroxymelatonin (the main intermediate between melatonin and AFMK), and 4-hydroxymelatonin. Concentrations of these photoproducts were directly proportional to UVR-dose and to melatonin substrate content, and their accumulation was time-dependent. The UVR-dependent increase of AFMK and 2-hydroxymelatonin was also detected in keratinocytes, where it was accompanied by simultaneous consumption of intracellular melatonin. Of note, melatonin and its two major metabolites, 2-hydroxymelatonin and AFMK, were also detected in untreated keratinocytes, neither irradiated nor preincubated with melatonin. Thus, intracellular melatonin metabolism is enhanced under exposure to UVR. The additional biological activity of these individual melatonin metabolites increases the spectrum of potential actions of the recently identified cutaneous melatoninergic system."
https://openalex.org/W2157691027,"Cells/organs must respond both rapidly and appropriately to increased fatty acid availability; failure to do so is associated with the development of skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin resistance, pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, and myocardial contractile dysfunction. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intrinsic circadian clock within the cardiomyocytes of the heart allows rapid and appropriate adaptation of this organ to fatty acids by investigating the following: 1) whether circadian rhythms in fatty acid responsiveness persist in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes, and 2) whether manipulation of the circadian clock within the heart, either through light/dark (L/D) cycle or genetic disruptions, impairs responsiveness of the heart to fasting in vivo. We report that both the intramyocellular circadian clock and diurnal variations in fatty acid responsiveness observed in the intact rat heart in vivo persist in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Reversal of the 12-h/12-h L/D cycle was associated with a re-entrainment of the circadian clock within the rat heart, which required 5-8 days for completion. Fasting rats resulted in the induction of fatty acid-responsive genes, an effect that was dramatically attenuated 2 days after L/D cycle reversal. Similarly, a targeted disruption of the circadian clock within the heart, through overexpression of a dominant negative CLOCK mutant, severely attenuated induction of myocardial fatty acid-responsive genes during fasting. These studies expose a causal relationship between the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte with responsiveness of the heart to fatty acids and myocardial triglyceride metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2134675152,"Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP-1) is an EF-hand protein that activates retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in photoreceptors at low free Ca2+ in the light and inhibits it in the dark when Ca2+ concentrations rise. We present the first direct evidence that Mg2+-bound form of GCAP-1, not its cation-free form, is the true activator of RetGC-1 under physiological conditions. Of four EF-hand structures in GCAP-1, three bound Ca2+ ions and could exchange Ca2+ for Mg2+. At concentrations of free Ca2+ and Mg2+ typical for the light-adapted photoreceptors, all three metal-binding EF-hands were predominantly occupied by Mg2, and the presence of bound Mg2+ in GCAP-1 was essential for its ability to stimulate RetGC-1. In the Mg2+-bound form of GCAP-1 all three Trp residues became more exposed to the polar environment compared with its apo form. The replacement of Mg2+ by Ca2+ in the EF-hands 2 and 3 further exposed Trp-21 to the solution in a non-metal-binding EF-hand domain 1 that interacts with RetGC. Contrary to that, replacement of Mg2+ by Ca2+ in the EF-hand 4 moved Trp-94 in the entering α-helix of the EF-hand 3 back to the non-polar environment. Our results demonstrate that Mg2+ regulates GCAP-1 not only by adjusting its Ca2+ sensitivity to the physiological conditions in photoreceptors but also by creating the conformation required for RetGC stimulation. Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP-1) is an EF-hand protein that activates retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in photoreceptors at low free Ca2+ in the light and inhibits it in the dark when Ca2+ concentrations rise.

Contrary to that, replacement of Mg2+ by Ca2+ in the EF-hand 4 moved Trp-94 in the entering α-helix of the EF-hand 3 back to the non-polar environment. Our results demonstrate that Mg2+ regulates GCAP-1 not only by adjusting its Ca2+ sensitivity to the physiological conditions in photoreceptors but also by creating the conformation required for RetGC stimulation. In this study, we continue to develop a concept for the processes through which Ca2+ sensor proteins, GCAPs, 2The abbreviations used are: GCAP, guanylyl cyclase-activating protein; RetGC, retinal guanylyl cyclase; [Ca2+]f, free Ca2+ concentration; [Mg2+]f, free Mg2+ concentration; MOPS, 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; [Ca2+], ½ free Ca 2+ concentration required for half-maximal effect; [Mg2+], ½ free Mg 2+ concentration required for half-maximal effect. 2The abbreviations used are: GCAP, guanylyl cyclase-activating protein; RetGC, retinal guanylyl cyclase; [Ca2+]f, free Ca2+ concentration; [Mg2+]f, free Mg2+ concentration; MOPS, 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; [Ca2+], ½ free Ca 2+ concentration required for half-maximal effect; [Mg2+], ½ free Mg 2+ concentration required for half-maximal effect. regulate their target enzyme, retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC), in photosensitive neurons of the retina between light and dark. In dark-adapted photoreceptors, cGMP keeps a fraction of cGMP-gated channels open, thus allowing Na+ and Ca2+ to enter the outer segment (1Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ is continuously removed from the outer segments by a light-independent Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger, when the light closes the channels by stimulating cGMP hydrolysis, the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ decreases from near 250 nm in the dark to 25 nm in the light (3Woodruff M.L.

Despite the popular view that the cyclase activity is regulated by merely binding and release of Ca2+ by the apo form of GCAPs, our recent findings indicate that mutual displacement of two competing cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, defines the dynamic range of RetGC regulation in vivo (13Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GCAPs are recoverin-like neuronal calcium sensor proteins within the EF-hand superfamily (14Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Like other recoverin-like proteins, GCAPs have four EF-hand domains, but based on their amino acid sequence only three of them are capable of binding metal ion. Although the general model of regulation requires that Ca2+ be either bound or released by GCAPs, little is known about the actual Ca2+ binding properties of individual GCAPs under physiologically relevant conditions or the actual conformational change in GCAPs that constitutes switching them between the activator and the inhibitor forms. A number of previous studies aimed to identify conformational changes in GCAP-1 between its activator and inhibitor forms using limited proteolysis (16Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D.

Our recent finding demonstrated that Mg2+ is essential for adjusting the Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation by GCAPs to the actual physiological range of free Ca2+ concentrations and provided the first evidence that GCAPs are both Ca2+ and Mg2+ sensor proteins (5Olshevskaya E.V. Calvert P.D. Woodruff M.L. Peshenko I.V. Savchenko A.B. Makino C.L. Ho Y.S. Fain G.L. Dizhoor A.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6078-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Peshenko I.V.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13796-13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) thus raising the possibility that at physiological free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the light at least one of the EF-hands in GCAP-1 is in a Mg2+-bound, rather than metalfree, state. Importantly binding of Mg2+ changes the intensity of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of GCAP-1, and that implies that a significant structural difference exists between the Mg2+-bound and the metal-free GCAP-1 (13Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding properties of GCAP-1 using two independent methods and a wide range of mutations introduced in its EF-hand domains. We found the following. (i) At the physiological concentrations of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ that exist in the vertebrate photoreceptors in the light (3Woodruff M.L. Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Krasnoperova N.V. Lem J. Fain G.L. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Chen C. Nakatani K. Koutalos Y. J.

Physiol. 1999; 113: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), three EF-hands in GCAP-1 are predominantly occupied with Mg2+ ions; hence the physiological RetGC-activating form of GCAP-1 is triple Mg2+-bound form. (ii) The same three EF-hands in purified GCAP-1 also bind Ca2+ in a non-cooperative manner. (iii) Binding of Mg2+ in three metal-binding EF-hands causes significant structural changes in EF1 domain, an EF-hand-like structure that cannot bind metal ions but is required for interaction of GCAPs with RetGC. (iv) Inactivation of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding in three EF-hands renders GCAP-1 incapable of activating RetGC. Contrary to the common perception of GCAPs being activators of RetGC in their apo form, we also present the first direct evidence that the Mg2+-bound GCAP-1 is required for activation of the target enzyme. We conclude in this report that the regulation of the target enzyme by GCAP-1 is a result of Mg2+/Ca2+ exchange in the EF-hands rather then simply binding and release of Ca2+ ions by the apo form of GCAP. Recombinant GCAP-1 and Its Mutants—All mutations were incorporated into bovine GCAP-1 cDNA by PCR using a “splicing by overlap extension” technique (25Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). Wild-type GCAP-1 and its mutants used in this study also carried a D6S substitution that creates a recognition site for the yeast N-myristoyltransferase (26Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not interfere with the RetGC regulation by the recombinant GCAP-1 (27Dizhoor A.M.

GCAP-1 cDNA was inserted into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the pET11d vector (Novagen/Calbiochem) and expressed under control of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-regulated T7 promoter in a BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain (Novagen/Calbiochem) harboring a pBB131 plasmid for N-myristoyltransferase expression as described previously (27Dizhoor A.M. Boikov S.G. Olshevskaya E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17311-17314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells were typically grown in 3.0 liters of standard LB medium containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Free myristic acid was added from a concentrated ethanol solution to the suspension of bacterial cells to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml 30 min prior to the induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours after the induction, the bacterial pellet was harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cells were disrupted by ultrasonication. The expressed GCAP-1 and its mutants were always found in the insoluble fraction of the inclusion bodies. The insoluble material was washed twice with 50 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2mm EDTA and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. GCAP-1 was extracted from the pellet by homogenization in buffer A containing 8 m freshly deionized urea for 30 min at 4 °C and dialyzed twice against 2.0 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The concentration of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) in the supernatant was increased to 40 mm, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, the solution was then incubated on ice for 20 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was concentrated to 5 ml under nitrogen pressure using an Amicon YM10 membrane, centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 10 min, and loaded on a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.6 × 60 cm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. Fractions containing GCAP-1 were pooled and, after adding NaCl to 1 m and dithiothreitol to 5mm, applied on a 1.6 × 5.0-cm butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1.0 m NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer, and GCAP-1 was eluted with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The main peak of GCAP-1 was collected, and EDTA was added to 2 mm to remove Ca2+ bound to GCAP-1. The purity of GCAP-1 preparations was at least 95% as estimated by SDS gel electrophoresis. We also observed that using Chelex was not sufficient to remove all bound Ca2+ from GCAP-1 (18Hwang J.Y. Schlesinger R. Koch K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, preincubation with EDTA produced virtually metal-free GCAP-1. The excess of EDTA was removed by three to four cycles of 20-fold concentration/dilution using an Amicon Ultra-15 (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) centrifugal filter in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 μm EDTA. We find that even in solutions made of reagents containing <5 ppb Ca2+, such as Sigma Ultra grade and Barnstead Nanopure 18.3 megaohms·cm water, Ca2+ contaminations can be as high as 1 μm. Because GCAP-1 has high affinity for Ca2+, even these low levels of contamination are sufficient to skew the measurement of the Ca2+ binding (18Hwang J.Y. Schlesinger R. Koch K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 20 μm EDTA was used to prevent GCAP-1 from rebinding Ca2+ from the solutions during the concentration/dilution cycles. The final concentration of GCAP-1 in stock solutions was commonly between 300 and 350 μm. Concentrated protein was quickly frozen in small aliquots and stored at -70 °C. The concentration of GCAP-1 and its mutants was determined in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride using extinction coefficients at 280 nm computed for the individual mutants from their amino acid composition (29Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) utilizing the ExPASY proteomic WWW server software from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (30Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Myristoylation was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 1) as described in Peshenko et al. (22Peshenko I.V. Moiseyev G.P. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13796-13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Binding Measurements—To determine the stoichiometry and the affinity of GCAP-1 mutant for Ca2+, each protein sample containing a known amount of GCAP-1 or its mutant was incubated at a known total concentration of CaCl2, and the free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]f) in the sample was then determined using Ca2+ fluorescent indicator dyes (BAPTA-2, Fluo-3, BAPTA-6F, and Fluo-4FF, all from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) to calculate the concentration of Ca2+ bound to the protein. The Ca2+ indicators used in each particular experiment were selected to optimally cover the range of the free Ca2+ in the reaction mixture. Fluo-3 or BAPTA-2 was used when [Ca2+]f was between 0.02 and 2.0 μm; Fluo-4FF or BAPTA-6F was used for [Ca2+]f above 1 μm. The readings of the fluorescence intensity were corrected for dilution caused by addition of CaCl2. Free Ca2+ in the reaction mixture was calculated using the following formula: [Ca2+]f = Kd × (F - Fmin)/(100 - F) where F is the fluorescence intensity of the Ca2+ indicator in the assay mixture expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence of the Ca2+-saturated indicator (recorded at the end of each experiment at 1 mm [Ca2+]f), Fmin is the fluorescence intensity of the Ca2+ indicator in the absence of Ca2+ and also expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence of the Ca2+-saturated indicator, and Kd is a dissociation constant of Ca2+ indicator for Ca2+. For each Ca2+ indicator, we determined the Kd in the absence or in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ in separate experiments under the conditions identical to those used in the titration experiments (supplemental Table 1). We used a set of Ca2+/EGTA buffers (31Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) to determine the Kd for Fluo-3 and BAPTA-2, a direct titration of Ca2+ indicator with CaCl2 in the case of Fluo-4FF, and a combination of both methods for BAPTA-6F. Each GCAP-1 mutant was diluted from 300-350 μm stock solution to 20-40 μm final concentration in 0.6 ml of 100 mm MOPS/KOH (pH 7.2), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0 or 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm appropriate fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye (Fluo-3, BAPTA-2, Fluo-4FF or BAPTA-6F). The mixture was assembled in a plastic cuvette and titrated at 23 °C with addition of 3-μl aliquots of CaCl2 solution with known concentration. The fluorescence data were fitted by the equation: ([Ca2+]bound/[GCAP]) = N × [Ca2+]f nH/([Ca2+] fnH + Kd nH) where [Ca2+]bound is the concentration of Ca2+ bound to GCAP-1 calculated as [Ca2+]bound = [Ca2+]total - [Ca2+]free, N is the number of Ca2+ ions bound per molecule of GCAP-1 at saturation, Kd is the apparent affinity of GCAP-1 for Ca2+, and nH is the Hill coefficient. The trace amount of EDTA introduced into the assay from the stock solutions of the proteins was negligible compared with the protein concentration in the assay. The data shown are representative from three to five independent experiments producing virtually identical results. Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission at 332 nm (excitation at 290 nm) was recorded at 23 °C using 4 μm GCAP-1 in 0.6 ml of 100 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and specified concentrations of MgCl2. Small aliquots of concentrated CaCl2 solution were added to obtain the desired free Ca2+ concentrations. The free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the solution were calculated according to the method of Brooks and Storey (32Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) utilizing the algorithm of Marks and Maxfield (33Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The data shown are representative from three to four independent experiments producing virtually identical results. RetGC Assay—Wild-type RetGC-1 was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously (22Peshenko I.V. Moiseyev G.P. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13796-13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (25 μl) contained 30 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm free Mg2+, 2 mm Ca2+/EGTA buffer, 0.3 mm ATP, 4 mm cGMP, 1 mm GTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, 0.1 μCi of [8-3H]cGMP, 10 μm GCAP-1, and human embryonic kidney 293 cell membranes. The reaction mixture was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C and stopped by heating for 2.5 min at 95 °C, and the aliquots were analyzed by TLC using fluorescent plastic-backed polyethylenimine cellulose plates (Merck) as described previously (10Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Peshenko I.V.

The data shown are representative from three to seven independent experiments producing virtually identical results. Ca2+ Binding Properties of GCAP-1—GCAPs have three Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains (EF2-EF4) and one non-binding EF-hand-like domain (EF1) required for interaction with RetGC (Fig. 1A). GCAP-1 used for direct Ca2+ binding experiments effectively activated RetGC-1 at low Ca2+ concentrations and inhibited it in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a cooperativity factor of 2.2 ± 0.13 (mean ± S.D., n = 7) and free Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal ([Ca2+]½) inhibition of 0.25 ± 0.02 μm (n = 7) (Fig. 1B). It was recently suggested (18Hwang J.Y. Schlesinger R. Koch K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that one of the three metal-binding EF-hands can retain Ca2+ irreversibly (18Hwang J.Y. Schlesinger R. Koch K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although we isolated GCAP-1 in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found that all bound Ca2+ could be efficiently removed by dialysis in the presence of EDTA, and we always observed binding of three Ca2+ per GCAP-1 both in the absence (N = 2.86 ± 0.08, n = 3) and in the presence (N = 2.92 ± 0.08, n = 5) of magnesium in the direct Ca2+ binding assay using independent preparations of GCAP-1 (Fig. 1C). The affinity of myristoylated GCAP-1 for Ca2+ in our experiments strongly depended on Mg2+ and was 0.1 ± 0.025 μm (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and 0.29 ± 0.045 μm (n = 5) in the absence or in the presence of 1 mm free Mg2+, respectively. Much to our surprise, in these and the subsequent experiments, we found little cooperativity for the Ca2+ binding to GCAP-1: Hill coefficient was 1.04 ± 0.04 and 1.06 ± 0.07 in the presence or in the absence of Mg2+, respectively (compare with the theoretical curve for the cooperative nH = 2, binding in Fig. 1C, dashed line). To identify Ca2+/Mg2+-specific EF-hand(s) in GCAP-1, individual EF-hands were disabled by point mutations designed to prevent metal binding within the 12-amino acid Ca2+-binding loop of different EF-hands (Fig. 1D). It has been established that the first Asp, the oxygen-containing side chains in the third, fifth, and ninth positions, and the last Glu of the loop are essential for coordinating Ca2+ (34Babu A. Su H. Ryu Y. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15469-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their substitution with corresponding amides or Gly inactivates EF-hand and hampers Ca2+ binding. Substitution of the last Glu with Asp reduces the affinity of EF-hand for Ca2+ in favor of Mg2+ binding as it transforms the coordination sphere from 7-fold Ca2+ coordination to 6-fold Mg2+ coordination through switching from bidentate ligation to monodentate (36Allouche D. Parello J. Sanejouand Y.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 857-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Cates M.S. Teodoro M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Biophys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6773-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such mutations were introduced into each metal-binding EF-hand of GCAP-1, either separately or in combination, to disable one, two, or all three metal-binding EF-hands. Substitutions in EF-hand 2, EF(2)-—Unlike wild-type GCAP-1 that displays a single class of high affinity binding sites to which three Ca2+ can bind per GCAP-1, consistent with the three active EF-hands (Fig. 1C), in the E75Q mutant the number of high affinity Ca2+-binding sites is reduced by one (Fig. 2A). In addition to the high affinity class sites similar to the wild type (Kd = 0.24 ± 0.04 μm and 0.52 ± 0.05 μm in the absence or in the presence of 1 mm [Mg2+]f, respectively) corresponding to the remaining active EF-hands 3 and 4, a low affinity binding site for the third Ca2+ ion could be observed, corresponding to inactivated EF-hand 2. Similar results were observed in the case of mutations D64N and D68G/E75Q (not shown). Importantly in all EF2 mutants the Kd for the high affinity binding in EF3 and EF4 was reduced in the presence of Mg2+. Substitutions in EF-hand 3, EF(3)-—Unlike EF(2)-, after inactivation of EF3 by substitutions, D100N/D102G (Fig. 2B) or E111Q (not shown), only one of the two intact EF-hands in the EF(3)- GCAP-1 retained high affinity Ca2+ binding both in the absence and in the presence of 1 mm [Mg2+]f (Kd = 0.026 ± 0.06 μm and Kd = 0.15 ± 0.03 μm, respectively). To determine which of the two non-mutated EF-hands corresponds to the only remaining high affinity site, we complemented inactivation of the EF3 by inactivation of either EF2 or EF4, i.e. EF(2,3)- and EF(3,4)- GCAP-1 (Fig. 2C), respectively. In the EF(3,4)- mutant, the remaining EF-hand 2 bound Ca2+ similarly to the high affinity site found in the EF(3)- GCAP-1 (Kd = 0.033 ± 0.007 μm and Kd = 0.13 ± 0.03 μm in the absence or in the presence of 1 mm [Mg2+]f, respectively), but the high affinity site of the EF(3)- was eliminated in the EF(2,3)- mutants (D68G/E75Q/D100N/D102G, Fig. 2C, and E75Q/E111Q, D64N/D100N and E75D/E111D, data not shown). Thus, the EF-hand that retained the high affinity site for Ca2+ in the EF(3)- mutants is EF2, whereas the EF4 turned into a low affinity binding site as a result of the EF3 inactivation. The effect of EF3 inactivation on the EF4 did not allow estimation of the affinity for Ca2+ of individual EF4 in the wild-type GCAP-1. Nevertheless EF2 and EF4 both bind Ca2+ and Mg2+ because the dependence of Ca2+ binding in the individual EF-hands 2 and 4 on Mg2+ remained evident (Fig. 2, B and C). Substitutions in EF-hand 4, EF(4)-—The EF4 domain was completely disabled by two point mutations, D144N and D148G. The resultant EF(4)- mutant bound two Ca2+ ions (in EF-hands 2 and 3). Consistent with the ability of both EF2 and EF3 to bind Mg2+, the affinity for Ca2+ of this mutant was lowered in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ from Kd of 0.2 ± 0.03 to 0.4 ± 0.08 μm (Fig. 2D). We found that high affinity binding of a single Ca2+ ion in EF3 is preserved when both EF-hands 2 and 4 were inactivated by substituting the first Asp of the loop with Asn (D64N/D144N, Fig. 2E). The EF3 in this mutant bound Ca2+ with an apparent Kd of 0.4 ± 0.07 and 1.0 ± 0.2 μm in the absence or in the presence of 1 mm free Mg2+, respectively (Fig. 2E). The important conclusion from these series of experiments was that all three active EF-hands in GCAP-1 can bind both Ca2+ and Mg2+. Ca2+-dependent Changes in Trp Fluorescence of EF-hand Mutants and Effect of Mg2+—The Ca2+-dependent change in Trp fluorescence of wild-type GCAP-1 is biphasic (Ref. 13Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J.

This elegant, geometric structure is woven with silk fibers that are renowned for their superior mechanical properties. We used silk gland expression libraries to address a long-standing controversy concerning the evolution of the orb-web architecture. Contrary to the view that the orb-web design evolved multiple times, we found that the distribution and phylogeny of silk proteins support a single, ancient origin of the orb web at least 136 million years ago. Furthermore, we substantially expanded the repository of silk sequences that can be used for the synthesis of high-performance biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W2055334505,Phosphorus is a key macronutrient being strongly enriched in the deep ocean as a result of continuous export and remineralization of biomass from primary production. We show that phosphorus incorporated within the skeletons of the cosmopolitan cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus is directly proportional to the ambient seawater phosphorus concentration and thus may serve as a paleo-oceanographic proxy for variations in ocean productivity as well as changes in the residence times and sources of deep-water masses. The application of this tool to fossil specimens from the Mediterranean reveals phosphorus-enriched bottom waters at the end of the Younger Dryas period.

Although granzyme B can cleave and activate caspases to induce apoptosis, granzyme B can also cause caspase-independent cell death. Thirteen prospective granzyme B substrates were identified from a cDNA expression-cleavage screen, including Hsp70, Notch1, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), poly-A-binding protein, cAbl, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H′, Br140, and intersectin-1. Validation revealed that Notch1 is a substrate of both granzyme B and caspases, whereas FGFR1 is a caspase-independent substrate of granzyme B. Proteolysis of FGFR1 in prostate cancer cells has functionally relevant consequences that indicate its cleavage may be advantageous for granzyme B to kill prostate cancer cells. Therefore, granzyme B not only activates pro-death functions within a target, but also has a previously unidentified role in inactivating pro-growth signals to cause cell death.

These cytotoxic cells can also kill a variety of cancer cells, giving support to the immunosurveillance hypothesis (1Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 2Smyth M.J. Godfrey D.I. Trapani J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Indeed, tumor immunotherapy approaches aim to treat cancers with NKs and CTLs that have potent anti-tumor recognition and killing activities. To that end, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms and pathways that are important to the ability of NKs and CTLs to kill a particular cancerous cell. NK cells and CTLs induce the death of their targets by either tumor necrosis factor family death receptor/death ligand interaction or by granule exocytosis. Granule exocytosis is critical for the efficient killing of virally infected or tumor cell targets (1Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 3Smyth M.J. Thia K.Y. Street S.E. MacGregor D. Godfrey D.I. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Upon target recognition, killer cells release cytotoxic granules, the contents of which cross the immunological synapse and enter the target cell with the assistance of perforin, a putative pore-forming protein. Perforin may enable escape from endocytic vesicles or may allow entry directly through pores in the plasma membrane (1Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Granzymes are serine proteases that are released from the cytotoxic granules to induce target-cell death. There are five human granzymes, termed A, B, H, K, and M. Granzyme B (GrB) can initiate apoptosis by cleaving and activating several members of the caspases, the intracellular pro-apoptotic cysteine proteases (4Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W.

Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). It has also become clear that GrB can induce cell death independently of caspases. GrB has a similar preference to caspases for cleaving proteins C-terminal to aspartic acid residues (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

GrB has been shown to cleave many caspase substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (10Froelich C.J. Hanna W.L. Poirier G.G. Duriez P.J. D'Amours D. Salvesen G.S. Alnemri E.S.

Although the morphologies associated with caspase-independent cell death caused by GrB are chiefly characterized by mitochondrial disruption (13Pinkoski M.J. Waterhouse N.J. Heibein J.A. Wolf B.B.

This is especially true in light of the fact that GrB can cause apoptosis in the absence of Bid, Bax, and Bak (14Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, GrB may cleave other substrates to ensure target cell death but that do not result in a currently recognizable physiological trait. Elucidation of all GrB substrates will unveil a more detailed mechanism of cytotoxic cell death. To identify substrates of GrB, a cDNA expression and cleavage screen was employed. Several new prospective substrates of granzyme B were identified, and three, Hsp70, FGFR1 and Notch1, were validated. We show here these proteolytic events as well as how the cleavage of FGFR1 by GrB could be important in targeting prostate cancer. Reagents—The caspase inhibitor zDEVD-FMK was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. The caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK was purchased from EMD Biosciences and Alexis Biochemicals. When present, both caspase inhibitors are used in equimolar amounts and are designated as CI. The Notch1 antibody Nic927 was a gift from Anthony Capobianco (University of Cincinnati). Antibodies to Lamin B (C-20), Myc (9E10), PARP (H-250), Notch1 (C-20), and Flg (H-76) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Another FGFR1 antibody (Ab-2) was from EMD Biosciences. Purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies were antibodies to PARP, Notch1 (6A5), FGFR1, phospho-FGFR1, phospho-ERK, and ERK. Production of rat granzyme B (GrB) was previously described (8Harris J.L.

Human GrB was a generous gift from either Dr. Nancy Thornberry (Merck) or Dr. Sandra Waugh Ruggles (Catalyst Biosciences.) The small molecule GrB inhibitor L-038597 (GI) was developed and described in a previous study (15Willoughby C.A. Bull H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Jiang J. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Bioorg Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 2197-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift from Dr. Nancy Thornberry (Merck). Plasmid Construction—All inserts were ligated into the Invitrogen mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 Myc/Hisx6. Each overexpressed protein therefore was C-terminally Myc/Hisx6-tagged. The Notch1-ic clone was generated from a Notch1-ic vector that was a generous gift from Anthony Capobianco (University of Cincinnati). The insert coding for Notch1-ic residues 1759-2556 was liberated by BamHI and XbaI digestion and ligated into the expression vector. The plasmids for FGFR1-ic, FGFR1-VSAD, and FGFR1-VSAN were generated from the clone for mouse FGFR1 (IIIc isoform), a generous gift from Dr. David Ornitz (Washington University at St. Louis). The primers used to generate FGFR1-ic were 5′-CAC AAG CTT AAG ATG AAG AGC GGC ACC AAG-3′ and 5′-GCC GAA TTC GCG CCG TTT GAG TCC ACT GTT GGC-3′. The latter primer was also used along with the forward primer 5′-CAC AAG CTT ATG TGG AGC TGG AAG TGC CTC CTC TTC TG-3′ to generate the full-length insert for cloning both FGFR1-VSAD and FGFR1-VSAN. The FGFR1-VSAN clone was made from FGFR1-VSAD using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutagenesis primers 5′-CAG ACA GGT AAC AGT GTC AGC TAA CTC CAG TGC ATC CAT GAA CTC-3′ and its reverse complement. Human FGFR1-gBEC was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR on mRNA prepared from LNCaP cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit and Omniscript reverse transcriptase (both from Qiagen) and the primers 5′-CAC AAG CTT ATG TGG AGC TGG AAG TGC CTC CTC TTC TG-3′ and 5′-GCC GAT ATC GTC AGC AGA CAC TGT TAC CTG TCT GCG-3′. Cell Lines and Culture—All cell lines were available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC.) K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia, Jurkat T-cell leukemia, LNCaP, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines were all propagated in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. NK-92 human natural killer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 units/ml interleukin-2. All cells and transfectants were maintained in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Small Pool cDNA Screening—A cDNA library was constructed from RNA isolated from a 14-day post coitus mouse embryo as previously described (16Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA library was cloned into the high copy number plasmid pCS2+ to yield 200,000 independent clones. The library was divided into pools of ∼100 unique plasmids. [35S]Methionine-labeled protein pools were prepared directly from the cDNA pools using the coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) (17Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of transcription-translation mix was incubated at 30 °C with 0.1 μg of pooled DNA. After 2 h, half of the labeled protein reaction mix was incubated with 1nm recombinant rat granzyme B, 50 μm CI, and 50 μm Ac-IETD-FMK in a buffer containing 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. After 1 h, loading dye was added to each reaction mix, and the mixture was heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The samples were loaded side-by-side onto 10-20% Tris-glycine gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were visualized by autoradiography and scored for cleavage by the disappearance or appearance of bands in the granzyme B-incubated samples that were not found in the control samples. Proteolysis of Hsp70 in Vitro—Purified Hsp70 protein was purchased from Stressgen. Hsp70 protein at 0.64 μm was incubated at 37 °C with 50 nm human GrB in GrB activity buffer containing 50 mm Na HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. Aliquots of 15 μl containing 670 ng of Hsp70 were taken at specific intervals and mixed with sample loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto 4-20% Tris-glycine gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining. In Vitro Transcription-Translation—Plasmids encoding FGFR1-ic and Notch1-ic were subject to T7 Quick Coupled in vitro transcription-translation (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Samples were then diluted into GrB activity buffer and incubated with human GrB at 37 °C for 1-3 h. Aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE; gels were imaged by autoradiography. Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cytoplasmic lysates were generated by resuspending cells at 1 × 107 cells/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (Lysis Buffer). Aliquots from assays described below were lysed in Lysis Buffer including the Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets from Roche Applied Science (Lysis Buffer plus PI) to stop proteolysis. After incubating on ice for 30 min, lysates were spun at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble fraction. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), and equal amounts of total protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in TBST containing 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, as per the antibody manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then incubated with substrate-specific antibodies, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed on film with the ECL detection system. The locations of pre-stained protein markers were traced by overlaying the film onto the membrane. Immunoblots presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Confirming Proteolysis in Cell Lysates—K562 cytoplasmic extracts were generated in the absence or presence of 50 μm CI in Lysis Buffer. The lysate was incubated with 50 nm human GrB in the absence or presence of 20 μm GI, and aliquots were removed from 1 to 6 h. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NK-mediated Cytotoxicity—NK-92 effectors (E) and K562 targets (T) were collected, counted, and mixed at varying E:T ratios as in Ref. 6Mahrus S. Craik C.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, with 2 × 105 K562s in 24-well plates. Killing was stopped at intervals from 1 to6hby collecting and lysing in Lysis Buffer plus PI. Activation of Caspase-mediated Apoptosis in Jurkat T-cell Leukemia Cells—Jurkat cells were plated in a 96-well plate at 4 × 105 cells/well in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 media containing 2% serum. Cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml CH-11 anti-Fas antibody (Upstate) and incubated from 2 to 6 h. At the indicated time intervals, aliquots were lysed in Lysis Buffer plus PI. GrB Delivery to LNCaPs—Human GrB was delivered to LNCaP cells with the lipid protein-delivery reagent Bio-PORTER (BP, Gene Therapy Systems). BioPORTER has been used for intracellular delivery of a variety of proteins (18Zelphati O. Wang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Felgner P.L. Corbeil J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35103-35110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This approach has been used to deliver GrB and is an excellent method for analyzing components of cytotoxic granules (19Thiery J. Dorothee G. Haddada H. Echchakir H. Richon C. Stancou R. Vergnon I. Benard J. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5919-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GrB·BP complexes were established in QuikEase Single-Use tubes according to the manufacturer's instructions and delivered to pre-seeded LNCaPs at 75 nm GrB. Cells were incubated and time points were collected for lysis in Lysis Buffer plus PI. For flow cytometry analysis, serum was added to 30% after 3-4 h of GrB delivery, and samples were incubated for another 2-3 h. The cells were incubated overnight in media containing 10% serum. The following morning cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V-FITC (BioVision), and analyzed on a FACS-Calibur according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dead cells were counted as the Annexin V-positive (FL1) population. Transient Transfections—Mammalian expression plasmids with FGFR1-VSAD, FGFR1-VSAN, or FGFR1gBEC were transiently transfected into LNCaPs or PC3s with Lipofectamine 2000 (LF) reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, LNCaPs were seeded in 500 μl of media without antibiotics so that ∼0.5-2 × 105 cells were in one well of a 24-well plate the day of the transfection. A DNA·LF complex was formed in OPTI-MEM by combining 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA with 2 μl of LF; the complex was then added to one well of a 24-well plate. PC3s were transfected in 12-well (trypan blue) or 96-well (proliferation) plates and scaled accordingly. After 6 h all cells were changed into fresh media and incubated for 24-48 h, depending on the experiment. FGF2 Stimulation—LNCaPs were transiently transfected with FGFR1-VSAD as outlined above to monitor FGFR1 cleavage. At 36 h post transfection, cells were incubated with or without GrB·BP complexes in serum-free media as above. After 6 h, transfectants were stimulated for 10 min in the presence or absence 50 ng/ml purified recombinant FGF2 (R&D Systems) and 50 μg/ml heparin. Samples were then lysed in Lysis Buffer plus PI containing the phosphatase inhibitors 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3. To monitor overexpressed FGFR1-VSAD or FGFR1-VSAN directly after FGF2 stimulation, the receptors were immunoprecipitated from the lysate with anti-Myc antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. The pulled-down receptors were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting for both their Myc tags and for phospho-FGFR1. Trypan Blue Staining and Proliferation Assay—Viability of PC3s transiently overexpressing FGFR1-VSAD or FGFR1-gBEC for 48 h was determined by trypan blue staining (Invitrogen). Cells that were still adherent were collected by mild trypsinization, washed, resuspended in complete media, and counted on a hemocytometer. The data are presented as the average percent dead and alive cells, and error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments. Proliferation of PC3s 48 h post transfection was assessed with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 20 μl of AQueous One Solution reagent was added to the cells in 100 μl of media. The cells were incubated for 2 h, and then the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded. Readings are presented as the mean A490 with error bars representing one standard deviation above and below the mean of six independent transfections. A Student's t test with a two-tailed distribution was calculated to determine the statistical significance of FGFR1gBEC from FGFR1-VSAD transfectants. An in Vitro cDNA Expression Cleavage Screen Identified Several Substrates of Granzyme B—To identify new GrB substrates, a cDNA library containing ∼200,000 unique cDNAs was screened. The library was divided into pools each containing ∼100 unique plasmids. The cDNA pools were in vitro transcribed and translated, and the resulting [35S]methionine-labeled protein pools were incubated in the presence or absence of GrB and the caspase inhibitors zVAD-FMK and zDEVD-FMK (CI). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by autoradiography, and scored for caspase-independent proteolysis. Cleavage-positive pools were split into smaller sub-pools, which were then re-transformed and subjected to a subsequent round of DNA purification and in vitro transcribed and translated and screening. Fig. 1A is an autoradiograph of seven subpools from one initial positive pool. In sub-pool #5, a band at ∼47 kDa decreased in intensity and a smaller band at 40 kDa was enriched when GrB was added. Positive sub-pools like #5 continued to be split into smaller sub-pools and screened until individual cDNAs were isolated. The cDNAs were sequenced and subjected to a BLAST search. The cDNA isolated from positive sub-pool #5 was identified as the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), and other prospective GrB substrates identified were: Notch1, cAbl, Hsp70, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H′, Br140, intersectin-1, and poly-A-binding protein. Five additional clones matched cDNAs that have undefined protein identities. Lamin B, a known GrB substrate (11Zhang D. Beresford P.J. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was also isolated, demonstrating the efficacy of the screen. Each Identified Substrate Has a Prospective Granzyme B Cleavage Site—GrB has a strict requirement for cleaving C-terminal to Asp residues due to Arg-226 in its P1 pocket (20Waugh S.M. Harris J.L.

Armed with this fact as well as the well characterized extended substrate specificity of the enzyme (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar), protein sequences were searched for possible cleavage sites. Table 1 presents the prospective GrB cleavage sites within the identified proteins. According to protease substrate nomenclature, the (N-terminal to C-terminal) P4 thru P2′ residues are listed, with the scissile bond located between P1 and P1′. The optimal substrate of GrB is the sequence (I/V)EPD∼SG. However, specificity profiling data as well as research into the structural determinants of the specificity of GrB (22Ruggles S.W. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30751-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has revealed that the P1 and P4 sites are of critical importance, whereas GrB can accommodate a broader range of residues at the other positions. Depicted in Table 1, the importance of the P4 thru P2′ sites is proportional to the size of the letter. Other known substrates of GrB such as caspase 3, PARP, and Bid are cleaved at sites that are a close but not exact match to IEPD SG (Table 1). This understanding created an appropriate sieve for eliminating poly-A-binding protein, which has a less than optimal P4 Leu, from further investigation.TABLE 1Prospective granzyme B cleavage sites within each identified substrate Hsp70, FGFR1, and Notch1 Are Substrates of Granzyme B in Vitro—The ability of GrB to proteolyze Hsp70 was assessed in vitro by incubating purified recombinant Hsp70 with 50 nm GrB (Fig. 1B). The cleavage products that appear as early as 1 h (h) are 40 and 30 kDa, as expected given the predicted cleavage site at Asp-366. Proteolysis by GrB of FGFR1 and Notch1 (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively) was first confirmed in vitro by incubating GrB with in vitro transcribed and translated peptides corresponding to the intracellular portions of each transmembrane protein (Fig. 1, C (panel ii) and D (panel ii)). The mobility shift of intracellular FGFR1 (FGFR1ic, Fig. 1C), after incubation with GrB, confirms that it is a substrate of GrB in vitro, and the size change is consistent with cleavage at Asp-432. Intracellular Notch1 (Notch1-ic, Fig. 1D), which runs at ∼85 kDa, appears to be cleaved at one major site yielding a product of ∼75 kDa (arrowhead) but also appears to be proteolyzed further (asterisks) upon longer incubation with increasing concentrations of GrB. The banding pattern of the cleavage products is consistent with proteolysis occurring in the region of Notch1-ic that aligns to the location of the predicted cleavage sites (Fig. 1D and Table 1). FGFR1 and Notch1 Are Caspase-independent Substrates of Granzyme B—Proteolysis was next confirmed by treating human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia lysates with GrB. Using cell extracts is a valid approach, because GrB enters the cytoplasm of target cells with the assistance of perforin to induce apoptosis. Aliquots were removed over time, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for Notch1, FGFR1, or PARP (Fig. 2). Notch1 exists on the cell surface as a heterodimer (Fig. 1D, panel i); the peptide that contains the transmembrane and intracellular portions of the receptor is ∼120 kDa and is known as Notch1-TM (N™). Within only 1 h, both FGFR1 and N™ have been proteolyzed upon incubation with GrB (Fig. 2, left panels). Including CI did not prevent cleavage, indicating that proteolysis is independent of caspase activation (Fig. 2, right panels). However, N™ cleavage appears to be less efficient in the presence of CI when comparing the 2-h time points, indicating that N™ may also be a caspase substrate. PARP, a substrate of both GrB and caspases, was also monitored in this system (bottom panels). The addition of a small molecule-specific granzyme B inhibitor (GI, right panels) largely blocked the proteolysis of the full-length proteins. Notch1 and FGFR1 were also confirmed to be proteolyzed during NK cell-mediated killing of K562 targets (Fig. 3). NK cells kill K562s, which do not express a death receptor, exclusively by granule exocytosis. Potent NK-92 effectors (E) were co-incubated with K562 targets (T), and proteolysis was monitored by immunoblotting. Notch1 cleavage during NK-mediated cell killing of K562s is presented in Fig. 3 (A and B). N™ is proteolyzed within2hand almost completely by4hatanE:T of 2:1 (Fig. 3A, left). At 4:1, N™ is totally absent at 4h (Fig. 3A, right). The proteolysis is not due to NK cells killing themselves, because the 2:0 and 4:0 controls show no destruction of the N™ band. Furthermore, the addition of GI (Fig. 3, A and B) blocks efficient cleavage, and therefore proteolysis of these substrates is due to GrB and cannot be rescued by other granzymes. The addition of CI (Fig. 3B, left) shows that N™ is cleaved during cell killing in a caspase-independent manner. The antibody used to detect N™ in these experiments recognizes a cross-reactive species at 100 kDa. FGFR1 is also proteolyzed during NK-mediated cytotoxicity to a significant extent by 4 h and completely by 6 h under an E:T of 4:1 (Fig. 3C). FGFR1 is also a caspase-independent substrate during cell killing (Fig. 3C, right panel). In fact, proteolysis of FGFR1 seems to occur more efficiently by2hinthe presence of CI. This may indicate that, without apoptotic amplification by caspases, GrB can cleave other substrates more robustly. The cytotoxic cell would therefore still induce the death of a target whose caspase cascade is blocked. Proteolysis of PARP was also assessed during the cell killing experiments (Fig. 3D). At either 2:1 or 4:1 PARP is cleaved, and the 89-kDa caspase product and 55-kDa GrB products appear (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Bi"
https://openalex.org/W2007228548,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a secreted protein, has the intrinsic ability to induce apoptosis directly without binding insulin-like growth factors. Previous studies suggested that IGFBP-3 must be secreted to exert its biological functions. IGFBP-3 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and exogenous IGFBP-3 is translocated into the nucleus, suggesting that both secretion and nuclear localization may play important roles in IGFBP-3 action. To address these questions, we fused yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to mature IGFBP-3 lacking its signal peptide so that it would remain intracellular and mutated the C-terminal NLS of IGFBP-3, 228KGRKR232, to MDGEA. Following transfection of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells with these constructs, Western blots indicated that YFP-IGFBP-3 lacking a signal peptide was cell-associated and not present in the extracellular media. Moreover, the fusion protein was not N-glycosylated, indicating that it had not entered the secretory pathway. Confocal imaging showed that intracellular YFP-MDGEA-IGFBP-3 was predominantly cytoplasmic. Transient transfection of nonsecreted YFP-wild-type IGFBP-3 decreased cell viability, as assessed by staining with annexin V followed by flow cytometry. Induction of cell death was caspase-dependent, indicative of apoptosis. Apoptosis also was induced by the nonsecreted NLS mutant (YFP-MDGEA-IGFBP-3) alone and when the IGF-binding site also had been mutated. These results indicate that IGFBP-3 can induce apoptosis in an IGF-independent manner without being secreted or concentrated in the nucleus."

This elegant, geometric structure is woven with silk fibers that are renowned for their superior mechanical properties. We used silk gland expression libraries to address a long-standing controversy concerning the evolution of the orb-web architecture. Contrary to the view that the orb-web design evolved multiple times, we found that the distribution and phylogeny of silk proteins support a single, ancient origin of the orb web at least 136 million years ago.

Aging decreases oxidative metabolism in interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) located between the myofibrils. We asked whether reversal of aging defects in IFM before ischemia would decrease injury in the aged heart following ischemia and reperfusion. Treatment with acetylcarnitine (AcCN) increases the activity of cytochrome oxidase in the aged heart. Aged (24 months) and adult (6 months) Fischer 344 rats were treated with AcCN (300 mg/kg i.p. 3 h before excision of the heart) or served as controls. AcCN restored oxidative phosphorylation and the activity of complexes III and IV in IFM from aged hearts to rates present in adults. Isolated hearts underwent 25 min global ischemia and 30 min reperfusion without additional treatment. Contractile recovery during reperfusion improved in hearts from AcCN-treated aged rats compared to aged controls and were similar to adults in recovery. AcCN-treated aged hearts sustained less damage, indicated by decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release during reperfusion. AcCN treatment did not alter functional recovery or LDH release in adults. Restoration of mitochondrial function in the aged heart before ischemia was accompanied by enhanced contractile recovery and decreased tissue injury following ischemia and reperfusion."

Hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes plays an important role in determining the size of the heart (1Olson E.N.

Cell. 2002; 110: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has usually been regarded as an adaptive response to hemodynamic load in postnatal hearts when cardiomyocytes irreversibly withdraw from cell cycle activity (3Field L.J.

Academic Press, New York1999: 405-428Crossref Google Scholar). As a part of the normal developmental process, the cell cycle activity of cardiomyocyte declines rapidly upon terminal differentiation and maturation. At birth, the majority of cardiomyocytes (97%) stops proliferation and remains in G0/G1 phase (5Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H220-H226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Soonpaa M.H. Kim K.K. Pajak L. Franklin M. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2183-H2189PubMed Google Scholar). This cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdraw is considered a key phenomenon in the heart switching from hyperplastic growth to hypertrophic growth (3Field L.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1015: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy has traditionally been classified as pathological or physiological (7Scheuer J. Buttrick P. Circulation. 1987; 75: I63-I68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, persistent pressure or volume overload caused by disease conditions, such as hypertension, stenotic cardiac valve disorders, and genetic defects in contractile proteins, can induce cardiac pathological hypertrophy, which can be associated with diminished heart function and eventual heart failure (8Cohn J.N.

In contrast, physiological cardiac hypertrophy is a normal beneficial adaptive response of the heart to physiological stimuli (e.g. chronic swimming exercise), which is often accompanied by a decrease in resting and submaximal heart rate, an increase in ventricular contractile function, and an increase in chamber filling time and venous blood return (7Scheuer J.

This process is difficult to separate from physiological cardiac hypertrophy, mainly because of difficulty in creating an experimental condition for testing the growth potential of functioning heart in the absence of hemodynamic work load. The best demonstration was from a series of classic experiments by Bishop and co-workers (15Bishop S.P. Anderson P.G. Tucker D.C. Circ.

They found that hypertrophic growth actually occurred in the absence of hemodynamic load during 3-5 weeks of culture (15Bishop S.P. Anderson P.G. Tucker D.C. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 84-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that cardiac hypertrophic growth could be regulated without directly associated with the cardiac working load. In addition, isoform switching from β-myosin heavy chain (βMHC) to αMHC apparently occurred in oculo cultured heart as it does normally in postnatal heart (16Tucker D.C. Umeda P.K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).

The common abnormal cardiac phenotype in these mutant mice is the development of severe congenital ventricular myocardial defects with hypertrabeculation and noncompaction, a myocardial morphogenetic defect that is likely caused by enhanced cell cycle activity in trabecular cardiomyocytes (17Chen H.

These prior observations strongly suggest that the down-regulation of BMP10 in ventricular myocardium is a critical step in the normal development and maturation of the ventricular myocardium. In an effort to examine the impact of ectopic and elevated BMP10 expression in postnatal myocardium, we generated transgenic mice in which BMP10 expression is driven by the cardiomyocyte-specific promoter, αMHC promoter. Although these unique αMHC-BMP10 transgenic mice have apparently normal cardiogenesis in utero, they give rise to smaller hearts during postnatal growth because of severely attenuated hypertrophic growth. Here, we report our assessment of the physiological impact of sustained BMP10 expression in postnatal cardiomyocytes on several aspects of cardiac hypertrophic growth and demonstrate for the first time that cardiac postnatal hypertrophic growth can be specifically modified genetically and has a significant role in postnatal cardiac function. Generation of αMHC-BMP10 Transgenic Mice—αMHC promoter (a gift from Dr. Robbins, Cincinnati Children Hospital) was placed 5′ of a mouse BMP10 cDNA fragment (coding region), followed by the SV40 early region transcription terminator/polyadenylation site. The procedures that generated the transgenic mice were carried out as previously described at the mouse transgenic core of Indiana University Cancer Center (21Pashmforoush M. Lu J.T. Chen H.

In brief, the transgene insert (αMHC-BMP10) was purified and microinjected into inbred C3HeB/FeJ (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) zygotes, which were then implanted into the oviducts of pseudopregnant Swiss Webster mice. The resulting pups were screened by diagnostic PCR. Five positive founders were identified from a total of 79 F0 mice. Initially, these positive founders were bred to DBA/2J mice to minimize the silencing of the transgene caused by genomic methylation (22Rubart M. Pasumarthi K.B. Nakajima H. Soonpaa M.H.

We subsequently maintained αMHC-BMP10 mice in two genetic backgrounds, DBA/2J inbred strain and DBA/2J X C57B6 hybrid strain. Experiments were performed using the DBA/2J-C57B6 mixed strain in which age and sex matched non-transgenic littermates were used as controls. Histological Analysis—Heart samples were harvested, fixed, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for cardiac histology, Masson's trichrome for potential cardiac fibrosis, and subjected to in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses as previously described (17Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C. Haneline L.S. Franco D. Shou W.

Morphometric Measurement of Isolated Cardiomyocytes—Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated from the heart with 0.17% type I collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Inc.) and stained with Hoechst to demonstrate nuclei. Only typical rod-shaped cardiomyocytes were included in the morphometric measurement. Using ImagePro plus 5.1 software, the long axis, short axis, and cell area were measured and compared between transgenic and control mice. To count the total number of cardiomyocytes in adult hearts, formalin fixed hearts (the atria were removed) were digested with 50% KOH for 24 h (24Gerdes A.M. Onodera T. Tamura T. Said S.

After careful washing with phosphate-buffered saline, rodshaped cells were counted using a hemacytometer. Echocardiography—Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed as previously described (25Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A. Wang Y.

Two-dimensional short-axis images were obtained using a high resolution Vevo 660 and 770 Imaging System (Visualsonics Inc, Toronto) equipped with a 35 MHz scan probe. Left ventricular chamber dimension and wall thickness at systolic and diastolic phases were measured from M-mode recording. Heart rate was calculated from simultaneous electrocardiogram recording. Left ventricular volume, fractional shortening (FS%), and ejection fraction (EF%) were calculated using the Vevo Analysis program as described (25Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M.

Swimming Training—Programmed conditioning using a swimming training protocol was performed as previously described by Kaplan et al. (26Kaplan M.L. Cheslow Y. Vikstrom K. Malhotra A. Geenen D.L. Nakouzi A. Leinwand L.A. Buttrick P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1167-H1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 10-week-old male αMHC-BMP10 transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates were individually placed into a murine swimming pool (surface area 220 cm2, water depth 15-20 cm, water temperature 30-32 °C). On the first day, the mice swam for two 10-min cycles. On successive days, each swimming cycle was increased by 10-min increments until reaching to two 90-min cycles per day (this constituted the training period). Once trained, the mice swam for two 90-min cycles per day for a total of 28 days. Isoproterenol Treatment using Osmotic Pumps—3-monthold male αMHC-BMP10 mice and their non-transgenic siblings were treated with the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, using Alzet osmotic mini-pumps (7-day infusion, model 2001, flow rate of 1 μl/h, 0.028 g/ml isoproterenol dissolved in saline) as previously described (27Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1439-H1445PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin Treatment—3-month-old male αMHC-BMP10 mice and their non-transgenic siblings were fasted overnight and then treated with insulin (Eli Lilly Pharmaceutics) via IP injection (1.5 unit/kg). Cardiac tissues were harvested 10 min after injection for Western blot analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from the hearts of mice using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using 1 μg of total RNA as a template according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Real time PCR was performed using iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) with iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). The relative expression was normalized to the reference gene ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7) as previously described (28Pfaffl M.W.

The αMHC promoter has a transient burst of activity in embryonic heart around E9.5-10.5. This cardiac-specific promoter is re-activated during early postnatal life and remains persistently high into adult (30Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five transgenic lines carrying the αMHC-BMP10 transgene were generated with similar BMP10 expression levels and identical cardiac abnormalities as described below. These αMHC-BMP10 transgenic mice appear to have normal embryonic cardiac development and survive to adulthood (over 12 months of age). Some lethality at 8-10 months was evident for αMHC-BMP10 mice in a DBA/2J inbred background. We compared the expression profiles of transgene-encoded BMP10 and total BMP10 in the transgenic hearts during embryonic and postnatal development using RT-PCR (Fig. 1B, panel a). There is a brief window of transgenic αMHC-BMP10 expression from embryonic day E9.0 to E12.5, which coincides with the temporal pattern of endogenous BMP10 expression in the ventricle (17Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C. Haneline L.S. Franco D. Shou W.

To further confirm the level of BMP10 expression during the development, quantitative qRT-PCR was used to determine total BMP10 level in αMHC-BMP10 hearts at E10.5, E16.5, and neonatal day 8 (Fig. 1B, panel b). BMP10 expression was about 40-50% higher in E10.5 αMHC-BMP10 hearts when compared with non-transgenic littermate controls. As expected, transgenic BMP10 expression was rather high by N8 and remained high thereafter. In situ hybridization (Fig. 1C, panels a and b) and quantitative qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C, panel c) further confirmed persistent BMP10 expression in the ventricles of the adult αMHC-BMP10 mice. Interestingly, the level of transgenic αMHC-BMP10 expression in the right and left atrium is relatively low compared with ventricles in these αMHC-BMP10 mice (Fig. 1C, panel c). This phenomenon is different from the majority of transgenic mice using the αMHC promoter. The αMHC promoter typically drives constitutively high expression in atria (30Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of high atrial BMP10 expression suggests that some αMHC-BMP10 transgenic mice with higher expression levels may die in utero. Supporting evidence is from another transgenic mouse line in which BMP10 expression is driven by human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANF) promoter (21Pashmforoush M. Lu J.T. Chen H. Amand T.S. Kondo R. Pradervand S. Evans S.M. Clark B. Feramisco J.R. Giles W. Ho S.Y. Benson D.W. Silberbach M. Shou W. Chien K.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). hANF-BMP10 transgenic mice that have higher and persistent BMP10 expression in embryonic hearts are embryonic lethal because of the development of hypertrabeculation and noncompaction (21Pashmforoush M.

Significantly lower percent of αMHC-BMP10-positive F0 mice (6.2%, 5 out of 79 F0) obtained in our study is consistent with this notion. Therefore, the generated αMHC-BMP10 transgenic lines were likely preselected for lower expressing mice. It is not surprising that cardiac histological analysis revealed normal cardiac structure in these αMHC-BMP10 embryos (Fig. 1D) and newborns (Fig. 4A, panel a). Smaller Cardiomyocytes inαMH"
https://openalex.org/W2145164810,"High voltage-gated calcium channels consist of a pore-forming subunit (α1) and three nonhomologous subunits (α2/δ, β, and γ). Although it is well established that the β-subunit promotes traffic of channels to the plasma membrane and modifies their activity, the reversible nature of the interaction with the α1-subunit remains controversial. Here, we address this issue by examining the effect of purified β2a protein on CaV1.2 and CaV2.3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The β2a-subunit binds to the α1-interaction domain (AID) in vitro, and when injected into oocytes, it shifts the voltage dependence of activation and increases charge movement to ionic current coupling of CaV1.2 channels. This increase depended on the integrity of AID but was not abolished by bafilomycin, demonstrating that the α1-β interaction through the AID site can take place at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, injection of β2a protein inhibited inactivation of CaV2.3 channels and converted fast inactivating CaV2.3/β1b channels to slow inactivating channels. Inhibition of inactivation required larger concentration of β2a in oocytes expressing CaV2.3/β1b channels than expressing CaV2.3 alone but reached the same maximal level as expected for a competitive interaction through a single binding site. Together, our data show that the α1-β interaction is reversible in intact cells and defines calcium channels β-subunits as regulatory proteins rather than stoichiometric subunits. High voltage-gated calcium channels consist of a pore-forming subunit (α1) and three nonhomologous subunits (α2/δ, β, and γ).

Together, our data show that the α1-β interaction is reversible in intact cells and defines calcium channels β-subunits as regulatory proteins rather than stoichiometric subunits. High voltage-gated calcium channels are multi-subunit proteins complexes where a pore-forming subunit combines with one or more nonhomologous auxiliary subunits (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). One of these auxiliary subunit, the β-subunit, is crucial for channel function, because in addition to stimulating channel activity it appears to be required for surface expression of the channel protein (2Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J.M. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These two effects combined result in a severalfold increase in the ionic current density in heterologous expression systems, but the relative contribution, biological relevance, and extent to which both processes are independent from each other remain elusive. Early studies show that in Xenopus oocytes, coexpression of β2a with the pore-forming α1 subunit from cardiac cells (CaV1.2) augments ionic currents mostly by increasing ionic current to charge movement ratio (3Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Later on, it was shown that the addition of the β-subunit as purified protein is capable of modulating channel activity of the α1 subunit expressed in Xenopus oocytes (4Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J.

Rebolledo S. Garcia M.C. Sanchez J.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results suggest that modulation of function is separated from the effect on channel expression and predicts that binding sites remain available on the mature channel. However, the α1-β-subunit association depends primarily on the so-called α-interaction domain (AID), 2The abbreviations used are: AID, α-interaction domain; cRNA, complementary RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GV, normalized conductance. located within the intracellular loop joining the first and second repeats of the α1-subunit. Secondary binding sites have been identified, but they appear to be specific to certain α1-β pairs, and they modulate particular aspects of channel function (7Dolphin A.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recent work indicates that binding of a single β-subunit recapitulates function (9Dalton S. Takahashi S.X. Miriyala J. Colecraft H.M. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 757-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems likely that β-subunit-binding sites available at the plasma membrane arise from unbinding of the β-subunit to the AID site during channel trafficking. This would imply a reversible interaction rather than a stoichiometric association, as proposed by Tareilus et al. (2Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J.M. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here, we purified the β2a-subunit isoform, injected in oocytes expressing α1-subunit, and measured ionic and gating currents. Gating currents were correlated to the number of channels in the membrane by immunoassay. Using this approach we demonstrate that the α1-β-subunit interaction is dynamic and can occur at the plasma membrane. Binding to mature channels is reversible, and association of the β-subunit to the AID site is an absolute requirement to modulate channel function. Protein Preparation, Binding Assay, and Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding the rat β2a subunit (3Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was subcloned by conventional PCR methods into pRSET vector (Stratagene) to add an N-terminal polyhistidine tag (His6-β2a). The His6-β2a was expressed in BL-21 (DE-3) Escherichia coli bacteria by 2 h of induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C and purified from the cleared cell lysate by metal affinity chromatography (Talon; BD Biosciences) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex™ S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm Tris buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated up to 2–4 mg/ml, and stored at –80 °C. Binding to AID was assayed as by Neely et al. (4Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein encoding the I-II loop of the CaV1.2 subunit (GST-AID), and as a negative control we used GST alone or fused to a 126-amino acid peptide derived from the C-terminal end of the chloride channel from human skeletal muscle ClC-1 (GST-ClC126). Oocyte Injections and Electrophysiological Recordings—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, and maintained as in previous report (4Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All capped cRNA were synthesized using the MESSAGE-machine (Ambion, Austin, TX), resuspended in 10 μl of water and stored in 2-μl aliquots at –80 °C until use. The CaV1.2 subunit used in this study bears a deletion of 60 amino acids at the N-terminal end that increase expression (10Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar), and the CaV2.3 subunit corresponds to the human form (11Schneider T. Wei X. Olcese R. Costantin J.L. Neely A. Palade P. Perez-Reyes E. Qin N. Zhou J. Crawford G.D. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 255-270PubMed Google Scholar). The W470S mutation on the CaV1.2 subunit was incorporated by standard PCR methods. Electrophysiological recordings using the cut-open oocyte technique (12Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) were performed 4–6 days after cRNA injection as described (4Neely A.

The external solution contained in mm, 10Ba 2+, 96 n-methylglucamine, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.0, and the internal solution 120 n-methylglucamine, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.0. For recording of oocytes expressing the CaV2.3 subunit, EGTA was replaced by BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′,-tetraacetic acid) in the internal solution for a better control of calcium-activated chloride currents. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the pCLAMP system and software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). The currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Linear components were eliminated by P/–4 prepulse protocol (3Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For experiments with the purified β2a protein, the oocytes were injected with 50 nl of the protein stock solution 2–7 h before recordings. The final protein concentration was calculated assuming an oocyte volume of 525 nl that corresponds with a diameter of 1 mm. For bafilomycin treatment, the oocytes were exposed for 24 h to 500 nm concentration obtained from a 1 mm stock solution of bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich) in Me2SO and compared with control oocytes incubated for the same period in 0.05% Me2SO. Surface Expression Measurements in Xenopus Oocytes—Surface expression of CaV1.2 was measured by immunoassay as described (13Altier C. Dubel S.J. Barrere C. Jarvis S.E. Stotz S.C. Spaetgens R.L.

The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was inserted into the extracellular loop S5-H5 of domain II at residue 713 of the CaV1.2 subunit (Swiss-Prot P15381) by standard overlapping PCR using complementary oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope and flanked with extra amino acids to yield CaV1.2-HA. 5–6 days after CaV1.2 RNA injection, the oocytes were separated into two groups: one for electrophysiological recordings and the other for immunoassay. Unless otherwise stated, all of the incubations for immunoassay were carried out at 4 °C. The oocytes were incubated in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) with 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) for 30 min and then for 60 min in the presence of 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Applied Science). After washes, the oocytes were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat FAB fragments; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Thereafter, the oocytes were extensively washed with blocking buffer and rinsed once in ND96 at room temperature. Individual oocytes were then placed in 50 μl of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay femto substrate (Pierce) in 96-well microplates (Optiplate; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and chemiluminescence was quantified 30 s later with a luminometer (Viktor2; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purified β2a Protein Binds to GST-AID Fusion Protein and Modulates CaV1.2 Channel Activity—The purified β2a elutes as a monodisperse peak from a size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1A) and was capable of binding specifically to the CaV1.2-AID site because no binding activity was observed with GST alone or GST fused to an unrelated sequence (GST-ClC126; Fig. 1B). As in cRNA coexpression experiments (3Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Perez Reyes E. Castellano A.

Maximal barium current (IBa) was increased from –18 ± 4nA(CaV1.2 alone) to –184 ± 19 nA (CaV1.2/β2a protein), which compares with –101 ± 12 nA obtained from oocytes expressing CaV1.2/β2a cRNA (Fig. 1C). The reason for this difference is not clear. Channel expression depends on several factors, such as translation efficiency of microinjected cRNA and protein trafficking capacity of the oocyte, which complicates interpretation of peak current data. Nevertheless, our result shows the functional competence of the β2a protein. The fraction of channels activated during a 66-ms pulse to increasing potentials was measured as the peak of the tail current during repolarization to –40 mV. Normalized peak tail currents were plotted with respect to the pulse potential to yield the GV curves (Fig. 1D). The sum of two Boltzmann distributions was adjusted to each GV curve, and the parameters defining these distributions are described in Table 1. The only visible difference when comparing the effect of β2a as cRNA or as protein was that with the latter the relative contribution of the first Boltzmann distribution (G1) is slightly smaller (42.0 ± 2.5%) than with CaV1.2/β2a cRNA (50.9 ± 2.0%). This change impacts macroscopic conductance at positive voltages and may reflect channels not being modulated by the auxiliary subunit when injected as a protein. To illustrate this point we constructed a GV curve by adding 80% of a GV obtained with CaV1.2/β2a cRNA and 20% of the one obtained without β-subunit (thick line in Fig. 1D). This new plot superimposes almost perfectly with the data obtained from oocytes injected with the CaV1.2/β2a protein combination.TABLE 1The mean ± S.E. of parameters defining the sum of two Boltzmann distributions that best fitted the normalized conductanceCaV1.2 (n = 9)CaV1.2/β2a cRNA (n = 8)CaV1.2/β2a protein (n = 10)%G155.4 ± 4.650.9 ± 2.042.0 ± 2.5V1 (mV)62.3 ± 2.710.0 ± 1.59.9 ± 2.5z12.09 ± 0.062.59 ± 0.132.45 ± 0.17V2 (mV)95.3 ± 4.457.0 ± 1.764.5 ± 2.4z21.44 ± 0.121.18 ± 0.031.22 ± 0.07Imax (μA)-2.87 ± 0.50-0.76 ± 0.08-1.38 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab Currents recorded in the absence of exogenous β-subunit showed a rapid outward transient corresponding to gating currents that was followed by a small noninactivating inward current mediated by the influx of Ba2+ (Fig. 2A, top panel). In contrast, oocytes coinjected with CaV1.2/β2a cRNA displayed inward ionic currents that were larger than gating currents (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Likewise, injection of the β2a protein to CaV1.2-expressing oocytes also leads to an increase in ionic current amplitude relative to gating currents (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Here we integrated the first 2 ms of the gating current evoked by a pulse from –80 to –30 mV (Q2ms; shaded area in Fig. 2A) and compared it with IBa measured at the end of a pulse to 0 mV as described previously (15Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in this type of measurements, IBa/Q2ms may be overestimated because inward currents are subtracted from outward gating currents, the impact is the same for β2a cRNA or β2a protein, because voltage dependence of activation is similar for both subunit combinations. Fig. 2B shows scatter plots of the Q2ms versus IBa for the three channel subunit combinations. Over a wide spectrum of Q2ms amplitudes, IBa amplitudes are near 0 when CaV1.2 was expressed alone, as reflected in an average IBa/Q2ms ratio of 0.3 ± 0.1 nA/pC. When the β2a-subunit is present in either form, this ratio is severalfold larger (12.7 ± 3.9 nA/pC for CaV1.2/β2a protein and 14.2 ± 2.3 nA/pC for CaV1.2/β2a cRNA). All of the values obtained from CaV1.2/β2a protein oocytes fell within the 95% confidence limit of the regression analysis from CaV1.2/β2a cRNA, indicating that both forms of β2a appear equally effective in facilitating ionic currents at 0 mV. The Effect of β2a Protein Is Preserved in CaV1.2-expressing Oocytes Pretreated with Bafilomycin but Not When the AID Site Is Disrupted—An increase in ionic currents upon injection of β2a occurs in a few hours, whereas the gating currents remain more or less invariant. This suggests that CaV1.2 subunits already present in the plasma membrane are accessible to the injected β2a protein. To further examine this possibility, we pretreated CaV1.2-expressing oocytes with bafilomycin, an inhibitor of V-type ATPases that impairs the traffic of intracellular vesicles (16Drose S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment is expected to interrupt the incorporation of new CaV1.2 subunits into the plasma membrane and cause a net reduction of channel density caused by constitutive endocytosis that removes membrane proteins at a rather constant rate. To assess that bafilomycin was effectively preventing the incorporation of newly synthesized channels, surface expression was assayed concurrently by two independent methods: immunoassay and charge movement (Qon) during a voltage step to IBa reversal potential (Fig. 3A). Immunoreactivity and Qon were reduced by more than 70% by bafilomycin, and this reduction was not reverted upon injection of β2a protein. For protein-injected oocytes Qon was 164 ± 26 pC (n = 8), which compares with 144 ± 21 pC (n = 9) measured in the absence of β2a. Similarly, chemiluminescence measurements were virtually identical with (0.97 × 105 ± 0.24 × 105 cps; n = 16) or without (1.02 × 105 ± 0.31 × 105 cps; n = 20) β2a protein. Thus, in fact the bafilomycin treatment under our conditions prevents channel incorporation into plasma membrane. If β2a could only interact with channels before they reach the plasma membrane, then injection of β2a protein should not modify the function of calcium channels in bafilomycin-treated oocytes. However, IBa/Q2ms increases from 0.6 ± 0.2 nA/pC to 18.6 ± 5.6 nA/pC by injection of β2a protein in bafilomycin-treated oocytes (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that β2a interacts with channels already present in the plasma membrane. We next asked whether modulation of function of mature channels depends on an intact AID site and generated a point mutation in CaV1.2 (W470S) homologous to a mutation that impairs binding of the β-subunit in CaV2.1 (17De Waard M. Scott V.E. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In CaV2.3, this mutation abolishes modulation of function as well as binding (18Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1429-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because expression may be impaired by alteration of the AID sequence, we documented the ability of HA-tagged CaV1.2 carrying the W470S mutation of reaching the plasma membrane by immunoassay and gating current measurements (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Qon measured at IBa reversal potential correlates with chemiluminescence values over a wide range (Fig. 4B). We also show that substituting the conserved tryptophan within the AID sequence in CaV1.2 abolishes binding of β2a protein to a peptide carrying this mutation (Fig. 4C, GST-AIDW470S). When injected into CaV1.2-W470S-expressing oocytes, the β2a protein is no longer capable of increasing ionic currents (Fig. 4, D and E) nor of shifting the voltage dependence (Fig. 4F). For protein-injected oocytes, IBa/Q2ms was 1.05 ± 0.07 nA/pC (n = 11), which is virtually identical to 0.95 ± 0.22 nA/pC (n = 13) in oocytes without β2a, demonstrating that modulation of function by the β-subunit requires an intact AID site. The W470S channels displayed a higher IBa/Q2ms ratio than wild type channels, suggesting an alteration on the ability of the channel to open. Changes in channel function associated with mutations on residues within the AID domain in the absence of β-subunit have been reported (19Berrou L. Dodier Y. Raybaud A. Tousignant A. Dafi O.

Chem. 2005; 280: 494-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). β2a Protein Reverts Inactivation of CaV2.3/β1b-mediated Currents—Here, to ascertain whether the α1-β interaction is reversible, we tested the ability of β2a to inhibit inactivation in oocytes coexpressing CaV2.3/β1b cRNA and compare it with its effects on oocytes expressing CaV2.3 alone. Typically, IBa from oocytes expressing CaV2.3 cRNA by itself fully inactivates in a few hundred milliseconds (Fig. 5A). In contrast, when β2a cRNA is coinjected with CaV2.3 cRNA, IBa inactivation develops over several seconds and reaches a plateau of about 25% of the peak current (20Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Injection of β2a protein on CaV2.3-expressing oocytes also slows inactivation (Fig. 5, A and B). T½ increases from 0.26 ± 0.03 s (n = 16) for CaV2.3 alone to 4.0 ± 0.63 s (n = 12). This is even slower than T½ values obtained from oocytes injected with both subunits as cRNAs (2.4 ± 0.42 s; n = 13). More notably, the β2a protein was also capable of increasing T½ in oocytes coexpressing the CaV2.3/β1b combination, from 0.15 ± 0.01 s (n = 18) to 1.5 ± 0.3s(n = 23). The steady state inactivation (SSIN) is also affected by β2a-subunit (20Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). While SSIN is complete for CaV2.3 alone or coexpressed with β1b, a residual component emerges (IRES) with β22. When we injected β2a protein in oocytes expressing CaV2.3 alone or the CaV2.3/β1b combination, voltage for half-inactivation was shifted to the right, and a significant component of IRES developed in both cases (Fig. 5, C and D; see also Table 2 for details).TABLE 2Mean ± S.E. of parameters defining the Boltzmann distribution and the percentage of residual current (IRES) that best fitted steady state inactivation for the different subunit combinationsSubunit compositionnV½ZIRESmV%Cav2.311-51.9 ± 1.22.20 ± 0.11-0.5 ± 0.9Cav2.3/β2a-prot.9-43.5 ± 1.02.20 ± 0.1428.2 ± 3.5Cav2.3/β2a-cRNA10-40.9 ± 4.61.89 ± 0.1317.2 ± 2.7Cav2.3/β1b-cRNA10-70.3 ± 1.12.34 ± 0.17-0.1 ± 0.5Cav2.3/β1b-cRNA + β2a protein18-61.4 ± 2.01.48 ± 0.0610.5 ± 1.4 Open table in a new tab The inhibition of inactivation by β2a protein in CaV2.3/β1b channel complexes may arise either by competitive inhibition or by allosteric modulation through a second binding site. To discriminate among both models, we studied the inhibition of inactivation by measuring T½ at different concentrations of β2a (Fig. 6). In CaV2.3/β1b channel complexes, increase in T½ requires higher concentration of β2a than CaV2.3 alone (1.2 μm versus 0.24 μm to increase T½ near half-maximal, respectively). With higher β2a concentration (>3 μm) channels inactivate similarly regardless of the presence of β1b (T½ = 6.4 ± 1.5s(n = 4) and 6.8 ± 2.0s(n = 5) for CaV2.3 alone or coexpressed with β1b, respectively). These results suggest a simple competitive replacement of β1b by β2a. To estimate the fraction of newly associated CaV2.3/β2a channel complexes, we modeled the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation of CaV2.3 and CaV2.3/β1b channels exposed to different concentrations of β2a protein (Fig. 7). Each subunit combination is expected to give rise to a SSIN of a particular shape. In oocytes expressing a mixture of subunit combinations, SSIN corresponds to the weighed sum of the template curves characterizing inactivation of CaV2.3, CaV2.3/β1b, and CaV2.3/β2a channels (CaV2.3SSIN, CaV2.3β1bSSIN, and CaV2.3β2aSSIN, respectively; Fig. 7A, inset). The three template curves were obtained by adjusting Boltzmann distributions to average IPEAK/IMAX curves from oocytes with the different subunit combinations. Following this approach we determined the relative weight of the CaV2.3β2a channel complexes (% β2a-like SSIN) and plotted against the different concentrations of β2a protein tested. From these plots, we obtained a dissociation constant of 0.35 μm for β2a on CaV2.3-expressing oocytes and 0.85 μm in CaV2.3/β1b background without changes in the maximal effect. Concomitantly, the relative weight of CaV2.3/β1b channels (%β1b-like SSIN) decreases with increasing concentration of β2a protein when β1b is present (Fig. 7B). Note also that in oocytes lacking the β1b-subunit, this component of inactivation was not detected. Together these results confirm the notion of a competitive reaction between β1b and β2a. The data presented here show that the α1-β-subunit interaction leading to modulation of channel activity can take place at the plasma membrane, is reversible, and depends on an intact AID site. The reversibility was shown by a novel approach that took advantage of the differential effect of two β-subunit isoforms, β1b and β2a, on the inactivation of CaV2.3 channels. Through a simple modeling of the voltage dependence of the steady state inactivation of the different subunit combinations, we estimated the KD in intact cells. CaV2.3/β1b channels were converted to channels with a behavior typical of CaV2.3/β2a channels upon the addition of β2a protein in a concentration-dependent manner that was consistent with the exchange of β-subunits governed by mass action law; i.e. the presence of β1b shifts the apparent KD without a change in the maximal effect when compared with CaV2.3 alone. Thus, our data are consistent with a competitive inhibition of inactivation of CaV2.3/β1b channel complexes by β2a protein. Although our analysis does not conclusively exclude a second binding site, evidence for a single site come from experiments showing that a covalently linked β2b to CaV1.2 recapitulates the effect of the auxiliary subunit on expression and function and no longer responds to coexpression of the β-subunit (9Dalton S. Takahashi S.X. Miriyala J. Colecraft H.M. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 757-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our case, with both subunit combinations, dose-response curves yield Hill coefficients between one and two (Fig. 7). Several factors may increase the apparent Hill coefficient, such as not attaining full equilibrium in the 5 h that elapsed between protein injection and electrophysiological recordings. According to our experience, longer incubation time reduces the activity of the purified β-subunit protein (4Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The KD values we measured in intact cells are hundred-fold larger than reported for in vitro binding to GST-AID fusion proteins. Affinity for the β-subunit may be lower for channels in the cell surface than in early stage of protein synthesis and folding as initially proposed by Birnbuamer and co-workers (2Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J.M. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A KD value in the micromolar range is also consistent with a rapidly reversible binding of the β-subunit that stands in contrast to the traditional view of an invariant stoichiometric subunit. This reversibility is important to other intracellular regulatory pathways involving the AID site. For example, G protein binds to a site near the AID sequence, displaces the β-subunit, and inhibits N and P/Q type calcium channel (21Dolphin A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Sandoz G. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Grunwald D. Bichet D. Altafaj X. Weiss N. Ronjat M. Dupuis A. De Waard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6267-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An issue that remains rather puzzling is our observation that CaV1.2-W470S, a mutant with impaired β-subunit binding and functional modulation, expresses well in the plasma membrane, as if binding of the β-subunit to the AID site were not mandatory for surface expression. It may be that the lack of the conserved tryptophan weakens binding to the AID to the point that is no longer detectable in vitro and on functional modulation, but it is sufficient to allow the β-subunit to occlude the putative endoplasmic reticulum retention signal encoded in the I–II loop. In light of recent experiments (23Maltez J.M. Nunziato D.A. Kim J. Pitt G.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showing that CaV2.1 can also reach the plasma membrane without the AID sequence, retention appears not to be as tight as initially thought, and perhaps the β-subunit may help traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to other sites of the α1-subunit. Alternatively, the CaV1.2 N-terminal truncation used in this study may help override the retention signal from the AID conferring independence of channel expression on the β-subunit. We have reported similar results for other β-subunit isoforms (4Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This uncoupling would also explain why N-terminal deletion mutant overexpresses (10Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we demonstrate that the interaction between the β-subunit and the pore-forming subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels is dynamic. The dynamic nature of this interaction allows for post-targeting modulation of channel function. Moreover, this interaction requires the AID site, proposed to control targeting of the channel to the plasma membrane. We thank Dr. Christoph Fahlke and David Naranjo for insightful discussions."

Eukaryotic mRNA precursors undergo a 3′ processing reaction in the cell nucleus in which almost all mRNAs receive a poly(A) tail. Most newly made poly(A) tails are of a more or less uniform, species-specific length, about 250 nucleotides in mammals (1Brawerman G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 10: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and 70–90 nucleotides in yeast (2Groner B. Hynes N. Philips S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5378-5383Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After export to the cytoplasm, poly(A) tails are gradually shortened. This shortening reaction, termed deadenylation, is the first step in mRNA decay (3Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 4Muhlrad D. Parker R.

A third enzyme, the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) (30Körner C. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) is not present in all eukaryotes. PARN is involved in an oocyte-specific, sequence-independent deadenylation reaction in Xenopus (31Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and also seems to act on certain mRNAs in plants (32Reverdatto S.V. Dutko J.A. Chekanova J.A. Hamilton D.A. Belostotsky D.A. RNA. 2004; 10: 1200-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the general role of the enzyme in poly(A) tail metabolism remains poorly defined.Poly(A) tail shortening also plays an important role in the translational control of mRNAs in oocytes and early embryonic development. Oocytes accumulate large amounts of maternal RNAs that are translationally silent until they are activated at specific stages of oocyte maturation or early development, before the onset of zygotic transcription (33Wickens M. Goodwin E.B. Kimble J. Strickland S. Hentze M. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 295-370Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated in several different biological systems that translational silencing depends on the shortening of poly(A) tails, whereas translational activation requires poly(A) tail extension (34Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 35Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression.

Proteomic. 2004; 3: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This function of regulated changes in poly(A) tail length is probably related to the fact that the poly(A) tail and the associated cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein play a role in the initiation of translation (34Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 36Gorgoni B. Gray N.K. Brief. Funct. Genomic.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-465Google Scholar). In maturing Xenopus oocytes, poly(A) tail shortening is a sequence-independent default reaction that appears to be catalyzed by PARN, as mentioned above. In contrast, deadenylation is message-specific and sequence-dependent during embryogenesis (38Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Voeltz G.K. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7537-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Thompson S.R.

Standart N. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and has led to the identification of the protein EDEN-BP as an activator of deadenylation (38Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 43Paillard L. Legagneux V. Osborne H.B. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the responsible deadenylase has not been identified.Translational regulation of maternal mRNAs is essential in the formation of the anterior-posterior body axis in the Drosophila embryo. The posterior determinant, the Nanos (Nos) protein (44Wang C. Lehmann R. Cell. 1991; 66: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), together with other proteins binds the maternal hunchback (hb) mRNA, repressing its translation and limiting the expression of Hb protein to the anterior part of the embryo (45Macdonald P.M. Smibert C.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Dean K.A. Aggarwal A.K. Wharton R.P.

Development. 1997; 124: 3015-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deadenylation contributes to but is not essential for translational repression of hb (46Dean K.A. Aggarwal A.K. Wharton R.P.

A. 2001; 98: 11359-11364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nos itself is also subject to translation regulation; a small fraction of nos RNA is localized to the posterior pole of the embryo, and it is only here that the RNA is translated. A Nos protein concentration gradient then develops by diffusion in the embryonic syncytium (50Gavis E.R. Lehmann R. Cell. 1992; 71: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 51Gavis E.R. Lehmann R. Nature. 1994; 369: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The large majority of the nos RNA is distributed uniformly throughout the embryo (52Bergsten S.E. Gavis E.R. Development. 1999; 126: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Bashirullah A. Halsell S.R. Cooperstock R.L. Kloc M. Karaiskakis A. Fisher W.W. Fu W. Hamilton J.K. Etkin L.D. Lipshitz H.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Translation of this unlocalized RNA is repressed by the protein Smaug, which binds two Smaug response elements (SREs) in the proximal part of the nos 3′-UTR (54Dahanukar A. Walker J.A. Wharton R.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 55Smibert C.A. Lie Y.S. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Macdonald P.M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Bulk nos RNA has a relatively short poly(A) tail of up to about 50 nucleotides (58Sallés F.J. Lieberfarb M.E. Wreden C. Gergen J.P. Strickland S. Science. 1994; 266: 1996-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 59Gavis E.R. Lunsford L. Bergsten S.E. Lehmann R. Development. 1996; 122: 2791-2800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-localized nos RNA decays gradually; its degradation is complete at 2–3 h of embryonic development. Importantly, degradation depends on the SREs (53Bashirullah A. Halsell S.R. Cooperstock R.L. Kloc M. Karaiskakis A. Fisher W.W. Fu W. Hamilton J.K. Etkin L.D. Lipshitz H.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 56Smibert C.A. Wilson J.E. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M.

Several lines of evidence indicated that the regulation of nos RNA might involve poly(A) tail shortening induced by Smaug; a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of Smaug, Vts1p, also binds SREs and leads to accelerated decay of SRE-containing reporter RNAs, which requires the deadenylase subunit Ccr4p (60Aviv T. Lin Z. Lau S. Rendl L.M. Sicheri F. Smibert C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Smaug induces the deadenylation of the unstable hsp83 mRNA by the CCR4·NOT complex (25Semotok J.L. Cooperstock R.L. Pinder B.D. Vari H.K. Lipshitz H.D. Smibert C.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 284-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).A mechanistic understanding of sequence-dependent accelerated deadenylation will require studies in a cell-free system. Therefore, we have used extracts of Drosophila embryos to examine the regulation of nos mRNA in vitro. We confirm that the nos 3′-UTR causes a very strong translational repression in vitro. We have discovered that the same extracts exhibit a pronounced SRE-dependent deadenylation activity, supporting the prediction of Smaug-induced deadenylation. The activity requires ATP hydrolysis and is associated with rapidly sedimenting particles. Translation is strongly enhanced by the poly(A) tail in the embryo extract, so SRE-dependent deadenylation represses translation. However, a second aspect of repression functions independently of deadenylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExtracts—Cytoplasmic extract of 0–2-h-old Drosophila embryos (Canton S) was prepared according to Tuschl et al. (61Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Lehmann R. Bartel D.P. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3191-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (62Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) was either obtained from Promega or donated by A. Ostareck-Lederer and N. Flach.DNA Templates for in Vitro Transcription—Nucleotides 7–161 of the nanos 3′-UTR (kindly supplied by D. Curtis and R. Lehmann) were PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides that introduced a 5′ BglII site and a 3′ BamHI site. The PCR product was cloned into the BglII and BamHI sites of a BSK vector containing the Photinus pyralis luciferase coding region upstream of the BglII site and a poly(A) tract of 72 residues downstream of the BamHI site (a gift of F. Gebauer). RNA obtained by transcription of this plasmid is called luciferase nos. Nucleotides 286–433 of the hunchback 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified from the hunchback cDNA (obtained from D. Curtis and R. Lehmann), and the resulting fragment was cloned in an inverted orientation into the BglII-BamHI site of the luciferase cassette. Transcription resulted in the RNA luciferase control. The two SREs of the nanos 3′-UTR were changed by site-directed mutagenesis from CTGGC to CTCGC (luciferase nos-SRE– RNA). The AU-rich stem region of the nanos 3′-UTR (nt 50–62) was changed from TTTATATAACATG to TTAAAAAAACATG (luciferase nos-IIIA RNA). The same mutation was also introduced into the plasmid already carrying the SRE– double mutation (luciferase nos-SRE–-IIIA RNA). For the generation of shortened RNAs to be used in deadenylation assays, most of the luciferase coding region was removed from the plasmids described above by digestion with SacI and EcoRV and religation. Upon digestion of the DNA templates with HindIII, BamHI, or KpnI, transcription resulted in RNAs carrying a poly(A) tail, lacking a poly(A) tail, or carrying an internal poly(A) region followed by 40 residues of mixed sequence, respectively. The template for the “SRE only” RNA was generated with the help of the synthetic oligonucleotide CAGAGGCTCTGGCAGCTTTTGAGCGTTACTAGCGCCTGGCGCGTTCGAG. The underlined sequences correspond to the two authentic SREs from the nos 3′-UTR, with the loop sequences in bold. A complementary oligonucleotide added overhangs corresponding to a SacI site upstream and a BamHI site down-stream, and the double strand was cloned into the vector described above from which the luciferase coding sequence had been removed by SacI-BamHI digestion. For the “SRE– only” RNA, DNA oligonucleotides were used that generated SRE loops with the mutant sequence CTCGC. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RNAs derived from these templates are shown schematically in Fig. 1.In Vitro Transcription—RNAs used for translation assays were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) in the presence of 7 mm m7GpppG (New England Biolabs or KEDAR, Warsaw, Poland), 1 mm concentrations each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences). After a 5-min preincubation, GTP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reaction was left at 37 °C for 2 h. After a 20-min digestion with 1.5 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science), the RNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, dissolved, and purified over a Sephadex G50 spun column. RNA substrates used for deadenylation assays were synthesized as above with UTP reduced to 0.2 mm. When desired, ApppG (New England Biolabs) was used instead of m7GpppG. For later assays, cap analogues were omitted.In Vitro Translation Assay—In vitro translation assays contained 40% (v/v) extract, 2 nm luciferase RNA, 16 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 μm concentrations of an amino acid mixture (Promega), 250 ng/μl S. cerevisiae tRNA (Roche Applied Science), 50 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm spermidine, 20 mm creatine phosphate (Roche Applied Science), 80 ng/μl creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science), 800 μm ATP, and 100 μm GTP. The reaction, containing Drosophila embryo extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate, was incubated at 26 or 37 °C, respectively, for the times indicated. Luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega).Deadenylation Assays—32P-Labeled RNA constructs lacking the luciferase coding region were incubated at 26 °C under conditions similar to the in vitro translation assays. 20% (v/v) of embryo extract was used, and the amino acid mixture, and in later experiments, GTP, were omitted. After incubation the RNA was phenol-extracted, precipitated, resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide/urea gel, and detected by phosphorimaging. Quantitative evaluation was as follows; radioactivity corresponding to the deadenylated product and total radioactivity in each lane (the gel area from just above the substrate RNA to just below the deadenylated product) were calculated from the phosphorimaging data, numbers were obtained for the corresponding areas of an empty gel lane were subtracted as background, and the amount of product was expressed as % of total. The apparent amount of product present in unreacted substrate RNA was usually about 1%, and this number was again subtracted as background from deadenylation products generated during the incubation. For ATP depletion, creatine kinase was omitted from the deadenylation reaction, 0.1 units/μl of hexokinase (Roche Applied Science) and 10 mm glucose were added, and the sample was preincubated for 5 min at 26 °C. ATP depletion was confirmed by the addition of a trace amount of [α-32P]ATP at the beginning of the preincubation and analysis by thin layer chromatography using polyethyleneimine-cellulose (Merck) and 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl as a solvent. The reaction was then started by the addition of substrate RNA. For RNase H digestion, the RNA recovered from the reaction (∼50 fmol) was incubated with 2.5 pmol of dT12 and 2 units of RNase H (Promega) in a 50-μl reaction for 45 min at 37 °C. When an oligonucleotide hybridizing to an internal RNA sequence was used, ∼3 fmol of radioactive RNA recovered from a deadenylation reaction was incubated in a 20-μl reaction with 100 nmol of oligo(dT), 2 μmol of specific oligonucleotide (5′-ATCTCTCTGA), and 1.5 units of RNase H for 40 min at 37 °C. The buffer for RNase H digestions was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 unit/μl of RNasin (Promega).Ultracentrifugation—Embryo extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C and 50,000 rpm (equivalent to Ø103,000 × g) in a Beckman Optima™ TLX Ultracentrifuge and a TLA 100.3 rotor. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 15 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm magnesium acetate.Antibodies and Western Blots—Antibodies to Smaug, Pacman, and Me31B were kindly supplied by R. Wharton, S. Newbury, and A. Nakamura, respectively. Antibodies to CCR4 and POP2/CAF1 have been described (24Temme C. Zaessinger S. Simonelig M. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2862-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Bases 1912–3355 of the NOT1 (CG1884) coding sequence were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA prepared from Drosophila S2 cells and cloned into the PvuII site of the pRSET C expression vector (Invitrogen). The NOT2 (CG2161) and NOT3 (CG8426) coding sequences were amplified by PCR from full-length cDNA clones (NOT2, clone GM14102; NOT3, clone LD13864, both from the BACPAC resources center), and both fragments were cloned with blunt ends into a pET19b expression vector (Novagen) modified by insertion of a SmaI site to allow cloning in-frame with the His tag. The EcoRI fragment (bases 1460–2285 of the coding sequence) of the NOT4 (CG31716) full-length cDNA clone (clone RE04975 from BACPAC) was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pRSET C expression vector. All sequences were cloned in-frame with an N-terminal His tag. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Codon+ cells and purified by solubilization from inclusion bodies and chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column in 8 m urea. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were produced by Eurogentec (Belgium). If necessary, SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices containing the antigen of interest were used for immunization. Further details are available upon request. Western blots were done essentially as described (24Temme C. Zaessinger S. Simonelig M. Wahle E.

In this interval of development, translation of non-localized nos mRNA is repressed by Smaug (56Smibert C.A. Wilson J.E. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2600-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In translation experiments with luciferase reporters, the extracts displayed a very strong repression by the nos 3′-UTR (see below). Three substrate RNAs were initially generated; the nos RNA carried a segment of nucleotides 7–161 from the nos 3′-UTR. This segment contains both SREs and is sufficient for translational control in vivo (56Smibert C.A. Wilson J.E. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2600-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 57Dahanukar A. Wharton R.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the control RNA, the nos sequence was replaced by an irrelevant sequence (antisense to nucleotides 286–433 of the hb 3′-UTR). The nos-SRE– RNA differed from the nos RNA by two point mutations changing the CUGGC loop sequence to CUCGC in each of the two SREs of the nos 3′-UTR. These point mutations abolish translational regulation and Smaug binding (56Smibert C.A. Wilson J.E. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2600-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All RNAs were capped and contained a poly(A) tail of 72 nucleotides, encoded in the transcription template, 22 nucleotides downstream of the inserted Drosophila sequences. These RNAs and all others used in this work are shown schematically in Fig. 1.The RNAs were incubated in the embryo extract under conditions similar to those used for translation and then examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The nos RNA was rapidly shortened to about the length expected for the completely deadenylated product; the shortened product remained stable (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the two nos SREs abolished deadenylation almost completely (∼20-fold reduction in deadenylation rate). Shortening of the control RNA was also barely detectable, and very little deadenylated product accumulated during the 60-min incubation (Fig. 2A). An RNA in which only the upstream SRE had been inactivated by point mutation was still rapidly dea"
https://openalex.org/W2121771103,"Lung endothelial damage is a characteristic morphological feature of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, although the molecular steps involved in the loss of endothelial integrity are still poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cell signaling would be responsible for the increase in lung vascular permeability seen early after the onset of I/R in rats. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the I/R-induced pulmonary edema would be significantly attenuated in rats by the activation of the stress protein response. Pretreatment with Ad Flk-1, an adenovirus encoding for the soluble VEGF receptor type II, prevented I/R-mediated increase in lung vascular permeability in rats. Furthermore, the I/R-induced lung injury was significantly decreased by prior activation of the stress protein response with geldanamycin or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. In vitro studies demonstrated that VEGF caused an increase in protein permeability across primary cultures of bovine macro- and microvascular lung endothelial cell monolayers that were associated with a phosphorylation of VE- and E-cadherin and the formation of actin stress fibers. Activation of the stress protein response prevented the VEGF-mediated changes in protein permeability across these cell monolayers and reduced the phosphorylation of VE-and E-cadherins, as well as the formation of actin stress fibers in these cells."

Structural modeling predicts an interhelical hydrophobic interface between paired EF hands in the proximal region of the NaV1.5 COOH terminus. The predicted interface is conserved among almost all EF hand-containing proteins and is the locus of a number of disease-associated mutations. Using the structural model as a guide, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the structural integrity of this interface is necessary for proper Na+ channel inactivation gating.

Channelopathies, so named because they represent a set of diseases caused by mutations in genes coding for ion channels, are a new and growing class of human disorders that include but are not limited to diabetes, muscle disorders, neurological disease, and cardiac arrhythmias (1Hubner C.A. Jentsch T.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2435-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A surprising number of channelopathies associated with a wide diversity of human disease are caused by similar mutation-induced changes in ion channel function. Inactivation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels is an example of a physiological process critically important in many tissues that, when altered by mutation, can result in muscle weakness, inherited epilepsies, autism, or cardiac arrhythmia (2George Jr., A.L. Epilepsy Curr. 2004; 4: 65-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jurkat-Rott K. Lerche H. Lehmann-Horn F. J. Neurol. 2002; 249: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Kass R.S. Moss A.J.

Clinical consequences of inherited mutations that disrupt Na+ channel inactivation provide the most direct link between ion channel biophysics and human physiology and pathophysiology. Conversely, investigation into the consequences of inherited mutations on ion channel function has, in many cases, provided insight into the physiological importance of novel regions and/or structures of ion channel proteins. In the heart, Na+ channels (NaV1.5) 4The abbreviations used are: NaV1.5, voltage-gated sodium channel isoform 1.5; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ISUS, sustained current; WT, wild type; TTX, tetrodotoxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 4The abbreviations used are: NaV1.5, voltage-gated sodium channel isoform 1.5; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ISUS, sustained current; WT, wild type; TTX, tetrodotoxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney. primarily underlie action potential initiation and propagation but more recently have been shown to be critical determinants of action potential duration, particularly in the setting of certain inherited channelopathies. Inherited mutations in SCN5A, the gene coding for NaV1.5, are now known to underlie multiple inherited cardiac arrhythmias, including the congenital long QT syndrome variant 3, Brugada syndrome, and isolated conduction disease (5Clancy C.E. Kass R.S. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and in most cases, these inherited mutations disrupt channel inactivation. Fast inactivation of Na+ channels is due to rapid block of the inner mouth of the channel pore by the cytoplasmic linker between domains III and IV that occurs within milliseconds of membrane depolarization (6Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Inherited mutations of the III/IV linker in the cardiac Na+ channel can disrupt fast inactivation, resulting in sustained current (ISUS), which can cause long QT syndrome variant 3 (5Clancy C.E. Kass R.S. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the NaV1.5 COOH terminus also has been shown to play a role in inactivation both through chimeric studies (7Mantegazza M. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15348-15353Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), through the characterization of several disease-linked mutations found in the C terminus (8Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C.

Res. 1998; 83: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and by direct biochemical evidence for COOH terminus interactions with the cytoplasmic peptide that links domains III and IV of the α subunit (III-IV linker) (12Motoike H.K.

Here we have tested the hypothesis that preservation of COOH terminus structure may also be critically important to NaV1.5 channel inactivation. Previously, we generated a structural model of the NaV1.5 C terminus based on homology to the amino-terminal lobe of calmodulin (14Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The model predicts six α-helices (H1-H6), the first four forming two EF-hand pairs. EF hands are helix-loop-helix motifs that typically, although not always, bind Ca2+ in the loops between helices and generally occur in pairs. One helix from each EF-hand pair is predicted to form interhelical contacts with a helix from the opposite EF hand, H1 with H4 and H2 with H3. In the present experiments, we focus on a possible role of the putative interface between H1 and H4 in stabilizing the COOH terminus structure and, in turn, in the control of channel inactivation. The predicted interface in NaV1.5 was initially of interest to us not only because several naturally occurring mutations predicted to be near it disrupt inactivation and cause multiple types of cardiac arrhythmias (8Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bezzina C. Veldkamp M.W. van Den Berg M.P. Postma A.V. Rook M.B.

However, the importance of this interface may be more general than its role in sodium channel function, because in structures for EF hand proteins there are extensive side chain interactions between helices analogous to the first (H1) and fourth (H4) predicted helices in the NaV1.5 C terminus (see, on the World Wide Web, structbio.vanderbilt.edu/cabp_database/struct/cmaps/cmap_list.html). In addition, hydrophobic residues are conserved at this interface among EF-hand proteins (18Kretsinger R.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Linse S. Voorhies M. Norstrom E. Schultz D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Alignment of the first four helices of all voltage-gated sodium channels demonstrates significant homology in H1 and H4, whereas H2 and H3 are not well conserved among these channels (see supplemental data). We thus focused our experiments on possible interactions between helices H1 and H4. Our results indicate that mutation of hydrophobic residues integral to the H1/H4 interface disrupts protein stability and markedly alters channel inactivation, providing evidence that stabilization of the COOH terminus structure via the H1/H4 hydrophobic interface is necessary to preserve physiologically essential inactivation of the NaV1.5 channel. Computational Analysis—A homology model was generated as described previously (14Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alignments were performed using ClustalX (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) with default parameters. Molecular Biology and Tissue Culture—Site-directed mutagenesis for electrophysiological studies was carried out on NaV1.5 in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type NaV1.5 and NaV1.5 mutants were transiently transfected with β1 subunits into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as previously described (21Tateyama M. Liu H. Yang A.S. Cormier J.W. Kass R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1843-1851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plasmid used to grow proteins for fluorescence experiments was generated using QuikChange mutagenesis on a previously generated plasmid of the NaV1.5 COOH terminus in the pGEX vector (14Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The predicted unstructured proximal region (residues 1773-1785) was deleted using QuikChange reactions, and a stop codon was inserted following the residue at 1863. The resulting construct (NaV1.5 EF) contained those residues predicted to form the EF hands (residues 1786-1863) in the pGEX vector with a thrombin cleavage site following the coding region for GST and preceding residues 1786-1863. Electrophysiology—Wild type and mutant human sodium channel α subunits were co-expressed with human β1 subunits in HEK 293 cells, and currents were measured with whole cell patch clamp procedures as previously described (12Motoike H.K. Liu H. Glaaser I.W. Yang A.S. Tateyama M. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Tateyama M. Liu H. Yang A.S. Cormier J.W. Kass R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1843-1851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, whole cell Na+ current was recorded at room temperature (22 °C) using the following solutions. The internal solution contained aspartic acid (50 mmol/liter), CsCl (60 mmol/liter), Na2-ATP (5 mmol/liter), EGTA (11 mmol/liter), HEPES (10 mmol/liter), CaCl2 (1 mmol/liter), and MgCl2 (1 mmol/liter), with pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH. The external solution contained NaCl (130 mmol/liter), CaCl2 (2 mmol/liter), CsCl (5 mmol/liter), MgCl2 (1.2 mmol/liter), HEPES (10 mmol/liter), and glucose (5 mmol/liter), with pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH. The voltage dependence of inactivation was determined after application of conditioning pulses (500 ms) applied once every 2 s to a series of voltages followed by a test pulse (20 ms) to voltages from -130 to -20 mV. In experiments designed to measure the voltage dependence of activation, external Na+ was reduced to 30 mm using n-methyl-glucamine as an Na+ substitute. Current was measured using test pulses (40 ms) from a holding potential of -100 mV to voltages ranging from -80 to +75 mV. Persistent Na+ channel current (ISUS) was measured as the tetrodotoxin (TTX; 30 μm)-sensitive current measured at 150 ms (Tyr1795 constructs) or 200 ms (all other constructs) during depolarization to -10 mV. Unless otherwise specified, the holding potential was -100 mV. ISUS was normalized to peak TTX-sensitive Na+ channel current measured at -10 mV and plotted as percentage of peak current in relevant figures. Membrane currents were measured using whole cell patch clamp procedures, with Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Capacity current and series resistance compensation were carried out using analog techniques according to the amplifier manufacturer (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). PClamp8 (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and initial analysis. Data are represented as mean values ± S.E. Protein Expression and Purification—Fusion proteins were transformed in BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown to an A600 of ∼0.6, and then expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and shaking for 72 h at 16 °C. After induction, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science), DNase, MgCl2, and lysozyme. Following incubation at room temperature, the samples were sonicated, and the lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation. The NaV1.5 EF-GST fusion proteins were further purified through affinity purification on GSTrap FF columns (Amersham Biosciences). GST eluate was thrombin-digested, and proteins were then further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75pg 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions that eluted at the appropriate time relative to previously analyzed protein standards were collected for fluorescence measurements. Mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) was carried out to confirm sample purity and that the protein samples were the full-length polypeptide. Samples were collected at all stages, run on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide precast gels (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration for the NaV1.5 EF was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8370 m-1 cm-1. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer in a 2-ml quartz cuvette (Hellma). Protein samples were at a concentration of 5 μm in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, or the denatured protein in the same buffer plus urea at a concentration of 7.6 m. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was excited at λex = 295 nm and monitored for fluorescence emission between 295 and 395 nm. The fluorescence contributions of the buffer, urea, and acrylamide were subtracted from the total fluorescence. Fluorescence quenching data were collected with the sequential addition of the 5 m acrylamide as the quencher. Stern-Vollmer plots were constructed according to the Stern-Vollmer equation, Fo/F=1+KSV[Q](Eq. 1) where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher acrylamide at concentration [Q], and KSV is the Stern-Vollmer constant. Analysis of Experimental Data—Analysis was carried out in Excel (Microsoft), Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), and programs written in Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). Data are represented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Computational Analysis of NaV1.5 COOH Terminus Predicts a Hydrophobic Interface—We previously generated a structural model of the NaV1.5 COOH terminus based on homology to the CaM amino-terminal lobe (14Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The model predicts a structured proximal region containing six α-helices (H1-H6), in which the first four helices are predicted to form two EF-hand pairs. One helix from each of these EF hands is predicted to form an interface with a helix from the opposite hand pair, H1 with H4 and H2 with H3 (Fig. 1A). Alignments using ClustalX (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) with default parameters predict significant structural homology between the first four predicted helices of the NaV1.5 COOH terminus and helices from NMR and x-ray crystallographic studies of EF hand proteins (Fig. 1B). Whereas residues from all of the helices in paired EF hand motifs make contributions to a hydrophobic core, a cluster of hydrophobic residues, including several that are similar among EF hand proteins, is predicted at the interface between H1 and H4 (Fig. 2A, residues marked with asterisks below). We thus focused on possible interactions between these two helices and used the predictions of the model as well as what appears to be conservation of critical hydrophobic residues as a guide in determining mutations that might be expected to perturb the interface and used inactivation gating to assay the effects of these perturbations on channel function.FIGURE 2Conservation of predicted hydrophobic interface between the first (H1) and fourth (H4) helices of NaV1.5 CT and EF-hand proteins. A, sequence alignment of predicted structural regions examined in this study. Shown are the predicted first and fourth helices. Asterisks below the alignment indicate hydrophobic residues conserved among aligned EF-hand proteins. B, structural model of NaV1.5 CT showing the first and fourth predicted helices.

We thus first focused on this locus. Mutation of this residue to glutamate (Y1795E) alters channel inactivation, as reflected in an increase in sustained channel activity. Current traces are illustrated in Fig. 3A, and the mutation-induced increase in sustained current (ISUS) in response to prolonged depolarization (right traces) is evident when compared with traces from wild type (WT) channels (left traces). Space-filling models of the side chain substitution at this residue within the model (Fig. 3B) illustrate the relative difference in size of the side chains of these amino acids (197 Å3 for tyrosine and 134.8 Å3 for glutamate (22Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar)). Replacement of Tyr1795 by Glu increases ISUS in a manner that is very similar to previously reported changes in ISUS caused by the naturally occurring mutation Y1795C (10Rivolta I. Abriel H. Tateyama M. Liu H. Memmi M. Vardas P. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30623-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C and Table 1) that results in a slightly larger change in the size of the residue side chain (108.5 Å3 for the cysteine side chain (22Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar)). We thus asked whether mutation-altered inactivation correlated with possible structural alteration of the H1/H4 interface and constructed a series of mutations to test this hypothesis (Fig. 3C). Substitution of Y1795 by either nonpolar resides (Y1795A) or nonaromatic, charged residues (Y1795E, Y1795R), in addition to small nucleophilic residues (Y1795C, Y1795S), significantly increased ISUS (Fig. 3C). However, substitution with other aromatic residues (Y1795F or Y1795W) showed no significant alteration in persistent current. Substitution with a total of eight residues was carried out and confirmed significant differences in ISUS only between channels with aromatic (including WT channels) and nonaromatic residues (Fig. 3C and Table 1) with the exception of the Y1795H mutation. The Y1795H mutation, which has been linked to Brugada syndrome (10Rivolta I. Abriel H. Tateyama M. Liu H. Memmi M. Vardas P. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30623-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), results in an increase in ISUS despite its aromatic nature (Fig. 3C and Table 1). This can be attributed to the at least partial positive charge that histidine would be expected to have in the cytoplasm. Thus, our data suggest that there is a spatial and hydrophobic importance to residues predicted to be near the interface.TABLE 1Summary of mutations Sustained sodium current were measured in response to prolonged depolarization.

The importance of the presence of an aromatic ring or charged residue at position 1795 in the maintenance of inactivation gating raises the possibility that spacing between helices H1 and H4, determined in part by the presence of an aromatic ring at residue 1795, may be critical to channel gating and, in turn, that a putative H1/H4 interface may play a key role in the structural integrity of the COOH terminus domain. Mutation of Trp1798 Disrupts Channel Gating—If integrity of an H1/H4 interface is key to control of inactivation, mutations of other hydrophobic residues predicted to form the interface would be expected to cause similar or more severe alteration in gating (inactivation), depending on the importance of the mutated residue to the integrity of the interface. We thus systematically studied the functional consequences of mutation of additional residues predicted to be within (Fig. 2B), and possibly critical to, the interhelical interface: Trp1798 (helix 1) and Ile1853 and Leu1854 (helix 4). The functional consequences of the Trp1798 mutations are very similar to those that accompany mutation of Tyr1795, affecting inactivation with relatively minor effects on channel activation (Table 1). Introduction of nonaromatic residues (W1798A and W1798E) produced significant increases in ISUS (Fig. 4B) with accompanying negative shifts in steady-state inactivation (Fig. 4C). Similar to changes made at residue 1795, conservation of the aromatic ring at residue 1798 (W1798F) did not alter ISUS, but, in contrast with the Y1795F mutation, did shift steady-state inactivation. Because Trp1798 is predicted to be more integral to the putative hydrophobic interface than Tyr1795, we also replaced the native tryptophan by a leucine, which is a large hydrophobic, but not aromatic, residue. We found that the W1798L mutation did not increase ISUS (Fig. 4B). However, this mutation, similar to the W1798F mutation, did produce a negative shift in the voltage dependence of steady state in activation (Table 1). Mutations of Hydrophobic Residues on the Partner Helix Alter Inactivation—We next tested two H4 residues predicted to be critical to the interface within the framework of our computational model: an isoleucine at residue 1853 (Ile1853) and a leucine at residue 1854 (Leu1854). Residues at similar loci on EF-hand proteins are conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2A). Based on the linear sequence of the protein, one might expect similar effects when either residue is mutated. However, the modeling of the protein structure places residue Ile1853 at a location that is more critical to the putative interhelical interface and thus predicts that mutation of Ile1853 may have a greater impact on the hydrophobic interface than mutation of residue Leu1854. Our functional experimental data support the predictions of the model. We find that mutation of each of these residues has marked consequences on channel gating; however, mutation of Ile1853 causes much greater disruption of inactivation, as reflected in increased ISUS as well as the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, than comparable mutation of residue Leu1854. Replacement of Leu1854 by a hydrophilic glutamate residue (L1854E), but not a nonpolar alanine residue (L1854A), results in a small, but significant, increase in ISUS with modest effects on steady-state inactivation (Fig. 5, A, C, and D).

For example, transport by the apical Na+-glucose cotransporter, SGLT1, triggers translocation of NHE3, Na+-H+ antiporter isoform 3, to the plasma membrane. This translocation requires activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Akt2, and ezrin. Akt2 directly phosphorylates ezrin, but the precise role of p38 MAPK in this process remains to be defined. Sequence analysis suggested that p38 MAPK could not directly phosphorylate Akt2. We hypothesized that MAPKAPK-2 might link p38 MAPK and Akt2 activation. MAPKAPK-2 was phosphorylated after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport with kinetics that paralleled activation of p38 MAPK, Akt2, and ezrin. MAPKAPK-2, Akt2, and ezrin phosphorylation were all attenuated by p38 MAPK inhibition but were unaffected by dominant negative ezrin expression. Akt2 inhibition blocked ezrin but not p38 MAPK or MAPKAPK-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that MAPKAPK-2 could be an intermediate in p38 MAPK-dependent Akt2 activation. Consistent with this, MAP-KAPK-2 could phosphorylate an Akt2-derived peptide in vitro. siRNA-mediated MAPKAPK-2 knockdown inhibited phosphorylation of Akt2 and ezrin but not p38 MAPK. MAPKAPK-2 knockdown also blocked NHE3 translocation. Thus, MAP-KAPK-2 controls Akt2 phosphorylation. In so doing, MAP-KAPK-2 links p38 MAPK to Akt2, ezrin, and NHE3 activation after SGLT1-mediated transport."
https://openalex.org/W2002590094,"Deadenylation is the rate-limiting step of mRNA decay, yet little is known about the mechanism regulating this process. In yeast, deadenylation is mainly mediated by the Pop2-Ccr4 complex. We tested whether the selective recruitment of this deadenylase to target mRNAs was sufficient to stimulate their decay in vivo. For this purpose, the Pop2 factor was fused to a U1A RNA binding domain while U1A binding sites were inserted in untranslated regions of a reporter transcript. Analysis of the reporter fate in strains expressing the Pop2-U1A-RBD fusion demonstrated a specific activation of target mRNA decay. Increased mRNA degradation involved accumulation of deadenylated mRNAs that was not detected when the control factors Dcp2 or Pub1 were tethered to the same transcript. The rapid target mRNA degradation was also accompanied by the appearance of new decay intermediates generated by the 3′ -5′ trimming of the corresponding 3′ -untranslated region. Interestingly, this process was not mediated by the exosome but may result from the activity of the Pop2-Ccr4 deadenylase itself. These results indicate that selective recruitment of the Pop2-Ccr4 deadenylase is sufficient to activate mRNA decay, even though this process can also be stimulated by additional mechanisms.

Furthermore, deadenylase recruitment affects the downstream path of mRNA decay. Regulation of gene expression is a fundamental process occurring in all organisms. Since messenger RNAs were hypothesized to carry the information contained in the genome to protein-synthesizing ribosomes, it has become clear that gene regulation could be controlled at many steps, including transcription and mRNA decay (1Jacob F. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 318-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). Although the process of transcription has been analyzed for a long time in eukaryotes, studies devoted to the degradation of the corresponding mRNAs are more recent. This task is complicated by the occurrence of parallel pathways that have been conserved from yeast to human. Two pathways have been reported to target “normal” (i.e. non-defective) cytoplasmic mRNAs (2Meyer S. Temme C. Wahle E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Cougot N. van Dijk E. Babajko S. Seraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 436-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The major yeast mRNA degradation pathway acts in a 5′ 3′ direction. It involves deadenylation of the substrate mRNA that induces cap cleavage before 5′-3′ exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA body. A minor degradation pathway also involves mRNA deadenylation. However, this step is then followed by 3′-5′ degradation of the mRNA body. These pathways appear to be conserved from yeast to human cells. In the latter case, cytoplasmic degradation of specific mRNAs has also been shown to be initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage (4van Dijk E.L. Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the majority of mRNA turnover in human cells occurs by 3′-5′ degradation (5Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Deadenylation is a common step in the degradation of normal mRNAs by the 5′-3′- and 3′-5′ pathways. This process has been shown to be rate-limiting (6Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In yeast, deadenylation is mostly mediated by the Pop2-Ccr4 complex (7Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), which degrades poly(A) tails of substrate mRNAs with kinetics varying for each target substrate. Deadenylation proceeds until 10–15 A residues are left on the target mRNA. In many cases, this shortening induces, by an unknown process, the cleavage of the mRNA cap by the Dcp2 factor (3Cougot N. van Dijk E. Babajko S. Seraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 436-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases deadenylation is followed by the exonucleolytic 3′-5′ decay of the mRNA body that is mediated by a multinuclease complex called the exosome (9van Hoof A. Parker R. Cell. 1999; 99: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The major yeast deadenylase was identified as the Pop2-Ccr4 complex (7Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), which was originally suggested to repress transcription (10Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Collart M.A. Timmers H.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 289-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both the Pop2 and Ccr4 subunits of this large assembly are endowed with catalytic nuclease activities (7Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R.

Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The major catalytic activity in vivo can be attributed to Ccr4 because point mutations in its active site were shown to affect mRNA degradation whereas mutations of the Pop2 subunit had little effect. However, Pop2 has been shown to be phosphorylated in the absence of glucose, suggesting that it may participate actively to deadenylation on specific occasions (15Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Pop2-Ccr4 complex is evolutionary conserved. Like their yeast counterparts, mammalian orthologs of Pop2 and Ccr4 have been shown to associate in a complex that displays nuclease activity (16Bianchin C. Mauxion F. Sentis S. Seraphin B. Corbo L. RNA. 2005; 11: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Viswanathan P. Ohn T. Chiang Y.C. Chen J. Denis C.L. J. Biol.

BMC Genomics. 2001; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Additional deadenylases have been identified, including PARN in vertebrates (19Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the Pan2-Pan3 complex in yeast and human (20Boeck R. Tarun S. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A.

Biol. 2003; 13: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PARN was suggested to be the major deadenylase in vertebrate cells. However, this idea was challenged as it appears to be conserved only in this evolutionary group, and functional analysis indicated a major role for Pan2 and Pop2-Ccr4 in mRNA deadenylation (21Yamashita A. Chang T.C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast, genetic analyses demonstrated that the Pop2-Ccr4 complex represents the major deadenylase in yeast and Drosophila (7Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Temme C. Zaessinger S. Meyer S. Simonelig M. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2862-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas deletions of Pan2 or Pan3 were found to have few consequences on mRNA turnover in yeast (24Brown C.E. Tarun S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because deadenylation is the rate-limiting step for mRNA decay, it constitutes a major regulatory step for mRNA stability (6Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). However, little is known about its regulation. The Pop2-Ccr4 complex has been shown to be associated with several other factors, NotI-5, Caf130, and Caf40, that have been shown to contribute to its regulation through unknown mechanisms (10Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Collart M.A. Timmers H.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 289-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These observations do not explain, however, the differences observed in the speed of deadenylation between mRNAs originating from distinct genes. Different hypotheses can be made to explain these variations. An extreme hypothesis could be that the deadenylase is constitutively active. If this is the case, different mRNA half-lives would result from a selective recruitment of the active complex to substrate mRNA. Such recruitment could be mediated via a bridging factor recognizing specific signals on the messenger. Alternatively, an inactive deadenylase complex could be turned on locally, e.g. by a post-translational modification. If the first hypothesis is correct, tethering the deadenylase to a stable messenger should be sufficient to promote its rapid deadenylation, as this artificial situation would bypass the recruitment step. In contrast, if local activation controls deadenylase activity, tethering of the deadenylase should not increase deadenylation as it should still require triggering by a local activator. In this study, we developed a general tool based on the human U1A binding domain (25Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Jessen T.H. Avis J. Evans P. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; : 1-2PubMed Google Scholar) to target protein factors to reporter mRNAs in yeast. When Pop2 was targeted to a stable PGK1 reporter mRNA, the resulting deadenylase activity was more processive and the half-life of the transcript was decreased 2-fold. Furthermore, we were able to detect a new decay intermediate induced by the nuclease activity of the tethered deadenylase. These results indicate that deadenylation can be regulated by recruitment of the deadenylase to target transcripts. In addition, these results show that the constructs that we prepared for the rapid fusion of the U1A cassette to target genes by genomic integration are functional. These constructs should prove powerful to study the function of yeast factors involved in mRNA decay or other RNA-dependent processes, particularly for genes without clear phenotypes. Strains and Media—The Escherichia coli strains MH1 and MC1066 were used for cloning that was performed following standard procedures. All yeast strains used in this study originated from W303 or its derivative BMA64. The BSY1170, BSY1172, and BSY1574 strains contain the sequence coding the U1A RNA binding domain fused downstream of the last encoded amino acids of POP2, DCP2, and PUB1, respectively. These were constructed by PCR-mediated gene tagging (26Puig O. Rutz B. Luukkonen B.G. Kandels L.S. Bragado N.E. Seraphin B. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using pBS2215 (see below) as template. The ccr4 disruption was obtained by insertion of the HIS3-MX6 cassette (27Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar) in the BSY1171 diploid strain that is heterozygous for the Pop2-U1A-RBD fusion. After sporulation, a meiotic segregant, BSY1505, was selected. The BSY1487 strain harboring the dis3 thermosensitive mutation 3F. Lacroute, unpublished information. and the Pop2-U1A-RBD fusion was obtained by crossing the two cognate strains and dissection of the resulting diploid. Standard complete and synthetic media were used for growing E. coli and yeast strains. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid pBS2215 was generated by inserting the sequence encoding the first 102 amino acids of the human protein U1A (corresponding to its RNA binding domain) and a HA 4The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; UTR, untranslated region; RBD, RNA binding domain; BS, binding site. tag from plasmid pG1hU1A-HA (28Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Luhrmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) between the SacI and HindIII sites of plasmid pBS1479 (29Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids were first generated by cloning a fragment of plasmid p602RP (30Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) encompassing the GAL1 UAS, PGK1 promoter, PGK1-coding sequence and its 3′-UTR, an oligo(G), and the polyadenylation site of PGK1 between the NotI and HindIII sites of pRS416 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating pBS2284. The sequence of the human U1A stem-loop binding site was inserted either in the 5′-UTR (pBS2324) or in the 3′-UTR (pBS2322) by cloning PCR fragments, respectively, between the XbaI and HindIII sites or the BamHI and MfeI sites of pBS2284. The same strategy was used to insert the control sequences complementary to the U1A binding stem-loop, producing plasmids pBS2325 (5′-UTR) and pBS2323 (3′-UTR). Sequences of the 3′-UTR insertions are given in Fig. 1C. The 5′-UTR insertions are 5′-tactttttacGGAATCCATTGCACTCCGGATTTCACTAGtaacaaatat-3′ for the binding site and 5′-tactttttacGAAATCCGGAGTGCAATGGATTCCACTAGtaacaaatat-3′ for the non-binding site (uppercase letters denote the inserted sequence and lowercase letters the flanking PGK1 sequence). Insert sequences derived from PCR or oligonucleotide cloning were confirmed by sequencing. This revealed that the poly(G) sequences inserted in pBS2322 and pBS2323 contained 17 Gs, whereas 18 Gs were present in pBS2324 and pBS2325. The oligo(G) tracks were thus identical between matched plasmids. These oligo(G) tracks were sufficient to promote accumulation of mRNA decay intermediates by blocking the Xrn1 exonuclease, irrespective of the presence of 17 or 18 G residues (see “Results”). RNA Analysis—To map the polyadenylation site of the PGK1 transcripts, total yeast RNA was first reverse transcribed using primer OBS 1320 (see supplemental Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences) and AMV reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). cDNAs were then PCR amplified using two primer combinations, OBS 34 and OBS 1321 or OBS 34 and OBS 1322 for 30 cycles using Taq DNA polymerase. The products obtained were cloned using the TOPO cloning system from Invitrogen. Several clones were sequenced to identify polyadenylation sites. Reporter plasmids were introduced into yeast strains by LiCl-mediated transformation (32Ito H. Fakuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA chase experiments were performed as described previously (7Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast total RNA was extracted using hot acid phenol extraction. Northern blot analyses were carried out following either formaldehyde-agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reporter PGK1 mRNA was detected using oligonucleotide probes complementary to different regions of the PGK1 reporters (OBS1220–1223, supplemental Table S1). Radioactive signals were collected and quantified using a phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). They were used to derive mRNA half-lives using the best fit for an exponential decay, and the latter averaged from at least two experiments. Western Blots—Western blots using anti-HA antibodies (Covance) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were performed using a standard protocol and detected using chemiluminescence (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 471-510Google Scholar). A System to Target a Deadenylase to a Reporter mRNA—As deadenylation is the rate-limiting step for mRNA decay, it is important to understand whether this process is controlled by recruiting a constitutively active deadenylase on target substrates or whether the enzyme is present in excess but only activated locally. Obviously, both modes of control are not entirely exclusive and each could contribute to some level of regulation. In an effort to discriminate between these two models, we decided to target the Pop2-Ccr4 complex on a reporter mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We selected the stable PGK1 mRNA for this purpose, as it is deadenylated slowly and is highly stable (6Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Hence, subtle increases in its deadenylation rate should sensitively lead to a reduced half-life. We selected the human U1A RNA binding domain (U1A-RBD) and its cognate RNA binding site (U1A-BS) to target Pop2-Ccr4 to PGK1 reporters, because this system has been extremely well characterized in previous structural studies (25Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Jessen T.H. Avis J. Evans P. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; : 1-2PubMed Google Scholar) and because both constituents are relatively small and their affinity is high. Furthermore, the yeast U1A protein and its binding site in the yeast U1 snRNA are highly divergent from their human counterparts, thus excluding possibilities of undesired interference (34Liao X.L. Kretzner L. Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1766-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistently, previous studies have revealed that ectopic expression of human U1A fusion is innocuous to yeast cells (28Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Luhrmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 35SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We constructed a plasmid encoding a cassette composed of a calmodulin binding peptide, a TEV cleavage site, the U1A-RBD, and the HA tag together with the TRP1 marker from Kluyveromyces lactis (Fig. 1A). This construct allows the rapid fusion of any yeast protein to the U1A-RBD using standard, PCR-based, genomic integration protocols (36Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2000; 24: 218-229Crossref Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). We selected the Pop2, rather than Ccr4, subunit of the heterodimeric yeast deadenylase (7Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) for C-terminal fusion with the targeting module because the nuclease domain of Ccr4 is located at its C terminus. As it has been proposed that Ccr4 is responsible for the major fraction of the deadenylase activity, addition of the U1A module to the Ccr4 may have interfered sterically with the function of this complex. Furthermore, previous experiments had demonstrated that fusion of tag sequences to the C terminus of Pop2 was not detrimental to cell growth (data not shown). We fused the U1A-RBD cassette downstream of, and in-frame with, the genomic POP2 locus in the haploid yeast strain W303a. This strategy maintains the expression of POP2 under the control of its natural promoter and ensures that all Pop2 molecules produced in these cells contain a U1A-RBD. As controls, we produced isogenic yeast strains with fusion of U1A-RBD to either Dcp2 or Pub1. Correct integration of the U1A-RBD at the targeted loci was confirmed by PCR; expression of the fusion proteins was demonstrated by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Because the Pop2 function is required for normal cell growth and because the strain carrying the U1A-RBD-Pop2 fusion as the only source of Pop2 grows normally, we conclude that this fusion did not significantly alter its function. Similarly, the Dcp2 fusion strain did not display the very slow growth rate indicative of the inactivation of this gene, whereas for Pub1 it is known that it can be fused to a C-terminal tag without affecting its expression or correct localization (37Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). We next needed to insert a U1A-BS in the PGK1 reporter. We chose to build constructs harboring this sequence in either the 5′- or the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1B). To ensure the construction of a functional reporter, we first needed to map the exact polyadenylation site marking the extremity of the 3′-UTR, as this feature has only been determined indirectly in the past. Total yeast RNA from a W303 yeast strain derivative was used to generate cDNAs with an oligo(dT)-containing primer in a 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment. Fragments overlapping the polyadenylation site of the PGK1 reporter were recovered by nested PCR and cloned. Sequences of several resulting clones revealed the location of the major polyadenylation site of the chromosomally encoded PGK1 mRNA (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, this site is more than 25 nucleotides upstream of the site reported in the literature from indirect RNA mapping experiments. With this information, we constructed clones containing one U1A-BS either in the 5′-UTR or in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1C and “Experimental Procedures”). As controls, we inserted in the same location the antisense sequence unable to bind to the U1A-RBD (Fig. 1). Like the parent plasmids, all reporters also contain in their 3′-UTR an oligo(G) sequence that blocks the 5′-3′-Xrn1 exonuclease, allowing the detection of otherwise unstable mRNA decay intermediates. Furthermore, sequencing of rapid amplification of cDNA end clones derived from the reporter with the U1A-BS insertion confirmed that this modification did not change the site of polyadenylation. Insertion of a U1A Binding Site Does Not Significantly Alter Reporter mRNA Decay—We first had to validate that insertion of the U1A-BS or the antisense control did not significantly alter the half-life and decay mode of the reporters. For this purpose a wild-type yeast strain was transformed with the reporter encoding plasmids carrying the U1A-BS, or the anti-sense control sequence, in their 3′-UTR. Transformants were grown in galactose-containing selective medium allowing the expression of the reporter before transfer to glucose-containing medium that shuts off reporter transcription allowing analysis of reporter mRNA stability. Total yeast RNA was extracted at different time points along this chase experiment, fractionated on agarose gels, and analyzed by Northern blot using an oligo(C) probe specific for the reporters. The results indicated that both transcripts follow essentially the same degradation pathway with similar kinetics (Fig. 2). Indeed, the larger band detected at time of transcriptional repression corresponds to the full-length mRNA, while a shorter intermediate characteristic of the 5′-3′ decay pathway was also detectable, the former species disappearing more rapidly than the latter one. Determination of the two mRNA half-lives, 24 ± 2.9 and 31 ± 0.5 min, respectively, indicated that both are stable species with half-lives within the range of values reported for the original p602RP construct (8Tucker M.

Targeting the Pop2-Ccr4 Deadenylase to a mRNA 3′-UTR Speeds Its Decay—The reporter plasmid harboring a U1A-BS in its 3′-UTR, and the antisense control, were introduced in the yeast strain producing the Pop2-U1A-RBD fusion (BSY1170). The decay of the encoded mRNA was assayed in a transcriptional chase experiment (Fig. 3). The first obvious result was that the mRNA amount was greatly reduced in the cells targeting Pop2 to the reporter RNA (4 ± 0.75-fold at the 0 time point). A similar reduction was seen for the corresponding decay intermediate. Second, the half-life of the targeted reporter mRNA in the Pop2-U1A-RBD strain (11.4 ± 1.1 min) was decreased ∼2-fold compared either with the same reporter in a wild-type strain (t½ = 24 ± 2.9 min, Fig. 2) or to the untargeted construct in the strain expressing the Pop2-U1A-RBD fusion (t½ = 20.9 ± 1.3 min, Fig. 3). Third, a new RNA species slightly shorter than the full-length mRNA, possibly corresponding to a deadenylated species, was detected (Fig. 3, asterisk). These effects resulted specifically from the targeting of the deadenylase to the reporter mRNA 3′-UTR because (i) they were not observed in cells not expressing the deadenylase-U1A-RBD fusion, (ii) they were not observed with a control reporter unable to interact with the deadenylase, and (iii) they were not observed when the Pub1- or Dcp2-U1A-RBD fusions, which would simply bind but have no deadenylase activity, were targeted to the same reporter (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Interestingly, targeting of Pop2 to the 5′-UTR (which is also close to the poly(A) tail given the eIF4G-Pab1 interaction) (38Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) also decreased the stability of the reporter mRNA (data not shown). This result demonstrates further that the targeting effect does not result from a peculiar alteration of the reporter 3′-UTR.FIGURE 4A, analysis of the degradation of the PGK1 reporter pBS2322 (U1A-BS in its 3′-UTR) by transcriptional shut off in wild-type (lanes 2–10), in Pop2-U1A-RBD (lanes 11–19), and Dcp2-U1A-RBD (lanes 20–28) strains. Total RNA isolated as described for Fig. 3 was digested by RNase H after hybridization with an internal primer complementary to the PGK1 mRNA, fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized with an oligonucleotide complementary to the poly(G). For each kinetic, lanes labeled with C correspond to the background signal observed when cells were grown in glucose overnight. Lanes labeled with dT correspond to an RNA sample from time 0 treated by RNase H with an oligo(dT) in addition to the PGK1-specific oligonucleotide, thus revealing the position of migration of deadenylated species. Lanes labeled with ND correspond to the time 0 sample before digestion by RNase H. In the Dcp2-U1A-RBD panel, the lane indicated with a star corresponds to the 5-min point of the Pop2-U1A-RBD kinetic that was duplicated to serve as a reference.

Ligand binding to the extracellular portion of IGF1R stimulates autophosphorylation at three sites (Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136) in the activation loop within the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. Autophosphorylation at all three sites is required for maximum enzyme activity, and for IGF1-stimulated cellular activity of the receptor. Previous studies have not clarified the contributions of the individual tyrosines to enzymatic activation. Here, we produced single Tyr-to-Phe mutations at these positions, and compared activities of the purified kinase domains (unphosphorylated and phosphorylated) with wild-type IGF1R. Rates of autophosphorylation of the three mutants were more rapid than for wild-type IGF1R; this was most apparent for the Y1135F mutant. Substrate phosphorylation studies on the unphosphorylated forms of IGF1R confirmed that the value of Vmax for Y1135F was elevated relative to wild-type IGF1R, consistent with a disruption of an autoinhibitory interaction. In contrast, activity measurements on the fully phosphorylated enzymes indicated that kcat/Km values were lowered relative to wild-type IGF1R; this effect was most dramatic for Y1136F. We confirmed these findings using limited proteolysis and tryptophan fluorescence experiments. The results demonstrate that Tyr1135 plays a particularly important role in stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of the activation loop, while Tyr1136 plays the key role in stabilizing the open, activated conformation of IGF1R. The tyrosine kinase activity of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R) is under tight control.

The receptor is activated by binding of the secreted growth factor ligand IGF1 (or the lower affinity ligand IGF2) to the extracellular domain of IGF1R. Ligand binding stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain. This in turn triggers a number of cellular signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway (the main mechanism by which IGF1R protects cells from apoptosis), and the Erk/MAPK pathway leading to mitogenesis. Aberrant IGF1R signaling has been implicated in malignant transformation of cells, and the enzyme has emerged as a target for anticancer drug design (6LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T.

IGF1R, insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-related receptor (IRR) belong to the same receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK) family (11Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev.

These receptors are composed of two extracellular α subunits containing the ligand binding domain and two transmembrane β subunits possessing tyrosine kinase activity. IGF1R and IR share 70% sequence identity overall, and 84% identity within the tyrosine kinase catalytic domains. The mechanism for receptor activation is thought to be similar for IR and IGF1R (2Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell Mol.

These RTKs contain a segment known as the activation loop (A-loop), which contains the three principal autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136 in IGF1R) (Fig. 1). Ligand binding to the extracellular α subunit promotes a conformational change that leads to autophosphorylation of these sites. The first site of autophosphorylation is predominantly Tyr1135, followed by Tyr1131 and then by Tyr1136 (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, bisphosphorylated, and trisphosphorylated forms of IGF1R (IGF1R-0P, -1P, -2P, and -3P, respectively) have increasing levels of enzyme activity (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of IGF1R-0P, -2P, and -3P have been solved (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct.

Phosphorylation of Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136 triggers a large change in the A-loop conformation, which allows access of ATP and peptide substrate to the catalytic site. Thus, autophosphorylation of IGF1R is the crucial regulator of the catalytic activity. The details of how autophosphorylation controls enzymatic activity, however, are not completely understood. Steady state kinetic studies show that a significant decrease in the substrate Km occurs in the transition from the 1P state (mainly Tyr1135) to the 2P state (Tyr1135 and Tyr1131) (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The conformation of the trisphosphorylated activation loop in IGF1R-3P is stabilized by numerous interactions between the activation loop and other segments of the kinase. The purpose of the present study was to define the roles of Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136 in regulation of autophosphorylation. When expressed in fibroblasts, a mutant lacking all three A-loop tyrosines showed dramatically reduced signaling in response to IGF-1 (19Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Y1135F/Y1131F double mutant was incapable of further autophosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells, and did not promote downstream Shc and IRS-1 signaling (21Hernandez-Sanchez C. Blakesley V. Kalebic T. Helman L. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29176-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr1131 alone significantly reduced the level of IGF1-induced receptor autophosphorylation, whereas it did not have an impact on cell proliferation or phosphorylation of the substrate IRS-1 (22Stannard B. Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4918-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In a separate study, a Y1136F mutant showed a marked decrease in IGF1-stimulated receptor phosphorylation, DNA synthesis, and mitogenesis, whereas Y1135F and Y1131F mutations had smaller effects (20Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of these mutations on purified preparations of the IGF1R kinase domain have not previously been published. We previously reported a method to separately purify each of the phosphorylated forms of IGF1R (IGF1R-0P, -1P, -2P, and -3P) (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analyses of the isolated phosphorylated forms of the IGF1 receptor showed that each autophosphorylation increases enzyme turnover number and decreases Km for ATP and peptide. In this study, we used similar methods to purify unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of IGF1R mutants containing single mutations at Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136.We analyzed the conformation of the A-loop and the level of enzymatic activity in these forms of IGF1R. Our results indicate that each tyrosine is important for full activation of the IGF1R kinase domain. Furthermore, our results shed light on the individual roles of the three tyrosines. Autophosphorylation of Tyr1135 and Tyr1131 appears to destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of the activation loop, whereas Tyr1136 phosphorylation plays the key role in structural stabilization of the A-loop. Materials—10% Tris-HCl gels were from Bio-Rad. Mass spectrometry grade trypsin was obtained from Promega. ADP and potassium iodide were obtained from Sigma. Mutagenesis and Purification of IGF1R Kinase Domain—IGF1R mutants were produced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The mutants were made in a pFastBac-1 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen) encoding the kinase catalytic domain of IGF1R (IGF1RK). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI 373 automated DNA sequencer. Mutant forms of IGF1RK were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were cultured in Excel 410 (JRH Biosciences) with 5% heat-inactivated serum (Sigma) and 1% pencillin/streptomycin/amphotericin at 27 °C. The cells were harvested after 72 h of infection. The purification of the mutants was accomplished using similar procedures as for wild-type IGF1RK (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated forms of the mutants were purified in three chromatographic steps on an FPLC system (GE Healthcare): 1) a Source Q-15 column, 2) a Superdex-75 gel filtration column, and 3) a Mono-Q HR10/10 column. To produce the completely phosphorylated forms of IGF1RK (i.e. IGF1RK-3P for wild-type enzyme, or IGF1RK-2P for the single site mutants), enzymes were incubated with 10 mm ATP and 30 mm MgCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. The autophosphorylation reactions were terminated by addition of 100 mm EDTA. Native gel analysis confirmed that these reactions contained predominantly the completely phosphorylated forms. Sodium orthovanadate (200 μm) was added to prevent dephosphorylation. The reactions were then passed over Superdex 75 to remove nucleotides, and the phosphorylated forms were separated by Mono-Q chromatography (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The pooled fractions were concentrated and stored at -80 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All final protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Kinase Assays—The kinetics of IGF1R autophosphorylation and substrate peptide phosphorylation were measured by a continuous spectrophotometric assay (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 23Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this assay, the consumption of ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH, which is monitored as a reduction in NADH absorption at 340 nm. Reactions (50 μl) contained 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1.2 mg/ml NADH, 111 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 156 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and substrate peptide (KKEEEEYMMMMG). Autophosphorylation reactions contained 6 μm enzyme and 1 mm ATP. Peptide phosphorylation reactions contained 100 nm enzyme. For determinations of Km (ATP), reactions contained a peptide concentration of 2 mm and varying concentrations of ATP (10-4000 μm). For determinations of Km (peptide), reactions contained an ATP concentration of 1 mm and varying concentrations of peptide (10-5000 μm). Data were recorded every 6 s. The kinetic parameters were determined by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Native-PAGE autophosphorylation assays were carried out using 6 μm enzyme, 10 mm ATP, and 30 mm MgCl2 at room temperature (24Li W. Favelyukis S. Yang J. Zeng Y. Yu J. Gangjee A. Miller W.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by addition of 100 mm EDTA at various time points. Autophosphorylation reactions were analyzed by 10% Tris-HCl native PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Limited Proteolysis of IGF1RK—Limited proteolysis of wild-type and mutant forms of IGF1RK was carried out according to previous methods established for IRK (25Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Proteins were diluted to 9 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 30 mm MgCl2, and 2mm dithiothreitol, with or without 10 mm ADP. Trypsin was added at a ratio of trypsin to IGF1RK of 1:25-30 by mass. The reactions proceeded at room temperature for 15 min and were stopped by addition of 5× SDS-PAGE buffer. The digestion products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the fragments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Fluorescence Spectra and Iodide Quenching—Tryptophan fluorescence experiments were carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol using methods described for IRK (26Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in volumes of 500 μl using 0.5 μm IGF1RK (wild-type or mutants). Potassium iodide was included at varying concentrations to quench emission of tryptophan 1148 of IGF1R. The ionic strength in the reactions was kept at 0.5 m by addition of KCl, and 0.1 mm sodium thiosulfite was included to inhibit the formation of I-3. The fluorescence emission spectra were obtained with a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and emission spectra were collected from 310-420 nm. The solvent accessibility of fluorescent tryptophan residues was characterized by the Stern-Volmer constant, KSV, according to the relationship between the peak fluorescence intensity and the iodide quencher concentration [Q] in the solution, as defined by Equation 1, F0/F=1+KSV[Q](Eq. 1) where F0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher. Autophosphorylation of Single Site Mutants—To analyze the importance of the individual A-loop tyrosines, we produced mutant forms of IGF1RK in which each tyrosine was changed to phenylalanine (Y1135F, Y1131F, and Y1136F). We expressed wild-type and mutant IGF1RKs using the Sf9/baculovirus system, and purified the unphosphorylated forms of the enzymes. In wild-type IGF1R, the first A-loop tyrosine to be phosphorylated is Tyr1135, followed by Tyr1131, and then Tyr1136 (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To determine whether elimination of single A-loop tyrosines blocked the autophosphorylation of the remaining two sites, we incubated the enzymes with Mg-ATP and followed the time course of autophosphorylation by native PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A). The various phosphoforms of IGF1R are readily resolved by native PAGE (Fig. 2A and Ref. 16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). All three mutants were capable of autophosphorylation at the remaining two sites, indicating that no one site is obligatory for full phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). To compare the rates of autophosphorylation for wild-type and mutant forms of IGF1RK, we used a continuous spectrophotometric assay. We incubated the enzymes with ATP in the absence of any exogenous substrate. As we observed previously (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), the enzyme progress curves were biphasic, because autophosphorylation activates IGF1RK. Autophosphorylation of all three single-site mutants was more rapid than for wild-type IGF1R (Fig. 2B), suggesting that to a certain extent all three tyrosines participate in autoinhibitory interactions. Activation was most apparent in the case of the Y1135F and Y1131F mutants; the final autophosphorylation rates for these mutants were 63.1 and 31.8 mOD/min., respectively, compared with 6.2 mOD/min for wild-type IGF1RK. The Y1136F mutant had a rate that was closer to wild-type IGF1R (12.2 mOD/min). Substrate Phosphorylation Assays—We carried out steady-state kinetic measurements of phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate by wild-type and single site mutants of IGF1RK. We first tested the unphosphorylated forms of the proteins. To ensure that the enzymes remained in their unphosphorylated states during the initial rate measurements, we analyzed samples from the reactions by native PAGE; there was no detectable conversion to 1P, 2P, or 3P forms in the peptide phosphorylation reactions (data not shown). The kinetic experiments showed that all three mutants had higher activity than wild-type IGF1RK (Table 1). This activation was driven primarily by changes in Vmax. The values of Vmax for Y1135F, Y1131F, and Y1136F were ∼6-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold higher than wild-type, respectively. Changes in Km for ATP were modest; the largest change was a 2-fold reduction for the Y1135F mutant. Values of Km (peptide) were increased for all three mutants, with the largest change (∼3-fold) in the Y1136F mutant.TABLE 1Kinetic characterization of unphosphorylated IGF1RK and mutantsEnzymePeptide KmATP KmVmaxkcat/Km, peptidemmmmμmol/min/mgmin−1 mm−1WT (IGF1RK-OP)1.4 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.223Y1131F-OP2.3 ± 0.10.76 ± 0.19.0 ± 0.3139Y1135F-OP2.8 ± 0.30.54 ± 0.0417 ± 1.1211Y1136F-OP4.5 ± 0.90.96 ± 0.16.4 ± 0.850 Open table in a new tab Next, we wished to test the effects of the mutations on the fully-phosphorylated, activated states of the proteins. To produce the fully phosphorylated forms of wild-type and mutant IGF1RK, we incubated the enzymes with MgATP. We monitored autophosphorylation by native PAGE. After removal of excess ATP by gel filtration, we purified the fully-phosphorylated forms (i.e. IGF1RK-3P, Y1131F-2P, Y1135F-2P, and Y1136F-2P) by MonoQ-FPLC. We then used the spectrophotometric assay to measure Vmax and Km for both ATP and peptide substrate. Each mutant showed a lowered value of kcat/Km relative to wild-type IGF1RK (Table 2); values for Y1135F, Y1131F, and Y1136F were decreased by 9.3-fold, 2.2-fold, and 18.6-fold, respectively. These differences were due for the most part to increases in peptide substrate Km, especially for the Y1136F mutant (Table 2). These results indicate that Y1136 plays a particularly important role in stabilizing a conformation of IGF1R that is catalytically competent for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates.TABLE 2Kinetic characterization of fully phosphorylated IGF1RK and mutantsEnzymePeptide KmATP KmVmaxkcat/Km, peptidemmmmμmol/min/mgmin−1 mm−1WT (IGF1RK-3P)0.15 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.0154.9 ± 2.51.3 × 104Y1131F-2P0.4 ± 0.030.12 ± 0.0269.0 ± 2.15.9 × 103Y1135F-2P0.9 ± 0.120.24 ± 0.0237.8 ± 1.81.4 × 103Y1136F-2P3.3 ± 0.50.27 ± 0.0268.4 ± 6.27 × 102 Open table in a new tab Conformational Changes in the A-loop—To confirm that the single site mutations destabilized the autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop, we carried out limited proteolysis experiments. This approach was developed by Kohanski and coworkers (25Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to analyze the conformation of the IRK activation loop; the rates of limited trypsin proteolysis were used to estimate the differences in global conformation. While wild-type, unphosphorylated IRK was relatively stable to trypsin, addition of adenine nucleotide (to generate autophosphorylated IRK) gave rise to fragments of ≈25 kDa and ≈16 kDa. These fragments were generated by cleavage at an Arg-Lys sequence within the activation loop (25Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Arg-Lys sequence is conserved in IGF1R (Fig. 1). We applied the limited proteolysis strategy to purified preparations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated wild-type and mutant IGF1RK. First, we carried out limited proteolysis experiments on purified IGF1RK-0P, Y1135F-0P, Y1131F-0P, and Y1136F-0P (Fig. 3A). After quenching the reactions with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, we analyzed the products on SDS-PAGE. As was the case for IRK, IGF1RK-0P was cleaved into fragments of ≈24 kDa and ≈14 kDa only in the presence of ADP. The Y1131F and Y1136F mutants behaved similarly to wild-type IGF1R. In contrast, the Y1135F mutant showed significant A-loop cleavage in the absence of ADP (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this mutation promotes the “open” conformation of the A-loop. We carried out similar experiments on the fully phosphorylated forms of the proteins (IGF1RK-3P, Y1135F-2P, Y1131F-2P, and Y1136F-2P). Surprisingly, IGF1RK-3P was relatively resistant to trypsin cleavage in the A-loop, even in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that the triple phosphorylation of the A-loop stabilizes an “open” conformation that renders the Arg-Lys sequence inaccessible to trypsin. We were able to exploit this effect to compare the fully phosphorylated forms of the enzymes. In contrast to wild-type IGF1R, the phosphorylated mutants showed significant trypsin cleavage in the presence or absence of ADP (Fig. 3B). The highest extent of cleavage was seen for the Y1136F mutant, consistent with a role for Tyr1136 in stabilizing the open conformation of the A-loop. As a complementary approach to study conformational changes in the IGF1RK A-loop, we measured tryptophan fluorescence. This method has been previously applied to IRK; the solvent accessibility of Trp1175 differs between IRK-0P and IRK-3P, as detected by solute quenching (26Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of both IR and IGF1R have five tryptophan residues. One is on the surface of the small lobe, and the other four are in the interior of the large lobe. Mutagenic analysis demonstrated that the fluorescence emission spectrum of IRK was dominated by Trp1175, a residue that is near the C terminus of the A-loop in the IRK active site (26Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The solvent accessibility of IRK Trp1175 increases significantly upon autophosphorylation. For IRK, unphosphorylated enzyme gave a Stern-Volmer constant of 0.3 m-1, whereas phospho-IRK gave a value of 1.5 m-1. IR and IGF1R are highly conserved in this region, and the residue corresponding to IRK Trp1175 in IGF1R is Trp1148 (Fig. 1). We employed a similar fluorescence quenching strategy to monitor solvent accessibility in the active site of purified IGF1RK-0P and IGF1RK-3P. We carried out fluorescence experiments using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, because tyrosine absorbance is negligible at this wavelength. We measured emission spectra over 310-420 nm, using increasing concentrations of potassium iodide as quencher. The fluorescence intensity over 310-420 nm was integrated and analyzed on Stern-Volmer plots (Fig. 4). As reported previously for IRK, the solvent accessibility of IGF1RK increases upon autophosphorylation: the Stern-Volmer constant for unphosphorylated IGF1RK was 0.29 m-1, whereas the value for IGF1R-3P was 1.72 m-1 (Fig. 4 and Table 3). Next, we performed similar studies on the three A-loop mutants of IGF1R, in both their unphosphorylated and fully phosphorylated (2P states). All unphosphorylated mutants showed higher values of KSV than wild-type IGF1RK-0P, with the most significant increase for Y1135F (Table 3). These results are consistent with our other experiments, and suggest that Tyr1135 plays a particularly important role in stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation. Tyr1131 and (to a lesser extent) Tyr1136 are also involved in autoinhibition. The Stern-Volmer constants for the doubly phosphorylated forms of the A-loop mutants were less than the value of KSV for fully phosphorylated wild type (Table 3). The most significant decrease was observed for Y1136F-2P, consistent with a role for Tyr1136 in stabilizing the “open” conformation.TABLE 3Fluorescence quenching for wild-type and mutant forms of IGF1RKEnzymeKsv for unphosphorylated enzymeKsv for fully unphosphorylated enzymeM−1M−1WT0.29 ± 0.031.72 ± 0.05Y1131F0.6 ± 0.031.35 ± 0.06Y1135F1.17 ± 0.031.46 ± 0.04Y1136F0.43 ± 0.021.20 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab The autophosphorylation of IGF1R at three sites within the activation loop is crucial for full catalytic activity and important for the physiological roles of the receptor in normal and transformed cells (13LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 19Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol.

Autophosphorylation of the A-loop tyrosines serves two functions: it disrupts the autoinhibitory contacts in the closed form of the receptor, and it introduces phosphate groups that stabilize the open conformation, in which ATP and protein substrates gain access to the active site (14Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that there is a preferred sequence of A-loop phosphorylations (Tyr1135, followed by Tyr1131, then Tyr1136), and that each phosphorylation increases enzyme activity (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It was not clear, however, to what extent each phosphorylation contributed to the two functions listed above. Here, we carried out mutagenesis experiments to address the individual roles of the A-loop tyrosines. Our autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 2) showed that removal of individual A-loop tyrosines did not block the autophosphorylation of the remaining sites. Furthermore, for each mutant, rates of autophosphorylation at the remaining two sites exceeded the rate for wild-type IGF1RK (Fig. 2B). This effect was most pronounced for the Y1135F mutant. The Y1131F mutant also showed a significantly higher autophosphorylation rate than wild-type, while the Y1136F mutant was only slightly increased. The data suggest that the three A-loop tyrosines are involved in IGF1R autoinhibition in the following order of importance: Tyr1135>Tyr1131>Tyr1136. This possibility was borne out by steady-state kinetic measurements using the unphosphorylated forms of the enzymes (Table 1). For the mutants (particularly for Y1135F), values of Vmax for phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate were elevated as compared with wild-type IGF1R kinase. We also investigated how these three autophosphorylation sites contribute to the activity of the fully phosphorylated forms of the enzyme toward an exogenous substrate. If destabilization of the autoinhibited conformation is sufficient for full enzyme activity, we would expect the fully phosphorylated forms of the mutants to reach a level of activity that is comparable to wild-type IGF1RK. Our kinetic studies on the purified phosphorylated forms of the mutants (Table 2) showed that this is not the case. The kcat/Km values for Y1135F, Y1131F, and Y136F were decreased by 9.3-fold, 2.2-fold, and 18.6-fold, respectively. For Y1136F, the Km for peptide substrate was raised by over 20-fold. These results indicate that the phosphorylated A-loop tyrosines are required for full enzyme activity, in the order of importance Tyr1136>Tyr1135>Tyr1131. We confirmed the enzyme activity results using two probes of the A-loop conformation: limited trypsin proteolyis and fluorescence quenching. Unphosphorylated IGF1RK behaved similarly to insulin receptor in these studies (the Stern-Volmer constant for unphosphorylated IR was 0.3 m-1, compared with 0.29 m-1 for IGF1RK). In the proteolysis experiments on unphosphorylated forms of IGF1RK, we found that only the Y1135F mutant showed significant cleavage in the absence of ADP (Fig. 3A). Similarly, fluorescence experiments showed the largest degree of iodide quenching for Y1135F (Table 3). Y1131F and Y1136F also gave greater fluorescence quenching than wild-type, with the same rank order as was observed for the enzyme activity assays. The data suggest that removal of these tyrosine residues (particularly Tyr1135) results in a more flexible conformation of the A-loop. Limited proteolysis experiments on purified IGF1RK-3P showed that the A-loop was inaccessible to trypsin cleavage under these conditions, even in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation appears to anchor the A-loop in such a way as to inhibit trypsin cleavage. In the structure of IGF1RK-3P, the phosphate group of Tyr1135 is salt bridged to Arg1137 within the trypsin cleavage site and the phosphate group of pY1136 is salt-bridged to Lys1138 (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This might explain, at least in part, why trypsin can access the Arg-Lys site only when the A-loop has a flexible conformation. The phosphorylated forms of the mutants all showed enhanced cleavage relative to wild-type IGF1R, suggesting that the open form of the A-loop was destabilized in the mutants. The effect was most pronounced for Y1136F. Iodide quenching experiments showed the expected increase in quenching for IGF1RK-3P as compared with IGF1RK-0P, due to a change in solvent accessibility in the open conformation (26Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated forms of the Y1135F, Y1131F, and Y1136F mutants showed progressively larger decreases in iodide quenching relative to IGF1RK-3P (Table 3). The results suggest that the A-loop in the single-site mutants adopts a conformation that is intermediate between IGF1RK-0P and IGF1RK-3P. The results are consistent with enzyme activity assays and point to a key role for Tyr1136 in stabilizing the activated conformation. Our results on the roles of the A-loop tyrosines are consistent with the available structural data. In the unphosphorylated forms of IGF1RK (17Munshi S. Kornienko M. Hall D.L. Reid J.C. Waxman L.

Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), the A-loop adopts an autoinhibitory conformation with Tyr1135 (IRK residue 1162) bound in the active site. Tyr1135 of IGF1R interacts with Asp1105, Arg1109, and Pro1145 (17Munshi S. Kornienko M. Hall D.L. Reid J.C. Waxman L. Stirdivant S.M. Darke P.L. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38797-38802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The side chain of Tyr1131 is hydrogen-bonded to Ser1059. Phosphorylation of Tyr1135 and Tyr1131 would be expected to incrementally destabilize the autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop. In the structure of IGF1R-3P (Fig. 1), the phosphotyrosine side chains interact with numerous residues in the A-loop and in other regions of the enzyme (16Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The phosphate group of Tyr1135 interacts with Arg1137, whereas the phosphate group of Tyr1136 is salt-bridged to Lys1138 and Arg1128. The latter interaction is conserved in the structure of the tris-phosphorylated form of insulin receptor. In the crystal structure of IGF1R-2P, in which residues Tyr1131 and Tyr1135 are phosphorylated but Tyr1136 is not, the central part of the activation loop is disordered (18Pautsch A. Zoephel A. Ahorn H. Spevak W. Hauptmann R. Nar H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Tyr1136 appears to trigger the final lobe closure in which ATP and substrate are brought close together, facilitating catalysis. Our data indicate that Tyr1136 autophosphorylation is necessary to stabilize the activated state of IGF1R. Our results are relevant for the development of conformationally selective inhibitors of IGF1R. Most of the clinically tested inhibitors of tyrosine kinases are compounds that target the ATP-binding site. There were initial concerns that the conserved architecture of kinase ATP binding sites would preclude the development of specific inhibitors. A large body of evidence now demonstrates that different ATP-binding sites have distinct features (shape of the pockets, composition of amino acids) that can serve as unique drug targets. In particular, it has been argued that the inactive conformations of protein kinases may differ more dramatically than the fully active conformations (27Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Science. 2004; 303: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Gleevec is an example of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the unphosphorylated, inactive conformation (28Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible to design inhibitors that not only discriminate among related tyrosine kinases, but also between conformational states of a given tyrosine kinase. Among other advantages of targeting the unphosphorylated form of IGF1R, there are greater differences in the ATP-binding pocket between IGF1R-0P and IR-0P than between their triply phosphorylated counterparts (17Munshi S. Kornienko M. Hall D.L. Reid J.C. Waxman L. Stirdivant S.M. Darke P.L. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38797-38802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the active site of IGF1R-2P is not as tightly closed as that of IGF1R-3P, suggesting that it could accommodate inhibitors that are too large to fit in the relatively small, closed IGF1R-3P active site (18Pautsch A. Zoephel A. Ahorn H. Spevak W. Hauptmann R. Nar H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The variety of conformational states of IGF1R present potential targets for inhibitor design. For example, the cyclolignan PPP was recently shown to block the phosphorylation of Tyr1136, but not the other two A-loop tyrosines (29Vasilcanu D. Girnita A. Girnita L. Vasilcanu R. Axelson M. Larsson O. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7854-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A full understanding of the enzymatic and conformational changes that occur with each A-loop phosphorylation is an important prelude to the development of conformation-specific inhibitors.

Essentially all studies on the molecular mechanisms of this expansion process invoke an important role for non-B DNA conformations which may be adopted by these repeat sequences. We have directly evaluated the role(s) of the repeating sequences per se, or of the non-B DNA conformations formed by these sequences, in the mutagenic process. Studies in Escherichia coli and three types of mammalian (COS-7, CV-1, and HEK-293) fibroblast-like cells revealed that conditions which promoted the formation of the non-B DNA structures enhanced the genetic instabilities, both within the repeat sequences and in the flanking sequences of up to ∼4 kbp. The three strategies utilized included: the in vivo modulation of global negative supercoil density using topA and gyrB mutant E. coli strains; the in vivo cleavage of hairpin loops, which are an obligate consequence of slipped-strand structures, cruciforms, and intramolecular triplexes, by inactivation of the SbcC protein; and by genetic instability studies with plasmids containing long repeating sequence inserts that do, and do not, adopt non-B DNA structures in vitro. Hence, non-B DNA conformations are critical for these mutagenesis mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2034625230,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plays an important role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Diverse kinases, including AKT/protein kinase B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), can be activated by IGF-I. Here, we show that the receptor-interacting protein (RIP), a key mediator of tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB and JNK activation, plays a key role in IGF-I receptor signaling. IGF-I induced a robust JNK activation in wild type but not RIP null (RIP–/–) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Reconstitution of RIP expression in the RIP–/– cells restored the induction of JNK by IGF-I, suggesting that RIP is essential in IGF-I-induced JNK activation. Reconstitution experiments with different RIP mutants further revealed that the death domain and the kinase activity of RIP are not required for IGF-I-induced JNK activation. Interestingly, the AKT and ERK activation by IGF-I was normal in RIP–/– cells. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, did not affect IGF-I-induced JNK activation. These results agree with previous studies showing that the IGF-I-induced JNK activation pathway is distinct from that of ERK and AKT activation. Additionally, physical interaction of ectopically expressed RIP and IGF-IRβ was detected by co-immunoprecipitation assays.

The combination of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic properties of IGF-I has a profound impact on tumor growth, rendering the IGF-I system a good target for potential adjunct therapy to standard chemotherapy (8Pollak M.N.

The anti-apoptosis of IGF-I may involve activation of AKT and the regulation of the ratio of Bcl2 and Bax that leads to blockage of the initiation of the apoptotic pathway (11Linseman D.A.

The binding of IGF-I to its cell membrane IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) is regulated by a group of six specific IGF-I binding proteins (IGFBP1–6), which belong to the IGF family (13Fang P. Hwa V. Rosenfeld R. Novartis Foundation Symposium. 2004; 262 (discussion 230–234, 265–268): 215-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol.

The IGF-IR is a heterotetramer of two identical α- and β-subunits, IGF-IRα and IGF-IRβ, respectively, that are generated by proteolysis and glycosylation of the αβ precursor encoded by a single gene. Binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR activates the tyrosine kinase of the receptor, which in turn triggers a cascade of interactions among a number of molecules involved in signal transduction (15LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Distinct signal transduction pathways have been identified for the IGF-IR, and it appears that there is a considerable overlap in the pathways used for the receptor functions (14Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). One pathway activated by the IGF-IR is that through the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 or IRS-2, leading to the activation of phosphoinositol (PI) 3-kinase and AKT, which promote suppression of apoptosis via phosphorylation of downstream factors such as caspase-9, Bad, GSK3-β, and the transcription factors FKHRL1 and CREB (16Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). The next pathway activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) through the Ras/Raf/MAP or Ras/Rsk-1/MAP cascade (14Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Additionally, binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR also induces the transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (17Monno S. Newman M.V. Cook M. Lowe Jr., W.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IGF-I-induced JNK activation could be anti-apoptotic (18Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Walsh P.T. Smith L.M. O'Connor R. Immunology. 2002; 107: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the IGF-IR mediated activation of JNK has not been well elucidated. Because the C terminus of the IGF-IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2, which are required for AKT activation, are unnecessary for JNK activation, it appears that signals that activate JNK mediated by the IGF-IR are distinct to those leading to PI 3-kinase and AKT activation (18Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The death domain kinase receptor-interacting protein (RIP) plays a central role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, which contributes significantly to cell survival (20Liu Z.G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). RIP also contributes to TNF-induced JNK, ERK, and p38 MAP kinases activation (23Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent studies in different cell models have revealed that RIP is also critical in NF-κB activation by other agents, including TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, DNA damaging agents, and double-stranded RNA (25Lin Y.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In addition, RIP is crucial for toll-like receptor (TLR)4- and TLR6-mediated AKT activation (29Vivarelli M.S. McDonald D. Miller M. Cusson N. Kelliher M. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Further, it is reported that RIP interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor, contributing to epidermal growth factor-induced NF-κB activation (30Habib A.A. Chatterjee S. Park S.K. Ratan R.R. Lefebvre S. Vartanian T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8865-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we address whether RIP is involved in IGF-IR signaling. With RIP–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, we demonstrated that RIP is required for IGF-I-induced JNK activation. The results indicate that the death domain kinase RIP, a key factor in TNF signaling, also plays a pivotal role in the IGF-IR-mediated activation of JNK. Reagents and Plasmids—Recombinant human IGF-I and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem. TNF and interleukin (IL)-1 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-RIP, c-Myc, and JNK1 antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Anti-IGF-IRβ, -Xpress, and -HA antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-AKT, -ERK, -phospho-AKT, and -phospho-ERK antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Chicago, IL). Anti-phospho-c-Jun was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The mammalian expression plasmids for RIP, RIP-(559–671), RIP (K45A), RIP-(324–671), CrmA, and HA-JNK1 are described previously (23Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G.

Xpress-tagged IGF-IRβ was constructed by inserting the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment from the pBPV IGF-IR, a gift from Dr. D. LeRoith (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York), into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA 3.1 vector. The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—MEF and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (31Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—After treatment with different reagents as described in the figure legends, cells were collected and lysed in M2 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Fifty μg of the cell lysate from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Biosciences) instructions (32Lin Y. Choksi S. Shen H.M. Yang Q.F. Hur G.M. Kim Y.S. Tran J.H. Nedospasov S.A. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10822-10828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation assays of transfected proteins, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with different plasmids and then were lysed in M2 buffer. The expression of each transfected protein was verified by Western blot analysis. The immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with anti-myc or -Xpress and protein A-Sepharose beads by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed five times with M2 buffer, and the bound proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. The Xpress-IGF-IR and myc-RIP were detected by Western blot analysis with anti-Xpress and myc, respectively. For immunoprecipitation assays of endogenous proteins, 5 × 107 of wild type (WT) cells were serum-starved for 4 h followed by treatment with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) as indicated in the legend of Fig. 5. The cells were then lysed in M2 buffer and precipitated with 1 μg of the anti-IGF-IRβ antibody as described above. RIP was detected by Western blot. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data are shown. JNK Assay—MEF cells (5 × 105) were serum-starved for 4 h and treated with IGF-I as described in the figure legends. Cells were collected in 300 μl of M2 lysis buffer. JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with JNK1 antibody, and JNK kinase activity was determined by using 1 μg of glutathione-S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate (25Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h and treated with IGF-I 24 h after transfection as described (18Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were collected in 300 μl of M2 lysis buffer. HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody, and their kinase activities were determined. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data are shown. Cell Proliferation Assays—MEF cells were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was then replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After continuing the culture for 4 h, the cells were treated with IGF-I. Cells were collected and counted at 1, 2, or 3 days post-treatment. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and data shown (mean ± S.D.) are representative of three independent experiments. Impaired JNK Activation by IGF-I in RIP–/– Cells—RIP plays a pivotal role in activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 induced by diverse stimuli (23Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Using a BLAST search for RIP homolog(s), we found a significantly high homology between the RIP and the IGF-I receptor β subunit (IGF-IRβ) (data not shown). This prompted us to address whether RIP is involved in IGF-I-induced signaling. Based on the fact that RIP is involved in JNK activation by different stimulations, we explored the possible role of RIP in IGF-I-induced JNK activation with RIP–/– MEF cells as a cell model. JNK activity was measured by an in vitro kinase assay with glutathione-S-transferase-c-Jun (1–79 amino acids) as the substrate. In WT MEF cells IGF-I treatment caused a robust activation of JNK, which started at 10 min, peaked at 20–40 min, and lasted up to 60 min post-treatment (Fig. 1A). However, there was no detectable JNK induction by IGF-I in RIP–/– cells (Fig. 1B, top panel). RIP–/– cells were confirmed by Western blot analysis to be null of RIP and defective to TNF-induced JNK activation by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Because comparable expression levels of JNK1 and IGF-IR were detected in both RIP–/– and WT cells (Fig. 1B, second and fourth panels), it is unlikely that the decrease of JNK activation in RIP–/– cells resulted from the altered expression of JNK or the IGF-IR. Deficient JNK activation by IGF-I in RIP–/– cells was further confirmed with an anti-phospho-JNK antibody. In this experiment, JNK activation by IGF-I was detected in a dose-dependent manner in WT cells (Fig. 1C, upper panel). The induction of c-Jun, the direct downstream target of JNK, was also impaired in RIP–/– cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel). These results suggest that RIP is required for transducing the IGF-I-induced signal to activate JNK. Defective JNK activation in RIP–/– cells was specific to IGF-I treatment because RIP–/– cells responded to IL-1 and ultraviolet treatment as efficiently as the WT cells did in terms of JNK activation (Fig. 1D and data not shown). IGF-I-induced Normal AKT and ERK Activation in RIP–/– Cells—Upon activation by IGF-I, the IGF-IR transduces signals to activate ERK and AKT through Ras/Raf and PI 3-kinase, respectively. Activation of AKT or ERK is associated with the phosphorylation of AKT or ERK proteins. Because RIP is also involved in AKT and ERK activation under certain situations (23Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), we addressed whether RIP is also involved in mediating IGF-I-induced AKT and ERK activation. RIP–/– and WT cells were treated with IGF-I and collected at different time points post-treatment, and the activated forms of AKT and ERK were detected with anti-phospho-AKT and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, IGF-I-induced AKT phosphorylation was comparable in the RIP–/– and WT cells. A similar result was obtained regarding the IGF-I-induced ERK activation. These results suggested that RIP is unnecessary for AKT and ERK activation pathways. Although RIP is a key factor for TNF-induced NF-κB activation, and IGF-I was found to activate NF-κB activity in some cell types such as multiple myeloma cells (34Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Poulaki V. Schlossman R. Akiyama M. Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Treon S.P. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5673-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we did not detect NF-κB activation by IGF-I in MEF cells, either by Western blot for IκBα degradation or NF-κB-reporter assay for NF-κB activity (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Whether RIP is involved in IGF-IR-mediated activation of NF-κB remains to be determined in other cell models. Restoration of IGF-I-induced JNK Activation in RIP-reconstituted RIP–/– Cells—To rule out the possibility that some other flaws in the signaling pathway of IGF-I-induced JNK activation are present in RIP–/– cells, we tested whether IGF-I-induced JNK activation could be restored when RIP is reconstituted in those cells. To examine the reconstitution of IGF-I-induced JNK activation, the expression vector for myc-RIP was co-transfected with HA-JNK1 into RIP–/– cells. Following treatment with IGF-I, the transfected HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated for in vitro JNK activity assay. As shown in Fig. 3, RIP expression restored JNK activation in response to IGF-I treatment in RIP–/– cells (Lane 4). This result indicated that defective IGF-I-induced JNK activation in RIP–/– cells is caused by the absence of RIP. IGF-I-induced JNK Activation Does Not Require the Death Domain and Kinase Activity of RIP—RIP possesses three functional domains: kinase domain (1–300 amino acids), intermediate domain (300–582 amino acids), and death domain (583–653 amino acids). The death domain is essential in TNF receptor signaling as it is a protein-protein interacting motif that is used to recruit RIP to the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling complex. The intermediate domain is crucial for NF-κB activation. The biological relevance of the kinase domain is not well elucidated, although it may be involved in TNF-induced ERK activation and necrotic cell death (23Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). To determine the domain prerequisite for IGF-I-induced JNK activation, the expression vectors for either myc-RIP (K45A), a kinase dead RIP mutant, or myc-RIP-(1–558), a death domain deleted RIP mutant, was co-transfected with HA-JNK1 into RIP–/– cells. WT RIP was used as a positive control. After treatment with IGF-I, HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated, and JNK activity was measured by in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3, both RIP (K45A) and RIP-(1–558) expression restored the JNK activation in response to IGF-I treatment in RIP–/– cells as efficiently as WT RIP did. The expression levels of RIP (K45A), RIP-(1–558), and RIP WT were comparable (Fig. 3, bottom panel). These results indicated that both the kinase and death domains of RIP are dispensable for IGF-I-induced JNK activation in MEF cells. IGF-I-induced JNK Activation Is Not Mediated by PI 3-Kinase—It was reported that the IGF-I-induced JNK activation pathway is distinct to that of the PI 3-kinase-mediated AKT activation (18Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results indicating that RIP is unnecessary for IGF-I-induced ERK and AKT activation supported the notion that JNK activation does not involve PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2). To further test this hypothesis, WT cells were pretreated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin followed by IGF-I treatment. The cell extracts were subjected to in vitro JNK assay and Western blot analysis for phospho-AKT. TNF treatment was included as a control. When treated with a moderate concentration of wortmannin (100 nm), which specifically and efficiently suppressed PI 3-kinase-mediated AKT activation by IGF-I, the IGF-I-induced JNK activity was barely affected (Fig. 4A). As expected, pre-incubation of wortmannin did not interfere with TNF-induced JNK activation. (Fig. 4A). This result supported the conclusion that IGF-I-induced JNK activation does not involve the PI 3-kinase pathway. When cells were treated with a high concentration of wortmannin (10 μm), the IGF-I-induced JNK activation was completely blocked, whereas TNF-induced activation was not affected (Fig. 4B). Because high concentrations of wortmannin inhibit other kinases in addition to the PI 3-kinase, the blockage of JNK activation under this condition likely resulted from the inhibition of an unidentified kinase by wortmannin. However, as the TNF-induced JNK activation was not affected under the same condition, the mechanism of IGF-I-induced JNK activation might be different from that of TNF, although both IGF-I-and TNF-induced signaling to JNK activation require RIP. RIP Interacts with the IGF-IR—Because our data suggested that RIP is essential in IGF-I-induced JNK activation, RIP might also interact with the IGF-IR. To test this possibility, we investigated whether RIP interacts with the IGF-IR by ectopic expression of RIP and the IGF-IRβ in HEK293 cells. The Xpress-tagged IGF-IRβ was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Xpress antibody, and the immunoprecipitants were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, myc-tagged RIP was specifically co-precipitated with the Xpress-tagged IGF-IRβ when RIP and the IGF-IRβ were co-expressed. There was no detectable precipitation of RIP when it was expressed alone, although the expression level was similar to that of RIP and IGF-IRβ co-expression (Fig. 5A). Conversely, the IGF-IRβ was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with myc-RIP when the two proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 5B). These results suggested a specific binding between RIP and the IGF-IRβ. With ectopic expression and co-immunoprecipitation, we mapped the IGF-IRβ binding region in RIP. Whereas the death domain (RIP-(559–671)) was unable to bind IGF-IRβ, RIP-(324–671) as well as RIP-(1–558) retained the binding activity (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the minimal IGF-IRβ binding region is mapped to be between 324–558 amino acids, locating in the intermediate domain of RIP. It is noteworthy that the binding of RIP-(324–671) and RIP-(1–558) to IGF-IRβ was greatly reduced compared with that of WT RIP. It is possible that the sequence flanking this minimal binding region may help to stabilize the association between RIP and IGF-IRβ. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with the RIP reconstitution experiment, showing that the death domain and kinase activity of RIP are unnecessary for IFG-I-induced JNK activation (Fig. 3). RIP Is Part of the IGF-IR Signaling Complex—To test whether endogenous RIP is recruited to the IGF-IR complex during IGF-I signaling, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with cell extracts derived from WT cells with or without IGF-I treatment. In these experiments, the endogenous IGF-IRβ was immunoprecipitated with an anti-IGF-IRβ antibody, and the immunoprecipitants were analyzed with an anti-RIP antibody. As shown in Fig. 5D, whereas no detectable RIP was co-precipitated by an anti-IGF-IRβ antibody from the nontreated cell extract, RIP was present in the IGF-IR complex that was immunoprecipitated from the cell extract with IGF-I treatment for 10 min. (Lane 5). Under the same condition, RIP was not precipitated using the anti-JNK1 antibody, suggesting the association of RIP and IGF-IRβ induced by IGF-I is specific (data not shown). These results suggested that IGF-I induces the recruitment of RIP to the IGF-IR. Interestingly, only a trace amount of RIP was detected after 20 min of treatment (Lane 6), suggesting that RIP was released rapidly from the IGF-IR signaling complex after being recruited there. This release may enable a downstream signaling that activates JNK, which is not recruited to IGF-IR (Fig. 5D). RIP Is Required for IGF-I-induced Cell Proliferation—It was suggested that JNK contributes to IGF-I-induced anti-apoptosis (18Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, IGF-I had"

In the present study, laser tweezers were used to measure the binding force exerted by a live Chinese hamster ovary cell that expressed integrin αIIbβ3 (CHO αIIbβ3), to the bead carrier coated with the snake venom rhodostomin that served as an activated ligand for integrin αIIbβ3. A progressive increase of total binding force over time was noticed when the bead interacted with the CHO αIIbβ3 cell; such an increase was due mainly to the recruitment of more integrin molecules to the bead-cell interface. When the binding strength exerted by a single ligand-receptor pair was derived from the “polyvalent” measurements, surprisingly, a stepped decrease of the “monovalent binding force” was noted (from 4.15 to 2.54 piconewtons (pN)); such decrease appeared to occur during the ligand-induced integrin clustering process. On the other hand, the mutant rhodostomin defective in clustering integrins exhibited only one (1.81 pN) unit binding strength.

Since the early recognition of integrin as an integral membrane complex involved in the trans-membrane association between the extracellular matrix and the cell, integrin heterodimers have been found to play important roles in controlling various steps that regulate processes as diverse as proliferation, development and differentiation, cell migration, and carcinogenesis (1Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The initiation of the integrin-mediated activities involves at least two steps, namely, receptor activation and clustering. Taking platelet cells as an example, the integrin αIIbβ3 proteins on the membrane of a resting platelet bind only loosely to fibrinogen (FBN). 3The abbreviations used are: FBN, fibrinogen; Rho-RGD, recombinant wild-type rhodostomin containing R49G50D51 motif; Rho-RGE, recombinant mutant rhodostomin containing RGE motif (whose Asp51 is substituted by Glu); Rho-P53N, recombinant mutant rhodostomin whose Pro53 is substituted by Asn; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; CHO K1, Chinese hamster ovary K1 cell; CHO αIIbβ3, Chinese hamster ovary K1 cell expressing exogenous integrin αIIbβ3 proteins; N, newton(s); GCV, generalized cross-validation; MSE, mean square error. Stimulation (or activation) of the platelets with agonists (such as ADP or thrombin) induces an inside-out signaling process that confers on integrin αIIbβ3 a stronger binding to FBN, resulting in the onset of platelet aggregation. Subsequent integrin clustering triggers complex intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the extent of the irreversible platelet aggregation and clot retraction (2Payrastre B. Missy K.

Using advanced structural biology techniques, several recent reports have provided convincing evidence that indicates the adoption of different molecular conformations by integrin heterodimers when the inside-out signaling pathway is invoked (3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 4Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Such structural changes are thought to be the mechanisms underlying increased ligand binding by an integrin during the activation process. Whether or not ligand binding affinity is further modulated during the subsequent integrin clustering process has remained largely elusive (6van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To focus this research on the ligand-receptor interaction during the receptor clustering, we utilized snake venom rhodostomin from Agkistrodon rhodostoma as the ligand for integrin αIIbβ3. Rhodostomin is a member of the disintegrin super-family (7Huang T.F. Wu Y.J. Ouyang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); it binds very strongly to integrin αIIbβ3 (8Chang H.H. Lin C.H. Lo S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Chang H.H. Lo S.J. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike the FBN and other extracellular matrix agonists, rhodostomin positively regulates outside-in signaling without prior inside-out activation of integrin αIIbβ3 (9Chang H.H. Lo S.J. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Chiang H.S. Yang R.S. Huang T.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Sun D.S. Lo S.J. Lin C.H. Yu M.S. Huang C.Y. Chen Y.F. Chang H.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 2005; 12: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structure of rhodostomin has been solved (12Adler M. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. Wagner G. Science. 1991; 253: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The binding of rhodostomin to the integrin is attributed to its Arg49-Gly50-Asp51 (RGD) sequence motif and changing RGD to RGE totally abolishes integrin binding (10Chiang H.S. Yang R.S. Huang T.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sequences adjacent to the RGD motif are thought to play regulatory roles; for example, the mutant that has a mutation at Pro53 significantly affects the morphogenesis and aggregation activity of rhodostomin on platelets (13Chang C.P. Chang J.C. Chang H.H. Tsai W.J. Lo S.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report, we utilize laser tweezers to quantify the binding force of the interacting ligand-receptor molecular pairs at a single-molecule resolution (usually in a force range of a few pNs) and to monitor the interaction dynamics over time. By focusing a laser beam to a diffraction-limited spot, the laser tweezers technique offers a unique way to manipulate targets and generate molecule-scaled forces (14Ashkin A. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1970; 24: 156-159Crossref Scopus (3973) Google Scholar, 15Ashkin A. Dziedzic J.M. Bjorkholm J.E. Chu S. Opt. Lett. 1986; 11: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (5908) Google Scholar, 16Sheetz M.P. Laser Tweezers in Cell Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 1-25Google Scholar). The use of light also allows the experiments to be performed in situ where the biological interactions occur. The measurements so done are much less invasive than techniques such as atomic force microscopy. In the present study, we successfully applied laser tweezers to systemically investigate the binding forces exerted by a live CHO cell that contained integrin αIIbβ3 on its membrane to a microbead carrier coated with the integrin ligand, rhodostomin. By analyzing the data set that represented the ensemble binding force of more than one ligand-receptor pair (polyvalent), we were able to derive the “unit” binding force, which we believe representing the “monovalent” binding strength between a single molecular pair of rhodostomin and integrin. Cells and Recombinant Rhodostomin Proteins—The CHO αIIbβ3 cells were a gift from Dr. Yoshikazu Takada of the Scripps Research Institute (17O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X.P. Glass A.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μm G418 (Invitrogen). CHO αIIbβ3 cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The rhodostomin gene was a gift from Dr. SJ Lo of Chang-Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan. The parental CHO K1 cells, which contained no integrin αIIbβ3, were purchased from ATCC and grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids. Generation and purification of the recombinant rhodostomin proteins were done according to a previous report (18Chang H.H. Tsai W.J. Lo S.J. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All beads used in this study were polystyrene beads (Bangs Laboratories); the coating with recombinant rhodostomin proteins was done by the hydrophobic adsorption method (19Cantarero L.A. Butler J.E. Osborne J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Essentially, beads were incubated with 10 μg/ml proteins in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight with gentle mixing, washed with phosphate-buffered saline for three times, and further blocked with 5% heat-treated bovine serum albumin at 4°C for 2 h. Cell Adhesion Assay—The cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (20Mekrache M. Kieffer N. Baruch D. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 116: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Larrucea S. Gonzalez-Manchon C. Butta N. Arias-Salgado E.G. Shen L. Ayuso M.S. Parrilla R. Blood. 2002; 99: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The adhesion substrates were coated with different concentrations of recombinant rhodostomin as indicated at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by 1% heat-treated bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. CHO αIIbβ3 and parental CHO K1 cells were harvested and then plated on the substrates at the density of 5 × 104 cells/well at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells that remained adhering to the substrate after a standard wash procedure were determined by the methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Absorbance was read at 570 nm. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) Phosphorylation Assay—The FAK phosphorylation experiments were done according to the method described previously (22Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml recombinant rhodostomin proteins, fibrinogen, or mock solution for 30 min, then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). The resulting immuno-complexes were blotted with anti-FAK and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) and detected by the chemiluminescence assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence staining was done as described previously (22Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, suspended cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml Rho-RGD, Rho-P53N, or mock solution for 30 min, then fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with monoclonal antibodies made against human integrin β3 or integrin αIIb (Chemicon), followed by fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. The resulting slides were observed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope and a Leica DM IRBE epifluorescence microscope. Laser Tweezers Construction—The assembly of laser tweezers was done in the laboratory (23Lin C.H. Forscher P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 763-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 24Tsai J.W. Liao B.Y. Huang C.C. Hwang W.L. Wang D.W. Chiou A. Lin C.H. Proc. SPIE. 2000; 4082: 213-221Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A 100-milliwatt CW TEM00 mode diode laser at λ = 830 ± 10 nm (JDS Uniphase Corp.) was used for trapping; the power was controlled by Lab-VIEW (National Instrument) through a current driver (Newport). A probing He-Ne laser (JDS Uniphase Corp.) was also directed to the trapped object to generate a forward scattering image which was used to better position or monitor the displacement of the trapped object. Trapping Force Calibration—The dragging force method was applied to calibrate the trapping force of the laser tweezers. The trapping force of the laser tweezers exerted on the bead positioned at the 2 μm off-center position (in the ΔP mode measurements) was measured and calculated using the modified form of Stoke's Law,f=6πηνr1-916rh+18rh3-45256rh4-116rh5 where η was the viscosity of the medium, ν was the velocity of the laminar flow, r was the radius of the polystyrene bead (3.75 μm), and h was the distance of the trapped bead from the wall of laminar flow. The maximum and minimum trapping forces of laser tweezers at the 2 μm off-center position are 21 and 1.5 pN, respectively. Force Measurements: the ΔT and ΔP Mode—Binding force measurements between the bead and the cell were done in two ways, the ΔT and ΔP modes (Fig. 3A). In the ΔT mode, a bead was guided to contact a cell. After a certain interaction period (ΔT; from 10 to 100 s in a 10-s increment), a constant force (21 pN) was applied to hold the bead while the cell was moved away from the trapped bead by the motorized stage at a constant velocity of 1 μm/s. The percentage of the beads that resisted such detaching manipulation was plotted as a function of ΔT (Fig. 3B). In the ΔP mode, the range of the binding force distribution after a fixed period of molecular interaction was determined. A bead was held in contact with a cell by laser tweezers for 40 s (in Rho-RGD bead experiments) or 80 s (in Rho-P53N bead experiments). The laser trap was turned off and displaced off the bead-center by 2 μm. The laser was then turned on and increased the power at a steady rate (the loading rate of the trapping force is estimated 1.74 pN/s). The bead was released then retrapped twice; the minimal force just enough to “retrap” the bead was recorded. All the adjustments mentioned above were automated by computer program. Statistical Analysis—The data set of the ΔP mode experiments (Figs. 4 and 5) were subjected to statistical analyses starting with non-parametric methods, including generalized cross-validation (GCV)-Loess (25Cleveland W.S. J. Am. Statist. Assoc. 1979; 74: 829-836Crossref Scopus (7479) Google Scholar, 26Cleveland W.S. Devlin S.J. Grosse E. J. Econometr. 1998; 37: 87-114Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar) method, GCV-Spline method, minimal frequency selection, and maxima frequency selection method. In essence, the entire data set was first viewed as a continuous process and then categorized into separate groups by dichotomizing the length of duration (the distance between the means of groups) without making any assumption. The best optimization was determined by equality of durations and tested by the nonparametric Willcoxon rank sum test under the “obeying small sample size” hypothesis. From the non-parametric results, a hypothetical (grouping) model was built up, which was then subjected to the parametric (p-median) analysis (27Kaufman L. Rousseeuw P.J. Finding Groups in Data? An Introduction to Cluster Analysis. Wiley, New York1990: 69-119Google Scholar). The significance level was set at p < 0.1. All statistical analyses were performed by Microsoft EXCEL and SAS 8.2 versions.FIGURE 5Only one monovalent binding force was derived from Rho-P53N bead-CHOαIIbβ3 cell interactions.

D, mean ± S.D. within each sector is calculated and plotted as a function of numbers of interacting molecular pairs.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the resulting CHO αIIbβ3 cells contained the exogenous proteins on the plasma membranes when visualized by immunofluorescence staining. Immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1B) demonstrated that integrin αIIb was present in the immunocomplexes “pulled down” by the anti-integrin β3 antibody, and vice versa, suggesting that indeed the two subunits formed heterodimers in CHO αIIbβ3 cells. When plated a surface coated with the wild-type rhodostomin (Rho-RGD), CHO αIIbβ3 cells adhered tightly to the substrate in a dose-dependent manner (closed circles, Fig. 1C). In contrast, the parental CHO K1 cells adhered poorly to the Rho-RGD substrate (open circles) and neither did the substrate that coated with mutant rhodostomin whose RGD domain had been changed to RGE (Rho-RGE) support the adhesion of CHO αIIbβ3 cells (data not shown). These results indicated that the adhesion of CHO αIIbβ3 cells to the rhodostomin substrate was mediated by the interactions between the rhodostomin ligand and the integrin αIIbβ3 proteins. Interesting results were noticed when the CHO αIIbβ3 cells were plated on the substrate coated with the mutant rhodostomin whose proline (Pro53) had been changed to asparagine (Rho-P53N) (closed triangles). At low concentrations (<6.25 μg/ml), the Rho-P53N substrates supported the adherence of CHO αIIbβ3 cells almost equally good as the wild-type Rho-RGD. Increased coating of Rho-P53N did not further increase the cell adherence. In fact, at 25 μg/ml, only about half of the cell adhesion was observed in the Rho-P53N group, compared with Rho-RGD. This finding suggested that certain promoting effects (on cell adhesion) elicited by the wild type rhodostomin were disrupted by the P53N mutation, although the initial binding event appeared to remain intact. Ineffectiveness of Rho-P53N Mutant in Clustering Integrin αIIbβ3 and Triggering Downstream Signaling—Since the cell adhesion is regulated initially by ligand-receptor binding and further enhanced by receptor clustering. We tested whether the mutant rhodostomin Rho-P53N was defective in clustering integrin or in triggering the downstream signaling. As shown in Fig. 2A, integrin αIIbβ3 proteins were evenly distributed on the cell membrane of a control CHO αIIbβ3 cell. After the addition of soluble Rho-RGD to the cell for 30 min, a patchy integrin αIIbβ3 pattern was revealed under both an epifluorescence microscope and a confocal microscope. In contrast, treatments with the Rho-P53N mutant failed to cause any integrin clustering or membrane patch formation. Since integrin clustering has been shown to trigger the occurrence of downstream tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) of FAK (28Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), we set up experiments to examine the level of FAK phosphorylation following various ligand treatments. As shown in Fig. 2B, treating CHO αIIbβ3 cells with FBN caused only little FAK phosphorylation, since most of the cellular integrin αIIbβ3 proteins were not activated (and therefore could not be clustered). On the other hand, exposure of the CHO αIIbβ3 cells to wild-type Rho-RGD was enough to cause a very significant increase of FAK phosphorylation, while treating the same cells with the mutant Rho-P53N had only a minor effect. These results indicated that mutant Rho-P53N was less effective than the wild-type Rho-RGD in clustering integrin αIIbβ3 and was unable to trigger the downstream signaling processes. A Typical Ensemble Interaction between Rhodostomin and Integrin Was Characterized by a Progressive Increase in Total Binding Force Over Time—In addition to the biochemical methods, we utilized laser tweezers to measure the binding strength between the rhodostomin bead and the CHO αIIbβ3 cell. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the binding force between the bead and the cell could be measured by either ΔT or ΔP assay (Fig. 3A). The ΔT assay was designed to quantify the dynamic change of the total binding force over time. The beads were held to contact with the CHO αIIbβ3 cells for a fixed interaction period; the percentage of the bead (30 measurements for each curve, three repeats) that remained bound to the cells (or resisted the 21-pN detaching force) was determined. As shown in Fig. 3B, the percentage of bound bead progressively increased in the first 50 s of interaction then reached a plateau (closed circles). There was not significant binding between Rho-RGE bead and the CHO αIIbβ3 cell (open circles). The binding of Rho-P53N beads (closed triangles) increased much slower than the wild-type Rho-RGD beads and never reached plateau even after a 10 min interaction period (data not shown). Furthermore, neither the Rho-RGD bead, nor the Rho-P53N bead could bind to the parental CHO K1 cells (data not shown). These control experiments indicated that the bead-cell interactions studied here were mediated by the rhodostomin protein on the bead and the engineered integrin αIIbβ3 on the CHO αIIbβ3 cell. Quantification of the Trapping Force Exerted by the Laser Tweezers—To perform the ΔP experiments, we need to first calibrate the trapping force exerted by the laser tweezers. As shown in Fig. 3C, we first determined that the output of laser illumination power was in a stable linear relationship to the input current and such linear relationship was maintained over a wide range of current-loading rates (30, 3, and 0.3 mA/s) and that the illumination output responded almost instantaneously to the change of the input current. We then measured the actual trapping force by using the drag force assay (29Visscher K. Gross S.P. Block S.M. IEEE J. Select. Top. Quant. Electr. 1996; 2: 1066-1076Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). From these calibrations, we determined that the trapping force exerted by our system could range from 1.5 to 21 pN. When the “trapping force” (in pN) is plotted as a function of laser current (mA), a linear relationship with a slope of 0.58 pN/mA was found (R2 = 0.9812; Fig. 3D). The force was limited by the 100-milliwatt diode laser employed here. Two Monovalent Binding Forces Were Derived from the Ensemble Measurements of the Bead-Cell Interactions Using Wild-type Rhodostomin—The binding force exerted by a single Rho-RGD bead and a CHO αIIbβ3 cell was determined after a 40-s interaction period by the ΔP experiment (see Fig. 3A and “Experimental Procedures”). The histogram of 210 measurements is shown in Fig. 4A. Increase of the interaction period made the histogram shift to the right, while the decrease of the interaction period made the pattern shift to the left (data not shown). Moreover, the histogram pattern suggested a distribution with several clusters (or groups). To test whether such a non-random pattern is a feature of the entire data set, or simply reflected insufficient sampling, we analyzed the data accumulation trend as the sample size increased. As shown in Fig. 4B, the pattern of cumulative data taken from 25, 50, or 75 measurements were very different. When the measurements exceeded 100, the cumulative plots appeared to reach a very significant overlap, indicating that the experimental measurements performed here (n = 210), and the features obtained from this sampling could well represent the entire data set. To further analyze the grouping of the histogram, we applied a series of non-parametric statistical methods to first view the histogram as a continuous process and then categorized it into separate groups without making any assumption. As shown in Fig. 4C, we first performed local regression to smooth the relationship between the force and the event frequency using GCV-Loses methods. In this test, different curve fittings were applied using different local regression values, such as rolling averages of 5, 15, and 25% of the neighboring data (cyan, orange, and purple curves, respectively). Note that the 5% local regression plot demonstrated the best fit, which transformed the original dataset into a series of regular event containing seven peaks (R2 = 0.745, MSE = 5.48). Similar conclusions were made using GCV-Spline methods. In another approach (minimal frequency selection method), we selected from the raw histogram what appeared to be least frequent data as compared with its adjacent data points. When these low frequency data points were used to segregate the entire histogram data set, we found again seven separate groups: (4.977, 5.230), (8.011, 8.264, 8.516), (10.033, 10.539), (12.308, 12.561), (14.836, 15.089, 15.342), (17.364, 17.617), and (20.398). The same kind of grouping was made if the maximal frequency selection method was applied. Based on such non-parametric analyses, 7 sectors could be identified (as alternative shadings in Fig. 4C). The mean and S.D. of the data points within each sector were then calculated. They were (in pN): 2.486 ± 0.850, 6.368 ± 0.668, 10.784 ± 0.851, 13.730 ± 0.561, 16.587 ± 0.510, 19.302 ± 0.624, 21.294 ± 0.327; these values were plotted as a function of numbers of molecular pairs involved in the binding (n, n+1, n+2, n+3 etc.; Fig. 4D). Note that the very similar s.d. values and durations (i.e. the differences between means of neighboring sectors, which were averaged 3.15 pN), were consistent with the notion that there was a unit binding force present in the system. Using the Willcoxon rank sum test, we further noticed that the mean ± S.D. values shown in Fig. 4D could be best separated into two groups (red line at R2 = 0.9986 and blue lines at R2 = 0.9937, p = 0.0542). The first three durations were separated by a unit of 4.15 pN and last four durations by a unit of 2.54 pN. We then performed the parametric analyses using partition around medoids (also known as p-median methods (27Kaufman L. Rousseeuw P.J. Finding Groups in Data? An Introduction to Cluster Analysis. Wiley, New York1990: 69-119Google Scholar)) to identify the clustering sectors. Random grouping was first set with each group represented by the center point. The quality of clustering was indicated by the sum of the distance between the center point and another closest center. The solution to the p-median problem is to set the p center so the total distance could be minimized. We implemented a dynamic computer program to solve the p-median problem using p values from 2 to 15. The results revealed that p = 7 was a sensible choice, since the reduction in the total distance by adding one more clustering group (p = 8) was not significant. The means of the seven sectors grouped by the p-median method were (in pN): 2.234, 3.731, 6.328, 10.784, 13.730, 16.678, and 20.236. There was again a large duration (4.01 pN) across the first three means and a small duration (2.50 pN) across the last four means; these durations were comparable with those obtained by the nonparametric methods described above (4.15 and 2.54 pN). Only One Monovalent Binding Force Was Derived from the Ensemble Measurements of the Bead-Cell Interactions Using the P53N Rhodostomin Mutant—Similar experiments and statistical procedures were applied to analyze the binding force histogram obtained from the interactions of the Rho-P53N bead and the CHO αIIbβ3 cell (Fig. 5). Since the binding of Rho-P53N to integrin αIIbβ3 was much weaker than Rho-RGD, the bead-cell interaction period was extended to 80 s, as compared with 40 s used in the wild-type rhodostomin (Rho-RGD) experiments. A total of 176 measurements were made and their histogram is shown in Fig. 5A. The data accumulation pattern suggested that such a sampling size was enough to represent the entire data set (Fig. 5B). The GCV-Loses smooth plot supported the use of 5% local regression curve (cyan curve) with R2 = 0.654, MSE = 5.73 (Fig. 5C) and led to the grouping into 12 sectors (alternative shadings in Fig. 5C). In Fig. 5D, the plot of mean ± S.D. values revealed only one single duration of 1.81 pN. Subsequent parametric p-median analyses reached a similar conclusion"

In the case of type I topoisomerases, these breaks are single-stranded; in the case of type II topoisomerases they are double-stranded. Type II topoisomerases act by passing one DNA segment (the transfer- or T-segment) through the break that they transiently introduce in another DNA segment (the gate- or G-segment) (9Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Science. 1979; 206: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Depending on the DNA substrate and the reaction conditions, type II topoisomerases can catalyze DNA catenation/decatenation, knotting/unknotting and introduction and removal of DNA superturns. As type II topoisomerases act on duplex DNA, two questions arise: what is the minimal length of the DNA substrate and what is the enzyme specificity for the double-stranded DNA. In additional to providing information about the DNA-enzyme interaction, these questions might have direct biological relevance because topoisomerases could encounter, while assisting replication, single-stranded DNA, DNA-RNA duplexes, and DNA that is partially coated by other proteins so that only short regions could be available for topoisomerase action. The interaction of type II topoisomerases with very short substrates is most commonly investigated by the DNA cleavage assay, which is based on trapping of the covalent complex between the enzyme and the transiently cleaved G-segment by certain chemicals, such as quinolones (10Fisher L.M.

Cleavage showed, for example, that gyrase acts with some sequence specificity (12Lockshon D. Morris D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Morrison A.

Biol. 1990; 215: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that substrates other than pure DNA duplexes are recognized by eukaryotic type II topoisomerase. For example, the presence of a few ribonucleotides at certain positions within DNA duplexes increases type II topoisomerase cleavage several times, though full substitution of one strand by RNA completely inhibits topoisomerase-mediated cleavage (20Wang Y.

Andersen A.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4815-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, eukaryotic topoisomerase II is able to cleave parallel DNA tetraplexes at the tetraplex/ssDNA junction (22Chung I.K. Mehta V.B. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the disadvantage of the cleavage assay is that it detects only part of the enzymatic cycle. Another approach is based on the reaction of the enzyme with small closed double-stranded DNA circles. Circles as short as 174 bp can be negatively supercoiled, and positively supercoiled circles as short as 116 bp can be relaxed by DNA gyrase (23Bates A.D. Maxwell A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, using this approach it is difficult to test shorter substrates, because they would not readily circularize. Therefore, we developed a system that allows the investigation of the complete duplex passage reaction for short substrates. We applied it mainly to the study of the duplex passage reaction by Escherichia coli gyrase and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) 2The abbreviations used are: Topo IV, topoisomerase IV; Cam, chloramphenicol; Amp, ampicillin; nt, nucleotide; MCS, multiple cloning site; ss, singlestranded; C, catenanes., but it can be used for other type II topoisomerases. DNA—Long single-stranded DNA circles designated BC (3.4 kb) and BS (3 kb) were obtained from phagemids pBC SK(+) and pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene), respectively, using the Stratagene protocol for circular single-stranded phagemid DNA recovery and gel-purified from a 1% agarose gel. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, except MCS100, which was purchased from Operon. Substrates for Catenation Reaction—Hybridization between the single-stranded (ss) DNA circles (20 nm), tethering oligo (7 nm) and substrate oligo (73 nm) was performed in 10 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The mixture was successively incubated at 72 °C for 6 min, 58 °C for 40 min, and 37 °C for 3 h. Enzymes—GyrA and GyrB subunits of E. coli gyrase were purified by Allyn Schoeffler from the James Berger laboratory (University of California, Berkeley) as described (34Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ParC and ParE subunits of E. coli topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) were purified by Nancy Crisona and Brian Peter from the Nicholas Cozzarelli laboratory (University of California, Berkeley) as described (44Peng H. Marians K.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 163-169PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic Reactions—Catenation reaction was performed in a volume of 10 μl with a total concentration of the single-stranded DNA circles of 4 nm. Enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture was 50 nm in the case of gyrase, and 10 nm in the case of Topo IV. The reaction buffers were, for gyrase: 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 40 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm ATP, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; for Topo IV: 100 mm potassium glutamate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The samples were incubated at 32 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.4 μlof 5× stop buffer (25 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS) in the case of gyrase, or 1 μlof 250 mm EDTA followed by 2.4 μlof 5× stop buffer in the case of Topo IV. The mixture was supplemented with 0.5 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Cleavage assays were performed essentially as described in Ref. 15Cove M.E. Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Displacement of Tethering Oligos—The displacing oligo was added up to 1.4 μm. Samples were incubated 6 minat73°C, 1 h at 58°C, and cooled down to room temperature. After addition of an equivalent volume of 0.3 m NaOH, the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, supplemented with 2 μl of the loading buffer (30% glycerol, 3.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol in TAE 1×), and loaded on an agarose gel. Alternatively, the samples were additionally heated for 6 min at 73 °C before loading without NaOH addition. Gel Electrophoresis and Southern Blot—Native gel electrophoresis was performed in 1.2% agarose in TAE 1× buffer at 3.5 V/cm for 14 h. The DNA was detected by Southern blotting (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.20-6.21Google Scholar). Alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described in Ref. 45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.20-6.21Google Scholar. Data Analysis—The apparent yield of catenanes (C) was calculated using Equation 1,C=100%×(PE+-PE-)/P0(Eq. 1) where P0 is the initial percentage of the tethered circles, i.e. without displacement and topoisomerase treatment, PE+ is the percentage of the tethered circles treated by topoisomerase that remains after displacement of the tethering oligo, and PE– is the percentage of the tethered circles not treated by topoisomerase that remains after displacement of the tethering oligo. PE– represents the background amount of dimeric species due to non-complete displacement of the tethering oligo or because of some trace amount of dimeric single-stranded circles remaining after gel purification. The general strategy used in our experiments is based on the topoisomerase-mediated duplex passage between short double-stranded regions within long single-stranded DNA circles (Fig. 1A). These short double-stranded regions (substrate duplexes) were created by hybridization of the substrate-forming oligonucleotides (oligos) (red) to the single-stranded circles. Duplex passage leads to catenation of the DNA circles, which contain the duplexes. To facilitate the reaction between the two substrate duplexes, they are brought together by a tethering oligo (tether) (blue). The tethering oligo contains two short regions (21–25 nt), which hybridize to the single-stranded circle close to the substrate duplex (at about 30 nt), and a oligothymine linker between them (dT3–10, see inset in Fig. 1A). After topoisomerase-mediated duplex-transfer between substrate duplexes, the tethering oligo can be removed (displaced) by heating in the presence of a displacing oligo (Table 1). After displacement, only catenated circles remain together, as a consequence of duplex passage.TABLE 1Sequence of the oligonucleotides (5′ → 3′) that hybridize within common MCS region of pBS and pBC plasmidsSubstrate-forming oligonucleotidesMCS150CGCGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTGATAT CGAATTCCTGCAGCCCGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS100CGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTGATATCGAATTCCTGCAGCCCGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCG CGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS80AGCTTGATATCGAATTCCTGCAGCCCGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS67ATTCCTGCAGCCCGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS60CAGCCCGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS55CGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS50GATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGMCS40ATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCMCS20TCTAGAGCGGCCGCCACCGCTethering oligonucleotidesMCS-tetherCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCC (T)10CGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCDisplacing oligonucleotidesdis-MCSGGCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGT Open table in a new tab Substrates—Two long single-stranded DNA circles BC (3.4 kb) and BS (3 kb) were used to create various tethered circular substrates (Fig. 1B). Within these circles, three regions were used for hybridization with substrate-forming and tethering oligos: 1) the multiple cloning site (MCS) region, which is the same both for BC and BS, 2) the ampicillin (Amp) gene region, which is present only in BS, and 3) the chloramphenicol (Cam) gene region, which is present only in BC. All substrate-forming and tethering oligos are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The 3′-end of the substrate-forming oligo is proximal to the tethering oligo. All tethering oligos, except the Cam-Amp tether, bind two identical regions within two single-stranded circles, and the two substrate duplexes are also identical in this case. We call the tethered circles created by these tethering oligos the “symmetric system.” Cam-Amp tether creates an “asymmetric system” (shown in Fig. 1B, box), where the two substrate duplexes are different from each other, and can be varied independently. Unless it is otherwise indicated, in all tethered circles the substrate-forming and tethering oligos hybridize within the same region of the circle (for example, the MCS substrate-forming oligos are used with the MCS tether).TABLE 2Sequence of the oligonucleotides (5′ → 3′) that hybridize within the Amp region in BS and the Cam region in BCSubstrate-forming oligonucleotidesAmp100GCAATGATACCGCGAGACCCACGCTCACCGGCTCCAGATTTATCAGCAATAAACCAGCCAGCCGGAAGGGCCGAGCGCAGA AGTGGTCCTGCAACTTTATAmp60TATCAGCAATAAACCAGCCAGCCGGAAGGGCCGAGCGCAGAAGTGGTCCTGCAACTTTATAmp50AAACCAGCCAGCCGGAAGGGCCGAGCGCAGAAGTGGTCCTGCAACTTTATAmp40GCCGGAAGGGCCGAGCGCAGAAGTGGTCCTGCAACTTTATAmp21GCCGGAAGGGCCGAGCGCAGACam100TACCACGACGATTTCCGGCAGTTTCTACACATATATTCGCAAGATGTGGCGTGTTACGGTGAAAACCTGGCCTATTTCCCTA AAGGGTTTATTGAGAATACam60AAGATGTGGCGTGTTACGGTGAAAACCTGGCCTATTTCCCTAAAGGGTTTATTGAGAATACam50GTGTTACGGTGAAAACCTGGCCTATTTCCCTAAAGGGTTTATTGAGAATACam40GAAAACCTGGCCTATTTCCCTAAAGGGTTTATTGAGAATACam21TGAAAACCTGGCCTATTTCCCCam20TAAAGGGTTTATTGAGAATATethering oligonucleotidesAmp-tetherGAAGCTAGAGTAAGTAGTTCGCCAG (T)10GAAGCTAGAGTAAGTAGTTCGCCAGCam-tetherTCACCAGTTTTGATTTAAACGTGGC (T)10TCACCAGTTTTGATTTAAACGTGGCCam-Amp-tetherCAGTTTTGATTTAAACGTGGC (T)3CTAGAGTAAGTAGTTCGCCAGDisplacing oligonucleotidesdis-CamGAGTTTCACCAGTTTTGATTTAAACGTGGCCAdis-AmpCGGGAAGCTAGAGTAAGTAGTTCGCCAGTTAScaI oligonucleotidesBC-ScaI oligoATGAATTACAACAGTACTGCGATGAGTGGCBS-ScaI oligoCTGTGACTGGTGAGTACTCAACCAAGTCAT Open table in a new tab Both Gyrase Subunits Are Required for Catenation—DNA gyrase is heterotetramer containing two subunits, called GyrA and GyrB (24Gellert M.

A. 1977; 74: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The GyrA and GyrB subunits are purified separately and mixed together before the reaction to reconstitute the enzyme (A2B2). A typical result of the reaction is shown in the tethering oligo regardless of catenation). As expected, the amount of the non-displaced tethered circles is the same in the presence and in the absence of the enzyme (lanes 1–7). The picture changes dramatically after displacement of the tethering oligo (lanes 8–14). Only in the presence of both gyrase subunits does a significant amount of tethered circles (about 10–15%) survive displacement (lanes 8, 11, and 12). The requirement for both subunits for catenation provides a control that the reaction is catalyzed by gyrase rather then by some enzymatic contamination in either of the subunits. The Reaction Products Are Catenanes—The special feature of catenanes is that they dissociate to free monomeric components upon double-stranded cleavage within only one of the monomers. To confirm that the species we observed after gyrase action on tethered circles are really catenanes, we performed experiments with mixed BC- and BS-tethered circles, where either the BC or BS circle were cleaved by a restriction enzyme, ScaI. To convert either circle into a ScaI-cleavable form, it is hybridize with its corresponding Sca-oligo (Table 2). Because both BC and BS circles have common MCS regions, three possible combinations of tethered circles, BC/BC, BC/BS, and BS/BS are formed upon hybridization of the mixture of BC and BS circles with substrate-forming and tethering oligos complementary to the MCS region (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 8). As seen in Fig. 3, gyrase-treated BC/BS-tethered circles, which contain only one circle in the ScaI-cleavable form, disappear upon ScaI cleavage and subsequent tethering oligo displacement, and no new dimeric species appear, which is consistent with catenanes (lanes 1 and 7). An additional confirmation that the observed products are catenanes comes from the fact that they survive gel electrophoresis under denaturing (alkaline) conditions (supplemental Fig. 1). It is interesting that under these electrophoretic conditions the catenanes resolve into several bands, which are most likely catenanes with multiple links because of several successive duplex passage reactions. The Catenation Reaction Requires ATP—Fig. 4 shows the result of catenation reactions with and without ATP for the same tethered circles as in Fig. 2. The yield of the reaction in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP is 11%, whereas in the absence of ATP it is 0.6%, close to the background level of our method (about 0.5%).FIGURE 2Both gyrase subunits are required for catenation. BC-tethered circles with MCS100 substrate duplexes were used in this experiment. The concentration of gyrase subunits is shown for each lane. Lanes 1–7 show tethered circles before displacement of the tethering oligo. Lanes 8–14 show tethered circles after displacement of the tethering oligo, when only catenated species survive. The yield of catenanes was optimal with 100 nm of each subunits (lane 11), slightly smaller for 20 nm (lane 12), and almost at background level for 2 nm. The yield also decreased slightly when gyrase concentration was twice greater than the optimum (lane 8), probably because of substrate occlusion. The apparent yield of catenanes (C, %) is calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Reaction Occurs Only between Proximal Regions of the Circles—In our method the tethering oligo specifically brings together those regions of the circles that are close to the tethering oligo binding site. We will refer to these regions as “proximal.” and the regions roughly on the opposite side of the circles will be referred as “distal.” Both proximal and distal regions can be converted to DNA duplexes by hybridization to corresponding substrate-forming oligos. We thus investigated whether the two duplex regions must be proximal for catenation to occur. We used two tethering oligos, the MCS-tether and Amp-tether, which hybridize to the BS circle within the MCS and Amp-regions, respectively, and two substrate oligos, MCS80 and Amp100, which hybridize to the BS circle in the proximity (32 nt) of the corresponding tethering oligo. The hybridization sites for the MCS and Amp oligos are on the opposite sides of the BS circles, roughly 1.5 kb from each other. Consequently, in the tethered circles with the Amp tether and the MCS substrate oligo, and vice versa, substrate duplexes are distal from each other. With the Amp tether and the Amp substrate oligo, and with the MCS tether and the MCS substrate oligo, substrate duplexes are proximal (schematized in Fig. 5, top). Fig. 5 shows that only proximal combinations produce a significant yield of catenanes (lanes 1 and 7). This result also implies that there is no detectable duplex-passage reaction between the 25 bp duplexes formed by the tethering oligo itself, probably because they are too short and too close. Under our reaction conditions we detected catenanes only for tethered circles, although at five times higher spermidine concentration (5 mm), which facilitates DNA aggregation (28Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2687-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed, without a tether, a low yield of catenanes (around 1%, data not shown). In contrast, with double-stranded plasmid DNA, more than 50% catenation is observed with DNA gyrase at this high spermidine concentration (28Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2687-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1980; 20: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A probable explanation for this difference is that in the case of completely double-stranded plasmids any randomly chosen regions, which are brought together by aggregation, could be suitable for duplex passage. In our case, however, only about 4% of the DNA within tethered circles is double-stranded. Thus, the probability that these double-stranded regions are close to each other within the aggregate is small. Duplex Length Dependence for the Catenation Reaction—We investigated the length dependence of catenation using substrate-forming oligos of different length. First, we investigated the symmetrical system, in the MCS region, where both duplexes are the same. The data are summarized in Fig. 6A. The apparent yields of catenanes for different substrate oligo lengths are normalized to the yield for the maximal length, i.e. MCS100. The yield of the reaction increases with the duplex length, from 50 bp to 80 bp. The yield in the case of the 50 mer is at least ten times less than in the case of the 80 mer, at the limit of sensitivity of our method (about 1% or less). Because this effect is significantly larger than the 1.6× decrease in length from 80 bp to 50 bp, it cannot be explained by the simple decrease in the number of landing sites for the enzyme. We next showed that the observed length dependence is not caused by the absence of some specific sequence in the shorter oligos (such as MCS50). To explore this possibility, we mapped predominant gyrase cleavage sites within the MCS100 substrate duplex. We found five cleavage sites of different intensities (supplemental Fig. 2A). Three of these sites are localized within the MCS80 and MCS67 sequence, and two of them are within the MCS50 sequence. Similar results were obtained for the Cam and Amp duplex regions (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that gyrase-mediated cleavage sites are present even in the shorter duplexes. Further increase in the substrate duplex length (from 80 bp to 100 bp) produces some decrease in the efficiency of catenation (see “Discussion”). In the symmetrical system, we can only change the length of both segments simultaneously. However, because G- and T-segments play different roles and are interacting with different parts of the enzyme, the length requirements for G- and T-segments could be different. These questions were investigated using the asymmetric system. Fig. 6B shows the yields of catenation where the longest duplex regions (either Amp100 or Cam100) remain constant, while the length of the other duplex varies. In either case, shortening of the duplex by only 2-fold, from 100 bp to 50 bp, decreased the yield of the tethered circles 5-fold in one case, and about 20-fold in the other. When the varied duplex was 21 bp, catenanes could not be detected in either case. Thus, at least 50 bp participate in the interaction with the enzyme for both the G- and T-segments. Importantly, single-stranded DNA cannot serve as a G- or a T-segment. To check if our method could be used with other enzymes, we applied it to another type II topo, E. coli Topo IV (31Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Topo IV is also a heterotetramer. It contains two subunits, ParC and ParE, analogs of GyrA and GyrB, respectively. The major difference between these two enzymes is that Topo IV is not able to induce negative supercoiling in DNA, but is much more efficient in unknotting and decatenation (32Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Charvin G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, Topo IV and DNA gyrase share significant structural similarity, but strongly differ in their DNA substrate preferences and predominant mode of action. As in the case of gyrase, the reaction required both Topo IV subunits (Fig. 7A, lane 1) and the presence of ATP (Fig. 7B, lane 1). The yield of catenanes increased with the duplex length (Fig. 7C), and catenation was not detected without the tethering oligo (data not shown). Topo IV Can Use a DNA-RNA Duplex, Probably as a T-segment—As in the case of gyrase, both duplexes were necessary for detectable Topo IV-induced catenation (Fig. 7D). However, Topo IV-induced catenation was also observed when either one (Fig. 8A, lanes 3 and 5), but not two (lane 7), of the DNA-DNA substrate duplexes was replaced by a DNA-RNA duplex. Fig. 8B shows Topo IV-induced cleavage of the substrates containing DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA duplexes in the presence of norfloxacin to stabilize the cleavage products (36Khodursky A.B. Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11801-11805Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). RNA- and DNA-containing asymmetric tethered circles used in this experiment were the same as in Fig. 8A. The Amp50 oligo is complementary to the BS circle, and the Cam50 oligo is complementary to the BC circle. Linearization of the corresponding plasmid, which indicates cleavage, is observed only for the plasmid when it is hybridized to the DNA oligo, but not to the RNA oligo (Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 5 for Amp50, 9 and 11 for Cam50). Thus, we conclude that DNA-RNA duplexes can serve as T-segments, but not as G-segments. The yield of catenanes was always lower when one duplex was a DNA-RNA duplex in comparison with both DNA-DNA duplexes (compare lanes 3 and 5 to lane 1, Fig. 8A), though this difference was smaller when a 100-bp long DNA-DNA G-segment was used instead of a 50-bp long DNA-DNA G-segment (supplemental Fig. 3A). In the case of DNA gyrase, we were not able to detect catenation when one of the duplexes was DNA-RNA, using the same substrates as for Topo IV (supplemental Fig. 3B). However, since the efficiency of catenation in general is lower for gyrase in comparison with Topo IV, it could be that the catenation is below the sensitivity of our method in this case. In this work we constructed and validated an experimental system to investigate the duplex passage reaction catalyzed by type II topoisomerases. The substrate duplexes are localized within long single-stranded DNA circles, and the duplex passage reaction leads to the formation of catenanes between the circles, which can be identified unambiguously. The catenation occurs only if substrate duplexes within the circle are brought close to each other by a tethering oligo. Thus, our system allows the targeting of the duplex passage reaction to any given sequence within a single-stranded circle by annealing an appropriate tethering oligo. The system can be used to investigate sequences, which affect topoisomerase activity, for example the strong gyrase site in Mu-phage (14Pato M.L. Howe M.M. Higgins N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We studied the catenation reaction for two E. coli type II DNA topoisomerases: gyrase and Topo IV. The efficiency of the catenation reaction for DNA gyrase in our system grew strongly with the length of the duplex from 50 to 80 bp. Judging from footprinting experiments, within a long double-stranded DNA substrate, the length of the DNA involved in the complex with gyrase is about 140 bp. However, within these 140 bp, 40–50 bp in the vicinity of the gyrase cleavage site were protected more strongly than the rest of the sequence (10Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H.

Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggests that perhaps only these 40–50 base pairs are essential for the gyrase-mediated duplex passage reaction itself and that the rest of the DNA (about 100 bp), involved in the complex with gyrase, wraps around the C-terminal domain of GyrA subunit (GyrA CTD). The DNA wrapping around the GyrA CTD is necessary for generation of negative supercoiling (39Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Kampranis S.C. Bates A.D. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41Ruthenburg A.J. Graybosch D.M. Huetsch J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol.

Trans. 2005; 33: 1465-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the role of GyrA CTD in the reactions between remote DNA segments, as in catenation, is less clear. The fact that in our system the maximal yield of catenanes is obtained when the substrate duplex is significantly longer than the length of the strongly protected DNA area in the vicinity of the gyrase catalytic site (i.e. 80 bp versus 40–50 bp) might suggest that the CTD somehow facilitates the catenation reaction in our system, for example by stabilizing the complex with the G-segment, or by interacting with the T-segment, as suggested for the ParC CTD of Topo IV (34Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, when the duplex regions become too long, a partial wrapping of the G-segment around the enzyme could compete with the interaction of the enzyme with the intermolecular T-segment, explaining why for DNA gyrase we observe a slight decrease in catenation when the length of the duplex increases above 80 bp. The better understanding of this effect requires further investigation. By using an asymmetric system, we can investigate the reaction between two DNA segments with different lengths or backbone composition. The fate of the two DNA segments that participate in the duplex passage reaction is quite different: the G-segment undergoes cleavage and re-ligation, while the T-segment remains intact. Thus, G- and T-segments may have different requirements for nucleic acid length and composition. We showed that for gyrase- and Topo IV-mediated duplex passage both DNA segments participating in the reaction must be double-stranded, and decreasing the length of either duplex strongly decreases the yield of catenanes. Thus, the double-stranded DNA structure is required not only for cleavage of the G-segment, but also for interaction with the T-segment. We also showed that Topo IV can catalyze the catenation reaction when one (but not both) DNA-DNA duplex was replaced by a DNA-RNA duplex. Cleavage experiments in the presence of norfloxacin show that Topo IV cleaves a DNA-DNA, but not a DNA-RNA duplex, suggesting that the DNA-RNA duplex works as a T-segment but not as a G-segment. By performing similar experiments using various DNA analogs with modified backbones it would be possible to distinguish which DNA chemical groups are important for the DNA-gyrase interaction within both the T- and G-segments. This is especially useful for the interactions with the T-segment, which cannot be monitored by a DNA cleavage assay, as is the case of the G-segment. The experimental system developed in this work is applicable to other types of topoisomerases. Preliminary data with E. coli Topo IA showed that it produces catenanes in our system (data not shown). E. coli Topo IA (as well as other type IA topos) catalyzes a single-strand DNA passage reaction similar to the duplex passage reaction of type II topoisomerases (29Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 43Dekker N.H. Rybenkov V.V. Duguet M. Crisona N.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12126-12131Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In our system, Topo IA presumably acts on single-stranded or partially double-stranded regions of the circles proximal to the tethering oligo. By varying these regions, one could investigate, for example, how Topo IA activity varies with the sequence in both DNA strands or with the presence of the double-stranded regions.
