https://openalex.org/W4206950245,"Abstract Signal peptides (SPs) are short amino acid sequences that control protein secretion and translocation in all living organisms. SPs can be predicted from sequence data, but existing algorithms are unable to detect all known types of SPs. We introduce SignalP 6.0, a machine learning model that detects all five SP types and is applicable to metagenomic data."

Here we provide a structure of the isolated yeast NPC in which the inner ring is resolved by cryo-EM at sub-nanometer resolution to show how flexible connectors tie together different structural and functional layers. These connectors may be targets for phosphorylation and regulated disassembly in cells with an open mitosis. Moreover, some nucleoporin pairs and transport factors have similar interaction motifs, which suggests an evolutionary and mechanistic link between assembly and transport. We provide evidence for three major NPC variants that may foreshadow functional specializations at the nuclear periphery. Cryo-electron tomography extended these studies, providing a model of the in situ NPC with a radially expanded inner ring. Our comprehensive model reveals features of the nuclear basket and central transporter, suggests a role for the lumenal Pom152 ring in restricting dilation, and highlights structural plasticity that may be required for transport."

High heterozygosity (2.27%) resulted in two complete haplotypic assemblies. A total of 13,517 allelic genes (42.4%) were differentially expressed in diverse tissues. Analyses of 72 resequenced lychee accessions revealed two independent domestication events. The extremely early maturing cultivars preferentially aligned to one haplotype were domesticated from a wild population in Yunnan, whereas the late-maturing cultivars that mapped mostly to the second haplotype were domesticated independently from a wild population in Hainan. Early maturing cultivars were probably developed in Guangdong via hybridization between extremely early maturing cultivar and late-maturing cultivar individuals. Variable deletions of a 3.7 kb region encompassed by a pair of CONSTANS-like genes probably regulate fruit maturation differences among lychee cultivars. These genomic resources provide insights into the natural history of lychee domestication and will accelerate the improvement of lychee and related crops."
https://openalex.org/W4206349208,"We determined the relationships between DNA sequence variation and DNA methylation using blood samples from 3,799 Europeans and 3,195 South Asians. We identify 11,165,559 SNP–CpG associations (methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL), P < 10−14), including 467,915 meQTL that operate in trans. The meQTL are enriched for functionally relevant characteristics, including shared chromatin state, High-throuhgput chromosome conformation interaction, and association with gene expression, metabolic variation and clinical traits. We use molecular interaction and colocalization analyses to identify multiple nuclear regulatory pathways linking meQTL loci to phenotypic variation, including UBASH3B (body mass index), NFKBIE (rheumatoid arthritis), MGA (blood pressure) and COMMD7 (white cell counts). For rs6511961 , chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) validates zinc finger protein (ZNF)333 as the likely trans acting effector protein. Finally, we used interaction analyses to identify population- and lineage-specific meQTL, including rs174548 in FADS1, with the strongest effect in CD8+ T cells, thus linking fatty acid metabolism with immune dysregulation and asthma. Our study advances understanding of the potential pathways linking genetic variation to human phenotype. Genome-wide association analyses of DNA methylation in peripheral blood from 3,799 Europeans and 3,195 South Asians identify unique SNP–CpG associations (meQTL), providing insights into molecular mechanisms and the potential links to phenotypic variation."
https://openalex.org/W4206325121,"Female mice exhibit opposing social behaviors toward males depending on their reproductive state: virgins display sexual receptivity (lordosis behavior), while lactating mothers attack. How a change in reproductive state produces a qualitative switch in behavioral response to the same conspecific stimulus is unknown. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identify two distinct subtypes of estrogen receptor-1-positive neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the female ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and demonstrate that they causally control sexual receptivity and aggressiveness in virgins and lactating mothers, respectively. Between- and within-subject bulk-calcium recordings from each subtype reveal that aggression-specific cells acquire an increased responsiveness to social cues during the transition from virginity to maternity, while the responsiveness of the mating-specific population appears unchanged. These results demonstrate that reproductive-state-dependent changes in the relative activity of transcriptomically distinct neural subtypes can underlie categorical switches in behavior associated with physiological state changes."

Here we introduce SLOW5, an alternative format engineered for efficient parallelization and acceleration of nanopore data analysis. Using the example of DNA methylation profiling of a human genome, analysis runtime is reduced from more than two weeks to approximately 10.5 h on a typical high-performance computer. SLOW5 is approximately 25% smaller than FAST5 and delivers consistent improvements on different computer architectures."
https://openalex.org/W4205472873,"Emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens is increasing globally at an alarming rate with a need to discover novel and effective methods to cope infections due to these pathogens. Green nanoparticles have gained attention to be used as efficient therapeutic agents because of their safety and reliability. In the present study, we prepared zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) from aqueous leaf extract of Acacia arabica . The nanoparticles produced were characterized through UV-Visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. In vitro antibacterial susceptibility testing against foodborne pathogens was done by agar well diffusion, growth kinetics and broth microdilution assays. Effect of ZnO NPs on biofilm formation (both qualitatively and quantitatively) and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production was also determined. Antioxidant potential of green synthesized nanoparticles was detected by DPPH radical scavenging assay. The cytotoxicity studies of nanoparticles were also performed against HeLa cell lines. The results revealed that diameter of zones of inhibition against foodborne pathogens was found to be 16–30 nm, whereas the values of MIC and MBC ranged between 31.25–62.5 μg/ml. Growth kinetics revealed nanoparticles bactericidal potential after 3 hours incubation at 2 × MIC for E . coli while for S . aureus and S . enterica reached after 2 hours of incubation at 2 × MIC, 4 × MIC, and 8 × MIC. 32.5–71.0% inhibition was observed for biofilm formation. Almost 50.6–65.1% (wet weight) and 44.6–57.8% (dry weight) of EPS production was decreased after treatment with sub-inhibitory concentrations of nanoparticles. Radical scavenging potential of nanoparticles increased in a dose dependent manner and value ranged from 19.25 to 73.15%. Whereas cytotoxicity studies revealed non-toxic nature of nanoparticles at the concentrations tested. The present study suggests that green synthesized ZnO NPs can substitute chemical drugs against antibiotic resistant foodborne pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4206397678,"Analysis of convalescent plasma derived from individuals has shown that IgG3 has the most important role in binding to SARS-CoV-2 antigens; however, this has not yet been confirmed in large studies, and the link between binding and neutralization has not been confirmed. By analyzing plasma pools consisting of 247–567 individual convalescent donors, we demonstrated the binding of IgG3 and IgM to Spike-1 protein and the receptor-binding domain correlates strongly with viral neutralization in vitro . Furthermore, despite accounting for only approximately 12% of total immunoglobulin mass, collectively IgG3 and IgM account for approximately 80% of the total neutralization. This may have important implications for the development of potent therapies for COVID-19, as it indicates that hyperimmune globulins or convalescent plasma donations with high IgG3 concentrations may be a highly efficacious therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4205514954,"Innate defensive behaviors triggered by environmental threats are important for animal survival. Among these behaviors, defensive attack toward threatening stimuli (for example, predators) is often the last line of defense. How the brain regulates defensive attack remains poorly understood. Here we show that noxious mechanical force in an inescapable context is a key stimulus for triggering defensive attack in laboratory mice. Mechanically evoked defensive attacks were abrogated by photoinhibition of vGAT+ neurons in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN). The vGAT+ AHN neurons encoded the intensity of mechanical force and were innervated by brain areas relevant to pain and attack. Activation of these neurons triggered biting attacks toward a predator while suppressing ongoing behaviors. The projection from vGAT+ AHN neurons to the periaqueductal gray might be one AHN pathway participating in mechanically evoked defensive attack. Together, these data reveal that vGAT+ AHN neurons encode noxious mechanical stimuli and regulate defensive attack in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4205252522,"Hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) polypeptide contributes to regulating energy homeostasis, sleep and memory, although the mechanistic bases of its effects are unknown. In this study, in mice, we uncovered the physiological mechanism underlying the functional role of MCH signaling in projections to the dorsolateral septum (dLS), a region involved in routing hippocampal firing rhythms and encoding spatial memory based on such rhythms. Firing activity within the dLS in response to dorsal CA3 (dCA3) excitation is limited by strong feed-forward inhibition (FFI). We found that MCH synchronizes dLS neuronal firing with its dCA3 inputs by enhancing GABA release, which subsequently reduces the FFI and augments dCA3 excitatory input strength, both via pre-synaptic mechanisms. At the functional level, our data reveal a role for MCH signaling in the dLS in facilitating spatial memory. These findings support a model in which peptidergic signaling within the dLS modulates dorsal hippocampal output and supports memory encoding. The authors uncovered the physiological mechanism underlying the functional role of melanin-concentrating hormone in the dorsolateral septum, a region involved in routing hippocampal firing rhythms and encoding spatial memory."
https://openalex.org/W4206504028,"Gastrointestinal disease (GI) is the most common illness in pre-weaned dairy calves. Studies have associated the fecal microbiome composition with health status, but it remains unclear how the microbiome changes across different levels of GI disease and breeds. Our objective was to associate the clinical symptoms of GI disease with the fecal microbiome. Fecal samples were collected from calves (n = 167) of different breeds (Holstein, Jersey, Jersey-cross and beef-cross) from 4–21 d of age. Daily clinical evaluations assessed health status. Calves with loose or watery feces were diagnosed with diarrhea and classified as bright-sick (BS) or depressed-sick (DS) according to behavior. Calves with normal or semiformed feces and no clinical illness were classified as healthy (H). One hundred and three fecal samples were obtained from consistently healthy calves and 64 samples were from calves with diarrhea (n = 39 BS; n = 25 DS). The V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was sequenced and analyzed. Differences were identified by a linear-mixed effects model with a negative binomial error. DS and Jersey calves had a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus gallolyticus relative to H Holstein calves. In addition, DS calves had a lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and an enrichment of Escherichia coli . Species of the genus Lactobacillus , such as an unclassified Lactobacillus , Lactobacillus reuteri , and Lactobacillus salivarius were enriched in calves with GI disease. Moreover, we created a model to predict GI disease based on the fecal microbiome composition. The presence of Eggerthella lenta , Bifidobacterium longum , and Collinsella aerofaciens were associated with a healthy clinical outcome. Although lactobacilli are often associated with beneficial probiotic properties, the presence of E . coli and Lactobacillus species had the highest coefficients positively associated with GI disease prediction. Our results indicate that there are differences in the fecal microbiome of calves associated with GI disease severity and breed specificities."
https://openalex.org/W4205562661,"Abstract Molecular clocks that record cell ancestry mutate too slowly to measure the short-timescale dynamics of cell renewal in adult tissues. Here, we show that fluctuating DNA methylation marks can be used as clocks in cells where ongoing methylation and demethylation cause repeated ‘flip–flops’ between methylated and unmethylated states. We identify endogenous fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical model to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than the colon, with slower stem cell replacement in the small intestine. Germline APC mutation increased the number of replacements per crypt. In blood, we measured rapid expansion of acute leukemia and slower growth of chronic disease. Thus, the patterns of human somatic cell birth and death are measurable with fluctuating methylation clocks (FMCs)."
https://openalex.org/W4205805601,"Nearly all annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis ( K . brevis ) pose a serious threat to coastal Southwest Florida. These blooms discolor water, kill fish and marine mammals, contaminate shellfish, cause mild to severe respiratory irritation, and discourage tourism and recreational activities, leading to significant health and economic impacts in affected communities. Despite these issues, we still lack standard measures suitable for assessing bloom severity or for evaluating the efficacy of modeling efforts simulating bloom initiation and intensity. In this study, historical cell count observations along the southwest Florida shoreline from 1953 to 2019 were used to develop monthly and annual bloom severity indices (BSI). Similarly, respiratory irritation observations routinely reported in Sarasota and Manatee Counties from 2006 to 2019 were used to construct a respiratory irritation index (RI). Both BSI and RI consider spatial extent and temporal evolution of the bloom, and can be updated routinely and used as objective criteria to aid future socioeconomic and scientific studies of K . brevis . These indices can also be used to help managers and decision makers both evaluate the risks along the coast during events and design systems to better respond to and mitigate bloom impacts. Before 1995, sampling was done largely in response to reports of discolored water, fish kills, or respiratory irritation. During this timeframe, lack of sampling during the fall, when blooms typically occur, generally coincided with periods of more frequent-than-usual offshore winds. Consequently, some blooms may have been undetected or under-sampled. As a result, the BSIs before 1995 were likely underestimated and cannot be viewed as accurately as those after 1995. Anomalies in the frequency of onshore wind can also largely account for the discrepancies between BSI and RI during the period from 2006 to 2019. These findings highlighted the importance of onshore wind anomalies when predicting respiratory irritation impacts along beaches."
https://openalex.org/W4205338709,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of cultivation conditions in the context of light on the retention of selected vitamins, minerals and polyphenols in the stem and cap of the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus L.). Additionally, the effect of the retention of bioactive components on the antioxidant activity of mushroom extracts was evaluated, taking into account the morphological part. Oyster mushrooms grown in the light of 200 lux had higher riboflavin content compared to mushrooms exposed to the light of lower intensity. The thiamine content of the mushrooms dropped with decreasing light intensity during cultivation. The content of biologically active compounds was found to be equal in the stem and the cap. In the case of riboflavin, it was shown that its contents in cap fractions, irrespective of the cultivation method, was statistically significantly higher than in stems. The mineral composition of caps and stems differed from each other. No differences in Zn and Cu content between the morphological parts of the mushroom studied were found. However, it was shown that the stems, regardless of the type of light, contained less iron, magnesium and sodium. Thus, it was observed that limited light exposure caused an increase in the content of total polyphenolic compounds, which did not correlate with antioxidant activity. There was no effect of the light on the antioxidant activity of mushrooms. It was also shown that stem extracts had higher antioxidant activity compared to the extracts obtained from the caps. This findings point to the possibility and potentail of use both fraction of mushrooms in the new food products development."
https://openalex.org/W4206159404,"Every year, billions of egg layer chicks around the world are hatched under highly stressful, industrial circumstances. Here, it is investigated how the stressful procedure in the commercial hatchery, including incubation, hatching, processing, and transport affects the chicks with regards to traits relevant for the egg production industry. These traits were compared to those of a control group hatched in a small incubator and handled gently och quietly in a quiet room without any processing and transport. The chicks were weighed at hatch and at eight additional time points: 4 days, 1 week (w), 2 w, 3 w, 5 w, 8 w, 20 w and 25 w of age. Feather pecking was studied at 15 w of age and damages to the feathers and injuries on the comb and wattle were assessed at 25 w of age. From 19 w of age, eggs were collected on three days per week, counted and weighed. Chicks from a commercial hatchery had a lower hatch weight than control chicks (p<0.001). At 20 w of age, the weight of the commercial hatched chicks was still numerically lower, although this did not reach statistical significance. Commercially hatched chicks tended to show more feather pecking behaviour at 15 w of age compared to control chicks (p<0.1), although feather condition at 25 w of age showed the opposite pattern. Regarding production, commercially hatched chickens laid fewer (p<0.05) and smaller (p<0.05) eggs than chicks hatched and handled under calm circumstances. From this experiment, it is concluded that the stressful experience in the commercial hatchery has an overall negative effect on traits relevant for the industry."
https://openalex.org/W4225878261,"Salt marsh loss is projected to increase as sea-level rise accelerates with global climate change. Salt marsh loss occurs along both lateral creek and channel edges and in the marsh interior, when pannes expand and coalesce. Often, edge loss is attributed to erosive processes whereas dieback in the marsh interior is linked to excessive inundation or deposition of wrack, but remains poorly understood. We conducted a two-year field investigation in a central California estuary to identify key factors associated with panne contraction or expansion. Our study explored how an abundant burrowing crab, shown to have strong negative effects on marsh biomass near creek edges, affects panne dynamics. We also explored which physical panne attributes best predicted their dynamics. To our knowledge, ours is the first study of panne dynamics in a California marsh, despite how ubiquitous pannes are as a feature of marshes in the region and how often extensive marsh dieback occurs via panne expansion. Overall, we found that pannes contracted during the study period, but with variable rates of marsh recovery across pannes. Our model incorporating both physical and biological factors explained 86% of the variation in panne contraction. The model revealed a positive effect of crab activity, sediment accretion, and a composite of depth and elevation on panne contraction, and a negative effect of panne size and distance to nearest panne. The positive crab effects detected in pannes contrast with negative effects we detected near creek edges in a previous study, highlighting the context-dependence of top-down and bioturbation effects in marshes. As global change continues and the magnitude and frequency of disturbances increases, understanding the dynamics of marsh loss in the marsh interior as well as creek banks will be critical for the management of these coastal habitats."
https://openalex.org/W4206531115,"Summer grass weed species are a particular problem in the northeast cropping region of Australia because they are prolific seeders and favor no-till systems. Information on weed seed persistence levels can be used for the development of effective and sustainable integrated weed management programs. A field study was conducted over 42 months to evaluate the seedbank persistence of Chloris truncata , C . virgata , Dactyloctenium radulans , and Urochloa panicoides as affected by burial depth (0, 2, and 10 cm). Regardless of species, buried seeds persisted longer than surface seeds and there was no difference in seed persistence between 2 and 10 cm depths. Surface seeds of C . truncata depleted completely in 12 months and buried seeds in 24 months. Similarly, C . virgata seeds placed on the soil surface depleted in 12 months. Buried seeds of this species took 18 months to completely deplete, suggesting that C . truncata seeds persist longer than C . virgata seeds. Surface seeds of D . radulans took 36 months to completely deplete, whereas about 7% of buried seeds were still viable at 42 months. U . panicoides took 24 and 42 months to completely exhaust the surface and buried seeds, respectively. These results suggest that leaving seeds on the soil surface will result in a more rapid depletion of the seedbank. Information on seed persistence will help to manage these weeds using strategic tillage operations."
https://openalex.org/W4207037435,"Minimum toe clearance (MTC) is an important indicator of the risk of tripping. Aging and neuromuscular diseases often decrease MTC height and increase its variability, leading to a higher risk of tripping. Previous studies have developed visual feedback-based gait training systems to modify MTC. However, these systems are bulky and expensive, and the effects of the training continue only for a short time. We paid attention to the efficacy of vibration in decreasing the variability of gait parameters, and hypothesized that proper vibration applied to soles can reduce the MTC variability. Using shoes embedded with active vibrating insoles, we assessed the efficacy of both sub- and supra-threshold vibration in affecting MTC distribution. Experiment results with 17 young and healthy adults showed that vibration applied throughout the walking task with constant intensity of 130% of sensory threshold significantly decreased MTC variability, whereas sub-threshold vibration yielded no significant effect. These results demonstrate that a properly designed tactile sensory input which is controlled and delivered by a simple wearable device, the active insole, can reduce the MTC variability during walking."
https://openalex.org/W4225666904,"In times of crisis, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain of filtering facepiece respirators, such as N95 respirators, are disrupted. To combat shortages of N95 respirators, many institutions were forced to decontaminate and reuse respirators. While several reports have evaluated the impact on filtration as a measurement of preservation of respirator function after decontamination, the equally important fact of maintaining proper fit to the users' face has been understudied. In the current study, we demonstrate the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of fit test performance of N95 respirators following treatment with dry heat. We apply scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements to analyze filter material changes as a consequence of different decontamination treatments. We further compared the integrity of the respirator after autoclaving versus dry heat treatment via quantitative fit testing and found that autoclaving, but not dry heat, causes the fit of the respirator onto the users face to fail, thereby rendering the decontaminated respirator unusable. Our findings highlight the importance to account for both efficacy of disinfection and mask fit when reprocessing respirators to for clinical redeployment."
https://openalex.org/W4205360573,"Desmanthus (Desmanthus spp.), a tropically adapted pasture legume, is highly productive and has the potential to reduce methane emissions in beef cattle. However, liveweight gain response to desmanthus supplementation has been inconclusive in ruminants. This study aimed to evaluate weight gain, rumen fermentation and plasma metabolites of Australian tropical beef cattle in response to supplementation with incremental levels of desmanthus forage legume in isonitrogenous diets. Forty-eight Brahman, Charbray and Droughtmaster crossbred beef steers were pen-housed and fed a basal diet of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay supplemented with 0, 15, 30 or 45% freshly chopped desmanthus forage on dry matter basis, for 140 days. Varying levels of lucerne (Medicago sativa) hay were added in the 0, 15 and 30% diets to ensure that all diets were isonitrogenous with the 45% desmanthus diet. Data were analyzed using the Mixed Model procedures of SAS software. Results showed that the proportion of desmanthus in the diet had no significant effect on steer liveweight, rumen volatile fatty acids molar proportions and plasma metabolites (P ≥ 0.067). Total bilirubin ranged between 3.0 and 3.6 μmol/L for all the diet treatments (P = 0.67). All plasma metabolites measured were within the expected normal range reported for beef cattle. Rumen ammonia nitrogen content was above the 10 mg/dl threshold required to maintain effective rumen microbial activity and maximize voluntary feed intake in cattle fed low-quality tropical forages. The average daily weight gains averaged 0.5 to 0.6 kg/day (P = 0.13) and were within the range required to meet the target slaughter weight for prime beef markets within 2.5 years of age. These results indicate that desmanthus alone or mixed with other high-quality legume forages can be used to supplement grass-based diets to improve tropical beef cattle production in northern Australia with no adverse effect on cattle health."
https://openalex.org/W4225726015,"The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer. Development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) requires androgen-independent activation of AR, which involves its large N-terminal domain (NTD) and entails extensive epigenetic changes depending in part on histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) that interact with AR. The AR-NTD is rich in low-complexity sequences, including a polyQ repeat. Longer polyQ sequences were reported to decrease transcriptional activity and to protect against prostate cancer, although they can lead to muscular atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations are unclear. Using NMR spectroscopy, here we identify weak interactions between the AR-NTD and the KDM4A catalytic domain, and between the AR ligand-binding domain and a central KDM4A region that also contains low-complexity sequences. We also show that the AR-NTD can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, with longer polyQ sequences phase separating more readily. Moreover, longer polyQ sequences hinder nuclear localization in the absence of hormone and increase the propensity for formation of AR-containing puncta in the nucleus of cells treated with dihydrotestosterone. These results lead us to hypothesize that polyQ-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation may provide a mechanism to decrease the transcriptional activity of AR, potentially opening new opportunities to design effective therapies against CRPC and muscular atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4226013670,"N-Linked glycosylation and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) are important protein post-translational modifications that are orchestrated by a diverse set of gene products. Thus far, the relationship between these two types of glycosylation has remained elusive, and it is unclear whether one influences the other via UDP-GlcNAc, which is a common donor substrate. Theoretically, a decrease in O-GlcNAcylation may increase the products of GlcNAc-branched N-glycans. In this study, via examination by lectin blotting, HPLC, and mass spectrometry analysis, however, we found that the amounts of GlcNAc-branched tri-antennary N-glycans catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GnT-IV) and tetra-antennary N-glycans were significantly decreased in O-GlcNAc transferase knockdown cells (OGT-KD) compared with those in wild type cells. We examined this specific alteration by focusing on SLC35A3, which is the main UDP-GlcNAc transporter in mammals that is believed to modulate GnT-IV activation. It is interesting that a deficiency of SLC35A3 specifically leads to a decrease in the amounts of GlcNAc-branched tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that SLC35A3 interacts with GnT-IV, but not with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V. Western blot and chemoenzymatic labeling assay have confirmed that OGT modifies SLC35A3 and that O-GlcNAcylation contributes to its stability. Furthermore, we found that SLC35A3-KO enhances cell spreading and suppresses both cell migration and cell proliferation, which is similar to the phenomena observed in the OGT-KD cells. Taken together, these data are the first to demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation specifically governs the biosynthesis of tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans via the OGT-SLC35A3-GnT-IV axis."
https://openalex.org/W4205450298,"Survival has improved in bladder cancer but few studies have considered extended periods or covered populations for which medical care is essentially free of charge. We analyzed survival in urothelial cancer (UC, of which vast majority are bladder cancers) in Finland and Sweden over a 50-year period (1967-2016) using data from the NORDCAN database. Finland and Sweden are neighboring countries with largely similar health care systems but higher economic resources and health care expenditure in Sweden. We present results on 1- and 5-year relative survival rates, and additionally provide a novel measure, the difference between 1- and 5-year relative survival, indicating how well survival was maintained between these two periods. Over the 50-year period the median diagnostic age has increased by several years and the incidence in the very old patients has increased vastly. Relative 1- year survival rates increased until early 1990s in both countries, and with minor gains later reaching about 90% in men and 85% in women. Although 5-year survival also developed favorably until early 1990s, subsequent gains were small. Over time, age specific differences in male 1-year survival narrowed but remained wide in 5-year survival. For women, age differences were larger than for men. The limitations of the study were lack of information on treatment and stage. In conclusion, challenges are to improve 5-year survival, to reduce the gender gap and to target specific care to the most common patient group, those of 70 years at diagnosis. The most effective methods to achieve survival gains are to target control of tobacco use, emphasis on early diagnosis with prompt action at hematuria, upfront curative treatment and awareness of high relapse requiring regular cystoscopy follow up."
https://openalex.org/W4205642505,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), an RNA editing enzyme is involved in a site-selective modification of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Its role in the lungs is unknown. The phenotypic characterization of Adarb1 mice that lacked ADAR2 auto-regulation due to the deletion of editing complementary sequence (ΔECS mice) determined the functional role of ADAR2 in the lungs. ADAR2 protein expression increased in the ΔECS mice. These mice display immune cell infiltration and alveolar disorganization. The lung wet by dry ratio indicates there is no lung edema in ΔECS mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis of ΔECS mice reveals a significant increase in neutrophils. Interestingly, ΔECS mice spontaneously develop lung fibrosis as indicated by Sirius red staining of collagen fibers in the lung sections and a significant increase in hydroxyproline level in their lungs. ADAR2 expression increased significantly in a bleomycin mouse model, implicating a role of ADAR2 in lung fibrosis. Furthermore, there is a likely possibility that the genetically modified ΔECS mice does not model the physiological or pathophysiological process of lung fibrosis. Nevertheless, this model is useful in interrogating the role of ADAR2 in the lungs. The Ctgf mRNA and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) protein significantly increased in ΔECS lungs and occurs in bronchial epithelial cells. There is a significant increase in Human antigen R (ELAVL1; HuR) protein levels in ΔECS lungs and suggests a role in stabilizing Ctgf mRNA. Lung mechanics such as total respiratory resistance, Newtonian resistance and tissue damping were increased, whereas inspiratory capacity was decreased in the ΔECS mice. Taken together, these data indicate that overexpression of ADAR2 causes spontaneous lung fibrosis via HuR-mediated CTGF signaling and implicate a role for ADAR2 auto-regulation in lung homeostasis. The identification of ADAR2 target genes in ΔECS mice would facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the role of ADAR2 in the lungs and provide a therapeutic strategy for lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4205817393,"Bacillus cereus is a spore forming bacteria recognized among the leading agents responsible for foodborne outbreaks in Europe. B . cereus is also gaining notoriety as an opportunistic human pathogen inducing local and systemic infections. The real incidence of such infection is likely underestimated and information on genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the incriminated strains is generally scarce. We have recently analyzed a large strain collection of varying pathogenic potential. Screening for biomarkers to differentiate among clinical and non-clinical strains, a gene encoding an alcohol dehydrogenase-like protein was identified among the leading candidates. This family of proteins has been demonstrated to be involved in the virulence of several bacterial species. The relevant gene was knocked out to elucidate its function with regards to resistance to host innate immune response, both in vitro and in vivo . Our results demonstrate that the adhB gene plays a significant role in resistance to nitric oxide and oxidative stress in vitro , as well as its pathogenic ability with regards to in vivo toxicity. These properties may explain the pathogenic potential of strains carrying this newly identified virulence factor."

Correct host species identification is important to increase our knowledge of the ecology and evolutionary pattern of bat viruses in the EU. Bat species identification is commonly determined using morphological keys. Morphological determination of bat species from bat carcasses can be limited in some cases, due to the state of decomposition or nearly indistinguishable morphological features in juvenile bats and can lead to misidentifications. The overall objective of our study was to identify insectivorous bat species using molecular biology tools with the amplification of the partial cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA. Two types of samples were tested in this study, bat wing punches and bat faeces. A total of 163 bat wing punches representing 22 species, and 31 faecal pellets representing 7 species were included in the study. From the 163 bat wing punches tested, a total of 159 were genetically identified from amplification of the partial cyt b gene. All 31 faecal pellets were genetically identified based on the cyt b gene. A comparison between morphological and genetic determination showed 21 misidentifications from the 163 wing punches, representing ~12.5% of misidentifications of morphological determination compared with the genetic method, across 11 species. In addition, genetic determination allowed the identification of 24 out of 25 morphologically non-determined bat samples. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a genetic approach as an efficient and reliable method to identify bat species precisely."
https://openalex.org/W4205587551,"In the present study, we characterize a novel zebrafish mutant of solute carrier 18A2 ( slc18a2 ), also known as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( vmat2 ), that exhibits a behavioural phenotype partially consistent with human Parkinson´s disease. At six days-post-fertilization, behaviour was analysed and demonstrated that vmat2 homozygous mutant larvae, relative to wild types, show changes in motility in a photomotor assay, altered sleep parameters, and reduced dopamine cell number. Following an abrupt lights-off stimulus mutant larvae initiate larger movements but subsequently inhibit them to a lesser extent in comparison to wild-type larvae. Conversely, during a lights-on period, the mutant larvae are hypomotile. Thigmotaxis, a preference to avoid the centre of a behavioural arena, was increased in homozygotes over heterozygotes and wild types, as was daytime sleep ratio. Furthermore, incubating mutant larvae in pramipexole or L-Dopa partially rescued the motor phenotypes, as did injecting glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) into their brains. This novel vmat2 model represents a tool for high throughput pharmaceutical screens for novel therapeutics, in particular those that increase monoamine transport, and for studies of the function of monoamine transporters."

This study aimed to determine a cut-off score that can screen for Alzheimer’s dementia using a novel color vision threshold test named the red, green, and blue (RGB) modified color vision plate test (RGB-vision plate). We developed the RGB-vision plate consisting of 30 plates in which the red and green hues of Ishihara Plate No.22 were sequentially adjusted. A total of 108 older people participated in the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Ishihara plate, and RGB-vision plate. For the analyses, the participants were divided into two groups: Alzheimer’s dementia (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 38). K-means cluster analysis and ROC curve analysis were performed to identify the most appropriate cut-off score. As a result, the cut-off screening score for Alzheimer’s dementia on the RGB-vision plate was set at 25, with an area under the curve of 0.773 ( p &lt;0.001). Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the RGB-vision plate thresholds and MMSE scores (r = -0.36, p = 0.02). In conclusion, patients with Alzheimer’s dementia had a deficit in color vision. The RGB-vision plate is a potential early biomarker that may adequately detect Alzheimer’s dementia."
https://openalex.org/W4226238311,"In peripheral tissues, triiodothyronine (T3) production and consequent thyroid hormone actions are mainly regulated by iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) classified into 3 types: D1, D2, and D3. We aimed to investigate the effects of peripheral DIOs on thyroid hormone economy independent of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. We cloned coding sequences of human DIOs with FLAG-tag and HiBiT-tag sequences into a pcDNA3.1 vector. To obtain full-length proteins, we modified these vectors by cloning the selenocysteine insertion sequence of each DIO (SECIS vectors). Western blot analyses and HiBiT lytic assay using HEK293T cells revealed that SECIS vectors expressed full-length proteins with substantial activity. Subsequently, in vivo transfections of pLIVE-based SECIS vectors into male C57BL/6J mice were performed by hydrodynamic gene delivery to generate mice overexpressing DIOs predominantly in the liver (D1, D2, and D3 mice). After 7 days from transfections, mice were analyzed to clarify phenotypes. To summarize, serum thyroid hormone levels did not change in D1 mice but D2 mice had higher serum free T3 levels. D3 mice developed hypothyroidism with higher serum reverse T3 (rT3) levels. Transfections with levothyroxine administration suggested that thyroid hormone action was upregulated in D2 mice. Our DIO-overexpressing mice provided insights on the physiological properties of upregulated DIOs: D2 augments local thyroid hormone action and recruits T3 into the circulation: D3 decreases circulating T3 and T4 levels with elevated rT3, leading to consumptive hypothyroidism. As D3 mice are expected to be a novel hypothyroidism model, they can contribute to progress in the field of thyroid hormone economy and action."
https://openalex.org/W3118393640,"Today, collaborative playlists (CPs) translate long-standing social practices around music consumption to enable people to curate and listen to music together over streaming platforms. Yet despite the critical role of CPs in digitally connecting people through music, we still understand very little about the needs and desires of real-world users, and how CPs might be designed to best serve them. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we conducted a survey with CP users, collecting open-ended text responses on what aspects of CPs they consider most important and useful, and what they viewed as missing or desired. Using thematic analysis, we derived from these responses the Codebook of Critical CP Factors, which comprises eight categories. We gained insights into which aspects of CPs are particularly useful-for instance, the ability for multiple collaborators to edit a single playlist-and which are absent and desired-such as the ability for collaborators to communicate about a CP or the music contained therein. From these findings we propose design implications to inform further design of CP functionalities and platforms, and highlight potential benefits and challenges related to their adoption in current music services."
https://openalex.org/W4205306357,"This paper evaluates the performance of eight tests with null hypothesis of cointegration on basis of probabilities of type I and II errors using Monte Carlo simulations. This study uses a variety of 132 different data generations covering three cases of deterministic part and four sample sizes. The three cases of deterministic part considered are: absence of both intercept and linear time trend, presence of only the intercept and presence of both the intercept and linear time trend. It is found that all of tests have either larger or smaller probabilities of type I error and concluded that tests face either problems of over rejection or under rejection, when asymptotic critical values are used. It is also concluded that use of simulated critical values leads to controlled probability of type I error. So, the use of asymptotic critical values may be avoided, and the use of simulated critical values is highly recommended. It is found and concluded that the simple LM test based on KPSS statistic performs better than rest for all specifications of deterministic part and sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W4205826131,"Background Prior studies have established those elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at elevated risk for developing influenza-associated complications such as hospitalization, intensive-care admission, and death. This study sought to determine whether influenza vaccination could improve survival among elderly patients with COPD. Materials/Methods This study included Veterans (age ≥ 65 years) diagnosed with COPD that received care at the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA) during four influenza seasons, from 2012–2013 to 2015–2016. We linked VHA electronic medical records and Medicare administrative files to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Death Index cause of death records as well as influenza surveillance data. A multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare rates of mortality of recipients of influenza vaccination to those who did not have records of influenza vaccination. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and healthcare utilization. Results Over a span of four influenza seasons, we included 1,856,970 person-seasons of observation where 1,199,275 (65%) had a record of influenza vaccination and 657,695 (35%) did not have a record of influenza vaccination. After adjusting for comorbidities, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of death during the most severe periods of influenza seasons: 75% all-cause (HR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.24–0.26), 76% respiratory causes (HR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.21–0.26), and 82% pneumonia/influenza cause (HR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.13–0.26). A significant part of the effect could be attributed to “healthy vaccinee” bias as reduced risk of mortality was also found during the periods when there was no influenza activity and before patients received vaccination: 30% all-cause (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.65–0.75), 32% respiratory causes (HR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.60–0.78), and 51% pneumonia/influenza cause (HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.31–0.78). However, as a falsification study, we found that influenza vaccination had no impact on hospitalization due to urinary tract infection (HR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.80–1.18). Conclusions Among elderly patients with COPD, influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4206146708,"Deep vein thrombosis is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For acute proximal deep vein thrombosis, catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is an accepted method for vessel recanalization. Thrombolytic therapy is not without risk, including the potential for hemorrhagic bleeding that increases with lytic dose. Histotripsy is a focused ultrasound therapy that generates bubble clouds spontaneously in tissue at depth. The mechanical activity of histotripsy increases the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy at doses consistent with current pharmacomechanical treatments for venous thrombosis. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of lytic dose on histotripsy-enhanced fibrinolysis. Human whole blood clots formed in vitro were exposed to histotripsy and a thrombolytic agent (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) in a venous flow model perfused with plasma. Lytic was administered into the clot via an infusion catheter at concentrations ranging from 0 (control) to 4.54 μg/mL (a common clinical dose for catheter-directed thrombolysis). Following treatment, perfusate samples were assayed for markers of fibrinolysis, hemolysis, and intact red blood cells and platelets. Fibrinolysis was equivalent between the common clinical dose of rt-PA (4.54 μg/mL) and rt-PA at a reduction to one-twentieth of the common clinical dose (0.23 μg/mL) when combined with histotripsy. Minimal changes were observed in hemolysis for treatment arms with or without histotripsy, potentially due to clot damage from insertion of the infusion catheter. Likewise, histotripsy did not increase the concentration of red blood cells or platelets in the perfusate following treatment compared to rt-PA alone. At the highest lytic dose, a refined histotripsy exposure scheme was implemented to cover larger areas of the clot. The updated exposure scheme improved clot mass loss and fibrinolysis relative to administration of lytic alone. Overall, the data collected in this study indicate the rt-PA dose can be reduced by more than a factor of ten and still promote fibrinolysis when combined with histotripsy."
https://openalex.org/W4206199169,"To evaluate the efficacy, safety and overall clinical outcome of local treatment for recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma after hepatic resection.Between 2007 and 2019 72 consecutive patients underwent hepatic resection for primary intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma. If amenable, recurrent tumors were aggressively treated by HR or stereotactic radiofrequency ablation with local curative intent. Endpoints consisted of morbidity and mortality, locoregional and de novo recurrence, disease free survival, and overall survival.After a median follow-up of 28 months, recurrence of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma was observed in 43 of 72 patients undergoing hepatic resection (60.3%). 16 patients were subsequently treated by hepatic resection (n = 5) and stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (n = 11) with local curative intention. The remaining 27 patients underwent palliative treatment for first recurrence. Overall survival of patients who underwent repeated aggressive liver-directed therapy was comparable to patients without recurrence (p = 0.938) and was better as compared to patients receiving palliative treatment (p = 0.018). The 5-year overall survival rates for patients without recurrence, the repeated liver-directed treatment group and the palliative treatment group were 54.3%, 47.7% and 12.3%, respectively. By adding stereotactic radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment option, the rate of curative re-treatment increased from 11.9% to 37.2%.Repeated hepatic resection is often precluded due to patient morbidity or anatomical and functional limitations. Due to the application of stereotactic radiofrequency ablation in case of recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, the number of patients treated with curative intent can be increased. This leads to favorable clinical outcome as compared to palliative treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma recurrence."

The aim was to explore the immunological and prognostic significance of novel ferroptosis-related genes in STS.We identified ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in STS to construct the networks of enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction. Subsequently, hub genes with prognostic significance were localized and a series of prognostic and immune analyses were performed.40 ferroptosis-related DEGs were identified, of which HELLS, STMN1 EPAS1, CXCL2, NQO1, and IL6 were classified as hub genes and were associated with the prognosis in STS patients. In the results of the immune analysis, PDCD1, CTLA4, TIGIT, IDO1 and CD27 exhibited consistent intense correlations as immune checkpoint genes, as well as macrophage, neutrophil, cytotoxic cell, dendritic cell, interdigitating dendritic cell and plasmacytoid dendritic cell as immune cells. EPAS1 and HELLS might be independent prognostic factors for STS patients, and separate prognostic models were constructed by using them.We recognized novel ferroptosis-related genes with prognostic value in STS. Furthermore, we searched out potential immune checkpoints and critical immune cells."

This study inspired many diachronic and synchronic studies, mostly on English modal verbs and largely assuming the correlation between the use of modal verbs and power relations. Yet, there are continuing debates on sampling design and the choices of corpora. In addition, this hypothesis has not been attested in any other language with comparable corpus size or examined with longitudinal studies. This study tracks the use of Chinese modal verbs from 1901 to 2009, covering the historical events of the New Culture Movement, the establishment of the PRC, the implementation of simplified characters and the completion and finalization of simplification of the Chinese writing system. We found that the usage of modal verbs did rise and fall during the last century, and for more complex reasons. We also demonstrated that our longitudinal end-to-end approach produces convincing analysis on English modal verbs that reconciles conflicting results in the literature adopting Leech's point-to-point approach."

In this study, premature meiosis in male germ cells was observed during the embryonic stage by conditional activation of β-catenin in Sertoli cells. Somatic and germ cell transcriptome results indicated that the BMP signaling pathway was enriched after β-catenin activation. In addition, we observed a decreased DNA methylation within a reduction of DNMT3A in germ cells of β-catenin activated testes and reversed increase after inhibiting BMP signaling pathway with LDN-193189. We also found that Dazl expression was increased in β-catenin activated testes and decreased after LDN treatment. Taken together, this study demonstrates that male germ cells entered meiosis prematurely during the embryonic stage after β-catenin activated in Sertoli cells.

https://openalex.org/W4205419603,"Objective Recently, the State of Kuwait has witnessed a steady rise in the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents. The present study aims to provide an update on the rate of overweight or obesity among Kuwaiti adolescents and examines the associations between adolescents’ overweight/obesity levels and their perception of body weight as seen by parents or friends. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Kuwaiti secondary schools and included adolescents between the ages of 15 and 18 years, using a multistage stratified random sampling method. Body weight and height were measured. A specifically designed self-report questionnaire was used to assess parents’ and friends’ perceptions of an adolescent’s body weight. Results A total of 706 adolescents were included the study. The prevalence of overweight or obesity among Kuwaiti adolescents reached nearly 50%, with males (54.3%) having a significantly higher overweight or obesity percentage than females (44.6%). No significant difference in the prevalence of obesity relative to age, from 15 to 18 years, was found. In addition, logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, revealed that adolescents perceived their parents (p = 0.011 and p &lt; 0.001) or friends (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001) as more likely to classify their weight as overweight or obese, respectively. Conclusion Overweight or obesity levels appear to be high among Kuwaiti adolescents, and appears to have reached a plateau recently. Efforts to combat obesity and promote physical activity and healthy nutrition are needed. Future studies should seek to identify important moderators of parental and social underestimation/overestimation of children’s overweight or obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4205760964,"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is one of the most common human infectious agents, and the mutations in its genome may cause chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was designed to characterize the enhancer-II (Enh-II) region of X gene in HBV positive patients to assess the association of such mutations with CH, LC, and HCC.HBV positive samples (N = 200) with patients' demographic and clinical data were collected from different regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. The Enh-II region of the HBx gene was sequenced and zanalyzed for polymorphism associated with advanced liver disease. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate potent mutations associated with a risk for LC and HCC.HBV Enh-II region sequences analysis revealed 25 different mutations. The highest frequency of mutations S101F (62.2%), A102V/R/G/I (56.25%), M103L/A (68.75%)were found in HCC, followed in LC and CH patients as 57.1%, 42.8%, 28.52% 16%, 15.2% and 18.4% respectively. H94 deletion in the α-box of the Enh-II region, associated with a high risk of HCC was found in half of the HCC patients. This deletion was present in 28.5% of LC and 6.5% of CH patients. Importantly, the high frequency of some notable mutations such as E109A/Y, A110S/K, Y111D/E, and F112L was first time reported in the entire study population. The frequencies of these mutations were high in HCC (43.75%, 37.5%, 50% and 43.75% respectively) as compared to LC (14.28%, 14.28%, 28.2% and 42.8%) and CH patients (12.8%, 15.2%, 16.8% and 16% respectively).Mutations associated with LC and HCC are prevalent in the Enh-II region in Pakistani HBV isolates. The mutations found are alarming in CH patients as these may progress to LC and HCC in a large number of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4205870143,"The demographic development suggests a dramatic growth in the number of elderly patients undergoing surgery in Europe. Most red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) are administered to older people, but little is known about perioperative transfusion practices in this population. In this secondary analysis of the prospective observational multicentre European Transfusion Practice and Outcome Study (ETPOS), we specifically evaluated intraoperative transfusion practices and the related outcomes of 3149 patients aged 65 years and older. Enrolled patients underwent elective surgery in 123 European hospitals, received at least one RBCT intraoperatively and were followed up for 30 days maximum. The mean haemoglobin value at the beginning of surgery was 108 (21) g/l, 84 (15) g/l before transfusion and 101 (16) g/l at the end of surgery. A median of 2 [1-2] units of RBCT were administered. Mostly, more than one transfusion trigger was present, with physiological triggers being preeminent. We revealed a descriptive association between each intraoperatively administered RBCT and mortality and discharge respectively, within the first 10 postoperative days but not thereafter. In our unadjusted model the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.08-1.15) and the HR for discharge was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.83). After adjustment for several variables, such as age, preoperative haemoglobin and blood loss, the HR for mortality was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05-1.15) and HR for discharge was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.87). Pre-operative anaemia in European elderly surgical patients is undertreated. Various triggers seem to support the decision for RBCT. A closer monitoring of elderly patients receiving intraoperative RBCT for the first 10 postoperative days might be justifiable. Further research on the causal relationship between RBCT and outcomes and on optimal transfusion strategies in the elderly population is warranted. A thorough analysis of different time periods within the first 30 postoperative days is recommended."

The volumes of interest (VOIs) from the femoral head to the lesser trochanter and the femoral neck were expressed as 3DFemur. Round regions of interest (ROIs) of image plane drawn over the femoral neck touching the outer cortex were determined as 2Dcoronal. In HU histogram analysis (HUHA), the percentages of HU histogram ranges related to the ROI or VOI were classified as HUHAFat (<0 HU) and HUHABone (126 HU≤). Diagnostic performance, correlation analysis and measurement reliability were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves, correlation coefficient and interobserver correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively.AUCs of each HUHA and mean-HU measurement on 2D-ROI and 3D-VOI were 0.94 or higher (P < 0.001). Both 3DFemur-Mean-HU and 3DFemur-HUHABone showed the highest AUC (0.96). The cut-off value of 3DFemur-Mean-HU was 231HU or less, (sensitivity: 94.8%; specificity: 85.0%; correlation coefficient: -0.65; P <0.001) for diagnosis of osteoporosis. There was no superiority between AUCs in 2D-ROI and 3D-VOI measurements (P > 0.05). Reliability of the 3D-VOI measurement showed perfect agreement (ICC ≥ 0.94), and 2D-ROI showed moderate to good agreement (ICC range: 0.63~0.84).CT indexes on 3D-VOI for predicting femoral osteoporosis showed similar diagnostic accuracy with better reproducibility of measurement, compared with 2D-ROI."
https://openalex.org/W4206263087,"Age-associated intramuscular adipose tissue (IntraMAT) deposition induces the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between IntraMAT and biochemical parameters in older adults remains unclear. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to elucidate the relationship between adiponectin and echo intensity–estimated IntraMAT using ultrasonography in normal-weight older adults (men 9, women 13) and examine biochemical parameters. Blood tests were performed to determine fasting levels of glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol (Total-C), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), free fatty acid, triglycerides (TGs), adiponectin, leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and high-sensitivity tumor necrosis factor, and homoeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Mean gray-scale echo intensity was calculated as the IntraMAT index of the vastus lateralis. Waist circumference was measured at the level of the navel as the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) index. Echo intensity was significantly inversely correlated with adiponectin or LDL-C, and that was significantly positively correlated with TG. Adiponectin level was inversely correlated with waist circumference. Partial correlation analysis with waist circumference as the control variable revealed that adiponectin was inversely correlated with echo intensity, independent of waist circumference, whereas no such correlation was observed after controlling for LDL-C and TG levels. When biochemical parameters were grouped in the principal component analysis, among men, Total-C, insulin, and HOMA-IR or hemoglobin A1c, and high-sensitivity tumor necrosis factor–alpha were grouped with the same distribution for factors 1 and 2. Among women, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and Total-C or TGs were grouped with the same distribution for factors 1 and 2. These data suggest that adiponectin level is related to IntraMAT content, independent of VAT in normal-weight older adults. The dynamics of adiponectin might not be similar to those of other circulating biochemical parameters in older men and women."
https://openalex.org/W4206298754,"Introduction The objective of this study was to use a prospective error analysis method to examine the process of dispensing medication in community pharmacy settings and identify remedial solutions to avoid potential errors, categorising them as strong, intermediate, or weak based on an established patient safety action hierarchy tool. Method Focus group discussions and non-participant observations were undertaken to develop a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), and subsequent focus group discussions applied the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) focusing on the task of dispensing medication in community pharmacies. Remedial measures identified through the SHERPA analysis were then categorised as strong, intermediate, or weak based on the Veteran Affairs National Centre for Patient Safety action hierarchy. Non-participant observations were conducted at 3 pharmacies, totalling 12 hours, based in England. Additionally, 7 community pharmacists, with experience ranging from 8 to 38 years, participated in a total of 4 focus groups, each lasting between 57 to 85 minutes, with one focus group discussing the HTA and three applying SHERPA. A HTA was produced consisting of 10 sub-tasks, with further levels of sub-tasks within each of them. Results Overall, 88 potential errors were identified, with a total of 35 remedial solutions proposed to avoid these errors in practice. Sixteen (46%) of these remedial measures were categorised as weak, 14 (40%) as intermediate and 5 (14%) as strong according to the Veteran Affairs National Centre for Patient Safety action hierarchy. Sub-tasks with the most potential errors were identified, which included ‘producing medication labels’ and ‘final checking of medicines’. The most common type of error determined from the SHERPA analysis related to omitting a check during the dispensing process which accounted for 19 potential errors. Discussion This work applies both HTA and SHERPA for the first time to the task of dispensing medication in community pharmacies, detailing the complexity of the task and highlighting potential errors and remedial measures specific to this task. Future research should examine the effectiveness of the proposed remedial solutions to improve patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W4225273864,"Maintenance of the energy balance is indispensable for cell survival and function. Adenylate kinase (Ak) is a ubiquitous enzyme highly conserved among many organisms. Ak plays an essential role in energy regulation by maintaining adenine nucleotide homeostasis in cells. However, its role at the whole organism level, especially in animal behavior, remains unclear. Here, we established a model using medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) to examine the function of Ak in environmental adaptation. Medaka overexpressing the major Ak isoform Ak1 exhibited increased locomotor activity compared to that of the wild type. Interestingly, this increase was temperature dependent. Our findings suggest that cellular energy balance can modulate locomotor activity."

Type III polyketides undergo O -methylation at hydroxyl end to play a wide spectrum of roles in bacteria, plants, algae, and fungi. Mycobacterium marinum harbours a distinctive genomic cluster with a type III pks gene and genes for several polyketide modifiers including a methyltransferase gene, mmar_2193 . This study reports functional analyses of MMAR_2193 and reveals multi-methylating potential of the protein. Comparative sequence analyses revealed conservation of catalytically important motifs in MMAR_2193 protein. Homology-based structure-function and molecular docking studies suggested type III polyketide cores as possible substrates for MMAR_2193 catalysis. In vitro enzymatic characterization revealed the capability of MMAR_2193 protein to utilize diverse polyphenolic substrates to methylate several hydroxyl positions on a single substrate molecule. High-resolution mass spectrometric analyses identified multi-methylations of type III polyketides in cell-free reconstitution assays. Notably, our metabolomics analyses identified some of these methylated molecules in biofilms of wild type Mycobacterium marinum . This study characterizes a novel mycobacterial O -methyltransferase protein with multi-methylating enzymatic ability that could be exploited to generate a palette of structurally distinct bioactive molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4205989932,"To date, more than 2400 valid fish species have been recorded in the Amazon basin. However, some regions remain poorly documented. This is the case in the Beni basin and in particular in one of its main sub-basins, the Tuichi, an Andean foothills rivers flowing through the Madidi National Park in the Bolivian Amazonia. The knowledge of its ichthyological diversity is, however, essential for the management and protection of aquatic ecosystems, which are threatened by the development of infrastructures (dams, factories and cities), mining and deforestation. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been relatively little used so far in the Amazon basin. We sampled eDNA from water in 34 sites in lakes and rivers in the Beni basin including 22 sites in the Tuichi sub-basin, during the dry season. To assess the biogeographical patterns of the amazonian ichthyofauna, we implemented a metabarcoding approach using two pairs of specific primers designed and developed in our laboratory to amplify two partially overlapping CO1 fragments, one of 185bp and another of 285bp. We detected 252 fish taxa (207 at species level) among which 57 are newly identified for the Beni watershed. Species compositions are significantly different between lakes and rivers but also between rivers according to their hydrographic rank and altitude. Furthermore, the diversity patterns are related to the different hydro-ecoregions through which the Tuichi flows. The eDNA approach makes it possible to identify and complete the inventory of the ichthyofauna in this still poorly documented Amazon basin. However, taxonomic identification remains constrained by the lack of reference barcodes in public databases and does not allow the assignment of all OTUs. Our results can be taken into account in conservation and management strategies and could serve as a baseline for future studies, including on other Andean tributaries."
https://openalex.org/W4206277778,"Background The guitar-playing community is the largest group at risk of developing playing related musculoskeletal disorders. A thorough investigation of the relationships between the various risk factors and players’ report on musculoskeletal pain using objective and accurate means of assessment has yet to be reported. Purpose (a) to explore the correlations between demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, playing habits, and personal habits of guitar player and their complaints of musculoskeletal pain, (b) explore the correlations between the upper body kinematics of guitar players during playing the guitar and their complaints of musculoskeletal pain, and (c) compare the upper body kinematics of guitar players during playing the guitar while sitting versus standing. Methods Twenty-five guitar players (27.5±4.6 years old) filled out questionnaires regarding their guitar-playing habits, and the Standardized Nordic Questionnaires for the analysis of musculoskeletal symptoms. Kinematics of their torso and upper limbs were tracked while they played a tune twice, once while sitting and once while standing. Results We found moderate correlations between the number of painful joints in the last year and factors, such as physical comfort while playing, years of playing, and position during playing. During standing, lower back pain severity correlated with the rotation range of the torso, while during sitting, it moderately correlated with the average radial-ulnar deviation of the right wrist. During sitting, we found higher anterior and right tilt of the torso, combined with greater abduction of the right shoulder, higher flexion in the left shoulder and higher radial deviation in the left wrist. Conclusion Our results point to several risk factors, related both to playing habits but also to playing posture, which should be considered by the guitar players in order to prevent playing-related musculoskeletal disorders."
