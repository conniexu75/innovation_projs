https://openalex.org/W2068116440,"Block of Ca2+ channel current by dihydropyridines and by ω-conotoxin (ω-CgTx) was studied in a variety of freshly dissociated rat neurons. In most neurons, including those from dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia, spinal cord, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, nitrendipine and ω-CgTx each blocked a fraction of the high-threshold current, but a substantial fraction of current remained even when the two blockers were applied together at saturating concentrations. An extreme case was cerebellar Purkinje neurons, in which very little current was blocked by either nitrendipine or ω-CgTx. These results demonstrate the existence in mammalian neurons of high-threshold channels that are resistant to both ω-CgTx and dihydropyridine blockers. Such channels might underlie instances of synaptic transmission and other processes that depend on Ca2+ entry but are not sensitive to these blockers."
https://openalex.org/W1500217596,"Abstract In patch-clamp experiments on rat liver mitoplasts, cyclosporin A inhibited the activity of the recently described (Petronilli, V., Szabo, I., and Zoratti, M. (1989) FEBS Lett. 259, 137-143) 1.3-nanosiemens of the inner mitochondrial membrane at concentrations in the 10(-8)-10(-7) M range. The inhibitor acts when present on the matrix side of membrane. The Ca2(+)-dependent permeability transition channel of mitochondria is inhibited by cyclosporin A in the same concentration range. The results suggest therefore that the same pore is responsible for the permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and for the conduction of the high currents observed in electrophysiological experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1574967633,"Upon disulfide bond reduction, the alpha 2-subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel undergoes a characteristic mobility shift on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with the concurrent appearance of the three delta peptides delta 1 (25,000 Da), delta 2 (22,000 Da), and delta 3 (17,000 Da). Densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained gels shows a stoichiometric ration of 1.0:0.31.47:0.08 for the alpha 2-subunit and the delta peptides 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Characterization of the delta peptides using antibodies, photoincorporation of a hydrophobic probe, and lectin staining shows tham to be antigenically similar hydrophobic glycoproteins. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the delta peptides reveals three identical sequences that match the predicted amino acid sequence of the alpha 2-subunit starting at Ala935. Enzymatic deglycosylation of the reduced alpha 2.delta complex produces individual core peptides of 105,000 and 17,000 Da, respectively. Treatment of skeletal muscle membranes with high pH in the presence of reducing agents is able to extract the larger amino-terminal peptide but not the smaller carboxyl (delta) peptide, consistent with a single transmembrane domain in the carboxyl (delta) region. The data support a model of the alpha 2-subunit in which the propeptide is processed into two chains that remain attached through disulfide linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2086103921,"Changes in heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor gene expression and receptor phenotype occur during liver regeneration and in hepatoma cells. The nucleotide sequence of complementary DNA predicts that three amino-terminal domain motifs, two juxtamembrane motifs, and two intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain motifs combine to form a minimum of 6 and potentially 12 homologous polypeptides that constitute the growth factor receptor family in a single human liver cell population. Amino-terminal variants consisted of two transmembrane molecules that contained three and two immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops, as well as a potential intracellular form of the receptor. The two intracellular juxtamembrane motifs differed in a potential serine-threonine kinase phosphorylation site. One carboxyl-terminal motif was a putative tyrosine kinase that contained potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The second carboxyl-terminal motif was probably not a tyrosine kinase and did not exhibit the same candidate carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1572268730,"A synthetic, 28-residue peptide derived from the calmodulin-binding sequence of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (C28W) inhibits the ATPase activity of a calpain-produced, truncated fragment of the enzyme. The fragment, which has lost the calmodulin-binding domain, has a molecular mass of 124 kDa and is fully active in the absence of calmodulin. Replacement of Trp-8 in the peptide by an Ala decreases the overall inhibitory activity, while replacement with a Tyr increases it. However, at very low peptide concentrations the effect of Tyr replacement disappears. The synthetic peptide has been made photoactivatable by replacing Phe in position 9 with a synthetic phenylalanine analogue containing a diazirine group and was radioactively labeled by coupling a [3H]acetyl function to its N terminus. After cross-linking with the derivatized peptide, the 124-kDa fragment has been proteolyzed with either Lys-C, Asp-N, or V8 proteases, and the fragment(s) have been separated. Partial sequencing of the cross-linked, radioactive peptides has identified a site of the pump located C terminally to the phosphoenzyme-forming aspartic acid, spanning residues 537-544 of the hPMCA4 isoform of the enzyme. It is concluded that this sequence is part of a site which binds the calmodulin-binding domain of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W1530138845,"The purification and cloning of a novel metalloproteinase inhibitor (MI or TIMP-2) related to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) has been recently described by our laboratory (DeClerck, Y.A., Yean, T. D., Ratzkin, B.J., Lu, H.S., and Langley, K.E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17445-17453; Boone, T.C., Johnson, M.J., DeClerck, Y.A., and Langley, K.E. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 2800-2804). We have transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with a vector containing human MI/TIMP-2 cDNA and purified recombinant-derived MI/TIMP-2 (rMI/rTIMP-2) from the conditioned medium of such cells. We have investigated the inhibitory activity of rMI/rTIMP-2 toward rabbit fibroblast interstitial collagenase. The inhibition of activated collagenase by rMI/rTIMP-2 is stoichiometric and consistent with the formation of a 1:1 molar ratio complex. In addition to blocking the activated enzyme, rMI/rTIMP-2 inhibits the conversion of 52-kDa procollagenase to the 42-kDa active enzyme initiated by organomercurials. When plasmin is used as activator, rMI/rTIMP-2 does not inhibit the plasmin-mediated conversion of the 52-kDa proenzyme to the 46-kDa inactive intermediate but blocks further conversion of the 46-kDa intermediate to the 42-kDa active enzyme. The data indicate that rMI/rTIMP-2 blocks the autoproteolytic activation of procollagenase. Also, rMI/rTIMP-2 forms complexes with the 52-kDa procollagenase, the 46-kDa intermediate, and with the 42-kDa activated enzyme which are stable to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), such that the complexes can be visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It appears that the formation of a SDS-stable complex with procollagenase requires an initial conformational change of the procollagenase brought about by organomercurials or by plasmin cleavage. The data suggest that MI/TIMP-2 may be able to control the extracellular action of certain metalloproteinases not only at the level of the activated enzyme but also at the level of proenzyme activation."
https://openalex.org/W1562578444,"Regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in single cultured rat hippocampal neurons was investigated using the fluorescent pHi indicator dye bis-carboxyethylcarboxyfluorescein. Resting pHi was dependent on the presence of bicarbonate and external Na+ but was not altered significantly by removal of Cl- or treatment with the anion exchange inhibitor diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. Recovery of pHi from acute acid loading was due, in large part, to a pharmacologically distinct variant of the Na+/H+ antiporter. In nominally HCO3(-)-free solutions, this recovery exhibited a saturable dose dependence on extracellular Na+ (Km = 23-26 mM) or Li+. The antiporter was activated by decreasing pHi and was unaffected by collapse of the membrane potential with valinomycin. Like the Na+/H+ antiporter described in other cell systems, the hippocampal activity was inhibited by harmaline, but in sharp contrast, neither amiloride nor its more potent 5-amino-substituted analogues were able to prevent the recovery from an acid load. These data indicate that Na(+)-dependent mechanisms dominate pHi regulation in hippocampal neurons and suggest a role for a novel variant of the Na+/H+ antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1592310078,"We established a simple and efficient method for gene transfer in vitro (to cultured cells) and in vivo (to an adult organ) using liposomes. Plasmid DNA and proteins were efficiently co-encapsulated in liposomes by agitation and sonication, and were co-introduced into cells by hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-mediated membrane fusion. Introduction of the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene with non-histone chromosomal protein high mobility group 1 (HMG1) into LLCMK2 cells resulted in about 3 times higher beta-galactosidase activity than that on introduction of the gene alone. Two days after injection of HVJ-liposomes containing the beta-galactosidase gene and HMG1 under the perisplanchnic membrane of adult rat liver, hepatic cells near the injection site were found by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside staining to have beta-galactosidase activity. After similar injection of HVJ-liposomes containing the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) gene and HMG1, HBsAg was detected in the serum for 9 days with a maximum of 25-45 ng/ml on day 2 after the injection."
https://openalex.org/W1511443044,"Verocytotoxins comprise a family of closely related subunit proteins. Two members of this group, VT1 and the immunologically distinct VT2, have been found to share similar physical properties, and yet several differences in their biological activities have been noted. The subunits of these toxins were separated using urea and isolated by high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration. Reconstituted VT1 and VT2 as well as VT1-A:VT2-B and VT2-A:VT1-B hybrid toxins were then prepared. The B subunit was found to determine cell culture specificity, cytotoxic titer, and antibody neutralizability as determined on Vero and MRC-5 cells. Cross-linking isolated B chains revealed 5 species upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for both VT1-B and VT2-B. Using an in vitro translation system, both toxin A subunits inhibited protein synthesis at concentrations as low as 4 pM. In glycolipid binding assays, VT1 and VT1-B subunits competed equally on a molar basis with 125I-VT1 for the receptor, globotriaosylceramide, however, a 1000-fold excess of VT2 was required. Ligand analysis of direct VT1 and VT2 receptor binding assays revealed a difference in binding affinity constants (Kd of VT1 = 4.6 x 10(-8) M; VT2 = 3.7 x 10(-7) M)."
https://openalex.org/W2057495398,"The role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in signaling the development of the neuromuscular junction was examined. Beads coated with bFGF induced the formation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters in cultured Xenopus myotomal muscle cells. Tyrphostin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abolished AChR clustering induced by bFGF beads, suggesting a role of tyrosine kinase activation in AChR clustering. Using specific antibodies, we demonstrated the presence of both bFG F and its receptor in the myotomal muscle in vivo during the period of neuromuscular connection. However, similar tissue from older animals with mature neuromuscular junctions showed an apparently truncated form of the bFGF receptor. These data suggest that bFG F may play a role in signaling synaptogenesis in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1526061497,"The superoxide (O2-) forming NADPH oxidase complex of resting phagocytes can be activated in a cell-free system by certain anionic amphiphiles, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). For O2- production to occur, the participation of both membrane-associated and cytosol-derived components is required. The purpose of this investigation was to isolate and characterize the membrane component of NADPH oxidase. For this purpose, guinea pig macrophage membranes were extracted with 1 M NaCl, solubilized by 40 mM octyl glucoside, and subjected to a purification sequence consisting of absorption with DEAE-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. At each purification step, fractions were assayed for their ability to support SDS-elicited, cytosol-dependent O2- production, following incorporation in liposomes of phosphatidylcholine. We found that membrane oxidase activity copurified strictly with cytochrome b559. Peak hydroxylapatite fractions exhibited specific O2(-)-forming activity in the range of 81-115 mumol of O2-/mg protein/min and a specific cytochrome b559 content of 7-14 nmol of cytochrome b559/mg protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the peak oxidase activity fractions, derived by hydroxylapatite chromatography, revealed essentially two bands that were identified as the beta (54-60 kDa) and alpha (21/22 kDa) subunits of guinea pig cytochrome b559. The relation of the two polypeptides to cytochrome b559 was established by correlation with a spectral signal characteristic of cytochrome b559, immunoblotting with antibodies against defined human cytochrome b559 beta and alpha chain peptides, cross-linking studies, and deglycosylation experiments. Hydroxylapatite-purified membrane oxidase preparations did not contain FAD and were free of cytochrome c reductase activity. Purified membrane oxidase preparations were also capable of cooperating with purified cytosolic components in SDS-elicited cell-free O2- production. We conclude that the membrane-associated component of the O2- generating NADPH oxidase is identical to cytochrome b559."
https://openalex.org/W1500857007,"The mitochondrial (peripheral-type) benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) is a drug binding site associated with outer mitochondrial membranes which is coupled to intramitochondrial cholesterol transport, the rate-determining step of steroid biosynthesis. To examine the relationship between MBR function and steroid synthesis regulated by polypeptide hormones, the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines were used as model systems responsive to adrenocorticotropin and human choriogonadotropin, respectively. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine which binds to MBR with high nanomolar affinity, inhibited the steroidogenic activity of these hormones, or the activation by 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP, in both cell lines by 30-60% with an IC50 of 500-1000 nM. Scatchard analysis in both cell lines revealed one class of specific binding sites for [3H] flunitrazepam verified as being MBR by displacement studies with a series of MBR ligands. The potencies of these ligands to compete against the antagonism of hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis by flunitrazepam correlated significantly with their abilities to compete against [3H]flunitrazepam binding to MBR (r = 0.99). An inhibition in pregnenolone formation was also observed in isolated mitochondrial preparations characterized as a reduction of cholesterol transport to inner mitochondrial membranes. These observations provide unequivocal evidence that the antagonistic action of flunitrazepam is mediated through its interaction with MBR demonstrating that these drug recognition sites are coupled to steroid biosynthesis activated by tropic hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2136014098,"The tumor promoter thapsigargin releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores by specific inhibition of microsomal Ca-ATPase activity without inositol phosphate formation. Recent studies of the actions of thapsigargin support the concept that the level of Ca2+ within the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive intracellular pool regulates the Ca2+ permeability of the plasma membrane. We examined the effects of thapsigargin on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single rat parotid cells using digital fluorescence microscopy. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o), thapsigargin transiently increased [Ca2+]i. Following the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i transient, carbachol in the continued absence of Ca2+o was unable to raise [Ca2+]i, indicating that thapsigargin mobilizes Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive store. In the converse experiment, carbachol prevented a rise of [Ca2+]i by thapsigargin, suggesting that the IP3- and thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pools are the same. Depletion of Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive pool by thapsigargin enhanced plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability. Thapsigargin triggered sustained Ca2+ oscillations in Ca2(+)-containing medium which are highly reminiscent of agonist-induced oscillations in these cells. Carbachol addition rapidly raised IP3 levels during oscillations triggered by thapsigargin but did not elevate [Ca2+]i, indicating that the IP3-sensitive pool remains continuously depleted during [Ca2+]i fluctuations. The results from this study rule out the involvement of the IP3-sensitive pool in the mechanisms involved in thapsigargin-induced (and by analogy, agonist-induced) oscillations in parotid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1600090192,"Abstract The two tissue-specific isozymes of angiotensin-converting enzyme are encoded by two mRNAs. The 5-kilobase pulmonary mRNA (mRNAP) and the 2.5-kilobase testicular mRNA (mRNAT) have identical sequences near their 3'-ends, whereas each has a unique sequence toward its 5'-end. Here we report that the two mRNAs originate from the same gene by initiation of transcription at two alternative sites. We have isolated a rabbit genomic clone which encodes these mRNAs. The sequence organization of the genome is such that the unique sequence of mRNAP precedes that of mRNAT, which in turn precedes the sequence common to both species. For generation of mRNAP, the mRNAT-specific sequence is eliminated as an intron from the primary transcript by splicing. Transcription of mRNAT, on the other hand, initiates within this intron at the middle of the gene. The exact initiation sites of mRNAT and mRNAP have been determined by DNA sequencing; DNA, oligonucleotide, and antisense RNA protection assays; and primer extension assays. Analyses of the sequence upstream of the transcription initiation sites revealed the presence of putative binding sites of several known transcription factors including SP-1, AP-2, and IID."
https://openalex.org/W1528476113,"ts85, a cell line that harbors a mutant thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, fails to degrade short lived proteins at the restrictive temperature (Ciechanover, A., Finley, D., and Varshavsky, A. (1984) Cell 37, 57-66). However, the involvement of the ubiquitin system in the degradation of long lived proteins (most cellular proteins fall in this category) has not been addressed. In the present study we show that upon shifting the mutant cells to the restrictive temperature, there is no change in the rate of degradation of long lived proteins. In contrast, shifting the wild-type cells (FM3A) to the high temperature is accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the rate of proteolysis of this group of proteins. This heat-induced accelerated degradation can be inhibited completely by NH4Cl and chloroquine. Similarly, exposure of the cells to starvation, a stimulus that activates the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, has no effect on the degradation of long lived proteins in the mutant cells after inactivation of E1. Under the same conditions, the degradation rate in the wild-type cells increases almost 4-fold. Analogous results were obtained using a different cell line that also harbors a thermolabile E1 (ts20 (Kulka, R. G., Raboy, B., Schuster, R., Parag, H. A., Diamond, G., Ciechanover, A., and Marcus, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15726-15731)). Cycloheximide and 3-methyladenine, known inhibitors of formation of autophagic vacuoles, inhibit the heat-induced accelerated degradation of long lived proteins in wild-type cells. Taken together, the results suggest that 1) heat stress induces enhanced degradation of intracellular proteins; 2) the process occurs most probably in autophagic vacuoles; and 3) activation of ubiquitin is required for the formation of these vacuoles. As there is no change in the basal rate of degradation of intracellular proteins in the mutant cells at the restrictive temperature, it appears that the ubiquitin system is not involved in their breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2142345534,"Interactions of certain naturally occurring, amphiphilic polypeptides with membranes were investigated. Mastoparan (wasp venom toxin), melittin (bee venom toxin), cardiotoxin (cobra venom toxin), and polymyxin B (antibacterial antibiotic) inhibited protein kinase C stimulated by phosphatidylserine bilayer or arachidonate monomer and blocked binding of [3H] phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to protein kinase C in the presence of phosphatidylserine bilayer, with IC50 values (concentrations causing 50% inhibition) of 1-8 microM. Mastoparan and polymyxin B were much less inhibitory (IC50, 10-20 microM), whereas melittin and cardiotoxin were similarly inhibitory (IC50, 1-4 microM), when protein kinase C was activated instead by synaptosomal membrane. Kinetic analysis indicate that mastoparan inhibited protein kinase C, assayed using phosphatidylserine or synaptosomal membrane as the phospholipid cofactor, competitively with the phospholipid cofactor, in a mixed manner with CaCl2 or diacylglycerol, noncompetitively with histone, and uncompetitively with ATP, with apparent Ki values of 1.6-18.7 microM. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase in the membrane by these polypeptides had relative potencies different from those for their inhibition of protein kinase C activated by the same membrane preparation; mastoparan and melittin inhibited the two activities with comparable potencies, but polymyxin B and cardiotoxin were far less effective in inhibiting Na,K-ATPase. The same relative inhibitory potencies of the polypeptides (melittin greater than mastoparan greater than polymyxin B) for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase were also noted for their inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, 86Rb uptake (Na+ pump) by HL60 cells and the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of the leukemia cells. These findings were consistent with discrete interactions of the polypeptides with functionally distinct sites on the membrane, leading to differential inhibition of biological activities associated with the membrane. Actions of certain polypeptides appeared to be more specific compared to those of lipid second messengers such as lyso-phosphatidylcholine and sphingosine, and the antineoplastic ether lipid analogs such as 1-O-octadecyl-2-methyl-rac-glycero-3-ophosphocholine."
https://openalex.org/W1486388803,"The muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer was used as a target to study the specificity of DNA binding and trans-activation by members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD1, myogenin, myf-5, and MRF4. Whereas all four myogenic factors bound with similar affinities to the MCK enhancer in the presence of the widely expressed HLH protein E12, only MyoD1, myogenin, and myf-5 efficiently trans-activated the enhancer in transiently transfected 10T1/2 and 3T3 cells. That MRF4 binds the MCK enhancer without activating transcription suggests that domains in addition to those required for DNA binding are important for transcriptional activation and supports the notion that the different members of the HLH family of myogenic regulatory factors may selectively regulate unique sets of muscle-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1510668117,"The effect of pretreatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on chromate-induced DNA damage, cytotoxicity, and enzyme inhibition as well as on the cellular reduction of chromium(VI) was investigated using Chinese hamster V-79 cells. Cellular pretreatment with nontoxic levels of 1 mM ascorbic acid for 24 h prior to exposure resulted in a significant increase (1.7-fold) in cellular levels of this vitamin. Alkaline elution assays demonstrated that this pretreatment decreased cellular levels of Na2CrO4-induced alkali-labile sites while the numbers of DNA-protein crosslinks produced by chromate increased. In colony-forming assays, pretreatment with ascorbic acid enhanced the cytotoxicity of chromate. However, the inhibition of glutathione reductase attributed to Na2CrO4 was attenuated by this pretreatment. Under the same experimental condition, the uptake of chromate in pretreated cells was found to increase. ESR studies revealed that cellular pretreatment with ascorbic acid reduced the level of chromium(V) intermediate and increased the level of chromium(III) complex, indicating that cellular reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) was accelerated by this vitamin. These results suggest that ascorbic acid decreases chromate-induced alkali-labile sites and chromium inhibition of glutathione reductase, but it enhances DNA-protein cross-links and cytotoxicity caused by this metal through its ability to directly reduce chromium(VI)."
https://openalex.org/W1608247033,"In a previous report (Reece, R. J., and Maxwell, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19648-19653) we showed that treatment of the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase A protein with trypsin generates two stable fragments. The N-terminal 64-kDa fragment supports DNA supercoiling, while the C-terminal 33-kDa fragment shows no enzymic activity. We proposed that the 64-kDa fragment represents the DNA breakage-reunion domain of the A protein. We have now engineered the gyrA gene such that the 64-kDa protein is generated as a gene product. The properties of this protein confirm the findings of the experiments with the 64-kDa tryptic fragment. We have also generated a series of deletions of the gyrA gene such that C-terminal and N-terminal truncated versions of the A protein are produced. The smallest of the N-terminal fragments found to be able to carry out the DNA breakage-reunion reaction is GyrA(1-523). The cleavage reaction mediated by this protein occurs with equal efficacy as that performed by the intact GyrA protein. Deletion of the N-terminal 6 amino acids from either the A protein or these deletion derivatives has no effect on enzymic activity, while deletion of the N-terminal 69 amino acids completely abolishes the DNA breakage-reunion reaction. Therefore the smallest GyrA protein we have found that will perform DNA breakage and reunion is GyrA(7-523). A model is proposed for the domain organization of the gyrase A protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510475440,"Recent studies on the glucagon antagonist des-His1-[Glu9]glucagon amide have resulted in pure inhibitors of the hormone, suggesting that the inhibitory properties may be centered around position 9. The present study was designed to investigate the chemical characteristics of substitutions in position 9 of glucagon that determine binding affinity and biological activity. Twenty replacement analogs of position 9 of glucagon were synthesized and assessed for their ability to bind to the glucagon receptor in rat hepatocyte membranes and to activate adenylate cyclase. Any substitution of aspartic acid 9 was accompanied by a severely diminished capacity to transmit the biological signal, while retaining receptor binding affinity. These results are an indication of an uncoupling of receptor binding and biological activity at this locus and define a central role of aspartic acid 9 in glucagon activity. Single replacement or deletion of either His1 or Asp9 in glucagon caused a 20- to 50-fold decrease in cyclase activity, whereas these same changes made in tandem caused virtually complete loss of activity, with decreases of 10(4)-to 10(6)-fold. These observations have led us to speculate that, at the molecular level, the region of glucagon required for transduction of the biological response may be distinct from the binding region and is mediated by a coupled interaction between His1 and Asp9 of the hormone and a complementary functional site of the glucagon receptor."
https://openalex.org/W45725462,"The rab3A gene product is a 25-kilodalton guanine nucleotide-binding protein, expressed at high levels in neural tissue, which has about 30% homology to ras. Recombinant rab3A protein and p25rab3A purified from bovine brain membranes have been used as substrates to look for factors that regulate its biochemical activity. A detergent-soluble factor associated with rat brain membranes exists that accelerates the GTPase activity of both mammalian and recombinant p25rab3A. The activity was thermolabile, sensitive to trypsin, and behaved like an integral membrane protein. GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward p25rab3A was also detected in the cytosolic fraction. This activity was observed in all other tissues examined, in addition to brain. Based upon dose-response data, the rab3A-GAP activity from rat brain was approximately equally distributed between cytosolic and membrane fractions; no activity was found in the nuclear fraction. Recombinant ras-specific GAP had no effect upon the GTPase activity of p25rab3A. By gel filtration chromatography, the factor in rat brain cytosol has a molecular size of 400,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1610263906,"Abstract Agents which elevate cellular cAMP (prostaglandin E2, theophylline, and forskolin) or mimic cAMP action (dibutyryl cAMP) are known to inhibit human neutrophil activation (superoxide generation and secretion) by receptor-linked agonists such as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Herein, we show that these agents also markedly inhibit fMLP-stimulated diradylglycerol generation (assayed by mass methods). The magnitude of inhibition correlated with the ability of a given agent or combination of agents to elevate cAMP. Both 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-O-alkyl,2-acyl glycerol generation were affected. Effects on the latter species, as well as a lack of effect on fMLP-stimulated inositol phosphate release, implied that cAMP affected diradylglycerol generation from a source other than phospholipase C-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis, since phosphatidylinositols do not contain appreciable quantities of the 1-O-alkyl linkage. In cells in which the phosphatidylcholine pool was prelabeled using 1-O-[3H]octadecyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, prostaglandin E2 plus theophylline inhibited the fMLP-activated rapid generation of [3H]phosphatidic acid and its subsequent conversion to [3H]diradylglycerol, implying an effect at the level of phospholipase D. In the presence of ethanol, the fMLP-activated transphosphatidylation of [3H]phosphatidylcholine to generate [3H]phosphatidylethanol (a phospholipase D-dependent reaction) was also markedly inhibited. In contrast, when phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was used to activate cells, cAMP-related agents had no effect on phospholipase D activity, diradylglycerol generation, or superoxide generation. The data indicate an inhibitory effect of cyclic AMP on receptor-mediated phospholipase D activation at a site proximal to phospholipase D (e.g., the receptor or G protein). These studies provide a new example of cross-talk among signal transduction systems."
https://openalex.org/W2172138311,"High-affinity nickel transport in Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 is mediated by a function designated hoxN. hoxN lies within the hydrogenase gene cluster of megaplasmid pHG1. An insertional mutation at the hoxN locus led to an increased nickel requirement. In this mutant (strain HF260) both autotrophic growth on hydrogen and wild-type level of urease, a nickel-containing enzyme, were dependent on high concentration of nickel in the medium. Studies with a heterologous in vivo expression system revealed that the hoxN locus encodes two proteins with Mr = 30,000 and 28,000. Only the larger polypeptide was essential for nickel transport. The hoxN locus was cloned on a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the hoxN locus revealed an open reading frame with a coding capacity for a protein of 33.1 kDa. The insertion leading to the Nic- phenotype of strain HF260 maps within this open reading frame indicating that it does in fact have coding function. The deduced amino acid sequence of the hoxN gene has several features typical of a hydrophobic integral membrane protein. Alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins produced by insertion of the transposon TnphoA into hoxN gave significant levels of alkaline phosphatase activity indicating that protein HoxN contains periplasmic domains. Taken together, our results suggest that gene hoxN encodes the high-affinity nickel transporter of A. eutrophus."
https://openalex.org/W1523478951,"Transcription of the human vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene is regulated by both cyclic AMP and phorbol esters. A 17-nucleotide enhancer element within the human VIP gene mediates transcriptional activation by both phorbol esters and forskolin. Mutations of this element decrease responses to both agents, suggesting that the trans-acting proteins that mediate both modes of transcriptional regulation have similar DNA-binding characteristics. The response of the VIP enhancer element to forskolin, but not to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, was attenuated by treatment with a recombinant inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C second messenger pathways that converge on this single enhancer element are distinct. The transcriptional activator cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) proteins and the c-fos.c-Jun complex interact with the VIP enhancer. The dual second messenger responses of the VIP gene may result from the interaction of this second messenger enhancer with different transcriptional activator proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1567424586,"Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are involved in regulation of cell growth. We tested the hypothesis that the growth inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) involves activation of protein phosphatases. Exposure of human keratinocytes in culture to 400 pM TGF-beta 1 for 48 h led to 80% inhibition of DNA synthesis as measured by nuclear labeling. Incubation of cultured keratinocytes with 400 pM TGF-beta 1 rapidly activated (within 30 min) protein serine/threonine phosphatase, measured using phosphorylase as a substrate. Based on several criteria, including neutralization of activity with specific antibodies and inhibitor-2, TGF-beta 1-activated phosphorylase phosphatase was identified as protein phosphatase 1. TGF-beta 1 did not have rapid effects on protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity (type 2A) measured with histone phosphorylated by protein kinase C or on protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. However, protein tyrosine phosphatase was activated at 48 h, coincident with growth arrest. Differentiation, induced by the combination of TGF-beta 1 plus calcium or by serum, was not accompanied by further serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphatase activation. We conclude that induction of growth arrest in keratinocytes by TGF-beta 1 involves acute activation of protein phosphatase 1, while activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase may represent an additional mechanism for maintaining cells in a growth-arrested state."
https://openalex.org/W1582474907,"We have examined the effects of a T----C point mutation at the terminal nucleotide of the Mu ends in a mini-Mu plasmid on the early steps in the in vitro transposition reaction. These mutations inhibit the introduction of nicks at the Mu ends in a reaction with Mu A, HU, and integration host factor proteins. The presence of the point mutation at either the left end or the right end is sufficient to block the nicking reaction at both ends, indicating that the reaction is normally concerted. Addition of Mu B and ATP, however, dramatically stimulates the reaction of mutant mini-Mu plasmids carrying the mutation at one end but not at both ends. The data suggest that the Mu B protein mediates its effect through direct interaction with Mu A and that Mu B may play a role in an earlier step in the transposition process than previously proposed. In the presence of Mu B, two products are observed with the left end or right end mutant mini-Mu plasmids, a normal protein-DNA intermediate (Type 1 complex) which contains nicks at both Mu ends and an abortive product composed of free relaxed plasmid which is nicked only at the wild-type end. Furthermore, stable protein-DNA complexes characteristic of the first step in the in vitro transposition reaction are not observed in the absence of nicking or when only one end is a nicked; the introduction of nicks at both Mu ends is a prerequisite for stable transpososome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1575310231,"A fast and efficient method for medium scale purification of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor beta (rTNF-beta) from Escherichia coli cells is described. The purified rTNF-beta displayed biological activity similar to rTNF-alpha in a WEHI 164 cell cytotoxicity assay. The titration curve of rTNF-beta and elution profiles of rTNF-beta in gel filtration experiments were different from those of rTNF-alpha. However, light scattering and ultra-centrifugation studies showed that both cytokines have trimeric structures in solution at 0.5 mg/ml, with minor differences in the distribution of nontrimeric species. rTNF-beta bound to purified 55- and 75-kDa TNF receptors with high affinity. The binding of rTNF-beta to either receptor was analyzed on Scatchard plots and compared with that of rTNF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1502276768,"Bordetella pertussis produces a calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclase (AC) that exists in several forms. Only one form of AC, of apparent 200 kDa, is a toxin that penetrates eukaryotic cells and generates uncontrolled levels of intracellular cAMP. Recombination studies in transposon Tn5-insertion mutants of B. pertussis and amino acid sequence homology with alpha-hemolysin of Escherichia coli suggested that AC toxin may also have a hemolytic activity. Here, we demonstrate that only the toxic form of B. pertussis AC possesses hemolytic activity. Immunoblotting of membranes from sheep erythrocytes throughout the process of cell lysis detects the presence and accumulation of only the 200-kDa form of B. pertussis AC. cAMP generation induced by AC toxin in sheep erythrocytes is immediate whereas appearance of hemolysis is delayed by about 1 h and requires a higher level of AC toxin activity. Addition of exogenous calmodulin to sheep erythrocyte incubation medium potentiates the hemolytic activity of AC toxin but blocks cAMP generation. Extracellular Ca2+ at mM concentrations is absolutely required for cAMP generation but not for hemolysis. However, binding of AC toxin to sheep erythrocytes in the absence of exogenous Ca2+ followed by reincubation of cells in a toxin-free buffer containing Ca2+ leads to an immediate rise in intracellular cAMP. Human erythrocytes bind AC toxin and generate cAMP but are resistant to lysis. These results show that binding of AC toxin to erythrocytes can cause both cAMP generation and hemolysis or only one of these depending on conditions applied and cell type used."
https://openalex.org/W1521233708,"Transferrin (Tf) acidification has been shown to be limited to pH 6 in murine Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, human A549 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells and is followed by alkalinization during recycling. In contrast, Tf acidification in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 proceeds to below pH 5.5, and alkalinization of internal Tf during recycling is not observed. To explore the regulation of endosomal pH in K562 cells, we determined whether the existence of an early endosome of pH 6 could be demonstrated in K562 cells. The kinetics of Tf internalization, acidification, and recycling were determined at temperatures which block recycling of Tf in 3T3 cells. As in 3T3, Tf recycling in K562 was inhibited at 24 degrees C and below. At these temperatures, Tf internalization and acidification were delayed relative to 37 degrees C, yet the minimum pH achieved was below 5.5. Temperatures at or below 19 degrees C resulted in a complete block in recycling (at least over 40 min), which was rapidly reversible by incubation at 37 degrees C. Ouabain (a specific inhibitor of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase) had no effect on K562 Tf acidification, indicating that K562 endosomal pH is probably not regulated by the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. The results suggest that differentiation of the early endocytic pathway in erythroid cells involves changes such that the pH of Tf-containing compartments is not limited to 6 by the Na+,K(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1547744471,"Salicylhydroxamic and benzohydroxamic acids were found to bind to the resting state of myeloperoxidase and inhibit ligand binding to the heme iron. An ionizable group on the enzyme with pKa = 4 affects salicylhydroxamic acid binding; binding occurs when this group is not protonated. The binding of the heme iron ligands (e.g. cyanide, nitrite, and chloride) is probably controlled by the same ionizable group. The equilibrium dissociation constant of the salicylhydroxamic acid-myeloperoxidase complex is about 2 x 10(-6) M, and the association rate constant is 7.4 x 10(6) M-1.s-1. Salicylhydroxamic acid serves as a donor to the higher oxidation state of myeloperoxidase and thereby inhibits guaiacol oxidation. Salicylhydroxamic acid was also found to bind to intestinal peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Salicylhydroxamic acid binding to all three mammalian peroxidases was about 3 orders of magnitude stronger than benzohydroxamic acid binding. We conclude that the salicylhydroxamic and benzohydroxamic acids bind in the distal heme cavity of these peroxidases and interact with the heme ligand binding site."

The oxygenation mechanism was confirmed by the incorporation of oxygen-18 from molecular oxygen into the carboxylic acid formed. An aldehyde form but not a hydrated form of 11-oxo-delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol may be a substrate for the cytochrome P-450. The oxygenation of aldehyde catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 might be a common metabolic reaction in biological systems, and should be considered as an additional role of cytochrome P-450 in biotransformation of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1488661469,"A 285-base pair open reading frame was found immediately upstream of the fdxN gene (encoding ferredoxin I) of Rhodobacter capsulatus and coded for a 95-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 10,156. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 5 cysteines, 4 of which exhibited spacing characteristic of [2Fe-2S] plant and cyanobacterial ferredoxins. The amino acid sequence was found to share approximately 25% amino acid similarity with plant-type ferredoxins. The gene was named fdxC. Expression of the fdxC and fdxN genes together in Escherichia coli was accomplished by subcloning the genes in the vector pUC18 downstream of the lac promoter. Cells containing this plasmid produced a red and a brown protein corresponding to the fdxC and fdxN gene products, respectively. EPR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy confirmed that the FdxC protein contained a [2Fe-2S] cluster and the FdxN protein contained two [4Fe-4S] clusters and that the centers were correctly assembled and inserted in the ferredoxins expressed in E. coli. Transcription (Northern blot) analysis showed that the genes were transcribed only under nitrogen-limiting (nif-derepressing) growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1547002699,"Several steps implicated in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-coupled signaling are activated by PDGF exposure at 0-4 degrees C. These include receptor self-phosphorylation, physical association with and phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma). Reduced temperature blocks PDGF internalization, making it possible to dissociate bound PDGF after PLC gamma tyrosine phosphorylation. We addressed the functional consequences of PDGF dissociation from intact cell PDGF receptors. PDGF exposure at 0-4 degrees C for 15 min stimulated self-phosphorylation of a subpopulation of BALB/c 3T3 cell PDGF beta-type receptors (35%) and initiated subsequent inositol phosphate production. A small fraction of cellular PLC gamma (1-3%) coprecipitated with ligand-activated PDGF receptors; 3-5% of cellular PLC gamma acquired phosphotyrosine. The PLC gamma coprecipitating with PDGF receptors did not contain detectible phosphotyrosine. Phosphotyrosine antibody recovered similar amounts of PLC gamma from soluble and particulate fractions of PDGF-stimulated cells. Acid dissociation of bound PDGF from receptor caused rapid dephosphorylation of PDGF receptors and PCL gamma, and interrupted PLC gamma-PDGF receptor coprecipitation. Orthovanadate blocked tyrosine dephosphorylation of both PDGF receptors and PLC gamma and stabilized coprecipitation. Orthovanadate reversed the acid wash effect to abrogate PDGF-stimulated inositol phosphate production. PDGF receptor remains competent to coprecipitate with PLC gamma and stimulate PLC-mediated inositol phosphate production if PDGF-induced receptor phosphorylation is maintained. Formation of a coprecipitable PDGF receptor-PLC gamma complex appears required for PDGF-stimulated inositol phosphate production."
https://openalex.org/W1539027745,"Amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels are expressed at the apical membrane of high resistance, Na+-transporting epithelial. The specific interaction of amiloride with this transport protein suggested the feasibility of raising anti-Na+ channel antibodies by an antiidiotypic approach designed to generate antibodies directed against the amiloride-binding domain on the channel. Antiidiotypic monoclonal antibody RA6.3 mimicked the effect of amiloride by inhibiting Na+ transport across A6 cell monolayers when applied to the apical cell surface. Inhibition of transport required pretreatment of the apical cell surface with trypsin in the presence of amiloride in order to enhance accessibility of the antibody to the amiloride-binding site. This antibody specifically immunoprecipitated a large 750,000-700,000 Da protein from [35S]methionine-labeled A6 cell cultures, which was resolved further under reducing conditions as a set of polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 260,000-230,000, 180,000, 140,000-110,000, and 70,000 Da. The antibody recognized the 140,000-Da subunit, known to contain the amiloride-binding domain, on immunoblots of purified A6 cell Na+ channel. Immunoprecipitation of apical or basolateral plasma membrane proteins selectively labeled with 125I demonstrated that expression of the oligomeric Na+ channel was restricted to the apical plasma membrane. Immunocytochemical localization in A6 cultures revealed apical membrane as well as cytosolic immunoreactive sites. Immunostaining was also observed at or near the basolateral plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1847971626,"Abstract Limited proteolysis of solubilized beef heart mitochondrial complex III with trypsin yields a product previously identified as fragment (Gonzalez-Halphen, D., Lindorfer, M. A., and Capaldi, R. A. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7021-7031). In this work, fragment was generated by trypsin treatment of both the intact complex III and the purified Rieske iron-sulfur protein. Thus, in its bound or isolated form, the same sites of subunit V are sensitive to protease action. Fragment was a soluble protein that retained its iron-sulfur moiety. It was purified by exclusion from a hydrophobic phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column followed by gel filtration. In contrast to the pure, intact subunit V, fragment did not reconstitute oxidoreductase activity when combined with complex III devoid of subunit V. However, a 20-amino acid synthetic peptide carrying the sequence between amino acids Lys33 and Lys52 of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein competed with intact subunit V in reconstitution assays. The results obtained suggest that the iron-sulfur protein binds to complex III by hydrophobic protein-protein interactions, and that a nontransmembrane 18-amino acid amphipathic stretch accounts for the association of this subunit to the rest of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1480875818,"The chemical modification of histidine and arginine residues results in a loss of binding of the Mr 46,000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR 46) to a phosphomannan affinity matrix (Stein, M., Meyer, J. E., Hasilik, A., and von Figura, K. (1987) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 368, 927-936). Reversal of the modification or presence of mannose 6-phosphate during the modification partially restores or protects the binding activity, indicating that histidine and arginine residues contribute to the mannose 6-phosphate binding site. The 5 histidine and 8 arginine residues within the luminal domain of MPR 46, which contains the ligand binding site, were exchanged by site-directed mutagenesis. Only the conservative replacement of His-131 and Arg-137 by serine and lysine, respectively, results in a loss of binding activity without affecting other properties of the receptor such as the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds, immunoreactivity, processing of N-linked oligosaccharides, formation of dimers, intracellular distribution, and surface expression. Conservative replacement of other histidine and arginine residues did not affect the binding activity. Nonconservative replacement of several arginine residues reduced binding activity and immunoreactivity, indicating that the loss of a positive charge at these positions alters the folding of MPR 46. We conclude from these results that His-131 and Arg-137 are essential for binding of ligands by MPR 46."
https://openalex.org/W1521538174,"Mutations in regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were analyzed from cAMP-resistant mutants of S49 mouse lymphoma cells by direct sequencing of amplified regions of mutant R subunit cDNAs. Eight distinct single base-change lesions were identified in 24 independent mutants that were hemizygous for expression of mutant R subunits with altered protein charge. CG----TA transitions predominated, but AT----GC transitions and GC----TA transversions were also observed. Four of five spontaneous mutants had identical C----T transitions at CG causing substitution of Trp for Arg-334. Sites mutated in isolates obtained after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were more varied. Six of the lesions (two in binding site A and four in site B) were at amino acid residues that are highly conserved among cAMP-binding sites of R subunits and the Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein. These mutations all either prevented or strongly hindered binding of cyclic nucleotides to the mutated site. One of the remaining lesions (at Arg-242) also prevented cyclic nucleotide binding to the mutated binding site; the other (at Gly-170) had only minimal effects on binding of cyclic nucleotides but, nevertheless, increased the apparent constant for cAMP-dependent kinase activation. These results are discussed with reference to a model for the cAMP-binding sites of R subunit based on the crystal structure of the E. coli catabolite activator protein."
https://openalex.org/W1586694315,"Each regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase contains an autoinhibitor site that lies approximately 90-100 residues from the amino terminus. In order to study the importance of this autoinhibitor site in the type I R-subunit for interacting with the catalytic (C) subunit, recombinant techniques were used to replace Ala-97 with Gln, His, Lys, and Arg and to replace Ser-99 with Gly and Lys. All of the mutant proteins having a replacement at Ala-97 showed reduced affinity for the C-subunit ranging from 14- to 55-fold. In general, the decrease in affinity of the Ala-97 mutants for the C-subunit correlated with the increase in size of the side chain. In contrast to wild type R-subunit, where MgATP facilitates holoenzyme formation, MgATP inhibits the reassociation in all of the Ala-97 mutants suggesting that the larger side chains sterically interfere with bound MgATP in the active site of the C-subunit. Whereas MgATP slowed holoenzyme formation, AMP actually accelerated the reassociation of the A97K, A97H (pH 6.0), and A97Q mutants with the C-subunit. Therefore, the side chains of Lys-97, His-97, and Gln-97 can interact either electrostatically or by hydrogen bonding with the phosphate of AMP. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the stimulatory effect of AMP on the A97H mutant was pH-dependent. The affinities of the S99G and S99K mutants for the C-subunit were reduced 7- and 24-fold, respectively, suggesting that Ser-99 also may contribute to interactions between the R- and C-subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1566633147,"At present, the requirements for efficient phosphorylation of exogenous substrates by protein-tyrosine kinases are largely unknown. The proton resonances of each of the 3 tyrosines of the dodecapeptide substrate RRDIYETDYYRK are well resolved in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectra: thus, it is feasible to directly monitor phosphorylation at each site. A soluble approximately 48-kDa derivative of the human insulin receptor cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase domain phosphorylates this peptide at all 3 tyrosine sites and does so in a highly ordered and progressive manner (Y9, then Y10 and finally Y5), proceeding to full stoichiometry at each site before phosphorylating the next. This experimental system now provides an approach by which to follow the stereochemical requirements and dynamics of substrate phosphorylation by a protein-tyrosine kinase in solution in real time."
https://openalex.org/W1564859979,"Abstract With the aim of understanding the structural basis for the substrate specificity of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase, we have studied the conformational features of synthetic oligopeptide substrates and their interaction with the enzyme purified from chicken embryo. Circular dichroism and infrared spectral data, taken in conjunction with relevant crystal structure data, indicated an equilibrium mixture of the polyproline-II (PP-II) helix, the beta-turn, and the random coil conformations in aqueous and trifluoroethanol solutions of the collagen-related peptides: t-Boc-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-OH, t-Boc-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-NHCH3, t-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Pro-OH, t-Boc-Pro-Pro-Ala-Pro-OH, and t-Boc-Pro-Pro-Gln-Pro-OCH3, where t-Boc is tert-butoxycarbonyl. In another set of peptides related to elastin, t-Boc-Val-Pro-Gly-Val-OH and t-Boc-Gly-Val-Pro-Gly-Val-OH, the data indicated the beta-structure, rather than the PP-II helix, was in equilibrium with the beta-turn. Kinetic parameters for the enzymatic hydroxylation of the peptides showed that as a group, the first (proline-rich) set of peptides has higher Km values and lower Vmax and Kcat/Km values than the valine-rich peptides. Data on the inhibition of hydroxylation of the standard assay substrate (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 by the oligopeptides pointed to common binding sites for the peptides. Hydroxyproline-containing peptides had no effect on the hydroxylation of the standard substrate, showing the absence of product inhibition. Based on these and earlier data, we propose that in collagen and related peptides, a supersecondary structure consisting of the PP-II helix followed by the beta-turn is the minimal structural requirement for proline hydroxylation. The PP-II structure would aid effective interaction at the substrate binding subsites, while the beta-turn would be essential at the catalytic site of the enzyme. In elastin and related peptides, the beta-strand structure may be interchangeable with the PP-II structure. This conformational model for proline hydroxylation resolves the discrepancies in earlier proposals on the substrate specificity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. It is also consistent with the available information on the active site geometry of the enzyme."

The mutant phenotype includes inability to form colonies at temperatures above 38 degrees C and inability to propagate phage lambda at all temperatures. A lambda i434 cI- (ts121)+ transducing phage was isolated on the basis of its ability to form plaques on ts121 mutant bacteria. Using this transducing phage, it was shown through complementation and protein analyses, that the ts121 mutation is located in the dnaB gene. The exact insertion event was identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the DNA sequences containing the insertion junction. The mutational insertion event in ts121 was mapped precisely between base pairs 1514 and 1515 of the dnaB gene. This result predicts that the mutant dnaB protein has lost its six terminal amino acids. The reading frame shifts into Mu-specific DNA sequences resulting in an additional 20 amino acid residues. The E. coli wild type dnaB protein participates in host replication and interacts with lambda P protein to initiate phage lambda DNA replication. Our results demonstrate that the extreme carboxyl end of the dnaB protein is required for productive interaction with the lambda P replication protein at all temperatures, and is important for dnaB function at temperatures above 38 degrees C. Cold-sensitive extragenic suppressors of the ts121 mutation were isolated on the basis of their ability to restore colony formation at 42 degrees C. One of these extragenic suppressors was mapped at 54 min on the E. coli genetic map and localized to the suhB gene, whose product may affect the expression of a number of genes at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1527428001,"High molecular weight B cell growth factor (HMW-BCGF) and the complement component, Factor B, are antigenically related. HMW-BCGF and the physiologic Factor B activation fragment Bb, are both mitogenic for B lymphocytes and compete for binding to the B cell plasma membrane (Peters, M., Ambrus, J. L., Jr., Fauci, A., and Brown, E. (1988) J. Exp. Med. 168, 1225-1235). To understand which second messengers that occur after ligand-receptor interaction are associated with mitogenesis, we have examined the early signaling events after stimulation of activated B cells with these related growth factors. HMW-BCGF but not Bb increased [cAMP]i with a maximum between 45 and 60 min after stimulation. The increase in [cAMP]i was inhibited by indomethacin, suggesting that prostaglandin synthesis is involved in this response. Increase in [cAMP]i induced by HMW-BCGF, cholera toxin, or dibutyryl cAMP was associated with increased expression of the HMW-BCGF receptor, but there was no increase in proliferation of activated B cells when they were stimulated with cAMP agonists other than HMW-BCGF. These data suggest that cAMP is associated with regulation of receptor expression but is neither necessary nor sufficient for induction of proliferation. Both HMW-BCGF and Bb increased cellular levels of diacylglycerol and a water-soluble molecule which could be labeled with both [3H]myoinositol and [14C] glucosamine. However, only HMW-BCGF induced increases in intracellular calcium. Thus, two antigenically related B cell growth factors, HMW-BCGF and Bb, produce overlapping but distinct sets of second messengers after incubation with Sac-activated B cells. Since both induced increases in diacylglycerol and water-soluble inositol, one or both of these molecules may be involved in the proliferative signal generated by the related growth factors. In contrast, the increase in [cAMP]i caused by HMW-BCGF but not Bb is involved in the signal to increase HMW-BCGF receptor expression, but is unrelated to proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1505531343,"Chicken parathyroid hormone (cPTH) has been reported to stimulate adrenal steroidogenesis and to have unusual potency on traditional PTH target tissues. To evaluate these properties, chicken PTH-(1-88) has been expressed in Escherichia coli using a plasmid encoding a fusion protein which links together growth hormone, a factor Xa recognition site, and chicken PTH-(1-88). The growth hormone-cPTH fusion protein required the presence of 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate to remain in solution and be cleaved by factor Xa. The high performance liquid chromatography-purified recombinant cPTH-(1-88) and chemically synthesized cPTH-(1-34) had similar potency in rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cells, opossum kidney (OK) cells, and dispersed primary chicken kidney cells. The biologic potencies of cPTH-(1-34) and cPTH-(1-88) in radioreceptor binding and cAMP generation in both bone- and kidney-derived cell lines were less than those of human (h)PTH-(1-34). In dispersed chicken kidney cells, cAMP production by cPTH-(1-34) and cPTH-(1-88) was similar to that stimulated by human PTH-(1-34). No stimulation of steroidogenesis could be detected when recombinant chicken PTH-(1-88) was added to dispersed chicken adrenal cells. The biologic activity of recombinant chicken PTH-(1-88) purified from E. coli was comparable with that of chicken PTH-(1-88) expressed by mammalian COS cells. Thus, the full-length chicken PTH did not exhibit enhanced potency, when compared with human PTH in ROS 17/2.8, OK cell lines, and dispersed chicken kidney cells and did not demonstrate the novel steroidogenic action previously reported in adrenal cells. The successful production of chicken PTH-(1-88) will enhance our understanding of the structure-activity relationships for PTH, particularly the sequence-dependent metabolism of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1556532776,"Both ubiquitin conjugation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of chicken egg white lysozyme in a reticulocyte lysate depend on the presence of a reducing agent. We present evidence that the reduction of a specific disulfide bond, namely that at Cys6-Cys127, facilitates ubiquitination and is a prerequisite to the formation of a multiubiquitin chain on one of at least four chain initiation sites on lysozyme. The Cys6-Cys127 disulfide bond in lysozyme can be specifically reduced, and the modified protein can be isolated after carboxymethylation of the 2 resulting cysteines. This modified lysozyme no longer requires the presence of a reducing agent for ubiquitin conjugation and degradation. Inhibition of ubiquitination by the dipeptide Lys-Ala revealed that this modified lysozyme, like the unmodified protein, is recognized via the binding of the ubiquitin protein ligase, E3, to the substrate's N-terminal lysyl residue. Both the rate and the extent of ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugation, however, are significantly higher with this modified substrate. Likewise, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of 6,127-reduced/carboxymethylated lysozyme was 2-4-fold faster than degradation of the unmodified counterpart. These results are consistent with an interpretation that the modified lysozyme mimics an intermediate formed at the rate-limiting step of the degradation of lysozyme in the reticulocyte lysate. Reduction of the Cys6-Cys127 disulfide bond is expected to unhinge the N-terminal region of lysozyme, and we propose that the recognition of this otherwise stable protein by the ubiquitin pathway is due to facilitated binding of E3 that results from such a conformational transition."
https://openalex.org/W1497614053,"A novel triple-kringle plasminogen activator protein, PK1 delta FE1X, has been produced which is a genetic chimera between the fibrin binding kringle 1 domain of plasminogen and the two kringles and serine protease domains of naturally occurring wild-type tissue plasminogen activator (wt t-PA). This chimera also contains a modification to prevent high mannose type N-linked glycosylation on kringle 1 of t-PA. PK1 delta FE1X is biochemically and fibrinolytically similar to wt t-PA in vitro but retains the decreased plasma clearance rate characteristic of other t-PA variants which lack fibronectin finger-like and epidermal growth factor domains. The serine protease domain of PK1 delta FE1X exhibits the amidolytic activity characteristic of wt t-PA. In an indirect coupled plasminogen activator assay, the specific activity of PK1 delta FE1X is approximately 1.4 times greater than that of wt t-PA. In a fibrin film-binding assay, greater binding to untreated fibrin is observed with wt t-PA than with PK1 delta FE1X. However, following limited plasmin digestion of the fibrin film, PK1 delta FE1X binding increases to the level observed with wt t-PA. The incremental binding to plasmin-digested fibrin observed with PK1 delta FE1X is eliminated if plasmin digestion of the fibrin film is followed by carboxypeptidase B treatment. This result suggests that plasminogen kringle 1 binds plasmin-digested fibrin even after recombination with a heterologous protein. The fibrinolytic activity of PK1 delta FE1X in human plasma clot lysis assays was similar to that of wt t-PA at activator concentrations of approximately 1 microgram/ml. At substantially lower concentrations, approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, PK1 delta FE1X was only slightly less active than wt t-PA. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that wt t-PA activity is cleared approximately 15 times as rapidly as PK1 delta FE1X following intravenous bolus injection. In a rabbit jugular vein clot lysis model, intravenous bolus injection of 0.06 mg/kg of PK1 delta FE1X showed greater thrombolytic potency than a similar administration of 0.5 mg/kg of wt t-PA. Thus it appears that in vitro exon shuffling techniques can be used to generate novel fibrinolytic agents which biochemically and pharmacologically represent the combination of individual domains of naturally occurring proteins."
