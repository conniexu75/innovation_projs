https://openalex.org/W3167555428,"More than one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several working vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies1,2. Here we report on a cohort of 63 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines3,4. In the absence of vaccination, antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable between 6 and 12 months after infection. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response and, as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern similar to or greater than the neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 strain achieved by vaccination of naive individuals2,5-8. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in the variants of concern4,9. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand markedly after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W3170724610,"Abstract The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is highly effective against SARS-CoV-2. However, apprehension exists that variants of concern (VOCs) may evade vaccine protection, due to evidence of reduced neutralization of the VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 by vaccine sera in laboratory assays. We performed a matched cohort study to examine the distribution of VOCs in infections of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinees from Clalit Health Services (Israel) using viral genomic sequencing, and hypothesized that if vaccine effectiveness against a VOC is reduced, its proportion among breakthrough cases would be higher than in unvaccinated controls. Analyzing 813 viral genome sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs, we showed that vaccinees who tested positive at least 7 days after the second dose were disproportionally infected with B.1.351, compared with controls. Those who tested positive between 2 weeks after the first dose and 6 days after the second dose were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7. These findings suggest reduced vaccine effectiveness against both VOCs within particular time windows. Our results emphasize the importance of rigorously tracking viral variants, and of increasing vaccination to prevent the spread of VOCs."

We define credible sets of T1D-associated variants and show that they are enriched in immune-cell accessible chromatin, particularly CD4+ effector T cells. Using chromatin-accessibility profiling of CD4+ T cells from 115 individuals, we map chromatin-accessibility quantitative trait loci and identify five regions where T1D risk variants co-localize with chromatin-accessibility quantitative trait loci. We highlight rs72928038 in BACH2 as a candidate causal T1D variant leading to decreased enhancer accessibility and BACH2 expression in T cells. Finally, we prioritize potential drug targets by integrating genetic evidence, functional genomic maps and immune protein-protein interactions, identifying 12 genes implicated in T1D that have been targeted in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases. These findings provide an expanded genomic landscape for T1D."
https://openalex.org/W3172891032,"Geopolymer concrete is an inorganic concrete that uses industrial or agro by-product ashes as the main binder instead of ordinary Portland cement; this leads to the geopolymer concrete being an eco-efficient and environmentally friendly construction material. A variety of ashes used as the binder in geopolymer concrete such as fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, rice husk ash, metakaolin ash, and Palm oil fuel ash, fly ash was commonly consumed to prepare geopolymer concrete composites. The most important mechanical property for all types of concrete composites, including geopolymer concrete, is the compressive strength. However, in the structural design and construction field, the compressive strength of the concrete at 28 days is essential. Therefore, achieving an authoritative model for predicting the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete is necessary regarding saving time, energy, and cost-effectiveness. It gives guidance regarding scheduling the construction process and removal of formworks. In this study, Linear (LR), Non-Linear (NLR), and Multi-logistic (MLR) regression models were used to develop the predictive models for estimating the compressive strength of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (FA-GPC). In this regard, a comprehensive dataset consists of 510 samples were collected in several academic research studies and analyzed to develop the models. In the modeling process, for the first time, twelve effective variable parameters on the compressive strength of the FA-GPC, including SiO2/Al2O3 (Si/Al) of fly ash binder, alkaline liquid to binder ratio (l/b), fly ash (FA) content, fine aggregate (F) content, coarse aggregate (C) content, sodium hydroxide (SH)content, sodium silicate (SS) content, (SS/SH), molarity (M), curing temperature (T), curing duration inside ovens (CD) and specimen ages (A) were considered as the modeling input parameters. Various statistical assessments such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Scatter Index (SI), OBJ value, and the Coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the efficiency of the developed models. The results indicated that the NLR model performed better for predicting the compressive strength of FA-GPC mixtures compared to the other models. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the curing temperature, alkaline liquid to binder ratio, and sodium silicate content are the most affecting parameter for estimating the compressive strength of the FA-GPC."

However, little is known about how dynamic capabilities can shape business survival and performance during crises. The research objective of this paper is twofold. First, through a literature review, we seek to identify which first-order dynamic capabilities-managerial decisions under uncertainty-are vital for rapid response to a crisis. Second, we present the results of research carried out among 151 small and medium-sized companies in Poland immediately after the beginning of the economic lockdown (April 2020). The survey that we developed identifies which dynamic capabilities were essential for businesses to survive during this unexpected black swan event. We also present dependence and regression analyses showing the links between the identified dynamic capabilities and value creation, understood as retaining employees and production levels, as well as value capture, understood as maintaining cash flow and current revenues."
https://openalex.org/W3167148933,"Little information on the current burden of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults in Germany is available.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a representative healthcare claims database of approx. 4 million adults to estimate the incidence rates (IR) and associated mortality of CAP in 2015. IR and mortality were stratified by treatment setting, age group, and risk group status. A pneumonia coded in the primary diagnosis position or in the second diagnosis position with another pneumonia-related condition coded in the primary position was used as the base cases definition for the study. Sensitivity analyses using broader and more restrictive case definitions were also performed.The overall IR of CAP in adults ≥18 years was 1,054 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. In adults aged 16 to 59 years, IR for overall CAP, hospitalized CAP and outpatient CAP was 551, 96 and 466 (with a hospitalization rate of 17%). In adults aged ≥60 years, the respective IR were 2,032, 1,061 and 1,053 (with a hospitalization rate of 52%). If any pneumonia coded in the primary or secondary diagnosis position was considered for hospitalized patients, the IR increased 1.5-fold to 1,560 in the elderly ≥60 years. The incidence of CAP hospitalizations was substantially higher in adults ≥18 years with at-risk conditions and high-risk conditions (IR of 608 and 1,552, respectively), compared to adults without underlying risk conditions (IR 108). High mortality of hospitalized CAP in adults ≥18 was observed in-hospital (18.5%), at 30 days (22.9%) and at one-year (44.5%) after CAP onset. Mortality was more than double in older adults in comparison to younger patients.CAP burden in older adults and individuals with underlying risk conditions was high. Maximizing uptake of existing vaccines for respiratory diseases may help to mitigate the disease burden, especially in times of strained healthcare resources."

https://openalex.org/W3169271492,"Although radiotherapy is a well-known effective non-surgical treatment for malignant gliomas, the therapeutic efficacy is severely limited due to the radioresistance of tumor cells. Previously, we demonstrated that Yes-associated protein (YAP) promotes glioma malignant progression. However, whether YAP plays a role in radioresistance and its potential value in cancer treatment are still unclear. In this study, we found that high YAP expression is associated with poor prognosis in malignant glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy. Research in immortalized cell lines and primary cells from GBM patients revealed that YAP exhibited a radioresistant effect on gliomas via promoting DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, after radiation, YAP was translocated into the nucleus, where it promoted the expression and secretion of FGF2, leading to MAPK-ERK pathway activation. FGF2 is a novel target gene of YAP. Inhibition of YAP-FGF2-MAPK signaling sensitizes gliomas to radiotherapy and prolongs the survival of intracranial cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. These results suggest that YAP-FGF2-MAPK is a key mechanism of radioresistance and is an actionable target for improving radiotherapy efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3171980076,"There is a need for effective and youth-friendly approaches to suicide prevention, and social media presents a unique opportunity to reach young people. Although there is some evidence to support the delivery of population-wide suicide prevention campaigns, little is known about their capacity to change behaviour, particularly among young people and in the context of social media. Even less is known about the safety and feasibility of using social media for the purpose of suicide prevention. Based on the #chatsafe guidelines, this study examines the acceptability, safety and feasibility of a co-designed social media campaign. It also examines its impact on young people's willingness to intervene against suicide and their perceived self-efficacy, confidence and safety when communicating on social media platforms about suicide. A sample of 189 young people aged 16-25 years completed three questionnaires across a 20-week period (4 weeks pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 4-week follow up). The intervention took the form of a 12-week social media campaign delivered to participants via direct message. Participants reported finding the intervention acceptable and they also reported improvements in their willingness to intervene against suicide, and their perceived self-efficacy, confidence and safety when communicating on social media about suicide. Findings from this study present a promising picture for the acceptability and potential impact of a universal suicide prevention campaign delivered through social media, and suggest that it can be safe to utilize social media for the purpose of suicide prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3166991836,"Carceral facilities are epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing incarcerated people at an elevated risk of COVID-19 infection. Due to the initial limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, all states have developed allocation plans that outline a phased distribution. This study uses document analysis to compare the relative prioritization of incarcerated people, correctional staff, and other groups at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and morbidity.We conducted a document analysis of the vaccine dissemination plans of all 50 US states and the District of Columbia using a triple-coding method. Documents included state COVID-19 vaccination plans and supplemental materials on vaccine prioritization from state health department websites as of December 31, 2020. We found that 22% of states prioritized incarcerated people in Phase 1, 29% of states in Phase 2, and 2% in Phase 3, while 47% of states did not explicitly specify in which phase people who are incarcerated will be eligible for vaccination. Incarcerated people were consistently not prioritized in Phase 1, while other vulnerable groups who shared similar environmental risk received this early prioritization. States' plans prioritized in Phase 1: prison and jail workers (49%), law enforcement (63%), seniors (65+ years, 59%), and long-term care facility residents (100%).This study demonstrates that states' COVID-19 vaccine allocation plans do not prioritize incarcerated people and provide little to no guidance on vaccination protocols if they fall under other high-risk categories that receive earlier priority. Deprioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination misses a crucial opportunity for COVID-19 mitigation. It also raises ethical and equity concerns. As states move forward with their vaccine distribution, further work must be done to prioritize ethical allocation and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to incarcerated people."
https://openalex.org/W3169847845,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19), with the fatality rate in elder (60 years old or more) being much higher than young (60 years old or less) patients, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. A mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations under different fatality rates was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The model considered susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild CoViD-19, severe CoViD-19, and recovered compartments, besides compartments of isolated individuals and those who were caught by test. This model was applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of quarantine (isolation or lockdown) in many countries to control the rapid propagation of CoViD-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in São Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe CoViD-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from São Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated, and we obtained a higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R 0 (9.24 for São Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R 0 around 2 using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered compartments) model. In comparison with the lockdown in Spain, the relatively early adoption of the isolation in São Paulo State resulted in enlarging the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delaying its peak. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by quarantine when associated with the protective measures (face mask, washing hands with alcohol and gel, and social distancing) adopted by the population. The description of the epidemic under quarantine and protections can be a background to foreseen the epidemiological scenarios from the release strategies, which can help guide public health policies by decision-makers."
https://openalex.org/W3171381060,"This paper establishes a fully automatic real-time image segmentation and recognition system for breast ultrasound intervention robots. It adopts the basic architecture of a U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net), analyses the actual application scenarios of semantic segmentation of breast ultrasound images, and adds dropout layers to the U-Net architecture to reduce the redundancy in texture details and prevent overfitting. The main innovation of this paper is proposing an expanded training approach to obtain an expanded of U-Net. The output map of the expanded U-Net can retain texture details and edge features of breast tumours. Using the grey-level probability labels to train the U-Net is faster than using ordinary labels. The average Dice coefficient (standard deviation) and the average IOU coefficient (standard deviation) are 90.5% (±0.02) and 82.7% (±0.02), respectively, when using the expanded training approach. The Dice coefficient of the expanded U-Net is 7.6 larger than that of a general U-Net, and the IOU coefficient of the expanded U-Net is 11 larger than that of the general U-Net. The context of breast ultrasound images can be extracted, and texture details and edge features of tumours can be retained by the expanded U-Net. Using an expanded U-Net can quickly and automatically achieve precise segmentation and multi-class recognition of breast ultrasound images."
https://openalex.org/W3170194829,"Abstract Treatment of prostate cancer confronts resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies. AR-associated coregulators and chromatin proteins hold a great potential for novel therapy targets. Here, we employed a powerful chromatin-directed proteomics approach termed ChIP-SICAP to uncover the composition of chromatin protein network, the chromatome, around endogenous AR in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. In addition to several expected AR coregulators, the chromatome contained many nuclear proteins not previously associated with the AR. In the context of androgen signaling in CRPC cells, we further investigated the role of a known AR-associated protein, a chromatin remodeler SMARCA4 and that of SIM2, a transcription factor without a previous association with AR. To understand their role in chromatin accessibility and AR target gene expression, we integrated data from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and functional experiments. Despite the wide co-occurrence of SMARCA4 and AR on chromatin, depletion of SMARCA4 influenced chromatin accessibility and expression of a restricted set of AR target genes, especially those involved in cell morphogenetic changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The depletion also inhibited the CRPC cell growth, validating SMARCA4’s functional role in CRPC cells. Although silencing of SIM2 reduced chromatin accessibility similarly, it affected the expression of a much larger group of androgen-regulated genes, including those involved in cellular responses to external stimuli and steroid hormone stimulus. The silencing also reduced proliferation of CRPC cells and tumor size in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, further emphasizing the importance of SIM2 in CRPC cells and pointing to the functional relevance of this potential prostate cancer biomarker in CRPC cells. Overall, the chromatome of AR identified in this work is an important resource for the field focusing on this important drug target."
https://openalex.org/W3171372418,"Mucus forms an important protective barrier that minimizes bacterial contact with the colonic epithelium. Intestinal mucus is organized in a complex network with several specific proteins, including the mucin-2 (MUC2) and the abundant IgGFc-binding protein, FCGBP. FCGBP is expressed in all intestinal goblet cells and is secreted into the mucus. It is comprised of repeated von Willebrand D (vWD) domain assemblies, most of which have a GDPH amino acid sequence that can be autocatalytically cleaved, as previously observed in the mucins MUC2 and mucin-5AC. However, the functions of FCGBP in the mucus are not understood. We show that all vWD domains of FCGBP with a GDPH sequence are cleaved and that these cleavages occur early during biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. All cleaved fragments, however, remain connected via a disulfide bond within each vWD domain. This cleavage generates a C-terminal-reactive Asp-anhydride that could react with other molecules, such as MUC2, but this was not observed. Quantitative analyses by MS showed that FCGBP was mainly soluble in chaotropic solutions, whereas MUC2 was insoluble, and most of the secreted FCGBP was not covalently bound to MUC2. Although FCGBP has been suggested to bind immunoglobulin G, we were unable to reproduce this binding in vitro using purified proteins. In conclusion, while the function of FCGBP is still unknown, our results suggest that it does not contribute to covalent crosslinking in the mucus, nor incorporate immunoglobulin G into mucus, instead the single disulfide bond linking each fragment could mediate controlled dissociation."

While autophagy pathways are heavily researched in heterologous cells and neurons, regulation of autophagy in the astrocyte, the most abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, is less well understood. Missense mutations in the Synj1 gene encoding Synaptojanin1 (Synj1), a neuron-enriched lipid phosphatase, have been linked to Parkinsonism with seizures. Our previous study showed that the Synj1 haploinsufficient (Synj1+/−) mouse exhibits age-dependent autophagy impairment in multiple brain regions. Here, we used cultured astrocytes from Synj1-deficient mice to investigate its role in astrocyte autophagy. We report that Synj1 is expressed in low levels in astrocytes and represses basal autophagosome formation. We demonstrate using cellular imaging that Synj1-deficient astrocytes exhibit hyperactive autophagosome formation, represented by an increase in the size and number of GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 structures. Interestingly, Synj1 deficiency is also associated with an impairment in stress-induced autophagy clearance. We show, for the first time, that the Parkinsonism-associated R839C mutation impacts autophagy in astrocytes. The impact of this mutation on the phosphatase function of Synj1 resulted in elevated basal autophagosome formation that mimics Synj1 deletion. We found that the membrane expression of the astrocyte-specific glucose transporter GluT-1 was reduced in Synj1-deficient astrocytes. Consistently, AMP-activated protein kinase activity was elevated, suggesting altered glucose sensing in Synj1-deficient astrocytes. Expressing exogenous GluT-1 in Synj1-deficient astrocytes reversed the autophagy impairment, supporting a role for Synj1 in regulating astrocyte autophagy via disrupting glucose-sensing pathways. Thus, our work suggests a novel mechanism for Synj1-related Parkinsonism involving astrocyte dysfunction.

Autophagy is part of the intricate membrane trafficking network and often known as the self-eating process that maintains cellular homeostasis and copes with energy crisis. The formation of the autophagosome, a double-membraned structure, is typically induced by nutrient deprivation/starvation, and the sequestered cellular components (damaged organelles or protein aggregates) are eventually degraded in the autolysosome. Autophagy dysregulation has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders (1Nixon R.A. The role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disease.Nat.

The R839C mutation, which results in similar clinical phenotypes, has a more profound impact on both phosphatases as it reduces the 5’-phosphatase activity by ∼60% and PI4P hydrolysis by 80% (25Pan P.Y. Sheehan P. Wang Q. Zhu X. Zhang Y. Choi I. Li X. Saenz J. Zhu J. Wang J. El Gaamouch F. Zhu L. Cai D. Yue Z.

The functional relevance of the R839C mutation, however, has not been explored. Despite the well-known role of Synj1 in synaptic function, a few recent studies (including one from our laboratory) also suggest its involvement in autophagy regulation (12Vanhauwaert R. Kuenen S.

Flies carrying the Synj R258Q mutation exhibit an impairment in autophagosome maturation at the neuromuscular junction. In the aged Synj1+/− mouse brain lysate (25Pan P.Y. Sheehan P. Wang Q. Zhu X. Zhang Y. Choi I. Li X. Saenz J. Zhu J. Wang J. El Gaamouch F. Zhu L. Cai D. Yue Z. Synj1 haploinsufficiency causes dopamine neuron vulnerability and alpha-synuclein accumulation in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2020; 29: 2300-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we found an increase in lipidated microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II), a hallmark of mature autophagosomes, as well as an increase in the autophagy substrate, p62, indicating an impairment in autolysosomal clearance. However, it was left unclear how astrocytes might have contributed to this pathology. Whether Synj1 regulates astrocyte function remains largely unknown, except for an earlier study that showed its potential contribution to astrogliogenesis (27Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Synaptojanin-1 plays a key role in astrogliogenesis: Possible relevance for Down's syndrome.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our current study using cultured astrocytes from Synj1 littermate mice demonstrates that the neuronal isoform, Synj1-145 kDa, is also expressed in the astrocyte. More importantly, we show that endogenous Synj1 represses astrocyte autophagy at the basal level. Synj1 deletion or the R839C mutation with a complex defect in the SAC1 and 5'-phosphatase activities leads to enhanced autophagosome formation at the basal level. We demonstrate that the role of Synj1 in phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism is important for maintaining a proper basal autophagy level, and that the enhanced basal autophagy in Synj1-deficient conditions may be related to glucose starvation because of the lack of membrane glucose transporter. The role of Synj1 in astrocyte is poorly characterized. Using a Novus antibody that specifically recognizes the Synj1-145 kDa (Fig. 1A), we identified a low-level expression of neuronal isoform in Synj1 in the cultured cortical astrocytes but not in microglia or human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Fig. 1B). Similar to our findings in the cultured cortical neurons (25Pan P.Y. Sheehan P. Wang Q. Zhu X. Zhang Y. Choi I. Li X. Saenz J. Zhu J. Wang J. El Gaamouch F. Zhu L. Cai D. Yue Z. Synj1 haploinsufficiency causes dopamine neuron vulnerability and alpha-synuclein accumulation in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2020; 29: 2300-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), deletion of Synj1 resulted in increased plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2, suggesting a prominent role of the 5’-phosphatase domain in astrocyte membrane signaling (Fig. 1, C and D). Autophagy as an important aspect of membrane trafficking has not been well understood in astrocytes. In the Synj1+/− mouse, the LC3 immunofluorescence (IF) was not changed in the dopamine neurons; however, a significant increase was noted in the striatum and the cortex, suggesting cell type–specific heterogeneity of the autophagy response to Synj1 deficiency. To further elucidate the Synj1-mediated autophagy in astrocytes, we expressed GFP-LC3 in cultured astrocytes. In astrocytes prepared from Synj1+/+ (WT), Synj1+/− (heterozygous [HET]), and Synj1−/− (KO) littermate pups, we observed LC3 puncta of varying sizes, some of which are shown as circular structures with a hollow center that measured ∼1 to 2 μm in diameter (Fig. 2A). We quantified the number of these circular LC3 structures in all GFP-LC3 expressing astrocytes from three batches of primary littermate cultures and found a reverse gene dose dependence in its occurrence (Fig. 2B). To determine the nature of these organelles, we performed additional immunolabeling analyses to assess their colocalization with the early endosome marker, EEA1; the late endosome marker, Rab7; the lysosomal marker, LAMP1; as well as the autophagy adaptor, p62 (Fig. 2C). We found that, in all astrocytes regardless of the Synj1 level, the majority of the circular GFP-LC3 structures colocalize with LAMP1 (WT: 82.9%, HET: 90%, and KO: 85.5%) and p62 (WT: 72.6%, Het: 75.8%, and KO: 63.3%). A smaller fraction of these structures was found to colocalize with EEA1 (WT: 13.3%, HET: 7.5%, and KO: 18.4%) or Rab7 (WT: 16.7%, HET: 20%, and KO: 38.2%) (Fig. 2D). Our data suggest that the abnormal accumulation of circular GFP-LC3 structures in Synj1 deficiency astrocytes represents a dysregulated autolysosomal pathway. We next analyzed the number of GFP-LC3 puncta in cultured astrocytes. In Synj1 HET or KO astrocytes, the GFP-LC3 puncta was modestly but significantly higher (HET: 6.95 ± 0.92, N = 57; KO: 8.46 ± 1.00, N = 91; four batches) compared with that in the WT littermates (5.19 ± 0.73, N = 81; four batches) (Fig. 3, A and B). In a separate set of littermate astrocytes, where bafilomycin A1 (baf, 20 nM) was applied for an hour to inhibit autolysosomal degradation, a much more striking increase was observed for Synj1-deficient astrocytes (HET: 18 ± 2.54, N = 75 and KO: 26.50 ± 4.49, N = 58; four batches) compared with WT (8.74 ± 1.22, N = 62; four batches) (Fig. 3, A and C). Consistently, our Western blot analysis also showed significant accumulation of lipidated LC3-II after bafilomycin treatment (Fig. 3, D and E). These results, taken together, suggest hyperactive formation of autophagosome in Synj1-deficient astrocytes at the basal level (Fig. 3). We next examined how effective Synj1-deficient astrocytes are in clearing autophagy substrates. In cultured WT neurons from the murine models, starvation or pharmacologically inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity with rapamycin or torin are usually ineffective in inducing autophagic clearance (28Maday S. Holzbaur E.L. Compartment-specific regulation of autophagy in primary neurons.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 5933-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our previous study, however, showed an intriguing sensitization of the Synj1+/− dopamine neurons to rapamycin-induced p62 clearance (25Pan P.Y. Sheehan P. Wang Q. Zhu X. Zhang Y. Choi I. Li X. Saenz J. Zhu J. Wang J. El Gaamouch F. Zhu L. Cai D. Yue Z. Synj1 haploinsufficiency causes dopamine neuron vulnerability and alpha-synuclein accumulation in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2020; 29: 2300-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To examine the stress-induced autophagy in astrocytes, we used two strategies: a 4-h rapamycin (200 nM) treatment to inhibit mTORC1 (29Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth, metabolism, and disease.Cell. 2017; 168: 960-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 30Smith E.D. Prieto G.A. Tong L. Sears-Kraxberger I. Rice J.D. Steward O. Cotman C.W. Rapamycin and interleukin-1beta impair brain-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent neuron survival by modulating autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20615-20629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or serum starvation (replacing the culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM] only medium) to mimic nutrient deprivation. WT astrocytes responded robustly and consistently to rapamycin and serum deprivation with an increase in GFP-LC3 puncta (control: 4.75 ± 0.53, N = 120; Rap: 22.72 ± 2.78, N = 82, DMEM: 23.22 ± 4.10, N = 70) (Fig. 4, A and B) and a reduction in p62 IF (normalized control: 1 ± 0.025, N = 109; normalized Rap: 0.83 ± 0.031, N = 82; normalized DMEM: 0.76 ± 0.041, N = 57) (Fig. 4, C and D) in all four batches of cultures examined. However, rapamycin was ineffective in clearing the autophagy substrate, p62, in both HET and KO astrocytes. Despite a weaker LC3 response to rapamycin in Synj1 KO astrocytes, their responses to the 4-h serum deprivation were as robust as the WT cells (KO DMEM: 28.41 ± 4.52, N = 78, HET DMEM: 21.10 ± 3.31, N = 50) (Fig. 4, A and B, right panel). The p62 level, however, remained unaffected. Taken together, our data suggest that Synj1 deficiency impairs autolysosomal degradation in response to stress (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W3172295726,"Introduction The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was introduced in 2003 to reduce “out-of-pocket” payments for health care in Ghana. Over a decade of its implementation, issues about the financial sustainability of this pro-poor policy remains a crippling fact despite its critical role to go towards Universal Health Coverage. We therefore conducted this study to elicit stakeholders’ views on ways to improve the financial sustainability of the operations of NHIS. Methods Twenty (20) stakeholders were identified from Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Services, health workers groups, private medical practitioners, civil society organizations and developmental partners. They were interviewed using an interview guide developed from a NHIS policy review and analysis. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analysed thematically with the aid of NVivo 12 software. Results Stakeholders admitted that the NHIS is currently unable to meet its financial obligations. The stakeholders suggested first the adoption of capitation as a provider payment mechanism to minimize the risk of providers’ fraud and protection from political interference. Secondly, they indicated that rapid releases of specific statutory deductions and taxes for NHIS providers could reduce delays in claims’ reimbursement which is one of the main challenges faced by healthcare providers. Aligning the NHIS with the Community-based Health Planning and Services and including preventive and promotive health is necessary to position the Scheme for Universal Health Coverage. Conclusion The Scheme will potentially achieve UHC if protected from political interference to improve the governance and transparency that affects the finances of the scheme and the expansion of services to include preventive and promotive services and cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3168622161,"The mitochondrial tumor suppressor 1 (MTUS1) gene acts as a crucial tumor suppressor by inhibiting growth and proliferation of eukaryotic cells including tumor cell lines. Down regulation of MTUS1 gene has been implicated in a wide range of cancers as well as various human diseases. Alteration through nsSNPs can potentially damage the structure and/or function of the protein. As characterization of functional SNPs in such disease linked genes is a major challenge, it is feasible to analyze putative functional SNPs prior to performing larger population studies. Hence, in this in silico study we differentiated the potentially harmful nsSNPs of the MTUS1 gene from the neutral ones by using various sequence and structure based bioinformatic tools. In a total of 215 nsSNPs, 9 were found to be most likely to exert deleterious effect using 7 prediction tools. From which, 5nsSNPs (S1259L, E960K, P503T, L1084V and L1143Q) were selected as potentially damaging due to their presence in the highly conserved region and ability to decrease protein stability. In fact, 2 nsSNPs (S1259L and E960K) among these 5 were found to be individually associated with two distinctive cancers named Stomach adenocarcinoma and Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. As this is the first comprehensive study analyzing the functional nsSNPs of MTUS1, the results of the current study would certainly be helpful in future prospects concerning large population-based studies as well as drug discovery, especially developing individualized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3168344697,"In this study, we investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks removed from tick-bitten humans in the southwestern provinces of the Republic of Korea (ROK). We identified 33 ticks from three tick species, namely Amblyomma testudinarium (60.6%), Haemaphysalis longicornis (27.3%), and Ixodes nipponensis (12.1%) in order of occurrence via morphology and 16S rDNA-targeting polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tick-borne pathogens were detected in 16 ticks using pathogen-specific PCR. From the results, 12 ticks (36.4%) tested positive for spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia: Rickettsia monacensis (1/12), R. tamurae (8/12), and Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis (3/12). Three ticks (9.1%) were positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, three ticks (9.1%) tested positive for Babesia gibsoni (1/3) and B. microti (2/3). In conclusion, we identified three tick species; the most common species was A. testudinarium, followed by H. longicornis and I. nipponensis. SFG Rickettsia, A. phagocytophilum, and Babesia spp. were the most frequently detected pathogens in ticks removed from tick-bitten humans. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. tamurae and Ca. R. jingxinensis detection in Korea. The present results will contribute to the understanding of tick-borne infections in animals and humans in the ROK."

https://openalex.org/W3172166625,"A fraction of patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for advanced prostate cancer (PCa) will develop recurrent castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) in bone. Strategies to prevent CRPC relapse in bone are lacking. Here we show that the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins decrease castration-induced bone marrow adiposity in the tumor microenvironment and reduce PCa progression in bone. Using primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and M2-10B4 cells, we showed that ADT increases bone marrow adiposity by enhancing BMSC-to-adipocyte transition in vitro. Knockdown of androgen receptor abrogated BMSC-to-adipocyte transition, suggesting an androgen receptor-dependent event. RNAseq analysis showed that androgens reduce the secretion of adipocyte hormones/cytokines including leptin during BMSC-to-adipocyte transition. Treatment of PCa C4-2b, C4-2B4, and PC3 cells with leptin led to an increase in cell cycle progression and nuclear Stat3. RNAseq analysis also showed that androgens inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, raising the possibility that inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis may decrease BMSC-to-adipocyte transition. Indeed, statins decreased BMSC-to-adipocyte transition in vitro and castration-induced bone marrow adiposity in vivo. Statin pre-treatment reduced 22RV1 PCa progression in bone after ADT. Our findings with statin may provide one of the mechanisms to the clinical correlations that statin use in patients undergoing ADT seems to delay progression to “lethal” PCa."

Health professional students are at risk of health issues as well when compared to their age-matched counterpart in the population. The present study aimed to find out the impact of COVID-19 awareness on the wellness of Thai health professional students. The awareness of COVID-19 and wellness among Thai health professional students, such as medical, physical therapy, nursing, pharmacy, and medical technology students were surveyed during the early “new normal” informing policy. The participants included 1,001 students, aged 17 to 25 years old, who responded to a Google form questionnaire set by request. The results showed that the prominent health risks among the Thai health professional students included sedentary behavior, obesity, and mental symptoms. A positive rating in attitude towards the COVID-19 epidemic was mostly observed.

https://openalex.org/W3166900065,"Acute stress can crucially influence learning and memory processes. One of the key processes underlying human learning and memory is the ability of our brain to rapidly detect and extract regularities from sensory input across time and space leading to effective predictive processing. Here, we aimed to get an in-depth look into the effect of stress on the acquisition of two aspects of regularity extraction. We examined whether and how stress affects the learning (1) of probability-based regularities and (2) of serial order-based regularities in the same experimental design, and (3) the explicit access to the acquired information. Considering that the acquisition of probability-based regularities is a relatively rapid process, we primarily focused on the early phase of the task. We induced stress with the Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test in 27 young adults, while 26 participants were enrolled in the control group. Salivary cortisol levels and subjective ratings of affective states showed successful stress induction. After the stress induction, we measured regularity extraction with the cued Alternating Serial Reaction Time task. We found that stress promoted the extraction of probability-based regularities measured by the learning performance in the early phase of the task and did not alter the learning of serial order-based regularities. Post-block reports showed weaker explicit access to the serial order-based regularities in the stress group. Our results can contribute to a process-level understanding on how stress alters learning and memory functions related to predictive processes."
https://openalex.org/W3166177225,"Humanity faces the challenge of conserving the attributes of biodiversity that may be essential to secure human wellbeing. Among all the organisms that are beneficial to humans, plants stand out as the most important providers of natural resources. Therefore, identifying plant uses is critical to preserve the beneficial potential of biodiversity and to promote basic and applied research on the relationship between plants and humans. However, much of this information is often uncritical, contradictory, of dubious value or simply not readily accessible to the great majority of scientists and policy makers. Here, we compiled a genus-level dataset of plant-use records for all accepted vascular plant taxa (13489 genera) using the information gathered in the 4th Edition of Mabberley's plant-book, the most comprehensive global review of plant classification and their uses published to date. From 1974 to 2017 all the information was systematically gathered, evaluated, and synthesized by David Mabberley, who reviewed over 1000 botanical sources including modern Floras, monographs, periodicals, handbooks, and authoritative websites. Plant uses were arranged across 28 standard categories of use following the Economic Botany Data Collection Standard guidelines, which resulted in a binary classification of 9478 plant-use records pertaining human and animal nutrition, materials, fuels, medicine, poisons, social and environmental uses. Of all the taxa included in the dataset, 33% were assigned to at least one category of use, the most common being ""ornamental"" (26%), ""medicine"" (16%), ""human food"" (13%) and ""timber"" (8%). In addition to a readily available binary matrix for quantitative analyses, we provide a control text matrix that links the former to the description of the uses in Mabberley's plant-book. We hope this dataset will serve to establish synergies between scientists and policy makers interested in plant-human interactions and to move towards the complete compilation and classification of the nature's contributions to people upon which the wellbeing of future generations may depend."

Different study findings show that about 55% to 78.6% of inpatients experience moderate-to-severe pain. Nurses are one of the health professional who may hear of pain suffered by the patients and who can manage patient suffering by themselves. Therefore, their correct skill is very important in non- pharmacology and pharmacology pain management methods.To assess non-pharmacological pain management practice and barriers among nurses working in Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.Data were collected using structured observational check list with interviewer administered questionnaires that measure nurses' practice on non-pharmacological pain management. Data were entered using Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS (Stastical Package for Social Sciences) version 23. Bivariable and multivariable analysis were conducted to examine the association between independent and outcome variables.A total of 169 nurses participated in the study, with a response rate of 100%. Among the study participants 94 (55.6%) were females, and the mean age of nurses were 34.9(SD = 5.7) years. Only 44(26%) of nurses had good practice on non- pharmacology pain management methods. About 130(77.55%), 125(74.0%), and 123(72.8%) of nurses reported that inadequate cooperation of physicians, multiple responsibilities of nurses and insufficient number of nurses per patient ratio as barriers for practice of non -pharmacology pain management respectively.Majority of nurses didn't apply non-pharmacological pain management practices for their patients in pain and the overall practice level of nurses was very poor. The major identified obstacle factors for the poor practice of non-pharmacological pain management methods were nurses' fatigue, inadequate cooperation of physicians, heavy workload, multiple responsibilities of nurses, and insufficient number of nurses per patient ratio and unfavorable attitude of nurse on non-pharmacology pain management. Even if nurses experiences different challenges, they shall use non-pharmacological pain management methods complementary to pharmacological treatment of pain as they are low cost and safe. And also boosting nurse's attitude towards the effect of non-pharmacological pain management methods is crucial."

Numerous studies have recommended further research on this topic to find out the prevalence of SD overuse among school students and to what extent this is associated with psychological distress. The present study aimed to investigate the pattern of SD use among secondary and high school students in the state of Kuwait, as well as the possible associations with psychological problems, weight, physical activity, and school performance.The correlational study design aimed to survey students from public schools by using a questionnaire and valid instruments, which included: Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) and Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Scale-(DASS-21). Pearson's correlation coefficient, t-tests, one-way ANOVA were applied to find associations or significant differences between the categorical variables, in which p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The study included 1,993 students from secondary schools (48.9%) and high schools (51.1%), of which 47.5% were male and 52.5% were female. There were significant statistical differences in the pattern of use of SDs, addiction to SD use, stress, anxiety, and depression according to gender, school type, school performance, and sport engagement. In addition, there were positive correlations between students' addiction to SD use and stress, anxiety, and depression.The findings suggest that excessive SD use is associated with addiction among secondary and high school students. In addition, levels of stress, anxiety, and depression differ according to the number of hours of SD use. Strategies should be developed at the community and school levels to avoid the overuse of SDs among school-aged students."
https://openalex.org/W3167710512,"Tooth loss is closely associated with suboptimal oral care. Suboptimal oral care can facilitate local infections. These can lead to systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which are important pathological mechanisms of hypertension. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between tooth loss and the risk of hypertension. From the national health insurance system-health screening cohort in Korea, 19,680 participants who underwent three or more health examinations, including blood pressure measurements, between January 2003 and December 2008, without any history or diagnosis of hypertension were included in this study. Hypertension was defined as the diagnosis of hypertension (International Classification of Diseases-10 code “I10–11”) accompanied by the prescription of an antihypertensive agent or at least one health examination result of blood pressure of ≥140/90 mmHg. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with the log-rank test were used to evaluate the relationship between oral hygiene indicators and the incidence of hypertension. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to determine the association between oral hygiene indicators and the development of hypertension. During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, 1,853 patients developed hypertension. The estimated incidence of hypertension within seven years was 8.8%. Multivariable analysis confirmed a significant relationship between the number of lost teeth and hypertension (hazard ratio: 2.26; 95% confidence interval [1.24–4.10], p = 0.007, p for trend = 0.005). There was a positive association between the number of lost teeth and the risk of hypertension in a longitudinal research. In conclusion, the number of lost teeth may be associated with the risk of development of hypertension."

This study expands the scope of multicolor fluorescence microscopy by serial imaging of polystyrene micro-beads as surrogates for drug carriers, cancer spheroids formed using HeLa cells, and microfluidic channels. Three fluorophores with different spectral characteristics are utilized to perform multicolor microscopy. According to the spectrum analysis of the fluorophores, a multicolor widefield fluorescence microscope is developed. Spectral crosstalk is corrected by exciting the fluorophores in a round-robin manner and synchronous emitted light collection. To report the performance of the multicolor microscopy, a simplified 3D tumor model is created by placing beads and spheroids inside a channel filled with the cell culture medium is imaged at varying exposure times. As a representative case and a method for bio-hybrid drug carrier fabrication, a spheroid surface is coated with beads in a channel utilizing electrostatic forces under the guidance of multicolor microscopy. Our experiments show that multicolor fluorescence microscopy enables crosstalk-free and spectrally-different individual image acquisition of beads, spheroids, and channels with the minimum exposure time of 5.5 ms. The imaging technique has the potential to monitor drug carrier transportation to cancer cells in real-time."
https://openalex.org/W3171854152,"Meprin β is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease exhibiting a unique cleavage specificity with strong preference for acidic amino acids at the cleavage site. Proteomic studies revealed a diverse substrate pool of meprin β including the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Dysregulation of meprin β is often associated with pathological conditions such as chronic inflammation, fibrosis, or Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The extracellular regulation of meprin β including interactors, sheddases, and activators has been intensively investigated while intracellular regulation has been barely addressed in the literature. This study aimed to analyze C-terminal phosphorylation of meprin β with regard to cell surface expression and proteolytic activity. By immunoprecipitation of endogenous meprin β from the colon cancer cell line Colo320 and subsequent LC-MS analysis, we identified several phosphorylation sites in its C-terminal region. Here, T694 in the C-terminus of meprin β was the most preferred residue after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. We further demonstrated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms for meprin β phosphorylation and identified the involvement of PKC-α and PKC-β. As a result of phosphorylation, the meprin β activity at the cell surface is reduced and, consequently, the extent of substrate cleavage is diminished. Our data indicate that this decrease of the surface activity is caused by the internalization and degradation of meprin β."

The ABI ≤ 0.9 and TBI ≤ 0.7 were considered as abnormal values. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between TBI/ABI and CIMT.Right CIMT was significantly greater in the low TBI group (p = 0.03) while, left CIMT did not show a significant difference. Each 0.1-unit decrease in TBI value was independently associated with 0.017 mm increase in the right CIMT (β ± SE; -0.017 ± 0.005, p = 0.002) and with odds of the presence of increased CIMT [odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 1.21 (1.02, 1.44)] after adjustment with all traditional risk factors.

This study explored the relationships between six cataract types with pterygium and UV exposure.We have previously studied cataracts in residents of three regions in China and Taiwan with different UV intensities. From that study, we identified 1,547 subjects with information on the presence or absence of pterygium. Pterygium severity was graded by corneal progress rate. Cataracts were graded by classification systems as three main types (cortical, nuclear, posterior subcapsular) and three subtypes (retrodots, waterclefts, fiber folds) with high prevalence in middle-aged and elderly people. We calculated the cumulative ocular UV exposure (COUV) based on subject data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration data on UV intensities and used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for the associations of COUV, cataract, and pterygium.We found an overall pterygium prevalence of 23.3%, with significant variation among the three regions. Four cataract types (cortical, nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and retrodots) were significantly associated with the presence of pterygium.There was a significant association between COUV and pterygium, indicating that COUV is associated with the risk of pterygium development and that pterygium is useful as an index of UV exposure.

https://openalex.org/W3171984448,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus or GBS) is a commensal bacterium that can frequently behave as a pathogen, particularly in the neonatal period and in the elderly. The gut is a primary site of GBS colonization and a potential port of entry during neonatal infections caused by hypervirulent clonal complex 17 (CC17) strains. Here we studied the interactions between the prototypical CC17 BM110 strain and polarized enterocytes using the Caco-2 cell line. GBS could adhere to and invade these cells through their apical or basolateral surfaces. Basolateral invasion was considerably more efficient than apical invasion and predominated under conditions resulting in weakening of cell-to-cell junctions. Bacterial internalization occurred by a mechanism involving caveolae- and lipid raft-dependent endocytosis and actin re-organization, but not clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In the first steps of Caco-2 invasion, GBS colocalized with the early endocytic marker EEA-1, to later reside in acidic vacuoles. Taken together, these data suggest that CC17 GBS selectively adheres to the lateral surface of enterocytes from which it enters through caveolar lipid rafts using a classical, actin-dependent endocytic pathway. These data may be useful to develop alternative preventive strategies aimed at blocking GBS invasion of the intestinal barrier."

While existing research has demonstrated higher cigarette smoking rates among people with mental health conditions, there is sparse information on the association between ENDS use and mental health such as internalizing and externalizing problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between internalizing and externalizing problems for cigarette only, ENDS only, and dual users, as well as changes in mental health among those groups.We used the U.S. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study Wave 3 adult data. Internalizing and externalizing problems were self-reported and assessed via the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener; response options were dichotomized to reflect past 12 months and any lifetime problems. Self-reported changes in mental health over the past 12 months were also assessed. Participants' tobacco use status was categorized as ENDS only use (n = 618), cigarette only use (n = 6,779), dual use (cigarettes and ENDS) (n = 681), and non-current use (n = 16,515).Lifetime and past 12 month internalizing problems were reported by 63.8% (n = 18,706) and 50.4% (n = 15,326), respectively, while lifetime and past 12 months externalizing problems were reported by 63.3% (n = 18,835) and 52.7% (n = 16,005), respectively. Six percent of participants reported worse mental health over the past 12 months.

https://openalex.org/W3166118850,"Introduction Resilience has been proposed as a suitable solution to better deal with nursing students in cases of challenges but the complex and multidimensional nature of resilience has made its measurement challenging. This study aimed to develop and validate a new inventory theory-driven labeled Nursing Student Academic Resilience Inventory. Methods This study was performed with an exploratory sequential mixed-method design. In the qualitative phase of the study, individual interviews were conducted by including 15 participants to elicit the concept of resilience through purposive sampling. In the quantitative phase, psychometric analysis of the extracted items was performed using face, content, and construct validities (exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses) on a sample size of 405 nursing students. Besides, reliability has been tested using internal consistency and test-retest methods. According to the COSMIN standards, beside two important indicators of validity and reliability, responsiveness and interpretability were also considered. Results A 6-factor structure (optimism, communication, self-esteem/evaluation, self-awareness, trustworthiness, and self-regulation) with 24 items were extracted in terms of the derived categories from the qualitative phase. In confirmatory factor analysis, the χ 2 / df ratio was calculated as 2.11 for the NSARI six-factor structure. Suitable values were obtained for the goodness of fit indices (CFI = 0.904, AGFI = 0.885, IFI = 0.906, PCFI = 0.767, and RMSEA = 0.053). In the second-order factor analysis, AVE = 0.70 indicated the existence of both convergent and divergent validities. The Cronbach’s alpha and omega coefficients were investigated as (0.66–0.78) and (0.66–0.80), respectively. The AIC was between 0.33 and 0.45 for all factors, which is an acceptable rate. Additionally, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was obtained as .903 for the whole instrument (CI .846- .946, P &lt;0.0001). Conclusion Multidimensional nature of resilience was supported through exploring its 6-factor structures in the nursing students’ field. This tool also showed an acceptable validity and reliability for measuring resilience in the population of nursing students."
https://openalex.org/W3171467898,"Introduction There has been limited study of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients at risk of limb loss. Our primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of disability in this patient population using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). Materials and methods We recruited patients referred to a limb-preservation clinic. Patients self-reported their disability status using the 12-domain WHODAS 2.0. Severity of disability in each domain was scored from 1 = none to 5 = extreme and the total normalized to a 100-point scale (total score ≥25 = clinically significant disability). We also asked patients about wound-specific concerns and wound-related discomfort or distress. Results We included 162 patients. Reasons for clinic referral included arterial-insufficient (37.4%), postoperative (25.9%), and mixed etiology (10.8%) wounds. The mean WHODAS 2.0 disability score was 35.0 (standard deviation = 16.0). One-hundred-and-nineteen (73.5%) patients had clinically significant disability. Patients reported they had the greatest difficulty walking a long distance (mean score = 4.2), standing for long periods of time (mean score = 3.6), taking care of household responsibilities (mean score = 2.7), and dealing with the emotional impact of their health problems (mean score = 2.5). In the two-weeks prior to presentation, 87 (52.7%) patients expressed concern over their wound(s) and 90 (55.6%) suffered a moderate amount or great deal of wound-related discomfort or distress. In adjusted ordinary least squares regression models, although WHODAS 2.0 disability scores varied with changes in wound volume (p = 0.03) and total revised photographic wound assessment tool scores (p&lt;0.001), the largest decrease in disability severity was seen in patients with less wound-specific concerns and wound-related discomfort and distress. Discussion The majority of people at risk of limb loss report suffering a substantial burden of disability, pain, and wound-specific concerns. Research is needed to further evaluate the WHODAS 2.0 in a multicenter fashion among these patients and determine whether care and interventions may improve their PROs."
https://openalex.org/W3171476623,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase that is able to selectively respond to multiple extracellular stimuli. Previous studies have indicated that the modularity of this system may be caused by ligand-induced differences in the stability of the receptor dimer. However, this hypothesis has not been explored using single-mutant ligands thus far. Herein, we developed a new approach to identify residues responsible for functional divergence by selecting residues in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand that are conserved among orthologs yet divergent between paralogs. Then, we mutated these residues and assessed the mutants' effects on the receptor using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and biochemical techniques. Although the EGF mutants had binding affinities for the EGFR comparable with the WT ligand, the EGF mutants showed differential patterns of receptor phosphorylation and cell growth in multiple cell lines. The MD simulations of the EGF mutants indicated that mutations had long-range effects on the receptor dimer interface. This study shows for the first time that a single mutation in the EGF is sufficient to alter the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway at the cellular level. These results also support that biased ligand–receptor signaling in the tyrosine kinase receptor system can lead to differential downstream outcomes and demonstrate a promising new method to study ligand–receptor interactions.

These results also support that biased ligand–receptor signaling in the tyrosine kinase receptor system can lead to differential downstream outcomes and demonstrate a promising new method to study ligand–receptor interactions. The epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain ligand–receptor signaling system is involved in many biological events in multicellular organisms (1Gazdar A.F. Activating and resistance mutations of EGFR in non-small-cell lung cancer: Role in clinical response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Oncogene. 2009; 28: S24-S31Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). This system is constituted by one receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) and seven distinct peptide ligands (EGF; heparin-binding epidermal growth factor [HBEGF]; epigen [EPGN]; betacellulin [BTC]; epiregulin [EREG]; amphiregulin [AREG]; transforming growth factor-alpha [TGFA]). Upon binding to the receptor, these ligands can activate multiple intracellular downstream pathways through a network of intramolecular interactions with several feedback loops (2Oda K. Matsuoka Y. Funahashi A. Kitano H. A comprehensive pathway map of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2005; 1 (2005.0010)Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). For all ligands, binding induces a transition in the EGFR from monomer or inactive dimer to an active dimer state (3Landau M. Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N.

Saita E.I. Maruyama I.N. Activation of the EGF receptor by ligand binding and oncogenic mutations: The ""Rotation model"".Cells. 2017; 6: 13Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, different ligands are able to promote divergent outcomes, even at saturating concentrations; thus, the mechanism responsible of the modular downstream pathway activation is independent of ligand affinity or potency and likely encompasses intrinsic effects (5Wilson K.J. Gilmore J.L. Foley J. Lemmon M.A. Riese 2nd., D.J. Functional selectivity of EGF family peptide growth factors: Implications for cancer.Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 122: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is well known that the EGFR system plays a key role in cancer development. In particular, some studies have shown that overexpression of the EGFR or its ligands may induce different types of cancer (6Nicholson R.I. Gee J.M. Harper M.E. EGFR and cancer prognosis.Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37 Suppl 4: S9-S15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A better understanding of the interaction between the EGFR and its ligands could lead to the development of targeted therapies (7Xu M.J. Johnson D.E. Grandis J.R. EGFR-targeted therapies in the post-genomic era.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2017; 36: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protein–protein interactions, such as that between the EGFR and its ligands, are well-studied examples of molecular coevolution in biological systems. These interactions are sometimes defined by one part (receptor) that binds several counterparts (ligands). In these instances, receptors and ligands experience different selective constraints, where receptors tend to evolve more slowly because of the necessity of binding multiple ligands (8Alvarez-Ponce D. Feyertag F. Chakraborty S. Position matters: Network centrality considerably impacts rates of protein evolution in the human protein-protein interaction network.Genome Biol. Evol. 2017; 9: 1742-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, paralogs, proteins related by a duplication event, are less likely to retain the same function as orthologs, proteins related by a speciation event (9Jensen R.A. Orthologs and paralogs - we need to get it right.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (Interactions1002)Crossref Google Scholar). Then, the paralogous ligands rather than the receptor are a good candidate to test the functional divergence in the biased signaling system. However, this approach is susceptible to indirect factors, such as different ligand binding selectivity, thus resulting in the activation of unrelated pathways. In this work, we decided to test single mutants of one ligand, EGF, by identifying and modifying sites responsible for a divergent function among paralog ligands. Recent studies have shown that some EGF residues such as Arg-41 and Leu-47 are highly conserved and important for high binding affinity to the EGFR (10Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Structure-function-relationships for the EGF/TGF-alpha family of mitogens.Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Another study highlighted Tyr-13, Leu-15, and His-16 in the EGF as essential for downstream activity of ErbB1 (11Souriau C. Gracy J. Chiche L. Weill M. Direct selection of EGF mutants displayed on filamentous phage using cells overexpressing EGF receptor.Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These outcomes were based on structural analyses of ligands and experimental validation. Although bioinformatic tools such as contact prediction (12Skwark M.J. Raimondi D. Michel M. Elofsson A. Improved contact predictions using the recognition of protein like contact patterns.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10e1003889Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or molecular dynamics (MD) (13Gocheva G. Ivanova A. A look at receptor-ligand pairs for active-targeting drug delivery from crystallographic and molecular dynamics perspectives.Mol. Pharm. 2019; 16: 3293-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) can give a good overall picture of ligand–receptor interactions, the contribution of single ligand residues to the modularity of the system still remains unclear. Ligand-induced selective activation of downstream pathway has been observed in G protein–coupled receptors, a phenomenon known as “biased signaling” (14Evans B.A. Sato M. Sarwar M. Hutchinson D.S. Summers R.J. Ligand-directed signalling at beta-adrenoceptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 159: 1022-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Kenakin T. Functional selectivity and biased receptor signaling.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2011; 336: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A recent report hints that this mechanism might also take place in the EGFR tyrosine kinase (16Ali R. Brown W. Purdy S.C. Davisson V.J. Wendt M.K. Biased signaling downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor regulates proliferative versus apoptotic response to ligand.Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9: 976Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Initially, the main contributor to the modularity of the system was thought to be the affinity of the ligands to the receptor. However, the discovery of the ligand EPGN, which induces a potent mitogen effect despite low binding affinity (17Strachan L. Murison J.G. Prestidge R.L. Sleeman M.A. Watson J.D. Kumble K.D.

A plausible explanation was initially formulated by Wilson et al. (5Wilson K.J. Gilmore J.L. Foley J. Lemmon M.A. Riese 2nd., D.J. Functional selectivity of EGF family peptide growth factors: Implications for cancer.Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 122: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), where different EGFR ligands induce different receptor dimer stabilities, altering the phosphorylation dynamics. Later, new experimental evidence supported this theory by observing a transient activation in stable receptor dimers induced by the EGF, whereas the activation of the weak receptor dimer induced by EPGN or EREG persisted for a longer time (18Freed D.M. Bessman N.J. Kiyatkin A. Salazar-Cavazos E. Byrne P.O. Moore J.O. Valley C.C. Ferguson K.M. Leahy D.J. Lidke D.S.

A difference in dimer stabilities could result in alterations of the receptor oligomerization state, previously shown as a determinant of the intracellular kinase phosphorylation pattern (19Huang Y.

Now, the open question is how these ligands induce different dimer stabilities. Interactions between the interface of the ligand and the EGFR have been shown to influence the stability of the dimerized receptor (20Mehrabi M. Mahdiuni H. Rasouli H. Mansouri K. Shahlaei M.

It is known that the EGFR dimer can be observed in a symmetrical, “flush” conformation or an asymmetrical, “staggered” conformation (22Liu P. Cleveland T.E.t. Bouyain S. Byrne P.O. Longo P.A. Leahy D.J. A single ligand is sufficient to activate EGFR dimers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 10861-10866Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), depending on the presence/absence of the membrane, glycosylation, and the number of bound ligands (23Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Kim E.T. Shaw D.E. Membrane interaction of bound ligands contributes to the negative binding cooperativity of the EGF receptor.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10e1003742Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whether and how this plays a role in biased signaling is still unknown. Here, we show how single amino acid substitutions on the ligands effect the biased signaling in the EGF–EGFR ligand–receptor system. We developed a new bioinformatic tool to analyze the coevolution of the ligand–receptor pair and identify candidate function-altering mutations. The identified mutants induced an altered phosphorylation dynamics and different cellular phenotype (Fig. 1). This is the first study to explain differences in biased signaling of the EGFR using single-residue EGF mutants. Furthermore, our coevolutionary analysis can be applied readily to other ligand–receptor interactions. First, we developed a method for predicting residues that are likely to be responsible for functional divergence among paralogs sharing a common interactor (referred as ligands and receptor from now on). We called the method DIRpred (divergence-inducing residue prediction). Our approach combines residue-specific conservation measures to identify positions that are conserved among orthologs while diverging among paralogs. The DIRpred analysis is based on the assumption that conservation of a residue in orthologs of a specific ligand shows whether a residue is important for either structural or functional reasons, while conservation of a residue among paralogous ligands denotes the importance of a residue for interaction with the common interactor (the main shared property of all ligands). Thus, residues that are highly conserved in orthologs but not in paralogs of a ligand are likely related to the ligand's specific function. Unlike other existing methods for prediction of specificity determining residues (a review can be found in (24Chagoyen M. García-Martín J.A. Pazos F. Practical analysis of specificity-determining residues in protein families.Brief. Bioinform. 2015; 17: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)), we included interprotein coevolution measures to narrow down those residues that are responsible for a specific interaction. The DIRpred score is calculated as the sum of the four components (I: orthologs conservation, II: complement of the paralog's conservation, III: ligand–receptor coevolution, and IV: complement of ligand internal coevolution). Optionally, the analysis can be conducted using a structural alignment of the paralogs (multiple structural alignment [MSTA]) instead of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA). An implementation of the DIRpred analysis was done using Python. The pipeline accepts multiple sequence or structure alignments and a reference protein to conduct the analysis. The output consists of a single tabular file containing the four individual scores and the combined prediction score for each protein site, and a plotted recap of the results (Fig. S1). We applied the DIRpred algorithm to predict the residues in the EGF that induce functional divergence among paralogs (Fig. 2). Because the analysis requires prior knowledge of paralogs and orthologs of the target gene, we first performed a phylogenetic analysis to confirm that the reported paralogous ligands of the EGF are monophyletic (Fig. S2). The same tree was used in the statistical validation of the individual DIRpred scores. A random 53–amino acid–long sequence was evolved 100 times on the EGFR ligand phylogenetic tree using Pyvolve (25Spielman S.J. Wilke C.O. Pyvolve: A flexible Python module for simulating sequences along phylogenies.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0139047Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Assuming that the distribution of DIRpred scores will be normal, we estimated the probability that a site without functional constraints would have the same or higher than observed score (p-value) (26Chakrabarti S. Bryant S.H. Panchenko A.R. Functional specificity lies within the properties and evolutionary changes of amino acids.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We included the results of the statistical analysis to the output of DIRpred for the EGF (Fig. S3, Table S1). The analysis highlighted residue Asn-32, Asp-46, Lys-48, and Trp-50 as potential candidates for paralog functional divergence. Asn-32 and Lys-48 show a very small conservation in both sequence and structure alignments resulting in a high partial score (II). Asp-46 has a relatively high coevolution with the receptor (III), while Trp-50 has high scores overall (Fig. S4).Figure 2DIRpred analysis of EGF. A, the relative ranking score of the four mutants.

The plot is obtained by crossing the two conservation scores. Interestingly, no point lies in the bottom right half of the plot (high paralog conservation and low ortholog conservation), suggesting that paralog and ortholog conservation is not independent.

The tryptophan in position 50 is a strong outlier in our bioinformatics analysis, along with Trp-49 (Fig. 2). Their score is high even when using conservation measures that do not take amino acid type change into account (data not shown). However, Trp-50 was a better candidate for testing because of its outward-facing position, while Trp-49 is involved in buried protein contacts (27Gallay J. Vincent M. Li de la Sierra I.M. Alvarez J. Ubieta R. Madrazo J. Padron G. Protein flexibility and aggregation state of human epidermal growth factor. A time-resolved fluorescence study of the native protein and engineered single-tryptophan mutants.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Trp-49 and Trp-50 could be responsible in facilitating the interaction of the EGF with the membrane phospholipids, as it happens for Pro-7 and Leu-8 (28Tynan C.J. Roberts S.K. Rolfe D.J. Clarke D.T. Loeffler H.H. Kastner J. Winn M.D. Parker P.J. Martin-Fernandez M.L. Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) aligned on the plasma membrane adopts key features of Drosophila EGFR asymmetry.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 2241-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); Trp-49 and Trp-50 are not burying inside the bilayer when the EGF and a membrane are in solution alone (29Li De La Sierra I.M. Vincent M. Padron G. Gallay J. Interaction of recombinant human epidermal growth factor with phospholipid vesicles.

J. 1992; 21: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although this might be different when in complex with the receptor. For example, this could be achieved by Trp-50 through the formation of a helix, clustering together with Val-34 and Arg-45 around the conserved Leu-47 (30Hommel U. Harvey T.S. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Human epidermal growth factor. High resolution solution structure and comparison with human transforming growth factor alpha.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutation N32R is on the interface between the ligand and receptor. The slightly higher affinity is probably due to the presence of the guanidinium group of R which is positively charged and could interact with Gln-16 of EGFR extracellular domain (ECD) (Fig. S5). Interestingly, mutations of the corresponding position in chicken transforming growth factor-alpha were able to alter the mitogenicity without strongly affecting the binding affinity (31Puddicombe S.M. Chamberlin S.G. MacGarvie J. Richter A. Drummond D.R. Collins J. Wood L. Davies D.E. The significance of valine 33 as a ligand-specific epitope of transforming growth factor alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15367-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although no previous literature reported about Asp-46 before, Lys-48 was found in two mutants that showed higher affinity (32Lahti J.L. Lui B.H. Beck S.E. Lee S.S. Ly D.P. Longaker M.T. Yang G.P.

Engineered epidermal growth factor mutants with faster binding on-rates correlate with enhanced receptor activation.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Next, we manually chose which amino acid to introduce on the four sites depending on several factors. The main contribution to the decision was given by the paralog alignment, while also considering the amino acid type and the ligand functional divergence. The paralogs were divided into two groups based on their kinetics parameters of interaction with the receptor. After that, we selected an amino acid that infers a significant change in biochemical properties and that is found in the paralog group without the EGF. When multiple choices were possible, priority was given to the EPGN or EREG because these two ligands are the ones observed to induce a biased signaling in the study by Freed et al (18Freed D.M. Bessman N.J. Kiyatkin A. Salazar-Cavazos E. Byrne P.O. Moore J.O. Valley C.C. Ferguson K.M. Leahy D.J. Lidke D.S. Lemmon M.A. EGFR ligands differentially stabilize receptor dimers to specify signaling kinetics.Cell. 2017; 171: 683-695.e618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The four designed EGF mutants with a single amino-acid substitution that were selected for functional characterization are N32R, D46T, K48T, and W50Y. To determine the integrity of the secondary structure of the mutated ligands and the functional effects of these amino acid substitutions, we first performed in vitro analysis. Initially, CD spectroscopy was used to confirm that the secondary structure of the mutants was maintained (Fig. S6). The β-sheet content of the EGF mutants (ranging from 0.41 to 0.54 %) was not substantially different than the WT EGF (0.44%), whereas the other secondary structure varies. It is not surprising that only the beta sheet content can be detected by CD, considering that the EGF is a peptide (53 amino acids) constituted by two β-sheets connected by a loop and the regions at the C and N termini are flanking. Then, we tested the ability of each mutant to bind the soluble ECD of the EGFR, by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis. The mutants bound the receptor analogously to the WT sample in both the experiments (Fig. 3). Although the N32R sample showed a slightly steeper response in both the experiments, the mutations did not appear to strongly affect the ligand secondary structure and the ability to bind the receptor. To shed light on the biological outcome of the short-term response, we sampled the effect of the EGF single mutants on EGFR expression and on the amount of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) in A431 cells. A431 is a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line that overexpresses the EGFR. For this reason, we postulated that any changes at the receptor level would be amplified. We measured the amount of total and phosphorylated EGFR protein at multiple timesteps by Western blot (WB) after treating with saturating concentrations (100 nM) of WT or mutant ligands (Fig. 4). Remarkably, D46T mutant showed a reduced level of pEGFR up to 30 min after treatment (Fig. 4A). Meanwhile, the pEGFR bands for K48T and W50Y samples appear slightly stronger than the WT in the first three timesteps. However, the differences are not significant. The dimerization state of the receptor, tested by cross-linking assay, follows a similar trend as the phosphorylation experiments (Fig. 4B). After 1 h or 6 h, the treatment with the ligands also caused a reduction in the total amount of EGFR protein compared with the control (Fig. S7). However, the reduction of D46T sample did not appear as marked as the other samples. This result shows an inverse relationship between receptor activation and receptor quantity, a fact that could be explained by the biased signaling theory. Thus, while the EGF mutants showed comparable binding affinities to the receptor, at least one of the mutants showed a different phosphorylation pattern compared with the WT ligand. Furthermore, the observed differences in the total amount of EGFR protein indicate a possible alteration in the membrane expression or recycling of the receptor. To observe the long-term effects of the mutants on the cellular phenotype, we performed a cell growth assay using an IncuCyte live-cell analysis system on two fibroblast cell lines (Bj5-tα and Albino Swiss mouse 3T3). With the same platform, we also performed an apoptotic assay on A431 cells by measuring the reduction in cell population, using the Annexin V green reagent to confirm the induction of apoptosis. After 1 day of initial incubation, we subjected the cells to 1, 10, or 100 nM concentration of growth factors. Treating Bj5-tα fibroblasts with 100 nM WT EGF resulted in the highest reduction in the proliferation rate compared with the control. The reduction in proliferation was accompanied by a change in cellular morphology that could be a signal of differentiation (Data S1). However, treatment with any of the mutants decreased the ability of the ligand to suppress growth (Fig. 5A). The D46T and K48T mutants differed most from the WT (Fig. S8A). We observed a similar trend in the Albino Swiss mouse 3T3 cell line (Fig. S8B). In both cell lines, the effects are concentration dependent (Fig. S9). Next, we further tested the mutants in an apoptosis assay using the A431 cell lines. This cell line is known to exhibit apoptosis when treated with high (>10 nM) concentrations of the EGF peptide (33Gulli L.F. Palmer K.C. Chen Y.Q. Reddy K.B. Epidermal growth factor-induced apoptosis in A431 cells can be reversed by reducing the tyrosine kinase activity.Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 173-178PubMed Google Scholar). The WT showed the highest decrease in cell population 48 h after treating with 100 nM WT, while the four mutants had an intermediate response between WT and the control. Cells treated with the W50Y mutant have the closest level to the WT (Fig. 5B). In WT EGF cells, we observed evidence of apoptosis in cell's globular processes and increased ratio of Annexin to confluence signal (Fig. S10). Meanwhile, D46T- and K48T-treated cells displayed signs of cellular differentiation (Fig. 5C), in comparison with the no ligand and other mutants (Fig. S11, Data S1). Significantly, these results show that single amino acid changes in the EGF ligand display differential effects on the EGFR transduction mechanism. The observation that the four mutations in the EGF alter signal transduction without disrupting any contacts between the ligand and the receptor can be explained by the “loss of symmetry” model of EGFR signaling (18Freed D.M. Bessman N.J. Kiyatkin A. Salazar-Cavazos E. Byrne P.O. Moore J.O. Valley C.C. Ferguson K.M. Leahy D.J. Lidke D.S.

Freed et al. observed how stable symmetrical dimers show a short-lived nature of signaling, whereas asymmetric dimers conduct a sustained activation, lasting longer than 24 h. Such a model provides an explanation on how a low level of phosphorylation after EGF treatment causes modifications in the apoptotic behavior observed in the cellular growth experiments. Compared with the WT EGF, the D46T variant shows a constantly lower phosphorylation signal, possibly through the formation of a less stable, asymmetric dimer. Thus, the observed e"

However, we know less about differences in health between men and women within the same socioeconomic groups. In this article the lack of attention to potential socioeconomic variation in gender health inequality is argued as unfortunate, as it can obscure how mechanisms, such as e.g. working conditions, affect gendered health within specific groups. Drawing on the nationally representative Swedish Level of Living survey (LNU), class/gender interactions as well as class-separate linear probability models are estimated to explore relationships between working conditions and health among men and women with the same occupational class positions. Results show that, although class is not a large explanatory factor for general gender differences in health, there are varying within-class differences between men and women in working conditions, that can contribute to the understanding of within-class gender differences in health. This highlights that, when targeting causes of gender health inequality, it is important to consider not only what class means for women as well as for men, but also what gender means within specific classes."

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA archaeal gene were used to comprehensively investigate the spatiotemporal diversity and structure of archaeal community in the sediments of the Lancang River cascade reservoirs (LRCR). The archaeal abundance ranged from 5.11×104 to 1.03×106 16S rRNA gene copies per gram dry sediment and presented no temporal variation. The richness, diversity, and community structure of the archaeal community illustrated a drastic spatial change. Thaumarchaeota and Euryyarchaeota were the dominant archaeal phyla in the sediments of the cascade rivers, and Bathyarchaeota was also an advantage in the sediments. PICRUSt metabolic inference analysis revealed a growing number of genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and carbon and nitrogen metabolism in downstream reservoirs, indicating that anthropogenic pollution discharges might act as the dominant selective force to alter the archaeal communities. Nitrate and C/N ratio were found to play important roles in the formation of the archaeal community composition. In addition, the sediment archaeal community structure was also closely related to the age of the cascade reservoir and hydraulic retention time (HRT). This finding indicates that the engineering factors of the reservoir might be the greatest contributor to the archaeal community structure in the LRCR."

Mass rearing protocols of parasitoids that are currently in use in biocontrol programs require a meticulous quality control plan, in order to optimize their efficacy, but also their progeny production capacity. In this paper, the effect of different factors on the quality control in mass rearing of T. evenescens, using Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) and Galleria mellonella L. as host species, were investigated. The impact of egg agewas significant in the rates of parasitism, for both host species tested. Significantly highest percent of parasitoid emergence was noticed in two day-old eggs for both host species, while one day-old eggs day exhibited the maximum emergence when both species were used togetherin the same trials. Age-dependent storage egg preservation at either 4 or 9°C significantly influenced the parasitism percentages on both species. The highest parasitism percentage was recorded in two day-old G. mellonella eggs that are kept for 15 days at 9°C while the lower in one day-old P. interpunctella eggs for 60 d storage. Moreover, the highest parasitoid mortality was recorded in T. evanescens reared either on P. interpunctella or G. mellonella at 20°C. Rearing of the parasitoid on a mixture of eggs of both host species resulted in higher parasitism, but not always in higher rates of parasitoid emergence. The results of the present work provide useful information that can be further utilized in rearing protocols of T. evanescens."

Patients perceived DTS as a tool to cope with difficult interpersonal situations and emergencies and stated that this helped them to feel stable, safe and self-confident. Patients reported difficulties during the initial engagement, the learning process and the application of DTS as well as various facilitating factors. Implications of the findings for further research and for optimizing DTS-training in clinical practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3164863893,"Body image concerns revolving around body ideals (thin ideal, muscular ideal) are widespread among women. Whereas a stronger preoccupation with ideal physical appearance is often assumed for narcissistic women, previous empirical findings have been mixed. Following a tripartite structure of agentic, antagonistic, and neurotic narcissism facets, we reexamined whether trait narcissism predicted drive for thinness and drive for muscularity. We further explored the role of importance of appearance as a mediator and moderator of the relation between narcissism and body image concerns. Latent structural equation modeling was applied to self-report data from two independent nonclinical female samples (NSample1 = 224, NSample2 = 342). Results underlined the importance of distinguishing between narcissism facets: Neurotic (but not agentic or antagonistic) narcissism uniquely predicted drive for thinness and drive for muscularity. Importance of appearance mediated but did not robustly moderate these relations. Hence, neurotic narcissistic women (characterized by hypersensitivity, shame, and a fragile self-esteem) are particularly prone to body image concerns. This vulnerability seems partly driven by how much importance they ascribe to their appearance. Future work might build on these insights to further unravel the processes linking neurotic narcissism to body image concerns and how these can be targeted in practical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3166518033,"The principal chaparral species in California, Adenostoma fasciculatum, an evergreen, sclerophyllous shrub, is broadly distributed and provides habitat and food resources for a large and diverse animal community. The effects of climate change, including elevated temperatures, fire frequency and severity, along with increased urban encroachment, have placed pressure on chaparral habitats in California. Our goal is to investigate aspects of reproductive ecology as a measure of the potential resiliency of A. fasciculatum. We focus on seed rain (all seed falling into the seed traps regardless of origin) and seed banks in the context of plant-animal interactions and regeneration.Stand recovery following disturbance is achieved through both resprouting and germination from established persistent soil seed banks. In this study we focus on seed ecology using a series of experiments to document the length and quantity of seed rain, seed predation, parsing the importance of the community of granivores, and evaluating the connection between stand age and germination rate from soil seed banks.Our research documented an 8-month seed rain duration with over 1 million seeds per m2, multiple seed predators including passerines (songbirds) and rodents, and points to the possibility of native ants playing a role in the seed dispersal process. This is important given the recent advancement of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepthema humile) into Californian chaparral. This research demonstrates a clear relationship between A. fasciculatum and both resident and migratory granivores in the chaparral. We documented that a 39-year-old stand had higher germination rates than those which were 16, 20, 41 and 71 years old and how seed banks play a major role in assuring resiliency following fire. These findings are important for wildland managers to assure the continued resiliency of A. fasciculatum."
https://openalex.org/W3168067747,"As the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the need for effective CO2 management is clear. Microalgae are well-suited for CO2 sequestration, given their ability to rapidly uptake and fix CO2. They also readily assimilate inorganic nutrients and produce a biomass with inherent commercial value, leading to a paradigm in which CO2-sequestration, enhanced wastewater treatment, and biomass generation could be effectively combined. Natural non-axenic phototrophic cultures comprising both autotrophic and heterotrophic fractions are particularly attractive in this endeavour, given their increased robustness and innate O2-CO2 exchange. In this study, the interplay between CO2-consuming autotrophy and CO2-producing heterotrophy in a non-axenic phototrophic biofilm was examined. When the biofilm was cultivated under autotrophic conditions (i.e. no organic carbon), it grew autotrophically and exhibited CO2 uptake. After amending its growth medium with organic carbon (0.25 g/L glucose and 0.28 g/L sodium acetate), the biofilm rapidly toggled from net-autotrophic to net-heterotrophic growth, reaching a CO2 production rate of 60 μmol/h after 31 hours. When the organic carbon sources were provided at a lower concentration (0.125 g/L glucose and 0.14 g/L sodium acetate), the biofilm exhibited distinct, longitudinally discrete regions of heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism in the proximal and distal halves of the biofilm respectively, within 4 hours of carbon amendment. Interestingly, this upstream and downstream partitioning of heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism appeared to be reversible, as the position of these regions began to flip once the direction of medium flow (and hence nutrient availability) was reversed. The insight generated here can inform new and important research questions and contribute to efforts aimed at scaling and industrializing algal growth systems, where the ability to understand, predict, and optimize biofilm growth and activity is critical."
https://openalex.org/W3171333812,"Regionalization through the analysis of species groups offers important advantages in conservation biology, compared to the single taxon approach in areas of high species richness. We use a systematic framework for biogeographic regionalization at a regional scale based on species turnover and environmental drivers (climate variables and soil properties) mainly of herbaceous plant species richness. To identify phytogeographic regions in the Balsas Depression (BD), we use Asteraceae species, a family widely distributed in Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) and the most diverse of the vascular plants in Mexico. Occurrence records of 571 species were used to apply a quantitative analysis based on the species turnover, the rate of changes in their composition between sites ( β-Simpson index) and the analysis of the identified environmental drivers. Also, the environmental predictors that influence species richness in the SDTF were determined with a redundancy analysis. We identified and named two phytogeographic districts within the SDTF of the BD (Upper Balsas and Lower Balsas). According to the multi-response permutation procedure, floristic composition of the two districts differs significantly, and the richness of exclusive species in Upper Balsas was higher (292 species) than in the Lower Balsas (32 species). The proportion of Mg and Ca in the soil and the precipitation of the driest three-month period were the environmental factors with greatest positive influence on species richness. The division of geographic districts subordinated to the province level, based on diverse families such as Asteraceae, proved to be appropriate to set up strategies for the conservation of the regional flora, since at this scale, variation in species richness is more evident. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of biogeographic literature that indicates that the identification of smaller biotic districts is more efficient for the conservation of biodiversity, particularly of endemic or rare plants, whose distribution responds more to microhabitats variation."
https://openalex.org/W3166677595,"This article presents a Polish adaptation of the Motivational Postures (Towards Taxes) Questionnaire (MPQ). The MPQ is based on the concept of five tax-related motivational postures (Commitment, Capitulation, Resistance, Disengagement and Game Playing) and consists of 29 items. Three studies validating the Polish version of the MPQ are presented. The first study was conducted with a translated version of the original questionnaire and aimed to verify the factorial validity of this version using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Since the factor structure revealed on Australian sample was not reproduced, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted. Study 2 used CFA to confirm the new structure of the modified version of the questionnaire evident from the Study 1 EFA, and also estimated the reliability and internal validity of the modified version. This resulted in a questionnaire consisting of 20 items and five scales (Moral Duty, Capitulation, Active Resistance, Disengagement and Pleasant Games). The third study tested the questionnaire’s construct validity. A theoretical interpretation of the scale is provided."
https://openalex.org/W3168012399,"Silicene has attracted remarkable attention in the semiconductor research community due to its silicon (Si) nature. It is predicted as one of the most promising candidates for the next generation nanoelectronic devices. In this paper, an efficient non-iterative technique is employed to create the SPICE models for p-type and n-type uniformly doped silicene field-effect transistors (FETs). The current-voltage characteristics show that the proposed silicene FET models exhibit high on-to-off current ratio under ballistic transport. In order to obtain practical digital logic timing diagrams, a parasitic load capacitance, which is dependent on the interconnect length, is attached at the output terminal of the logic circuits. Furthermore, the key circuit performance metrics, including the propagation delay, average power, power-delay product and energy-delay product of the proposed silicene-based logic gates are extracted and benchmarked with published results. The effects of the interconnect length to the propagation delay and average power are also investigated. The results of this work further envisage the uniformly doped silicene as a promising candidate for future nanoelectronic applications."
