https://openalex.org/W2077580619,"Three cellular homologs of the v-erbA oncogene were previously identified in the rat; two of them encode high affinity receptors for the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). A rat complementary DNA clone encoding a T3 receptor form of the ErbA protein, called r-ErbAβ-2, was isolated. The r-ErbAβ-2 protein differs at its amino terminus from the previously described rat protein encoded by c-erbAβ and referred to as r-ErbAβ-1. Unlike the other members of the c-erbA proto-oncogene family, which have a wide tissue distribution, r-erbAβ-2 appears to be expressed only in the anterior pituitary gland. In addition, thyroid hormone downregulates r-erbAβ-2 messenger RNA but not r-erbAβ-1 messenger RNA in a pituitary tumor-derived cell line. The presence of a pituitary-specific form of the thyroid hormone receptor that may be selectively regulated by thyroid hormone could be important for the differential regulation of gene expression by T3 in the pituitary gland."

https://openalex.org/W1548955637,"3′-Azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (D4T) are potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus replication in MT-4 and ATH8 cells. They are also inhibitory to the replication of murine retroviruses, i.e. Moloney murine sarcoma virus-induced transformation of C3H cells. In MT-4 cells AZT is readily phosphorylated to its 5′-monophosphate, while the 5′-di- and 5′-triphosphates are generated to a 200–600-fold lower extent than the 5′-monophosphate. D4T is phosphorylated in MT-4 cells to its 5′-monophosphate at a 300–600-fold lower extent than AZT. The phosphorylation of AZT in the thymidine kinasedeficient cell line (Raji/TK−) is severely depressed, while D4T phosphorylation is only slightly diminished in Raji/TK− as compared to Raji/0 cells. D4T has a 10-fold lower affinity for phosphorylation by crude MT-4 cell extracts than AZT (Km, 142 and 14 µM, respectively), and the Vmax for phosphorylation of D4T is only 5% that of AZT. D4T is phosphorylated by MT-4 cell extracts about 180-fold less efficiently than AZT (Vmax/Km, 0.06 for D4T, as compared to 11 for AZT), and this is consistent with the differences found in the amounts of phosphorylated products of D4T and AZT formed in intact MT-4 cells. The 5′-triphosphates of AZT and D4T are equipotent in their inhibitory effects on the reverse transcriptases from human immunodeficiency virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus."
https://openalex.org/W2071131200,"The myb-ets-containing acute leukemia virus, E26, transforms myeloblasts and erythroblasts in culture and causes a mixed erythroid and myeloid leukemia in chicks. Genes (ets-1, ets-2, and erg) with variable relatedness to the v-ets oncogene of the E26 virus have been identified, cloned, and characterized in several species. Two new members (elk-1 and elk-2) of the ets oncogene superfamily have now been identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the elk-1 cDNA clone revealed that this gene encodes a 428-residue protein whose predicted amino acid sequence showed 82% similarity to the 3' region of v-ets. The elk or related sequences appear to be transcriptionally active in testis and lung. The elk cDNA probe detects two loci in the human genome, elk-1 and elk-2, which map to chromosome regions Xp11.2 and 14q32.3, respectively. These loci are near the translocation breakpoint seen in the t(X;18) (p11.2;q11.2), which is characteristic of synovial sarcoma, and the chromosome 14q32 breakpoints seen in ataxia telangiectasia and other T cell malignancies. This suggests the possibility that rearrangements of elk loci may be involved in pathogenesis of certain tumors."

The divalent metals produced a large spike in cytosolic free Ca2+ and strikingly increased net Ca2+ efflux similarly to bradykinin. One-tenth microM half-maximally increased 45Ca2+ efflux. The potency order of the Ca2+ mobilizing metals was: greater than Co2+ greater than Ni2+ greater than Fe2+ greater than Mn2+. probably acts at an extracellular site because loading the cells with a heavy metal chelator only slightly inhibited Cd2+-evoked 45Ca2+ efflux. increased [3H]inositol polyphosphates; [3H]inositol trisphosphate increased 4-fold in 15 s. Zn2+ reversibly blocked 45Ca2+ efflux evoked by but not that produced by bradykinin. Zn2+ competitively (Ki = approximately 0.4 microM) inhibited net Ca2+ efflux produced by Cd2+. also evoked Ca2+ mobilization in umbilical artery muscle, endothelial, and neuroblastoma cells, and the divalent cation agonist and antagonist specificities were similar to those in the fibroblasts. The divalent metals appear to trigger Ca2+ mobilization via a reversible interaction with an external site on the cell surface, which may be considered a Cd2+ receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2158001990,"Potassium channels are ubiquitous membrane proteins with essential roles in nervous tissue, but little is known about the relation between their function and their molecular structure. A complementary DNA library was made from rat hippocampus, and a complementary DNA clone (RBK-1) was isolated. The predicted sequence of the 495-amino acid protein is homologous to potassium channel proteins encoded by the Shaker locus of Drosophila and differs by only three amino acids from the expected product of a mouse clone MBK-1. Messenger RNA transcribed from RBK-1 in vitro directed the expression of potassium channels when it was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The potassium current through the expressed channels resembles both the transient (or A) and the delayed rectifier currents reported in mammalian neurons and is sensitive to both 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium."

https://openalex.org/W2126400723,"Whereas molecular cloning experiments have provided evidence for the presence of two closely related genes for the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the possible interchangeability of these isoforms in initiating biological processes has not been examined. To test the role of the two forms of the kinase in regulating transcription, expression vectors containing the coding sequence of either kinase have been cotransfected with a fusion gene containing the prolactin promoter coupled to an appropriate marker gene. The results demonstrate that expression vectors for both isoforms of the catalytic subunit are able to increase prolactin promotor activity in a dose-dependent manner. The effects can be observed by measuring either marker gene activity or RNA levels. Transfection of an expression vector encoding an inactive catalytic subunit did not stimulate prolactin promoter activity. The results provide additional evidence for the role of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent kinase in mediating regulation of specific gene transcription and demonstrate that both forms of the catalytic subunit are capable of participating in the regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1590957020,"Abstract We have previously demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) inhibits voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and that this effect is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive, guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein). We now demonstrate that NPY can also stimulate the synthesis of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol in dorsal root ganglion neurons. The effects of NPY were compared with those of bradykinin (BK) which also stimulates phosphoinositide turnover in these cells. NPY-stimulated InsP3 synthesis could be completely blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin and significantly enhanced by cholera toxin although not by other agents which raised cellular concentrations of cyclic AMP. In contrast, the effects of BK were completely unaltered by either toxin. Furthermore the maximal effects of BK and NPY were additive. In spite of the lack of toxin effects, stimulation of InsP3 synthesis produced by BK was clearly mediated by a G-protein. Thus BK stimulated InsP3 production in digitonin-permeabilized neurons, and these effects were enhanced by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and blocked by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). The stimulatory effects of both NPY and BK were also blocked by treatment of neurons with phorbol esters. Fura-2-based microfluorimetry of single dorsal root ganglion neurons demonstrated that both BK and NPY increased cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentration and that both peptides could produce this effect in the same neuron. Both agents could still increase cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentration in Ca2+-free medium indicating that the source of the Ca2+ was an intracellular store. Thus, both NPY and BK can activate InsP3 synthesis in the same cell but seem to utilize different G-proteins. NPY utilizes a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein and BK a toxin-insensitive one."
https://openalex.org/W1524758678,"Abstract A phospholipid column was prepared by coating siliconized porous glass beads with phospholipids. The analysis of the Ca2+ requirement of lipocortin I and its derivatives in the binding to phospholipids was carried out with this column. The Ca2+ concentration required for 50% binding to the phospholipid column at room temperature was about 30 microM for lipocortin I, while that was reduced to 15 microM when lipocortin I was phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor receptor/kinase, and a further reduction in the Ca2+ requirement was observed with proteolytic cleavage at the N-terminal region. Cathepsin D and calpain I (low calcium-requiring form of calcium-activated neutral protease) rapidly cleaved human placental lipocortin I at Trp-12 and Lys-26, respectively. These N-terminal-truncated proteins required only 5 microM Ca2+ for 50% binding to the phospholipid column. This enhancement of Ca2+ sensitivity by limited proteolysis was also observed for porcine lung lipocortin I. Essentially the same results were obtained when the Ca2+ sensitivities of the modified lipocortins I were analyzed using dispersed phospholipid vesicles instead of the phospholipid affinity column. Equilibrium dialysis indicated that the release of the N-terminal region markedly increased the affinity of lipocortin I for Ca2+ in the presence of phosphatidylserine, without any appreciable change of the number of Ca2+-binding sites. Limited proteolysis by endogenous proteases such as calpain may be an important regulatory mechanism for the Ca2+ sensitivity of lipocortin I in phospholipid binding."
https://openalex.org/W77849655,"The chicken liver cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor has been purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography on pentamannose phosphate-Sepharose and tested for its ability to bind iodinated human IGF-I, human IGF-II, and chicken IGF-II. In contrast to the bovine, rat, and human cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors, which bind human IGF-II and IGF-I with nanomolar and micromolar affinities, respectively, the chicken receptor failed to bind either radioligand at receptor concentrations as high as 1 microM. The bovine receptor binds chicken IGF-II with high affinity while the chicken receptor binds this ligand with only low affinity, which we estimate to be in the micromolar range. These data demonstrate that the chicken cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor lacks the high affinity binding site for IGF-II. These results provide an explanation for the failure of previous investigators to identify the type II IGF receptor by IGF-II cross-linking to chicken cells and indicate that the mitogenic activity of IGF-II in chick embryo fibroblasts is most likely mediated via the type I IGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2405656890,"The oxidation state of the 7 cyst(e)ine residues of the beta subunit of lamb kidney (Na,K)-ATPase was determined. The fluorescent sulfhydryl-reactive reagent 4-(aminosulfonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole was utilized before and after reduction of disulfide bonds to determine the number and location of disulfide bonds present in the beta subunit. Treatment of tryptic peptides of the beta subunit separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with a reducing agent and 4-(aminosulfonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole allowed identification of which residues were disulfide-linked. The results indicated that there is only one free sulfhydryl, Cys44, and that Cys125 is disulfide-bonded to Cys148, Cys158 is disulfide-linked to Cys174, and Cys212 is disulfide-bonded to Cys275. All three disulfide bonds were shown to be reduced in the presence of high concentrations of beta-mercaptoethanol and elevated temperature. These conditions also lead to a loss of (Na,K)-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588043867,"After binding to its four 9-mer boxes in the 245-base pair Escherichia coli replication origin (oriC), dnaA protein effects the formation of an in an adjacent region made up of three 13-mers (Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1988) Cell 52, 743-755). This open complex formation requires the ATP form of dnaA protein assisted by HU protein (Sekimizu, K., Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1987) Cell 50, 259-265). We now provide direct evidence that dnaA protein binds the 13-mers, sequences that bear no resemblance to the 9-mer box. The evidence is (i) displacement of dnaA protein from the open complex by oriC or by a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the 13-mers, but not by a mutant of oriC lacking the 13-mers; (ii) filter binding of the synthetic (13-mer) oligonucleotide by dnaA protein; and (iii) requirement for the ATP form of dnaA protein assisted by HU protein for temperature-dependent binding to the 13-mer region. Controlled proteolysis of dnaA protein results in a prompt loss of oriC binding; an NH2-terminal 30-kDa peptide contains the domain that binds ATP and phospholipids known to destabilize the tightly bound ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1553247575,"Abstract The use of guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate as a substrate for p21 c-Ha-ras was established. By using chirally labeled [gamma-17O,18O]guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate, the stereochemical course of the GTPase reaction was determined. The analysis shows that the hydrolysis occurs with inversion at the gamma-phosphorus. This shows that the most likely mechanism is a single step, in-line transfer, without a phosphoenzyme or other phosphorylated intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1574194466,"We have initiated a study to identify host proteins which interact with the regulatory region of the human polyomavirus JC (JCV), which is associated with the demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. We examined the interaction of nuclear proteins prepared from different cell lines with the JCV regulatory region by DNA binding gel retardation assays. Binding was detected with nuclear extracts prepared from human fetal glial cells, glioma cells, and HeLa cells. Little or no binding was detected with nuclear extracts prepared from human embryonic kidney cells. Competitive binding assays suggest that the nuclear factor(s) which interacted with the JCV regulatory region was different from those which interacted with the regulatory region of the closely related polyomavirus SV40. We found three areas in the JCV regulatory region protected from DNase I digestion: site A, located just upstream from the TATA sequence in the first 98-base pair (bp) repeat; site B, located upstream from the TATA sequence in the second 98-bp repeat; and site C, located just following the second 98-bp repeat. There were some differences in the ability of the nuclear factor(s) from the two brain cell lines and HeLa cells to completely protect the nucleotides within the footprint region. The results from the DNase I protective studies and competitive DNA binding studies with specific oligonucleotides, suggest that nuclear factor-1 or a nuclear factor-1-like factor is interacting with all three sites in the JCV regulatory region. In addition, the results suggest that the nuclear factor which interacts with the JCV regulatory region from human brain cell lines is different from the factor found in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526661164,"Abstract The purified outer membrane proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine and dicetylphosphate into membrane vesicles, and these were tested by the liposome swelling method for the diffusion of saccharides with different Mr. Proteins C (Mr, 70,000), D (Mr, 46,000), and E (Mr, 43,000) were found to confer the monosaccharide-permeable pores in the reconstituted liposome membranes. The membrane vesicles containing proteins F (Mr, 34,000), G (Mr, 25,000), or H (Mr, 19,000) showed no detectable pore-forming activity. The pores formed by proteins C, D, or E appeared to be smaller than that formed by the Escherichia coli porins. The size of the solutes that permeated through the newly identified porins is similar to that through the intact and purified outer membrane of P. aeruginosa (Yoneyama, H., and Nakae, T. (1986) Eur.

https://openalex.org/W1023984016,"The mechanisms by which the chemotactic peptide formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine stimulates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane were investigated in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60, induced to differentiate with dimethyl sulfoxide. Ca2+ influx was determined: (a) from the initial rate of Mn2+ influx, apparent from the quenching of intracellular quin2 or fura-2 fluorescence; (b) from the rate of the elevation of cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+]i, upon readdition of Ca2+ to cells previously stimulated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. [3H]Inositol tris-, tetrakis-, and pentakisphosphates were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography procedure which was optimized for the separation of inositol tetrakisphosphates, yielding three predominant isomers: inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4, 6-tetrakisphosphate. Both the kinetics and agonist dose dependence of Ca2+ influx stimulation correlated closely with the corresponding receptor-mediated variations of [Ca2+]i either in the presence or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Of the different inositol phosphates determined in parallel and under the same conditions, accumulation of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 correlated best with Ca2+ influx both temporally and in its dose dependence in the presence or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+; inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was also correlated but to a lesser extent. Attenuations of [Ca2+]i elevations by decreasing extracellular Ca2+ or by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ buffering capacity with quin2 led to parallel inhibition of Ca2+ influx and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 production. In conclusion: 1) activation of Ca2+ influx by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine depends on the elevation of [Ca2+]i, the latter being initiated by Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores; 2) Ins(1,3, 4,5)P4 is a strong candidate for maintaining receptor-mediated activation of Ca2+ influx in differentiated HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1549566700,"Abstract Initiation of smooth muscle contraction is associated with Ca2+/calmodulin activation of myosin light chain kinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 20-kDa light chain of myosin. In tracheal smooth muscle cells in culture, the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation is less than 10% at basal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations of 150 nM. Stimulation of these cells with serotonin, histamine, carbachol, or the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, increases free cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Light chain phosphorylation reaches a maximal value of 67% at Ca2+ concentrations below 1 microM. The relationship between the extent of light chain phosphorylation and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration is apparently independent of the source of free intracellular Ca2+ or the agent used to stimulate the cells and is not altered by pre-exposure of the contractile apparatus to high concentrations of free Ca2+. Pretreatment of cells with 8-bromo-cyclic GMP or forskolin decreases free cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation in response to histamine or ionomycin. Pretreatment with 8-bromo-cyclic GMP also decreases the maximal extent of light chain phosphorylation. These results indicate that cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, per se, is a primary determinant for myosin light chain phosphorylation in tracheal smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562056482,"Abstract Adenylate kinase (ATP:AMP phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3) activity was detected in the flagella of ejaculated bovine spermatozoa. This activity provided sufficient ATP to produce normal motility in cells permeabilized with digitonin and treated with 0.5 mM MgADP. In the presence of ADP, adenylate kinase activity was inhibited by P1,P5-di(adenosine 5')-pentaphosphate (Ap5A), an adenylate kinase-specific inhibitor, and motility was stopped. ATP-supported motility was not affected by Ap5A. Mitochondrial adenylate kinase activity allowed AMP to stimulate respiration in permeabilized sperm. Adenylate kinase activity in tail fragments was most active in a pH range from 7.6 to 8.4, and a similar pH sensitivity was observed for this enzyme activity in a hypotonic extract of whole sperm. The apparent km of adenylate kinase activity in permeabilized tail fragments was about 1.0 mM ADP in the direction of ATP synthesis. The fluctuation of nucleotide concentrations in normal and metabolically stimulated sperm suggested that adenylate kinase was most active when the cell was highly motile, although adenylate kinase activity did not appear to be coupled strictly with motility."
https://openalex.org/W33346537,"We have characterized a nuclear mutant of barley, viridis-115, lacking photosystem II (PSII) activity and compared it to wild-type seedlings during light-induced chloroplast development. Chloroplasts isolated from wild-type and viridis-115 seedlings illuminated for 1 h synthesized similar polypeptides and had similar protein composition. After 16 h of illumination, however, mutant plastids exhibited reduced ability to radiolabel D1, CP47, and several low Mr membrane polypeptides, and by 72 h, synthesis of these proteins was undetectable. Immunoblot analysis showed that plastids of dark-grown wild-type barley lacked several PSII proteins (D1, D2, CP47, and CP43) and that 16 h of illumination resulted in the accumulation of these polypeptides. In contrast, these polypeptides did not accumulate in illuminated viridis-115 seedlings, although mutant plastids accumulated two PSII proteins that participate in oxygen evolution, oxygen-evolving enhancers 1 and 3. Northern analysis showed that the levels of psbA and psbB mRNA in mutant plastids were equal to or greater than levels in wild-type plastids throughout the developmental period examined here. These results indicate that the nuclear mutation present in viridis-115 affects the translation and stability of the chloroplast-encoded D1 and CP47 polypeptides and that its influence is expressed after the onset of light-induced chloroplast development."
https://openalex.org/W1651705360,"Abstract Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters (CE) between lipoproteins and was reported to also directly mediate the of high density lipoprotein (HDL) CE by human Hep G2 cells and fibroblasts. The present study investigates that and its relationship to a pathway for selective uptake of HDL CE that does not require CETP. HDL3 labeled in both the CE and apoprotein moieties was incubated with Hep G2 cells. During 4-h incubations, CE tracer was selectively taken up from doubly labeled HDL3 in excess of apoA-I tracer, and added CETP did not modify that uptake. However, during 18-20-h incubations, CETP stimulated the of CE tracer more than 4-fold without modifying the of apoA-I tracer. This suggested that secreted products, perhaps lipoproteins, might be required for the CETP effect. Four inhibitors of lipoprotein via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (heparin, monensin, an antibody against the LDL receptor, and antibodies against the receptor binding domains of apoB and apoE) effectively blocked the CETP stimulation of CE tracer uptake. Heparin caused an increase in CE tracer in a d less than 1.063 g/ml fraction of the medium that more than accounted for the heparin blockade of CETP-stimulated CE uptake. CETP did not affect the of doubly labeled HDL3 by human fibroblasts, even at twice plasma levels of activity, and heparin did not modify of HDL3 tracers. Thus the CETP effect on Hep G2 cells can be accounted for by transfer of HDL CE to secreted lipoproteins which are then retaken up, and there is no evidence for a direct effect of CETP on cellular of HDL CE."
https://openalex.org/W1513355409,"Abstract Calcium-dependent protease (CANP, Calpain) is an intracellular protease involved in essential cellular functions mediated by calcium. To understand the mechanism regulating the expression of CANP at the transcriptional level, we isolated a human gene for the large subunit of mCANP (CANP mL) and analyzed its 5'-region. The transcription initiation sites were mapped to multiple positions (-142 to -103, A of initiation ATG as +1). The upstream region lacks typical promoter elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes and is characterized by its high GC content (-300 to -20, 70% GC content). Functional analyses of the 5'-region by a transient expression assay on HeLa cells revealed that the region (-202 to -80) has a promoter activity. The upstream half of the promoter region (-202 to -130) acts as an upstream promoter element in an orientation-independent manner. Upstream of the promoter region are tandemly reiterated multiple regulatory regions (-2.5k to -690, -690 to -460, -460 to -260, and -260 to -202), each of which negatively regulates the CANP mL gene promoter as well as heterologous promoters in an orientation-independent manner. The presence of a cellular factor(s) mediating the action of these positive (promoter) and negative regulatory elements was suggested by an in vivo competition assay. The negative regulation of transcription mediated by these reiterated cis-acting elements and trans-acting factor(s) may play an essential role in the expression of the CANP mL gene."
https://openalex.org/W1576735603,"Abstract The role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on the specific function of several steroidogenic cells has been recently reported. Since IGF-I is produced by several tissues, we have investigated whether bovine adrenal cells secrete this peptide. Purification of conditioned medium from adrenal cells incubated with [35S]methionine through affinity chromatography (monoclonal anti-IGF-I antibody), high pressure liquid chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single band of similar Mr as pure recombinant IGF-I. Moreover, the purified adrenal-secreted IGF-I displaced bound 125I-IGF-I to its adrenal receptors, and pretreatment of adrenal cells with the purified peptide enhanced the acute corticotropin (ACTH)-induced cAMP production as recombinant IGF-I. The basal secretion of IGF-I (6 +/- 1 ng/48 h/10(6) cells) was stimulated 3-, 4.5-, and 9.5-fold by fibroblast growth factor, angiotensin II (A-II), and ACTH, respectively, but not by growth hormone. The stimulatory effects of A-II and ACTH were dose-dependent (ED50 congruent to 2.5 x 10(-8) and 1.5 x 10(-10) M, respectively), and the effects of both hormones were additive. Glucocorticoids were not the mediators of the effect of the two hormones on IGF-I secretion, since inhibition of their steroidogenic action by aminoglutethimide did not significantly modify IGF-I secretion. An immunoreactive IGF-I material was also secreted by mouse adrenal tumor cell line Y-1, but the stimulatory effect of ACTH was only 2-fold, and there was no effect of A-II. Since bovine adrenal cells contain specific IGF-I receptors and this peptide is required for the maintenance of some adrenal cell-specific function, the present data suggest that IGF-I may act in an autocrine fashion to stimulate adrenal cell differentiation stimulated by ACTH and A-II."

https://openalex.org/W1580644725,"Abstract The reactivity with dioxygen of a mammalian (sheep) ceruloplasmin, anaerobically reduced with ascorbate, was found to depend on the state of the Type 2 and Type 3 copper centers, as monitored by EPR and optical spectroscopy. A complete reoxidation by air after anaerobic reduction with ascorbate was observed with samples (A) purified by the single-step procedure described for chicken ceruloplasmin (Calabrese, L., Carbonaro, M., and Musci, G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6480-6483), while samples prepared by traditional multistep procedure (B) or subjected to freeze-thawing (C) displayed partial and very slow reoxidation, reflecting the functional nonequivalence of blue coppers which is considered a typical property of mammalian ceruloplasmin. The rate of reduction of the 330 nm chromophore was found to increase as a function of the extent and rate of reoxidation of different samples, while the 610 nm band displayed an opposite trend. Samples B and C showed a Type 2 copper signal in the EPR spectrum, while sample A showed practically no Type 2 copper in the oxidized protein, and a transient Type 2-like signal during reduction. The presence of a trinuclear Type 2-Type 3 cluster can therefore be proposed for all ceruloplasmins, and the integrity of the copper-copper coupling is essential for efficient oxidase behavior."
https://openalex.org/W202772636,"Abstract Catalytic activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in plasma is regulated in part by formation of complexes with specific inhibitors as well as by hepatic clearance. Potential interaction of these two regulatory mechanisms was examined in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. These cells secrete plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) and initiate catabolism of exogenous t-PA by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Specific binding of 125I-t-PA to cells at 4 degrees C results in dose-dependent formation of a 95-kDa species recognized by monospecific anti-PAI-1 and anti-t-PA antibodies and stable in the presence of low (0.2%) concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Specific binding of 125I-t-PA and formation of the 95-kDa SDS-stable species are inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner following preincubation of cells with anti-PAI-1 antibodies. High and low molecular weight forms of urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) capable of forming specific complexes with PAI-1 complete for 125I-t-PA binding sites. However, the proenzyme form of u-PA (scu-PA), incapable of forming complexes with PAI-1, does not compete for 125I-t-PA binding sites. The role of the serine protease active site of t-PA in mediating both interaction with PAI-1 and specific binding was examined using 125I-t-PA that had been functionally inactivated with D-phenylalanyl-L-propyl-L-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK). 125I-t-PA-PPACK, despite a 6-fold lower affinity than active 125I-t-PA, exhibited specific binding to cells without detectable formation of SDS-stable complexes with PAI-1. Both surface-bound 125I-t-PA and 125I-t-PA-PPACK are internalized and degraded by cells at 37 degrees C. 125I-t-PA is internalized as a stable complex with PAI-1, whereas 125I-t-PA-PPACK is internalized with similar kinetics but without the presence of an SDS-stable complex. Thus, PAI-1 appears capable of modulating t-PA catabolism in the human hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1537520293,"Abstract Parathyroid hormone-like proteins (PTHLP) display actions in the kidney which are similar to those of parathyroid hormone (PTH). We compared the binding properties of PTHLP and PTH in canine renal cortical membranes to determine if they interacted with the same or different receptors. Radioiodination to high specific activity (greater than 400 microCi/micrograms) of [Nle8,18,Tyr34]human PTH-(1-34)amide and [Tyr36]PTHLP-(1-36)amide was performed using the lactoperoxidase method. Complete enzymatic digestion of both radioligands demonstrated that the peptides were monoiodinated. Both radioligands retained full biological activity in the renal adenylate cyclase assay, and neither was significantly degraded during incubation with highly purified canine renal membranes under binding assays conditions. Specific binding reached equilibrium by 20 min at 20 degrees C. Competition binding studies using unlabeled [Nle8,18,Tyr34]human PTH-(1-34)amide, [Tyr36] PTHLP-(1-36)amide, and bovine PTH-(1-34) with either radioligand revealed similar binding affinities for all three peptides. Biologically inactive PTHLP fragments did not show significant displacement. In contrast to its similar binding affinity, [Tyr36]PTHLP-(1-36)amide was 6-15-fold less potent than bovine PTH-(1-34) in the renal adenylate cyclase assay, suggesting less efficient receptor-effector coupling. Photoaffinity cross-linking using either radioligand in canine renal membrane labeled indistinguishable 70,000-dalton proteins. In the presence of multiple protease inhibitors, binding to an 85-kDa component was observed. Labeling of both receptor forms was specifically abolished by an excess of either cold peptide and dose-response curves using affinity cross-linked membranes corroborated the apparent binding affinities determined by conventional radioligand binding assays. We conclude that PTHLP-(1-36) and amino-terminal PTH analogues bind to indistinguishable receptors in canine renal cortical membranes, but display differential coupling to post-receptor events."
https://openalex.org/W1669883116,"The COX6 gene encodes subunit VI of cytochrome c oxidase. Previously, this gene and its mRNAs were characterized, and its expression has been shown to be subject to glucose repression/derepression. In this study we have examined the effects of heme and the HAP1 (CYP1) and HAP2 genes on the expression of COX6. By quantitating COX6 RNA levels and assaying beta-galactosidase activity in yeast cells carrying COX6-lacZ fusion genes, we have found that COX6 is regulated positively by heme and HAP2, but is unaffected by HAP1. Through 5' deletion analysis we have also found that the effects of heme and HAP2 on COX6 are mediated by sequences between 135 and 590 base pairs upstream of its initiation codon. These findings identify COX6 as the fourth respiratory protein gene that is known to be regulated positively by heme and HAP2. The other three, CYC1, COX4, and COX5a, encode iso-1-cytochrome c, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, and an isolog, Va, of cytochrome c oxidase subunit V, respectively. Thus, it appears that the biogenesis of two interacting proteins, cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase, in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, are under the control of common factors."

https://openalex.org/W2144198267,"The mechanism of Sendai virus fusion was investigated by studying the effect of the dehydrating agent polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the interaction of the virus with erythrocyte membranes. The initial rate of virus fusion, monitored continuously by a fluorescence membrane fusion assay, increases approximately 5-fold in the presence of small amounts (4%, w/v) of PEG. The polymer did not trigger a massive nonspecific fusion event, as the limited number of virus particles that fuse per erythrocyte ghost remains unaltered. A mass action kinetic analysis reveals that the binding rate constant increases approximately 1.5-fold; however, the fusion rate constant is enhanced by about an order of magnitude. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic interaction forces dominate the actual fusion step of the virus. Below about 22 degrees C, the viral membrane proteins appear to be clustered, as revealed by temperature-dependent fluorescence measurements of fluorescently tagged viral proteins. Clustering is not modulated by the presence of PEG, and fusion at those conditions is not observed. It is concluded that in addition to hydrophobic interactions, constraints in the mobility of the viral membrane proteins codetermine the fusogenic capacity of the virus. Such constraints have to be relieved in order to allow the occurrence of the hydrophobic interactions. PEG primarily affects the surface properties of the viral membrane, including the properties of the membrane glycoproteins. We hypothesize that during virus-target membrane interaction but prior to the actual fusion reaction, the fusion protein may undergo a conformational change, triggered by an enhancement in hydrophobic environment, which accounts for the need to establish close, i.e. fusion-susceptible intermembrane contact between virus and target membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1483093699,"Protein kinase C (PKC) (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activators stimulated human neutrophils to reduce the availability of high affinity receptors for platelet-activating factor. These effects were concentration dependent, irreversible, temperature sensitive, and antagonized by a PKC blocker. The activators also inhibited 1-O-alkyl-65% hexadecyl, 25% octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAF)-induced Ca2+ transients; this inhibition correlated precisely with receptor depletion. Contrastingly, PKC activators could enhance as well as inhibit PAF-induced degranulation. Inhibition of degranulation occurred only at concentrations of the activators which depressed high affinity PAF binding by greater than 75%. Cells treated with lesser activator concentrations responded to PAF with reduced but still substantial rises in cytosolic Ca2+, markedly increased degranulation, and markedly increased PKC mobilization. The last two responses, however, failed to occur in cells that were (a) calcium depleted, (b) treated with high activator concentrations (which inhibited virtually all PAF binding and PAF-induced Ca2+ transients), or (c) treated with PAF 5 min before a PKC activator (PAF-induced rises in cytosolic Ca2+ reversed in less than 5 min). Thus, activated PKC down-regulates high affinity PAF receptors. This tends to reduce neutrophil responses to PAF. On the other hand, PAF, perhaps by raising cytosolic Ca2+, acts synergistically with PKC activators in mobilizing PKC. This may tend to enhance function but seems capable of influencing only those responses that are elicited by PKC activators (e.g. degranulation but not Ca2+ transients). The complex and bidirectional effects of PKC activators on other receptor-mediated, calcium mobilizing agonists in various cell types may reflect these opposing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2340250851,"Abstract Oxygenated and states of the cytochrome d complex of Escherichia coli have been proposed as intermediates in the reaction mechanism of this ubiquinol oxidase. In this report, several stable states of the purified enzyme were examined spectroscopically at room temperature. As purified, the cytochrome d complex exists in an oxygenated state characterized by an absorbance band at 650 nm. Removal of oxygen results in loss of absorbance at this wavelength, which is restored upon the return of oxygen. The presence of one oxygen molecule in the oxygenated state was quantified by measuring oxygen released when excess hydrogen peroxide was added to the oxygenated state by passage of argon generates a partially state with an absorbance peak at 628 nm, apparently due to reduced cytochrome d. Addition of equimolar hydrogen peroxide to the fully oxidized state produces the state. This state is also formed upon addition of excess hydrogen peroxide to the oxygenated state via a stable intermediate termed peroxy It is likely that 1) the oxygenated state consists of one molecule of oxygen bound to reduced heme d, and 2) there are at least two stable states that have bound peroxide at room temperature, the state and a newly discovered intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1508567601,"Our recent findings suggest that enzymatic hydrolysis of the intradimer phosphodiester bond may constitute the initial step in the repair of UV light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in human cells. To examine the susceptibility of this phosphodiester linkage to enzyme-mediated hydrolysis, the trinucleotide d-Tp-TpT was UV-irradiated and the two isomeric compounds containing a cis-syn-cyclobutane dimer were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and treated with various deoxyribonucleases. Snake venom phosphodiesterase hydrolyzed only the 3'-phosphodiester group in the 5'-isomer (d-T less than p greater than TpT) but was totally inactive toward the 3'-isomer (d-TpT less than p greater than T). In contrast, calf spleen phosphodiesterase only operated on the 3'-isomer by cleaving the 5'-internucleotide bond. Kinetic analysis revealed that (i) the activity of snake venom phosphodiesterase was unaffected by a dimer 5' to a phosphodiester linkage, (ii) the action of calf spleen phosphodiesterase was partially inhibited by a dimer 3' to a phosphodiester bond, and (iii) Escherichia coli phr B-encoded DNA photolyase reacted twice as fast with d-T less than p greater than TpT as with d-TpT less than p greater than T. Mung bean nuclease, nuclease S1, and nuclease P1 all cleaved the 5'-internucleotide linkage, but not the intradimer phosphodiester bond, in d-TpT less than p greater than T. Both phosphate groups in d-T less than p greater than TpT were refractory to mung bean nuclease or nuclease S1. Incubation of d-T less than p greater than TpT with nuclease P1, however, generated the novel compound dT less than greater than d-pTpT containing a severed intradimer phosphodiester linkage. Accordingly, nuclease P1 represents the first purified enzyme known to hydrolyze an intradimer phosphodiester linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1647584281,"We have characterized a plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and a cytosolic phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific PLC in human liver. Epinephrine, 1 x 10(-5) M, and vasopressin, 1 x 10(-8) M, stimulated PIP2-PLC which was enhanced by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). PI-PLC stimulation was not observed by these agents. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) in the presence and absence of GTP gamma S did not stimulate PIP2-PLC or PI-PLC in plasma membranes and cytosol preparations nor phosphoinositide breakdown in isolated human hepatocytes. Furthermore, serendipitly we found that PIP2-PLC activity was increased in liver membranes from obese patients with type II diabetes when compared to obese and lean controls. We conclude that in human liver, insulin and IGFs are not members of the family of hormones generating inositol trisphosphate (IP3) as a second messenger. Furthermore, the increased PIP2-PLC in diabetic liver may result in: (a) increased intracellular concentrations of IP3 and thus increased Ca2+, which has been postulated to induce insulin resistance; and (b) increased diacylglycerol and thus increased protein kinase C which phosphorylates the insulin receptor at serine residues inactivating the insulin receptor kinase. While the mechanism of increased PIP2-PLC activity in diabetes is unknown, it may initiate a cascade of events that result in insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1524756587,"Abstract We have studied the variations in the number of insulin receptor and insulin receptor mRNA levels in (Hep G2) cells in response to growth and insulin treatment. The levels of insulin receptors are relatively low in growing cells. After approximately 5 days in culture, if cells are not refed they cease to divide and the number of receptors/cell increases, reaching 4 times the initial values by the 9th day. Refeeding the cells completely prevented both growth arrest and the increase in insulin receptor number. Insulin added daily to cells at 0.33 microM caused receptor down-regulation but did not prevent a 3-fold increase in binding with growth arrest. Pulse-chase studies of metabolically labeled ([35S]methionine) cells showed that the receptor degradation rate (apparent t 1/2, 18-20 h) was comparable in rapidly growing versus growth-arrested cells. The increased receptor level in non-refed cells is not due to generation of a soluble factor by confluent cells, nor is it caused by depletion of insulin, glucose, or insulin-like growth factor I from the culture medium. The levels of insulin receptor mRNA measured on Northern blots increased in growth-arrested cells in parallel to the increase in receptor number. The mRNA value begins to increase from the 3rd day in culture and by the 9th day reaches a level 6.0 times that on the 3rd day. Chronic insulin-induced receptor down-regulation did not alter insulin receptor mRNA levels at any time point studied. These data demonstrate that the increase in insulin receptor number/cell in growth-arrested cells is paralleled by an increase in insulin receptor mRNA content with no change in the receptor degradation rates. This suggests that the increase in the number of insulin receptors is due to enhanced receptor synthesis due to increased receptor mRNA content. Conversely, down-regulation of the insulin receptor does not affect the level of insulin receptor mRNA and thus must be due to increased receptor degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1557828310,"Abstract The ability of alcohols to regulate inositol lipid-specific phospholipase C (phosphoinositidase C) was examined in turkey erythrocyte ghosts prepared by cell lysis of erythrocytes which were prelabeled with [3H] inositol. Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thiotriphosphate] GTP[S] stimulated the production of both [3H]inositol bisphosphate (18-fold) and [3H]inositol trisphosphate (6-fold) in this system. The accumulation of [3H]inositol bisphosphate and [3H]inositol trisphosphate was linear up to 8 min following an initial lag period of 1-2 min. Ethanol (300 mM) reduced the lag period for [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation at submaximal GTP[S] concentrations and caused a shift to the left (3-fold) in the dose-response curve. Other short chain alcohols, methanol (300 mM), 1-propanol (200 mM), and 1-butanol (50 mM) also enhanced the accumulation of [3H] inositol phosphates in the presence of submaximal GTP[S] concentrations. Receptor activation by the purinergic agonist adenosine 5'-[beta-thio]disphosphate (ADP[S]) (10 microM) also reduced the lag period for [3H] inositol phosphate formation and shifted the GTP[S] dose response to the left (10-fold). In addition, ADP[S] increased the response to maximal GTP[S] concentrations. The formation of [3H]inositol phosphates induced by GTP[S] was associated with a concomitant decrease in labeling of both [3H]phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and [3H]phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, but no decrease in [3H]phosphatidylinositol was observed. All of the alcohols tested enhanced the breakdown of [3H]polyphosphoinositides in the presence of GTP[S]. The dose response to guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imino]triphosphate for [3H]inositol phosphate formation was displaced to the left by ethanol (300 mM) and ADP[S] (10 microM) (2- and 7-fold), respectively. ADP[S] also enhanced the maximal response to guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imino]triphosphate. The [3H]inositol phosphate formation produced in response to NaF was unaffected by either ethanol or receptor activation. These results indicate that alcohols initiate an activation of phosphoinositidase C, mediated at the level of the regulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1486941268,"Abstract Phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (EC 2.7.1.78) proved incapable of catalyzing the phosphorylation of thymidylyl-(3'----5')-thymidine containing either a cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (d-T less than p greater than T) or a 6-4'-[pyrimidin-2'-one]pyrimidine photoproduct (d-T[p]-T), and similarly the UV-modified compounds of (dT)3 bearing either photoproduct at their 5'-end (d-T less than p greater than TpT and d-T[p]TpT). In contrast, the 3'-structural isomers of these trinucleotides (d-TpT less than p greater than T and d-TpT[p]T) were phosphorylated at the same rate as the parent compound. These phosphorylatable lesion-containing oligonucleotides are quantitatively released from UV-irradiated poly(dA):poly(dT) by enzymatic hydrolysis with snake venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase (Liuzzi, M., Weinfeld, M., and Paterson, M. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6355-6363). By combining this digestion regimen with phosphorylation by polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP, pyrimidine dimers were quantitated at the fmol level following exposure of poly(dA):poly(dT) and herring sperm DNA to biologically relevant UV fluences. The rate of dimer induction in the synthetic polymer, approximately 10 dimers/10(6) nucleotides/Jm-2, was in close agreement with that obtained by conventional methods. Dimers were induced at one-fourth of this rate in the natural DNA. Further treatment of the phosphorylated oligonucleotides derived from irradiated herring sperm DNA with nuclease P1 released the labeled 5'-nucleotide, thus permitting analysis of the nearest-neighbor bases 5' to the lesions. We observed a ratio for pyrimidine-to-purine bases of almost 6:1, implicating tripyrimidine stretches as hotspots for UV-induced DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1507002498,"Abstract Native FAD was removed from chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and replaced with a number of artificial flavins of different redox potential. Dithionite titration of the 2-thio-FAD- or 4-thio-FAD (high potential)-containing enzymes showed that the first center to be reduced was the flavin. With native enzyme, iron-sulfur centers are the first to be reduced. With the low potential flavin, 6-OH-FAD, the enzyme-bound flavin was the last center to be reduced in reductive titration with xanthine. These shifts in the reduction profile support the hypothesis that the distribution of reducing equivalents in multi-center oxidation-reduction enzymes of this type is determined by the relative potentials of the centers. The reaction of molecular oxygen with fully reduced 2-thio-FAD XDH or 4-thio-FAD XDH resulted in 5 electron eq being released in a fast phase and one in a slow phase. Reduction of these enzymes by xanthine was limited at a rate comparable to that for the release of urate from native XDH. Xanthine/O2 turnover with these enzymes (and native XDH) resulted in approximately 40-50% of the xanthine reducing equivalents appearing as superoxide. Steady state turnover experiments involving all modified flavin-containing enzymes, as well as native enzyme, showed that shifting the flavin potential either positive or negative relative to FAD caused a decrease in catalytic activity in the xanthine/NAD reductase reaction. In the case of the xanthine/O2 reductase activity, there is no simple obvious relationship between the activity and the redox potential of the reconstituted flavin."
https://openalex.org/W2106499562,"Abstract The effect of varying concentrations of free Ca2+ on the formation of Pi from mannose-6-P or of Pi and [U-14C]glucose from [U-14C]glucose-6-P was investigated in isolated fasted rat hepatocytes made permeable by freezing and in liver microsomes. Free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted by the use of Ca-EGTA buffers. In permeabilized cells, glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) activity was inhibited up to 50% and in intact microsomes up to 70% by increasing free Ca2+ concentrations from 0.01 to 10 microM. The inhibition was reversible and competitive with respect to glucose-6-P. Treatment of microsomes with 0.4% deoxycholate exposed 90% of latent mannose-6-phosphatase activity which was insensitive to Ca2+. The results indicate that Ca2+ affects the glucose-6-P translocase rather than the phosphohydrolase component. It is concluded that the glucose-6-phosphatase system is modulated by changes in Ca2+ concentrations in the range of those occurring in the liver cell upon hormonal stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1596558078,"Abstract The effect of adrenalectomy and triamcinolone treatment on mRNA encoding rat hepatic 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was studied. Adrenalectomy decreased both the kinase and the bisphosphatase activities of the bifunctional enzyme to about 30% of the values in livers of normal rats. Triamcinolone treatment restored both activities to normal by 24 h. These changes were caused by alterations in the concentration of the enzyme as determined by immunoblotting and by an assay that measures phosphoenzyme formation. Messenger RNA for liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was markedly decreased by adrenalectomy and was increased 15-fold by triamcinolone administration for 8 h. The rate of transcription of the bifunctional enzyme gene, measured in rat liver nuclei, was also decreased in adrenalectomy, and triamcinolone treatment increased this rate 5-fold within 8 h. Similarly, liver nuclear precursors of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase mRNA were decreased by adrenalectomy to 25% of the level in nuclei from normal rats. Triamcinolone treatment restored heterogeneous values by 2 h, while treatment for 30 h increased it 12-fold over the adrenalectomized levels. It was concluded that glucocorticoids regulate the expression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, at least in part, by modulating the transcription rate of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1502803010,"In granulocytes harvested from human blood, an elevation of the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions is by itself insufficient to activate the cell's respiratory burst. We report herein that, when granulocytes are primed by a 90-min preincubation with the recombinant human hemopoietic growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSFrh), elevation of the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ions ([Ca2+]i) becomes a more effective transduction signal capable of triggering the generation of substantial quantities of superoxide (O2-) anions by the cell. In these studies, we used four separate and independent maneuvers to induce elevation of [Ca2+]i: 1) depolarization of the cell's electrical potential through obliteration of the transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients; 2) acidification of the cytoplasm using propionic acid; 3) addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin; and 4) treatment of the cells with the monoclonal antibody to the C3bi receptor, PMN7C3. In all cases, elevation of [Ca2+]i through these manipulations resulted in the release of substantially greater quantities of O2- by GM-CSFrh-primed granulocytes than by unprimed, control cells. The generation of O2- was in all cases markedly reduced by chelation of either intracellular Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid or extracellular Ca2+ with [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. We conclude that during the process of GM-CSFrh priming, the metabolic assembly responsible for O2- anion production in the granulocyte becomes altered in such a way that a subsequent elevation in [Ca2+]i provides a potent signal for its activation."
https://openalex.org/W1739489546,"The orientation of the condensing enzyme, the beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase, and the trans-2-enoyl CoA reductase within the rat liver microsomal membrane was investigated by the use of impermeant inhibitors of enzyme activity: trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, mercury-dextran, and anti-beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase IgG. The activity of the condensing enzyme was inhibited more than 70% by various proteases and was completely inhibited by 80 microM mercury-dextran. Similar results were obtained for the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity. On the other hand, in the absence of detergent, proteases inhibited beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase activity by 25-40%, while in the presence of detergent the inhibition increased to 65-90%. Furthermore, anti-beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase IgG, which in the absence of detergent produced no inhibition, in the presence of detergent inhibited beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase activity by more than 80%; under identical conditions, preimmune IgG caused a 13% inhibition. Microsomes used throughout this study displayed greater than 90% latency with respect to mannose-6-phosphatase activity, indicating that the microsomes were intact. Latency was not affected by the proteases, by mercury-dextran, or by the presence of the enzyme assay components. These results suggest that both the condensing enzyme and the reductase are present on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, whereas the beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase is embedded in the microsomal membrane."

https://openalex.org/W97386182,"Abstract Normal diploid human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI-38) produce type I collagen of chain composition [alpha 1(1)]2.alpha 2(1) together with small amounts of type III collagen. We have examined the synthesis and secretion of type I collagen in a clone of SV40-transformed WI-38 fibroblasts (SVWI-38). These cells produced only 20-25% of the total collagen synthesized by their normal counterparts, with no detectable synthesis of alpha 2(1) chains and deposited a type I trimer consisting of overmodified alpha 1(1) chains. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cyanogen bromide peptides of collagens isolated from cells cultured either in the presence or absence of alpha,alpha-dipyridyl revealed that this overmodification occurred along the entire length of the alpha 1(1) chains. Analysis of poly(A+) RNA by Northern blot analysis and total RNA by slot blot analysis using cloned type I procollagen cDNA probes revealed that no alpha 2(1) mRNA was present in the SVWI-38 cells. Primer extension of the RNA confirmed this finding. The SVWI-38 cells had a normal chromosome number, but contained 28 normal and 18 abnormal and marker chromosomes. Restriction mapping of the entire alpha 2(1) procollagen gene did not reveal any gross deletions or insertions within this gene, nor was the gene hypermethylated in the transformed cells, when compared with their normal counterparts. One interesting feature, however, was the fact that certain CpG dinucleotides in the alpha 2(1) gene were methylated in the normal as well as the transformed cells. These SV40-transformed WI-38 fibroblasts therefore do not produce any alpha 2(1) collagen chains due to transcriptional inactivation of their genes."

The activity of the highly purified protamine kinase was unaffected by cyclic AMP (up to 0.1 mM), cyclic GMP (up to 0.1 mM), the heat-stable protein inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (up to 100 micrograms/ml), heparin (up to 100 micrograms/ml), EGTA (up to 1 mM), Ca2+ (up to 1 mM), calmodulin (up to 0.5 microM) in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (0.05 mM), and phosphatidylserine (up to 40 micrograms/ml) and/or diolein (up to 1 microgram/ml) in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (up to 0.5 mM). Experiments in which extracts of kidney cytosol were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and MgCl2 revealed that the phosphorylation of numerous polypeptides was markedly increased in the presence of the purified protamine kinase.

https://openalex.org/W1549352310,"Radiation inactivation analysis was utilized to estimate the sizes of the units catalyzing the various activities of hepatic microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase. This technique revealed that the target molecular weights for mannose-6-P phosphohydrolase, glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase, and carbamyl-P:glucose phosphotransferase activities were all about Mr 75,000. These results are consistent with the widely held view that all of these activities are catalyzed by the same protein or proteins. Certain observations indicate that the molecular organization of microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase is better described by the conformational hypothesis which envisions the enzyme as a single covalent structure rather than by the substrate transport model which requires the participation of several physically separate polypeptides. These include the findings: (1) that the target sizes for glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase and carbamyl-P:glucose phosphotransferase activities were not larger than that for mannose-6-P phosphohydrolase in intact microsomes and (2) that the target size for glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase in disrupted microsomes was not less than that observed in intact microsomes. These findings are most consistent with a model for glucose-6-phosphatase of a single polypeptide or a disulfide-linked dimer which spans the endoplasmic reticulum with the various activities of this multifunctional enzyme residing in distinct protein domains."
https://openalex.org/W1525717008,"Fructose-6-P binding sites of rat liver and bovine heart Fru-6-P,2-kinase: Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase were investigated with an affinity labeling reagent, N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate. The rat liver enzyme was inactivated 97% by the reagent in 60 min, and the rate of inactivation followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The bovine heart enzyme was inactivated 90% within 60 min, but the inactivation rate followed pseudo-first order up to 80% inactivation and then became nonlinear. The presence of fructose-6-P retarded the extent of the inactivation to approximately 40% in 60 min. In order to determine the amino acid sequence of the fructose-6-P binding site, both enzymes were reacted with N-bromo[14C]acetylethanolamine-P and digested with trypsin; radiolabeled tryptic peptides were isolated and sequenced. A single 14C-labeled peptide was isolated from the rat liver enzyme, and the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined as Lys-Gln-Cys-Ala-Leu- Ala- Ala-Leu-Lys. A major and two minor peptides were isolated from bovine heart enzyme whose amino acid sequences were Lys-Gln-Cys-Ala-Leu-Val-Ala-Leu-Lys, Arg-Ile-Glu-Cys-Tyr-Lys, and Ile-Glu-Cys-Tyr-Lys, respectively. In all cases, N-bromoacetylethanolamine-P had alkylated the cysteine residues. The amount of bromo[14C]acetylethanolamine-P incorporated into rat liver and beef heart was 1.3 mol/mol of subunit and 2.1 mol/mol of subunit, respectively, and the incorporations in the presence of Fru-6-P were reduced to 0.34 mol/mol of subunit and 0.9 mol/mol of subunit, respectively. Thus, the main fructose-6-P binding site of rat liver and bovine heart enzymes was identical except for a single amino acid substitution of valine for alanine in the latter enzyme. This peptide corresponded to residues 105 to 113 from the N terminus of the known amino acid sequence of rat liver enzyme, but since the complete sequence of bovine heart enzyme is not known, the location of the same peptide in the heart enzyme cannot be assigned."
https://openalex.org/W1485844178,"Abstract In the photosystem I of thylakoid membranes, the photoinduced electron transfer involves three iron-sulfur centers, A, B, and X. Among them, center X is characterized by very unusual spectroscopic and redox properties. Recent arguments have been presented in favor of a [2Fe-2S] structure for the clusters implicated in this center, but the number of these clusters is still a controversial question. By using an original EPR method, based on the differences in the relaxation properties of A, B, and X, we have determined the stoichiometry for the iron-sulfur clusters in photosystem I. Our measurements indicate that center X is composed of a single iron-sulfur cluster per P700. The possible implications of this result for the polypeptide composition of the core reaction center are discussed."
