In vitro, thiazolidinediones promote adipocyte differentiation of preadipocyte and mesenchymal stem cell lines; however, the molecular basis for this adipogenic effect has remained unclear. Here, we report that thiazolidinediones are potent and selective activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily recently shown to function in adipogenesis. The most potent of these agents, BRL49653, binds to PPARγ with a Kd of approximately 40 nM. Treatment of pluripotent C3H10T1/2 stem cells with BRL49653 results in efficient differentiation to adipocytes. These data are the first demonstration of a high affinity PPAR ligand and provide strong evidence that PPARγ is a molecular target for the adipogenic effects of thiazolidinediones. Furthermore, these data raise the intriguing possibility that PPARγ is a target for the therapeutic actions of this class of compounds.

INTRODUCTIONAdipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a critical role in energy homeostasis. Their primary role is to store triglycerides in times of caloric excess and to mobilize this reserve during periods of nutritional deprivation. Adipocytes are derived from a multipotent stem cell of mesodermal origin that also gives rise to the muscle and cartilage lineages. Studies of the adipocyte differentiation program have been facilitated by the availability of established mesenchymal and preadipocyte cell lines that can be induced to differentiate upon treatment with mixtures of hormonal stimulants (reviewed in Ref. 1Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).Adipocyte differentiation is characterized by a coordinate increase in adipocyte-specific gene expression. In most cases, these increases can be accounted for by activation of gene transcription. Thus, considerable effort has been focused on the identification of transcription factors that regulate adipocyte-specific genes. Recently, an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, designated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ),1( 1The abbreviations used are: PPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γNIDDMnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusDME mediumDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasetkthymidine kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferase.) was shown to be expressed in an adipose-specific manner and its expression induced early during the course of differentiation of several preadipocyte cell lines (2Tontonoz P. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 3Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that forced expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts resulted in adipocyte differentiation; this differentiation was significantly enhanced in the presence of weak PPARγ activators (4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that PPARγ plays a pivotal role in the adipogenic signaling cascade.PPARγ is one of a subfamily of PPARs encoded by independent genes (5Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). To date, three mammalian PPARs, designated PPARα, PPARγ, and NUC-1, have been identified (6Isseman I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt A.

Commun. 1993; 196: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PPARs regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequence elements termed PPAR response elements. PPAR response elements have been identified in the regulatory regions of a number of genes encoding enzymes that modulate lipid metabolism, indicating a physiological role for the PPAR family in the regulation of lipid homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 11Keller H. Wahli W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 291-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PPARs have been shown to be activated to various degrees by micromolar concentrations of long-chain fatty acids and a structurally diverse group of compounds termed peroxisome proliferators that includes the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs (5Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 6Isseman I. Green S.

However, as no binding of these compounds to the PPARs has been reported, PPARs have remained “orphan” receptors.To further examine the role of PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation, we sought to identify activators of PPARγ. We report here that a class of compounds, termed thiazolidinediones (13Colca J.R. Morton D.R. Bailey C.J. Flatt P.R. New Antidiabetic Drugs. Smith-Gordon, New York1990: 255-261Google Scholar), are PPARγ-selective ligands. Thiazolidinediones are known to have marked adipogenic effects on preadipocyte and mesenchymal stem cells in vitro(14Hiragun A. Sato M. Mitsui H. J. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 37: 3977-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Our data provide strong evidence that PPARγ is the molecular target for the adipogenic effects of thiazolidinediones and, furthermore, suggest that PPARγ may be the target for the antidiabetic actions of this class of compounds.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsGAL4-PPAR chimera expression constructs contain the translation initiation sequence and amino acids 1-76 of the glucocorticoid receptor fused to amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, including the DNA binding domain, in the pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene). cDNAs encoding amino acids 167-468, 138-440, and 174-475 of murine PPARα, NUC-1, and PPARγ1 (ref. 8Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted C-terminal to GAL4 in the pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene) to generate plasmids pSG5-GAL4-PPARα, pSG5-GAL4-NUC-1, and pSG5-GAL4-PPARγ, respectively. The regions of the PPARs included in the chimeras should contain the ligand binding domains based on their homology to ligand binding domains of characterized nuclear receptors (19Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 20Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar). The chimeras initially contained the translation start site and N-terminal 262 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor, including the τ1 transcriptional transactivation domain (21Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, as these chimeras had high basal activity in CV-1 cells, a 0.6-kilobase BglII fragment containing the τ1 domain was removed, leaving the translation start site and amino acids 1-76 of the glucocorticoid receptor. Wild-type receptor expression vectors were generated by insertion of cDNAs encoding murine PPARα, NUC-1, PPARγ1, and PPARγ2 into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). Reporter plasmid (UAS)5-tk-CAT was generated by insertion of five copies of a GAL4 DNA binding element into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 (Ref. 22Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The reporter aP2-tk-CAT was generated by insertion of the 518-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment containing the enhancer of the aP2 gene (23Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2.Cotransfection AssayCV-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates in DME medium supplemented with 10% delipidated fetal calf serum. In general, transfection mixes contained 10 ng of receptor expression vector, 100 ng of the reporter plasmid, 200 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110, Pharmacia) as internal control, and 200 ng of carrier plasmid. Transfections were done with Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (24Hussman M. Lehmann J. Hoffman B. Hermann T. Tzukerman M. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4097-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Ligand Binding AssaycDNA encoding amino acids 174-475 of PPARγ1 was amplified via polymerase chain reaction and inserted into bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). GST-PPARγ LBD was expressed in BL21(DE3)plysS cells and extracts prepared as described previously (25Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). For saturation binding analysis, bacterial extracts (100 μg of protein) were incubated at 4°C for 3 h in buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol with [3H]-BRL49653 (specific activity, 40 Ci/mmol) (18Cantello B.C.C.

Bound was separated from free radioactivity by elution through 1-ml Sephadex G-25 desalting columns (Boehringer Mannheim). Bound radioactivity eluted in the column void volume and was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting.Adipocyte Differentiation AssayC3H10T1/2 cells were grown in a 24-well plate in DME medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Medium and compound were exchanged every 3 days. Cells were stained at day 7 with Oil Red O and photographed.Northern AnalysisC3H10T1/2 cells were grown in 225-mm flasks in DME medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Medium was exchanged every 3rd day and fresh compound added. Cells were harvested on day 7 and poly(A)+ RNA prepared using the PolyATract® system 1000 (Promega).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThiazolidinediones are Selective Activators of PPARγ-A transient cotransfection assay was used to screen for PPARγ activators. As mammalian cell lines contain endogenous nuclear receptors that can complicate interpretation of the results, we used an established chimera system (26Webster N.G.J. Green S. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 199-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Chimeras were constructed that fused the putative ligand binding domains of the three murine PPAR subtypes (α, γ, NUC-1) to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4. The structural organization of the GAL4-PPAR chimeras is shown schematically in Fig. 1A.Expression plasmids for the GAL4-PPAR chimeras were cotransfected into CV-1 cells with a reporter construct containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site upstream of the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression. As previously reported, all three PPAR subtypes were activated by high concentrations of the peroxisome proliferator Wy14,643 (Fig. 1B) (5Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 6Isseman I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 12Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Whereas the PPARα-GAL4 chimera was activated in the presence of 1 × 10-5 M Wy14,643, activation of the PPARγ and NUC-1 chimeras required 1 × 10-4 M Wy14,643 (Fig. 1B). Using this assay, we identified four compounds that were efficacious activators of the GAL4-PPARγ chimera at a concentration of 1 × 10-5 M, yet had little or no activity on either the GAL4-PPARα or GAL4-NUC-1 chimeras (Fig. 1B), even when concentrations as high as 1 × 10-4 M were used (data not shown). These chemicals failed to activate a control chimera that lacked a ligand binding domain (data not shown). Interestingly, these four compounds, termed BRL49653, pioglitazone, ciglitazone, and englitazone, fall into a class of structurally related antidiabetic agents designated thiazolidinediones (Fig. 1C).The effects of the thiazolidinediones on wild-type PPARγ were examined next. Two isoforms of PPARγ, termed PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, have been identified and shown to differ in their amino termini (2Tontonoz P. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 8Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Commun. 1993; 196: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the two PPARγ isoforms were cotransfected into CV-1 cells with a reporter plasmid containing the enhancer of the adipocyte-specific aP2 gene driving expression of the tk-CAT construct. The aP2 enhancer has previously been shown to contain two PPARγ response elements and to confer responsiveness to pioglitazone (2Tontonoz P. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 27Harris P.K.W. Kletzien R.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 439-445PubMed Google Scholar). Both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were activated by BRL49653 and pioglitazone in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 2). Interestingly, although the half-maximal concentration of activation with pioglitazone was 4 × 10-7 M for both PPARγ isoforms, the EC50 with BRL49653 was 3 × 10-8 M and 1 × 10-7 M for the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, the two PPARγ isoforms have distinct activation profiles. Ciglitazone and englitazone, although less potent, also activated both PPARγ isoforms (Fig. 2). No significant activation of wild-type PPARα or NUC-1 was seen in the presence of 1 × 10-5 M of the thiazolidinediones (data not shown). Likewise, the thiazolidinediones failed to activate other nuclear receptors including the human retinoic acid receptor α and the human thyroid hormone receptor β (data not shown). Thus, the thiazolidinediones are potent and selective activators of PPARγ.Fig. 2Thiazolidinediones activate wild-type PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for PPARγ1 (A) or PPARγ2 (B) and reporter plasmid aP2-tk-CAT. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of BRL49653 (open diamonds), pioglitazone (open triangles), ciglitazone (closed squares), and englitazone (stars), and cell extracts subsequently assayed for CAT activity. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thiazolidinedione BRL49653 Is a High Affinity PPARγ LigandAlthough it has been shown that members of the PPAR subfamily of nuclear receptors are activated by micromolar concentrations of fatty acids and hypolipidemic drugs such as clofibric acid and Wy14,643, none of these compounds have been shown to interact directly with the PPARs (5Dreyer C.

To test for binding of BRL49653 to PPARγ, the region extending from the end of the conserved DNA binding domain to the C terminus of PPARγ, which includes the putative ligand binding domain (LBD) (19Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 20Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar), was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST-PPARγ LBD). Radiolabeled BRL49653 bound specifically and saturably to GST-PPARγ LBD with a Kd of 43 nM (Fig. 3, A and B). No binding was detected in control extracts from bacteria expressing glutathione S-transferase (data not shown). Consistent with the dose-response data for PPARγ in the transient transfection assay, BRL49653 was the most effective competitor for binding of tritiated BRL49653 to GST-PPARγ LBD, followed by pioglitazone (Fig. 3C). Ciglitazone and englitazone also competed for binding of tritiated BRL49653 to GST-PPARγ LBD, albeit less efficiently than pioglitazone (Fig. 3C). Thus, all four thiazolidinediones bound directly to PPARγ. In control experiments, dexamethasone failed to compete with tritiated BRL49653 for binding to PPARγ (Fig. 3C). These data represent the first description of PPAR ligands and demonstrate that PPARγ is a bona fide member of the steroid/thyroid hormone/retinoid family of ligand-activated transcription factors.Fig. 3The thiazolidinedione BRL49653 binds PPARγ with high affinity. A, bacterial extracts containing the glutathione S-transferase-PPARγ ligand binding domain fusion protein (GST-PPARγLBD) were incubated with increasing concentrations of tritiated BRL49643 in the absence (total binding; closed circles) or presence (nonspecific binding; closed squares) of a 500-fold excess of nontritiated BRL49653. Specific binding of tritiated BRL49653 to GST-PPARγLBD is indicated (open triangles). B, Scatchard analysis. Specific binding of BRL49653 in A was transformed by Scatchard analysis and plotted. Linear regression yielded a K of 43 nM. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments performed in duplicate. C, competition binding analysis was performed with GST-PPARγLBD and 10 nM tritiated BRL49653 in the presence of a 100-, 500-, or 2500-fold excess of unlabeled BRL49653 (closed squares), pioglitazone (open squares), englitazone (closed circles), ciglitazone (open circles), or dexamethasone (closed triangles).

Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 3Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that ectopic expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts induces the entire adipocyte differentiation program as measured by lipid accumulation and induction of adipocyte-specific genes (4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate a causal role for PPARγ in adipogenesis. To test for an effect of a PPARγ-selective ligand on adipogenesis, we treated pluripotent C3H10T1/2 stem cells with BRL49653. Untreated C3H10T1/2 cells express PPARγ as demonstrated by Northern analysis (Fig. 4C). Treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with BRL49653 resulted in efficient adipocyte differentiation as judged by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 4, A and B) and Northern analysis using the adipocyte-specific markers aP2 and adipsin (Fig. 4C). PPARγ expression levels were increased approximately 3-fold in response to treatment with BRL49653 (Fig. 4C). Significant adipocyte differentiation was seen at concentrations of BRL49653 as low as 1 × 10-7 M (data not shown). These data provide evidence that ligand-mediated activation of PPARγ is sufficient to initiate the adipogenic signaling cascade in a mesenchymal stem cell line. Furthermore, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the reported adipogenic effects of several thiazolidinediones on preadipocyte cell lines (14Hiragun A. Sato M. Mitsui H. J. Cell.

Morton D.R. Bailey C.J. Flatt P.R. New Antidiabetic Drugs. Smith-Gordon, New York1990: 255-261Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PPARγ may be a target for the antidiabetic effects of these agents. How might activation of an adipocyte-specific transcription factor account for these diverse therapeutic effects? In recent years there has been a growing awareness that NIDDM is not only a derangement of glucose homeostasis, but is also characterized by elevated levels of circulating lipids. Although the mechanism is poorly characterized, increases in lipid levels have been shown to interfere with glucose disposal (reviewed in Ref. 28McGarry J.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55S: 29-38Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of PPARγ in adipose may affect glucose usage in other tissues such as skeletal muscle, the primary site of glucose disposal, through an indirect mechanism involving modulation of lipid levels. Alternatively, activation of PPARγ may regulate signaling molecules secreted by adipose such as tumor necrosis factor-α or the ob gene product (29Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11631) Google Scholar, 30Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These secreted products could, in turn, modulate glucose metabolism in other tissues.In summary, our demonstration that an adipogenic thiazolidinedione is a high affinity ligand for PPARγ provides compelling evidence that this nuclear receptor plays a critical role in adipogenesis. Clearly, an understanding of the PPARγ signaling cascade may lead to insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating energy homeostasis and the defects underlying obesity and NIDDM. INTRODUCTIONAdipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a critical role in energy homeostasis. Their primary role is to store triglycerides in times of caloric excess and to mobilize this reserve during periods of nutritional deprivation. Adipocytes are derived from a multipotent stem cell of mesodermal origin that also gives rise to the muscle and cartilage lineages. Studies of the adipocyte differentiation program have been facilitated by the availability of established mesenchymal and preadipocyte cell lines that can be induced to differentiate upon treatment with mixtures of hormonal stimulants (reviewed in Ref. 1Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).Adipocyte differentiation is characterized by a coordinate increase in adipocyte-specific gene expression. In most cases, these increases can be accounted for by activation of gene transcription. Thus, considerable effort has been focused on the identification of transcription factors that regulate adipocyte-specific genes. Recently, an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, designated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ),1( 1The abbreviations used are: PPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γNIDDMnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusDME mediumDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCATchlo"

Animals overexpressing beta ARK1 demonstrated attenuation of isoproterenol-stimulated left ventricular contractility in vivo, dampening of myocardial adenylyl cyclase activity, and reduced functional coupling of beta-adrenergic receptors. Conversely, mice expressing the beta ARK inhibitor displayed enhanced cardiac contractility in vivo with or without isoproterenol. These animals demonstrate the important role of beta ARK in modulating in vivo myocardial function. Because increased amounts of beta ARK1 and diminished cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness characterize heart failure, these animals may provide experimental models to study the role of beta ARK in heart disease."

https://openalex.org/W2077941693,"Neural ensemble processing of sensorimotor information during behavior was investigated by simultaneously recording up to 48 single neurons at multiple relays of the rat trigeminal somatosensory system. Cortical, thalamic, and brainstem neurons exhibited widespread 7- to 12-hertz synchronous oscillations, which began during attentive immobility and reliably predicted the imminent onset of rhythmic whisker twitching. Each oscillatory cycle began as a traveling wave of neural activity in the cortex that then spread to the thalamus. Just before the onset of rhythmic whisker twitching, the oscillations spread to the spinal trigeminal brainstem complex. Thereafter, the oscillations at all levels were synchronous with whisker protraction. Neural structures manifesting these rhythms also exhibited distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal ensemble activity in response to tactile stimulation. Thus, multilevel synchronous activity in this system may encode not only sensory information but also the onset and temporal domain of tactile exploratory movements."
https://openalex.org/W2059293195,"In higher eukaryotes, the polypyrimidine-tract (Py-tract) adjacent to the 3′ splice site is recognized by several proteins, including the essential splicing factor U2AF65, the splicing regulator Sex-lethal (Sxl), and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), whose function is unknown. Iterative in vitro genetic selection was used to show that these proteins have distinct sequence preferences. The uridine-rich degenerate sequences selected by U2AF65 are similar to those present in the diverse array of natural metazoan Py-tracts. In contrast, the Sxl-consensus is a highly specific sequence, which can help explain the ability of Sxl to regulate splicing of transformer pre-mRNA and autoregulate splicing of its own pre-mRNA. The PTB-consensus is not a typical Py-tract; it can be found in certain alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs that undergo negative regulation. Here it is shown that PTB can regulate alternative splicing by selectively repressing 3′ splice sites that contain a PTB-binding site."

These additions increased the content of acetyl CoA by 9- to 18-fold, increased the contents of metabolites of the first third of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle 2- to 5-fold, and decreased succinate, oxaloacetate, and aspartate 2- to 3-fold. Succinyl CoA, fumarate, and malate were essentially unchanged. The changes in content of TCA metabolites resulted from a reduction of the free mitochondrial NAD couple by 2- to 10-fold and oxidation of the mitochondrial coenzyme Q couple by 2- to 4-fold. Cytosolic pH, measured using 31P-NMR spectra, was invariant at about 7.0. The total intracellular bicarbonate indicated an increase in mitochondrial pH from 7.1 with glucose to 7.2, 7.5 and 7.4 with insulin, ketones, and the combination, respectively. The decrease in Eh7 of the mitochondrial NAD couple, Eh7NAD+/NADH, from -280 to -300 mV and the increase in Eh7 of the coenzyme Q couple, Eh7Q/QH2, from -4 to +12 mV was equivalent to an increase from -53 kJ to -60 kJ/2 mol e in the reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (EC 1.6.5.3). The increase in the redox energy of the mitochondrial cofactor couples paralleled the increase in the free energy of cytosolic ATP hydrolysis, delta GATP. The potential of the mitochondrial relative to the cytosolic phases, Emito/cyto, calculated from delta GATP and delta pH on the assumption of a 4 H+ transfer for each ATP synthesized, was -143 mV during perfusion with glucose or glucose plus insulin, and decreased to -120 mV on addition of ketones. Viewed in this light, the moderate ketosis characteristic of prolonged fasting or type II diabetes appears to be an elegant compensation for the defects in mitochondrial energy transduction associated with acute insulin deficiency or mitochondrial senescence."

INTRODUCTIONNucleotide excision repair (NER)1( 1The abbreviations used are: NERnucleotide excision repairPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRPAreplication protein AATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)AAFN-acetoxy-2-aminoacetylfluorene.) represents the most important cellular mechanism for the removal of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified seven genes, RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4, RAD10, RAD14, and RAD25, that are essential for NER (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To begin to define the biological roles of these genes, we have purified their encoded proteins from yeast and characterized their biochemical activities. This undertaking has allowed us to infer the involvement of these proteins in different steps of the incision process, viz. in damage recognition, in DNA unwinding, and in dual incision of the damaged DNA strand. Rad14 is a zinc metalloprotein with an affinity for UV-damaged DNA (2Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rad3 is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, and it also has DNA helicase and DNA·RNA helicase activities (3Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rad3 exhibits a preference for binding UV-damaged DNA that is dependent upon ATP and the degree of negative superhelicity in DNA (6Sung P. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8303-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rad25 also possesses a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities (7Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rad1 and Rad10 exist as a complex in vivo, and complex formation between these proteins is essential for their biological action (8Bailly V. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rad1 and Rad10 together comprise a DNA endonuclease (9Sung P. Reynolds P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 366: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Another level of complexity in understanding the biological roles of NER genes was introduced from the observation that in addition to their requirement in NER, RAD3 and RAD25 are also essential for cell viability (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Studies of temperature-sensitive conditional lethal mutations of these genes have indicated that both are essential for RNA polymerase II transcription (7Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L.

Studies with the rad3 and rad25 mutants defective in ATPase/DNA helicase activities have indicated that whereas Rad3 ATPase/helicase activity is required for NER, the Rad25 ATPase/helicase is essential for both NER and polymerase II transcription (7Guzder S.

Because of the amenability of S. cerevisiae to genetic and biochemical analyses, development of such a system is essential for a detailed understanding of processes that effect different steps of NER, including transcription-coupled DNA repair. Various yeast protein factors that have been implicated in NER in genetic and biochemical studies have now been purified to near homogeneity in our laboratory. Here, we present our results, which indicate that the incision step of NER can be accomplished by combining the following highly purified protein components: Rad14, Rad4-Rad23 complex, Rad1-Rad10 complex, Rad2, RPA, and TFIIH. The damage-specific incision reaction has a strict dependence on ATP, and our results imply that the two incision nicks are made in a highly coordinated fashion.MATERIALS AND METHODSUV Irradiation and AAF Treatment of Plasmid DNAReplicative form M13 mp18 DNA (~90% supercoiled form) was purified from infected Escherichia coli strain JM101 by two rounds of cesium chloride banding. The DNA, at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 mM EDTA), was irradiated in 15-μl droplets for 60 s with a germicidal lamp emitting at 254 nm and a fluence rate of 5 J/m2/s to introduce ~2.5 photoproducts/1000 base pairs of DNA. For treatment with N-acetoxy-2-aminoacetylfluorene (AAF), the plasmid DNA, 10 μg or 30 nmol of nucleotides, was incubated at 37°C for 12 h in the dark with 0.5 nmol of AAF in 200 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8. After extraction with diethyl ether, the DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and redissolved in TE to 100 μg/ml.Reconstitution of NER in Vitro(i) In the incision assay, reaction mixtures (10 μl, final volume) were assembled in buffer R (45 mM K-HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 8 mM MgCl2, bovine serum albumin at 120 μg/ml, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 30 mM creatine phosphate and 200 ng of creatine kinase, and 60 mM potassium acetate and 20 mM KCl that were due to addition of the various NER protein factors) and contained 100 ng of TFIIH, 50 ng of RPA, 8 ng of Rad1-Rad10 complex, 10 ng of Rad2 protein, 20 ng of Rad4-Rad23 complex, and 10 ng of Rad14 protein. The Rad1-Rad10 complex for use in these studies was formed by incubating equimolar amounts of purified Rad1 and Rad10 proteins for 24 h on ice in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin to give a final concentration of 1 μM of the protein complex. The combination of NER factors were incubated at 25°C for 5 min before the undamaged DNA or damaged DNA, 100 ng each, was added in 1 μl. After incubation at 30°C for 10 min, SDS and proteinase K were added to 0.5% and 200 μg/ml, respectively, followed by a 5-min incubation at 37°C to deproteinize the reaction mixtures. Samples were run in 0.8% agarose gels in TAE buffer (20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA). The gels were treated with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml in H2O) to stain DNA, soaked in a large volume of water to reduce background staining, and then photographed through a red filter.(ii) For the excision assay, reaction mixtures (50 μl, final volume) were assembled in buffer R and contained 500 ng of TFIIH, 250 ng of RPA, 40 ng of Rad1-Rad10 complex, 50 ng of Rad2, 100 ng of Rad4-Rad23 complex, and 50 ng of Rad14. The combination of NER proteins was incubated at 25°C for 5 min before 1 μg of undamaged or UV-damaged DNA was added in 10 μl of TE. The complete reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 60 min and then deproteinized by extraction with an equal volume of buffered phenol. The DNA was precipitated by ethanol and redissolved in 10 μl of TE, and 5 μl of which was treated with 7.5 units of calf thymus terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim) with 5 μCi of [α-32P]dideoxy ATP (Amersham Corp.; 5000 Ci/mmol) for 60 min at 37°C in a final volume of 20 μl of the buffer supplied by the vendor. The labeling mixtures were deproteinized by treatment with 0.5% SDS and 300 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min at 37°C, followed by the precipitation of the DNA. The pellets were dissolved in 4 μl of buffer and analyzed on 15% sequencing gels. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak Bio Max MR) to reveal the excision DNA fragments.RESULTSPurification of NER FactorsRad10 protein was purified ~1,000-fold to near homogeneity (Fig. 1B, lane1) from yeast strain CMY135 harboring the overproducing plasmid pSUC8 as described (22Sung P.

Rad1 protein was purified ~2,000-fold to near homogeneity (Fig. 1C, lane1) from yeast strain CMY135 harboring the overproducing plasmid pRR168 as described previously (9Sung P. Reynolds P. Prakash L.

Rad2 protein was purified ~3,000-fold to near homogeneity (Fig. 1C, lane2) from yeast strain LY2 harboring the overproducing plasmid pR2.26 as described (11Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1993; 366: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To overproduce the RAD4-encoded protein in yeast for purification, the protein coding frame of RAD4 was fused to the yeast ADC1 promoter to yield plasmid pR4.1, which was introduced into yeast strain YRP11. The scheme presented in Fig. 1A was used to purify Rad4 protein ~4,000-fold to near homogeneity (Fig. 1C, lane3) from YRP11(pR4.1). The elution of Rad4 protein from various chromatographic matrices was monitored by immunoblotting using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against an insoluble form of Rad4 protein expressed in insect cells with the use of baculovirus (data not shown). Rad4 protein has a predicted molecular mass of 87 kDa (24Gietz R.D. Prakash S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), we have verified that this 57-kDa species was indeed Rad23 protein. Because in wild type yeast Rad23 is more abundant than Rad4 (25Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), only overproduction of Rad4 was necessary to purify the Rad4-Rad23 complex (Fig. 1C, lane3). TFIIH was purified >10,000-fold to near homogeneity (Fig. 1D) from yeast strain YPH/TFB1.6HIS that contains a 6-histidine tag in the TFB1 subunit of TFIIH (26Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as outlined in Fig. 1A. During purification, the elution of TFIIH from various chromatographic matrices was monitored by immunoblotting using affinity-purified antibodies specific for the Rad3, Rad25, TFB1, and SSL1 subunits (23Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The TFIIH preparation used in this study contained six subunits, Rad25, Rad3, TFB1, SSL1, p55, and p38 (Fig. 1D). RPA, consisting of three subunits of 69, 36, and 13 kDa, was purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1B, lane3) from yeast strain LP2749-9B using the procedure of Brill and Stillman (27Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).ATP-dependent Incision of UV-damaged DNATo examine whether the purified yeast factors Rad14, Rad4-Rad23 complex, Rad1-Rad10 complex, Rad2, RPA, and TFIIH are sufficient for reconstituting NER in vitro, they were incubated at 30°C in buffer containing ATP with plasmid DNA previously irradiated with UV light to introduce photoproducts into the DNA. Reaction mixtures were deproteinized and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by staining with ethidium bromide to examine the fate of the DNA substrate. Fig. 2A shows that when all the purified NER factors were present, greater than 80% of the UV-damaged supercoiled plasmid DNA was converted to the open circular form (lane4), indicating that incision of the damaged DNA had occurred. By contrast, plasmid DNA that had not been subjected to UV treatment was not acted on by the same protein factors (Fig. 2A, lane2). Thus, the combination of NER proteins carries out an incision reaction that is highly specific for UV damage. Importantly, omission of any of the components Rad1-Rad10 complex, Rad2, Rad14, Rad4-Rad23 complex, TFIIH, or RPA from the reaction mixture abolished the formation of the open circular form (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-10), indicating that incision of UV-damaged DNA requires all of these purified protein factors. It is of particular interest that nicking of the UV-damaged DNA did not occur when either the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease or the Rad2 endonuclease was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 2A, lanes5 and 6). This observation strongly suggests that both the Rad1-Rad10 complex and the Rad2 protein, in addition to being the endonucleolytic components, have a pivotal role in the proper assembly of the incision enzyme complex at the damage site, thus ensuring that the two incision nicks are made in a coordinated fashion.Fig. 2ATP-dependent incision of UV-damaged DNA.

One of the aforementioned NER factors was absent in the reaction mixtures in lanes 5-10 that contained UV-damaged DNA and ATP; Rad1-Rad10 complex was omitted in lane 5, Rad2 was omitted in lane6, Rad14 was omitted in lane7, Rad4-Rad23 complex was omitted in lane8, TFIIH was omitted in lane9, and RPA was omitted in lane10, as indicated at the top of the figure.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), it was of considerable importance to determine whether the incision of damaged DNA in our reconstituted system requires ATP. We found that in the absence of ATP, the incision of UV-damaged DNA does not occur (Fig. 2B, compare lanes4 and 5). Whereas dATP is as effective as ATP in promoting the incision reaction, ADP, CTP, GTP, and UTP are inactive (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS is also inactive (Fig. 2B, lane8), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is in fact required for the incision reaction. Furthermore, Mg2+ is also required for incision (data not shown).Incision of DNA Damaged by AAFThe NER machinery has specificity for a variety of DNA lesions. We examined whether our purified NER proteins would also incise DNA damaged by N-acetoxy-2-aminoacetylfluorene. As shown in Fig. 3A, plasmid DNA containing the AAF adduct was incised when all the purified protein factors were present (lane4) but not when any of the factors was omitted from the reaction mixture (lanes 5-10). The incision of AAF-modified DNA also has a specific requirement for ATP or dATP (Fig. 3B). ATPγS did not promote incision (Fig. 3B), again suggesting a requirement for ATP hydrolysis in the repair of AAF-damaged DNA.Fig. 3ATP-dependent incision of DNA containing AAF adducts. A, the NER factors incise AAF-containing DNA. The undamaged DNA (lane2) or damaged DNA (lane4) was incubated with the Rad1-Rad10 complex, Rad2, Rad4-Rad23 complex, Rad14, TFIIH, and RPA at 30°C for 10 min in buffer containing ATP. The reaction mixtures in lanes 5-10 contained AAF-damaged DNA and ATP, but one of the NER factors was omitted; Rad1-Rad10 complex was absent in lane5, Rad2 was absent in lane6, Rad14 was absent in lane7, Rad4-Rad23 complex was absent in lane8, TFIIH was absent in lane9, and RPA was absent in lane10.

Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To detect the excision DNA fragment, we incubated plasmid DNA damaged by UV light in the reconstituted repair system. Following phenol extraction to remove repair proteins, the DNA was purified and treated with calf thymus terminal transferase in the presence of [α-32P]dideoxy ATP to label any excision DNA fragments that might have been generated. As shown in Fig. 4, a series of DNA fragments ranging in size from 25 to 28 nucleotides was detected in the reaction mixture that contained UV-damaged DNA as substrate (lane5) but not in the control that contained undamaged DNA (lane2). Importantly, the DNA fragments were not produced if ATP was absent (Fig. 4, lane6) or when TFIIH was omitted from the repair reaction (Fig. 4, lane4). Because the 32P-labeling protocol added one nucleotide to the excision DNA fragments, the actual size range of these fragments is 24-27 nucleotides.Fig. 4Size of the excision DNA fragments. UV-irradiated (lanes3-6) and unirradiated (lanes1 and 2) plasmid DNAs were incubated with the full complement of NER factors (lanes2, 5, and 6) in the presence of ATP (lanes2 and 5) or in its absence (lane6).

Since all these purified protein factors are indispensable for damage-specific incision, they represent the minimum set of factors for accomplishing this reaction.In our reconstituted system, incision of damaged DNA shows a strict dependence on ATP or dATP, whose hydrolysis is required for the repair reaction because the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS does not promote the incision of damaged DNA. The requirement for ATP and its hydrolysis in the incision step of NER is consistent with the results from genetic studies conducted with mutant variants of Rad3 and Rad25 proteins that are defective in ATP hydrolysis (7Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Qiu H. Park E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We suggest that at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, the combined helicase function of Rad3 and Rad25 creates a single-stranded region at the damage site for dual incision by the Rad1-Rad10 and Rad2 endonucleases.It is intriguing that nicking of the damaged DNA does not occur if either the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease or the Rad2 endonuclease is present alone with the remainder of the incision NER components. This finding strongly suggests that in addition to providing the endonucleolytic activities for dual incision, the Rad1-Rad10 protein complex and the Rad2 protein are also required for the proper assembly of the NER ensemble at the damage site. The involvement of the two endonucleolytic components in assembling the NER complex may serve to ensure that the endonucleolytic scissions at the damage site occur in a coordinated manner, as well as to minimize gratuitous nicking of DNA.In summary, the following major conclusions emerge from this work. First, the damage recognition factor Rad14, the Rad4-Rad23 complex, the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease, the Rad2 endonuclease, RPA, and TFIIH are all essential for the incision step of NER. Second, because of the high degree of purity of the protein factors used, we infer that the combination of these proteins is sufficient for the incision reaction. Third, the incision reaction occurs only in the presence of ATP, and our results strongly suggest a requirement of ATP hydrolysis in this reaction. Finally, our observation that the size of the excision fragment produced by the yeast incision enzyme complex resembles that in humans indicates that the yeast and human NER machineries act in a highly similar manner. INTRODUCTIONNucleotide excision repair (NER)1( 1The abbreviations used are: NERnucleotide excision repairPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRPAreplication protein AATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)AAFN-acetoxy-2-aminoacetylfluorene.) represents the most important cellular mechanism for the removal of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified seven genes, RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4, RAD10, RAD14, and RAD25, that are essential for NER (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To begin to define the biological roles of these genes, we have purified their encoded proteins from yeast and characterized their biochemical activities. This undertaking has allowed us to infer the involvement of these proteins in different steps of the incision process, viz. in damage recognition, in DNA unwinding, and in dual incision of the damaged DNA strand. Rad14 is a zinc metalloprotein with an affinity for UV-damaged DNA (2Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rad3 is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, and it also has DNA helicase and DNA·RNA helicase activities (3Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rad3 exhibits a preference for binding UV-damaged DNA that is dependent upon ATP and the degree of negative superhelicity in DNA (6Sung P. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8303-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rad25 also possesses a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities (7Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rad1 and Rad10 exist as a complex in vivo, and complex formation between these proteins is essential for their biological action (8Bailly V. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rad1 and Rad10 together comprise a DNA endonuclease (9Sung P. Reynolds P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26391-26399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tomkinson A.E. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tappe N.J. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and Rad2 also is a DNA endonuclease (11Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1993; 366: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Another level of complexity in understanding the biological roles of NER genes was introduced from the observation that in addition to their requirement in NER, RAD3 and RAD25 are also essential for cell viability (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Studies of temperature-sensitive conditional lethal mutations of these genes have indicated that both are essential for RNA polymerase II transcription (7Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Studies with the rad3 and rad25 mutants defective in ATPase/DNA helicase activities have indicated that whereas Rad3 ATPase/helicase activity is required for NER, the Rad25 ATPase/helicase is essential for both NER and polymerase II transcription (7Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Qiu H. Park E. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Rad3 and Rad25 proteins are two of the six subunits of polymerase II transcription factor TFIIH, and it has been proposed that the entire TFIIH functions in NER (15Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In addition to the above mentioned protein factors, the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA has been suggested to have a role in an early step of NER (19Coverley D. Kenny M.K. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Clugston C.K. McLaughlin K. Kenny M.K. Brown R.

Because of the amenability of S. cerevisiae to genetic and biochemical analyses, development of such a system is essential for a detailed understanding of processes that effect different steps of NER, including transcription-coupled DNA repair. Various yeast protein factors that have been implicated in NER in genetic and biochemical studies have now been purified to near homogeneity in our laboratory. Here, we present our results, which indicate that the incision step of NER can be accomplished by combining the following highly purified protein components: Rad14, Rad4-Rad23 complex, Rad1-Rad10 complex, Rad2, RPA, and TFIIH. The damage-specific incision reaction has a strict dependence on ATP, and our results imply that the two incision nicks are made in a highly coordinated fashion."

Associated with nodule formation is a change in the pattern of SMC gene expression including increased expression of a well characterized marker of smooth muscle cell differentiation, SM α-actin, and a 38-kDa glycoprotein (gp38k). gp38k has sequence homology with proteins reported to be correlated with tissue remodeling. To characterize the gp38k mRNA we designed degenerate oligonucleotides based on partial polypeptide sequencing to select a cDNA encoding the full-length gp38k. Southern analysis indicates that porcine gp38k is present as a single copy gene. Northern analysis indicates that the increase in gp38k is correlated with an increase in the steady state level of gp38k mRNA; and is present in cultures that have initiated the formation of multilayered foci and nodules. The correlation between SMC differentiation and gp38k expression is further established by using culture conditions that facilitate SMC differentiation. Cultures seeded onto reconstituted extracellular matrix show rapid formation of nodules and increased expression of gp38k mRNA. Comparison of the gp38k and cDNA sequences with nucleotide and protein sequences available through GenBank and SwissProt data banks revealed that molecules homologous to gp38k were present in human, mouse, bovine, and <i>Drosophila</i> tissues, suggesting that the gp38k may be a member of a gene family. Although a function for gp38k has not been identified, this report represents the first report of its correlation with a specific process important in phenotypic and morphological modulation of vascular SMC."

To identify ligands specific for gp330 and relevant to its localization on epithelia such as in the mammary gland, gp330-Sepharose affinity chromatography was performed. As a result, a 70-kDa protein was selected from human milk and identified by protein sequencing to be apolipoprotein J/clusterin (apoJ). Solid-phase binding assays confirmed that gp330 bound to apoJ with high affinity (Kd = 14.2 nM). Similarly, gp330 bound to apoJ transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. LRP, however, showed no binding to apoJ in either type of assay. The binding of gp330 to apoJ could be competitively inhibited with excess apoJ as well as with the gp330 ligands apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, and the receptor-associated protein, a 39-kDa protein that acts to antagonize binding of all known ligands for gp330 and LRP. Several cultured cell lines that express gp330 and ones that do not express the receptor were examined for their ability to bind and internalize 125I-apoJ. Only cells that expressed gp330 endocytosed and degraded radiolabeled apoJ.

Each of the proteins that bind to gp330 have been shown to also bind LRP. However, LRP binds several additional ligands, such as α2-macroglobulin-protease complexes (Ashcom et al., 1990Ashcom J.D.

To date no ligand has been identified that can bind gp330 exclusively. While the overlapping ligand binding specificity of LRP and gp330 might suggest that gp330 is part of a redundant receptor system, the very different pattern of expression of the two receptors suggests that gp330 has a unique function with respect to LRP. Not only is gp330 expression much more restricted than is LRP (Zheng et al., 1994Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar; Kounnas et al., 1994Kounnas M.Z. Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo. 1994; 8: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar), but in those cells where both receptors are expressed the two proteins have distinct subcellular distribution patterns (Kounnas et al., 1994Kounnas M.Z. Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo. 1994; 8: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). gp330 is strictly confined to apical portions of cells within epithelial layers, whereas LRP seems to be more basolaterally distributed within gp330-expressing cells. In addition, gp330 can be found expressed exclusive of LRP such as in the epithelial cells of epicardium and renal proximal tubules. In an effort to understand the function of gp330 we have sought to identify gp330 ligands present in bodily fluids that are normally in contact with gp330-expressing epithelial cells. Given that gp330 has been shown to be expressed by mammary epithelial cells (Zheng et al., 1994Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we have examined milk as a source for gp330 ligands. Herein we report on the identification of a milk protein known as apolipoprotein J (apoJ)2( 2Apolipoprotein J is synonymous with clusterin, sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SPG-2), complement lysis inhibitor (CLI), testosterone-repressed prostate message-2 (TRPM-2), Gp80 and SP-40-40.) as a novel gp330 ligand. Furthermore we have used gp330-expressing cell lines to demonstrate that gp330 mediates internalization and degradation of apoJ. gp330 from human urine or porcine kidney brush border membrane extracts was isolated by RAP-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (Kounnas et al., 1992bKounnas M.Z.

The 18-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of human lipoprotein lipase (residues 313-448) was from Dr. David Chappell (University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA). uPA:PAI-1 complexes were generated by incubation of a 1:1 molar ratio of active uPA with active PAI-1 for 30 min at room temperature. Bovine serum albumin-fraction V, and ovalbumin were purchased from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal antibody to human apoJ designated 1D11 has been described previously (de Silva et al., 1990ade Silva H.V. Stuart W.D. Park Y.B. Mao S.J.T. Gil C.M. Wetterau J.R. Busch S.J.

The mouse monoclonal antibody to rat gp330 designated 1H2 was provided by Dr. Robert McCluskey (Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). This antibody has previously been shown to cross react to both porcine (data not shown) and human gp330 (Kounnas et al., 1993Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

The mouse monoclonal antibody to the 515-kDa heavy chain of human LRP designated 8G1 has been described previously (Strickland et al., 1991). IgG was purified on protein G-Sepharose from each of the mouse ascitic fluids. IgG was isolated from rabbit polyclonal anti-gp330 serum (rb239) (Kounnas et al., 1994Kounnas M.Z. Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo. 1994; 8: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-LRP serum (rb777 and rb810) (Strickland et al., 1991) by affinity chromatography on either gp330- or LRP-Sepharose (1-2 mg of protein/ml of resin) followed by absorption on RAP-Sepharose. An affinity matrix of gp330-Sepharose was prepared by coupling porcine gp330 to activated CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 1-2 mg of protein/ml of resin. Human breast milk (12-20 weeks postdelivery) was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in the presence of the following proteinase inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), pepstatin (66 ng/ml), and D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (4 μg/ml). After centrifugation, the milk supernatant (200 ml) was preabsorbed on CL-4B Sepharose (20 ml bed volume) and applied to the gp330-Sepharose affinity matrix (5 ml bed volume). The column was then washed with 50 volumes of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), and bound protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Eluted fractions were electrophoresed in the presence of SDS on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, extracted in 0.1% SDS, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, and sequenced on a Hewlett Packard (model Gl000S) protein sequencing instrument. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were carried out as described previously (Kounnas et al., 1993Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 0.5% ovalbumin was used in the blocking buffer instead of bovine serum albumin. ELISA data was analyzed using a form of the binding isotherm as described by Ashcom et al., 1990Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar. Both homologous and heterologous ligand displacement assays were conducted according to methods already outlined (Williams et al., 1992Williams S. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with gp330, LRP, or ovalbumin (5 μg/ml) in TBS, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, for 4 h at 37°C, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 0.5% ovalbumin, TBS. Receptor-coated wells were then incubated with radiolabeled ligand in 0.5% ovalbumin, TBS, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Tween-20 in the presence of unlabeled competitor at varying concentrations for 18 h at 4°C. For binding assays, apoJ was labeled with 125I using IODO-GEN (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) and used within 24 h at a concentration of 0.5-2 nM (specific activity ranged from 1 to 5 mCi/mg of protein). Binding data was analyzed, and dissociation constants (Kd) and inhibition constants (Ki) were determined using the computer program LIGAND (Munson and Robard, 1980Munson P.J. Robard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). ApoJ and RAP (0.5 μg each) were electrophoresed in the presence of SDS and under nonreducing conditions on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 3% nonfat milk, which lacks detectable levels of apoJ (data not shown), in TBS (blocking buffer). The membranes were then incubated with unlabeled gp330 or LRP (25 nM) in blocking buffer with 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween-20. After a 1-h incubation, the membranes were washed with TBS, 0.05% Tween-20 and then probed with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies to gp330 (1H2) or LRP (8G1) (0.1 nM) for 1 h at 25°C. Filters were washed and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70°C. Cell assays were carried out according to procedures described previously (Kounnas et al., 1993Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells (ATCC CRL1720) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) precoated with 0.1% gelatin. To augment expression of gp330, the F9 cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with 0.1 μM retinoic acid (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 0.2 μM dibutyryl cAMP (DBC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 7 days. After 7 days of treatment, the cells were transferred to gelatin-coated 6-well dishes at 3-5 × 105 cells/well (60-80% confluence) and allowed to grow for 24 h. Prior to the addition of radioactive ligands, the cells were washed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mM HEPES, Nutridoma serum substitute (Boehringer Mannheim), penicillin/streptomycin, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin (assay medium) for 1 h at 37°C. Radioiodinated apoJ (5-10 nM) in assay medium was added to the cells in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of RAP or unlabeled apoJ (1.8-450 nM) and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. Typically, 200 μg of apoJ was radioiodinated using IODO-GEN (specific activity of 1-5 mCi/mg protein) and used within 24 h. For assays evaluating the effect of gp330 antibodies on 125I-apoJ internalization and degradation, the cells were preincubated with antibodies to gp330 (rb239) or antibodies to LRP (rb777) for 1 h at 37°C prior to the addition of 125I-apoJ. Antibodies were also included during the subsequent incubation with labeled ligand. Radioactivity in the cell medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid was taken to represent degraded ligand (Goldstein and Brown, 1974Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total ligand degradation was corrected for any degradation that occurred in radioligand-containing medium lacking cells, typically this amount was 5-10% of the total counts added. To inhibit lysosomal protease activity, the cells were treated with 0.1 mM chloroquine (Sigma) throughout the duration of the internalization and degradation assays. To determine the amount of 125I-apoJ that was internalized, the cells were washed 3 times with isotonic phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with serum-free medium containing 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), and 0.5 mM EDTA for 2-4 min at 4°C. The washing and trypsin/proteinase K/EDTA treatment were found to remove >80% of the surface-associated 125I-apoJ (data not shown). The cells were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 2 min, and the amount of radioactivity in the cell pellet was measured. The fact that gp330 expression in vivo is restricted to epithelial cells in contact with fluids prompted us to examine biological fluids for the presence of gp330 ligands. Human breast milk was available in larger quantities than other potential gp330 ligand-containing fluids like cerebral spinal fluid and seminal plasma. An affinity matrix of gp330 coupled to Sepharose was used to select gp330-binding proteins from human skim milk. The skim milk was preabsorbed on a column of Sepharose and then applied to a column of gp330-Sepharose. Elution of the gp330-Sepharose column with a buffer containing urea released a polypeptide that when analyzed by SDS-PAGE had a molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 1). The 70-kDa protein was subjected to protein sequence analysis, which revealed two sequences identical to the first 10 residues of the α- and β-subunits of human apolipoprotein J, a known 70-kDa milk protein (de Silva et al., 1990ade Silva H.V. Stuart W.D. Park Y.B. Mao S.J.T. Gil C.M. Wetterau J.R. Busch S.J. Harmony J.A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14292-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 1990b). In immunoblotting analysis, monoclonal apoJ antibodies were found to react with the 70-kDa protein eluted from the gp330 affinity matrix (data not shown). The results show that apoJ can be isolated from milk by gp330-Sepharose affinity chromatography and suggest that gp330 interacts with apoJ. We next investigated the ability of apoJ to bind to gp330 by using several types of solid-phase binding assays. In ELISA, apoJ bound to gp330 (urine or kidney derived) immobilized on microtiter well plastic with half-saturating levels of binding achieved at 2.8 nM for porcine gp330 and 3.8 nM for human gp330 (Fig. 2). Homologous ligand competition assays were performed to obtain quantitative information regarding the apoJ-gp330 interaction. As shown in Fig. 3A, 125I-apoJ bound to immobilized gp330, and the binding could be inhibited with increasing concentrations of unlabeled apoJ. The binding data could be fit to a model containing a single class of sites with a Kd of 10 nM. In these assays, we also investigated the ability of apoJ to bind to LRP, a receptor closely related to gp330 in structure and function. However, no binding of 125I-apoJ to immobilized LRP was observed (Fig. 3A). In addition, no binding was observed between apoJ and LRP in ELISA (data not shown). The functionality of the LRP used in the assays was confirmed by its ability to promote binding of 125I-apoE, a known LRP ligand (Beisiegel et al., 1989Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar; Kowal et al., 1989Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). In these experiments 125I-apoE also bound to gp330 with a Kd of 50.7 nM, which was similar to that for LRP, Kd = 53.6 nM. The apoJ-gp330 interaction was also evaluated by using a gel blot-overlay assay in which apoJ, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters after SDS-PAGE, was incubated with buffer containing either gp330 or LRP. Bound receptor was then detected by using radiolabeled monoclonal receptor antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, lane 4, gp330 bound to immobilized apoJ, whereas LRP did not (Fig. 4B, lane 4). A control for the functionality of both receptors in this assay was their ability to bind to the 39-kDa protein RAP (Fig. 4, lane 2 in panels A and B). The results of both the solid phase microtiter well assays and gel blot overlay assays show that apoJ binds to gp330 but not to LRP.Fig. 3Binding of 125I-apoJ and 125I-apoE3 to gp330. In panel A, 125I-labeled apoJ (1 nM) was incubated for 18 h at 4°C in wells coated with gp330 (●), LRP (○), or ovalbumin (○) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled apoJ (0.2-450 nM). After incubation, wells were washed and counted. The data were analyzed by the program LIGAND, and the curve represents the best fit of the data to a single class of sites with a K of 10 nM. The data presented are representative of six experiments having a mean K = 14.2 ± 8.6 nM). In panel B, 125I-labeled apoE3 (2 nM) was incubated with gp330, LRP, or ovalbumin-coated wells in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled apoE3 (0.2-450 nM) for 18 h at 4°C. The K values measured for the binding of apoE3 to gp330 and LRP were 50.7 and 53.6 nM, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4125I-gp330 binding to apoJ immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes after SDS-PAGE.

In panel A, the membrane was probed with unlabeled gp330 (25 nM), and the bound receptor was detected with 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-gp330 IgG 1H2. In panelB, the membrane was probed with unlabeled LRP (25 nM), and bound receptor was detected with 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-LRP IgG 8G1. Both membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film.

Heterologous ligand competition assays were performed using RAP, apoE3, or lipoprotein lipase carboxyl-terminal receptor-binding fragment as competitors for radiolabeled apoJ binding to gp330-coated microtiter wells. As shown in Fig. 5, each of these ligands competed effectively for the 125I-apoJ binding (Fig. 5). By curve fitting the data, inhibition of binding constants (Ki) were determined for each ligand (Table I). Inhibition constants were also derived for several other gp330 ligands including pro-uPA, uPA:PAI-1, and lactoferrin, and the values are shown in Table I (binding curves not shown). While apoJ, RAP, apoE, and lipoprotein lipase carboxyl-terminal receptor-binding fragment were able to compete for 125I-apoJ binding to gp330, the other gp330 ligands pro-uPA, uPA:PAI-1, and lactoferrin were not able to inhibit the binding. The results indicate that apoJ, apoE3, and lipoprotein lipase carboxyl-terminal receptor-binding fragment may share a common binding site on gp330 or have binding sites in close proximity to one another, whereas the other ligands bind to separate sites on the receptor. Similar results and interpretations have been reported for the binding of many of these ligands to LRP (Moestrup et al., 1993aMoestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Nykjaer A.

The F9 cells were grown in the presence of RA and DBC since this treatment can increase gp330 expression levels 20-40-fold (Fig. 6, inset) while having no effect on LRP, very low density lipoprotein receptor, or LDLR levels.3( 3S. Stefansson, D. A. Chappell, K. M. Argraves, and W. S. Argraves, manuscript in preparation.) As shown in Fig. 6, RA/DBC-treated F9 cells internalized 17-fold greater levels of 125I-gp330 monoclonal antibody (1H2) than untreated cells. Similar results were observed with 125I-gp330 polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). The increased ability of the RA/DBC-treated cells to endocytose gp330 antibody is comparable in magnitude to the increase in gp330 protein levels in the treated cells as measured by immunoblotting analysis of F9 cell extracts (Fig. 6, inset). Both the untreated and RA/DBC-treated F9 cells were found to internalize and degrade 125I-apoJ (Fig. 7). The levels of uptake and degradation of 125I-apoJ were respectively 5- and 10-fold greater in the RA/DBC-treated F9 cells as compared with the untreated cells. Several cells lines that do not express gp330 but are known to express LRP such as HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells were found to be unable to mediate 125I-apoJ internalization and degradation (data not shown). RAP, a competitor of apoJ binding to gp330 (Fig. 5), and unlabeled apoJ both acted to inhibit the F9 cell-mediated uptake and degradation of radiolabeled apoJ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). Lactoferrin, a gp330 ligand (Willnow et al., 1992Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was a poor competitor of gp330 binding to apoJ (Table I), did not inhibit the degradation of apoJ (Fig. 7, C and D). The results show that cellular catabolism of apoJ correlates with the expression of gp330.Fig. 7Internalization and degradation of 125I-apoJ by F9 cells. Wells containing 3 × 105 F9 cells that had been either RA and DBC treated (panels B and D) or untreated (panels A and C) as described under “Materials and Methods” were incubated with 125I-apoJ (5 nM) for 18 h at 37°C in the presence of increasing concentrations (1.8-450 nM) of unlabeled apoJ (●), RAP (○), or lactoferrin (▲). PanelsA and B show 125I-apoJ internalization data, and panels C and D show 125I-apoJ degradation data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide further evidence for the role of gp330 as a mediator of apoJ endocytosis and degradation, we tested the effects of gp330 polyclonal antibodies (r239) on F9-mediated catabolism of 125I-apoJ. These antibodies have been shown to efficiently block the uptake and degradation of other gp330 ligands (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8, both internalization (panel A) and degradation (panel B) of 125I-apoJ by RA/DBC-treated F9 cells were inhibited by gp330 antibodies, whereas antibodies to LRP had no effect. In addition, the degradation of 125I-apoJ was inhibited by chloroquine (Fig. 8, panel B), a drug that alters the pH of lysosomes leading to inhibition of lysosomal proteinase activity. These results suggest that gp330 functions to mediate endocytosis of apoJ, which leads to its degradation by lysosomal proteases. While we have identified gp330 as a receptor capable of mediating apoJ endocytosis and degradation, we do not yet know the biological significance for such a process. ApoJ has been reported to bind to several proteins including the βA4 peptide of the Alzheimer's precursor protein (Ghiso et al., 1993Ghiso J. Matsubara E. Koudinov A. Choi-Miura N.H. Tomita M.

In this regard, apoJ would function like several other ligands for the LDLR family. For example, apoJ may function to target lipoproteins for clearance as does apoE or lipoprotein lipase (Kowal et al., 1989Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

ApoJ has also been shown to act as an inhibitor of the cytolytic activity of the complement membrane-attack complex C5b-C9 (Jenne and Tschopp, 1989Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This interaction may facilitate clearance of the inactive complexes via gp330 in a manner analogous to the way in which proteases are inactivated by α2-macroglobulin or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and then cleared by LRP (Strickland et al., 1994Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Williams S.E. Argraves W.S. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 204-215Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A particularly important feature of apoJ is that its expression is up-regulated at sites undergoing tissue remodeling occurring in conjunction with apoptosis or following injury (Jenne and Tschopp, 1992Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).

The function that apoJ serves in these situations is not yet known. French et al., 1992French L.E. Sappino A.-P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar have proposed that apoJ may be involved in the removal of debris resulting from apoptosis or that it may protect by-stander cells from cytolysis by cell debris-activated complement. They also point out that in the thymus, where extensive apoptotic cell death normally occurs, inflammation is absent perhaps owing to the action of apoJ expressed by nondying cells in the medulla of the tissue. The typical absence of inflammation in areas that undergo apoptosis and the observed enhanced expression of apoJ in such areas makes it tempting to speculate that a primary function of apoJ is to restrict inflammation. Consistent with any of the postulated roles of apoJ is a role for a receptor such as gp330 to endocytose apoJ in complex with complement components or lipid debris/apoptotic bodies. ApoJ has been found to be widely expressed by cells of reproductive, endocrine, and nervous tissues (Sylvester et al., 1991Sylvester S.R. Morales C. Oko R. Griswold M.D. Biol.

For example, apoJ has been detected in ovary, prostate, seminal vesicle, testis, epididymis, kidney, liver, eye, and brain. ApoJ has also been detected in many body fluids including urine, saliva, seminal plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and plasma (Blaschuk et al., 1983Blaschuk O. Burdzy K. Fritz I.B. J. Biol.

There is a striking correlation between sites of apoJ expression and known sites of gp330 expression. Prominent expression of gp330 has been observed in the ependyma, choroid plexus, ciliary, and pigmented retinal epithelium, lung, kidney, yolk sac epithelium, and tissues of the male and female reproductive systems (Zheng et al., 1994Zheng G.

The colocalization of apoJ and gp330 strengthens the possibility that the two proteins interact with one another in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2120699640,"Although the excitatory amino acid glutamate and its receptors play crucial roles in many functions of the central nervous system (CNS), their presence in the peripheral tissues has remained unclear. In the present study, we have identified kainate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype mRNAs in pancreatic islets, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurements and electrophysiological recordings indicate that kainate, AMPA, and NMDA all elicit increases of [Ca2+]i in single pancreatic β-cells and depolarize them. In addition, kainate and AMPA stimulate insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets, whereas NMDA does not. Also, immunocytochemical study shows the presence of intense glutaminase immunoreactivity in pancreatic α-cells and intrapancreatic ganglia, a finding compatible with the possibility that glutamate is released from α-cells as well as from neurons. Because the inhibitory amino acid γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) is present in β-cells as well as in neurons and inhibits glucagon secretion from α-cells, the present study suggests that glutamate and GABA are coordinated in the regulation of hormone secretion in pancreatic islets.—Inagaki, N., Kuromi, H., Gonoi, T., Okamoto, Y., Ishida, H., Seino, Y., Kaneko, T., Iwanaga, T., Seino, S.

https://openalex.org/W2031904325,"Munc-18-1 is a 67-kDa neuronal protein that binds tightly to syntaxin 1 and functions in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Hata, Y., Slaughter, C. A., and Südhof, T. C.

Munc-18-2 is expressed in most tissues, whereas Munc-18-1 is primarily expressed in brain. Using recombinant Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 produced in COS cells, we show that both forms of Munc-18 bind tightly to syntaxins 1A, 2, and 3 but not to syntaxin 4.

This assay system depends on protein-protein interactions in the cell nucleus. We validated its utility for studying membrane trafficking proteins by testing well characterized interactions between cytosolic proteins that are known to be physiologically important in exocytosis.

Our studies demonstrate that neural and non-neural tissues have distinct forms of Munc-18, which may function in different types of exocytosis.

The lack of specificity of the interactions between syntaxins and Munc-18s indicates that specificity of membrane trafficking reactions is not dependent on this interaction. INTRODUCTIONThe first step toward an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of membrane traffic is the identification of components of the trafficking machinery. The characterization of proteins with putative functions in exocytosis has particularly advanced at the synapse (reviewed in Jahn and Südhof, 1994Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Originally, synaptic membrane traffic was thought to be mechanistically unique. Recent years, however, have demonstrated that many synapse-specific proteins have homologues in other cellular fusion reactions where they may perform analogous functions and vice versa. Thus, the mechanisms are probably similar for different types of membrane trafficking reactions, and the molecular components acting in these reactions are conserved between different reactions and different species (reviewed in Südhof et al., 1993Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niemann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and Bennett and Scheller, 1994Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).N-Ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF)1( 1The abbreviations used are: NSFN-ethylmaleimide sensitive factorGSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSNAPsoluble NSF attachment protein.) is a cytosolic protein that is conserved from yeast to man and probably functions in most intracellular membrane fusion reactions, including that of synaptic vesicles (Rothman, 1994Rothman J. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). NSF binds to specific receptor sites on membranes via soluble NSF-attachment proteins (SNAPs) that are also highly conserved between different trafficking reactions, although the membrane receptors for NSF-SNAPs may differ for different cellular compartments. Studies on the neuronal membrane receptors for NSF and α-SNAP revealed that the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein and the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 (no relation to the SNAPs of NSF) are efficiently purified on immobilized α-SNAP-NSF (Söllner et al., 1993Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). These three proteins do not individually bind α-SNAP and NSF but form a tight, SDS-resistant complex (the “core complex”) (Hayashi et al., 1994Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) that in turn binds α-SNAP (McMahon and Südhof, 1995McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2213-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the three components of the core complex are targets for different botulinum and tetanus toxins that block neurotransmitter release. These toxins inhibit the formation of the membrane-bridging core complex (Hayashi et al., 1994Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), suggesting that the core complex is required for exocytosis.Syntaxin 1 is not only a key component of the core complex but also interacts with other proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis; Ca2+ channels (Sheng et al., 1994Sheng Z.-H. Rettig J. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin I (Bennett et al., 1992Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H.

Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar; also called n-sec1 (Pevsner et al., 1994aPevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Munc-18-1 is likely to have an essential function in neurotransmitter release because mutations of its homologues in Drosophila and in Caenorhabditis elegans (called rop and unc-18, respectively) lead to a phenotype that suggests an inhibition of neurotransmitter release (Hosono et al., 1992Hosono R.

Broadie K. van de Goor J. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A role for Munc-18 in exocytosis is supported by its distant homology to three proteins involved in the yeast secretory pathway, Sec1, Sly1, and Slp1 (Pelham, 1993Pelham H.R.B. Nature. 1993; 364: 582Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have revealed that syntaxin 1 cannot simultaneously bind Munc-18-1 and SNAP-25, suggesting an ordered sequence in the interactions of syntaxin 1 with these two components of the fusion apparatus (Pevsner et al., 1994bPevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that the only function of Munc-18-1 consists in an inhibitory role in the formation of the core complex, and the exact function of Munc-18-1 is currently unclear.Since NSF and SNAPs are ubiquitous membrane trafficking proteins, it seems likely that non-neural tissues should also express homologues of the various interacting proteins. This has been shown for synaptobrevin and syntaxin. All cells tested express a ubiquitously distributed homologue of synaptobrevin, cellubrevin, that is also tetanus sensitive (McMahon et al., 1993McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition to brain syntaxin 1, four other syntaxins with a widespread tissue distribution have been described (Bennett et al., 1993Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar).Munc-18-1 interacts strongly with syntaxin 1; both proteins are expressed at high levels only in brain (Hata et al., 1993aHata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar; Pevsner et al., 1994aPevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 1994b). However, the presence of homologues of syntaxin 1 and of synaptobrevin in all animal cells indicates a general role for syntaxins and its interacting partners in membrane traffic (Bennett et al., 1993Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar; McMahon et al., 1993McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This suggests that there may be additional forms of Munc-18 in non-neuronal membrane traffic. In the current study, we have identified a novel form of Munc-18 called Munc-18-2. We have studied the specificity and mechanism of the interaction of Munc-18s with different syntaxins to gain insight into the regions of Munc-18 that are required for binding and into the specificity of this interaction. Our data demonstrate that neuronal and non-neuronal trafficking pathways use distinct but homologous isoforms of Munc-18 with similar binding specificities for syntaxin.MATERIALS AND METHODScDNA Cloning, Sequencing, and Sequence AnalysiscDNA libraries from rat intestine, thymus, and liver in λZAPII (Stratagene) were screened with random-primed DNA probes from rat Munc-18-1 (Hata et al., 1993aHata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) at low stringency (30% formamide) (Südhof, 1990Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7849-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven clones were isolated from the intestinal library and one from the liver and the thymus libraries and sequenced after subcloning into M13 vectors. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method using fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI370A DNA sequencer. All but one clone initiated just after the starting ATG, and the single clone containing the putative initiator ATG had an intron, an artifactual occurrence that is not uncommon for cDNA libraries. Therefore, PCR primers corresponding to the putative translation start and termination codons were used to isolate the complete coding region as a PCR fragment (sequences of oligonucleotide primers: CGCGGATCCGAGGGGAAGATGGCGCCCT and GCGCTCGAGTCAGGGCAGGGCTATGTC). PCR was performed on rat brain cDNA as described (Ushkaryov and Südhof, 1993Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6410-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The 1.8-kilobase fragment was subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. All sequences were analyzed on a PC using IntelliGenetics software. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones were deposited in the GenBank data bank.Construction of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Expression Vectors and Expression of Proteins in Bacteria and COS CellsBacterial expression vectors encoding GST-fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxins 1A, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (pGexSynt1-Synt5) were constructed by PCR and standard recombinant DNA techniques in pGEX-KG (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J.

GST-fusion proteins were expressed and purified on glutathione-agarose; GST-syntaxin 5 was insoluble and not studied further. For expression of Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 in COS cells, the coding region of the rat cDNAs were cloned into the vector pCMV5 (gift of Dr. David W. Russell, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Plasmid DNA was transfected into COS cells using DEAE-dextran, and transfected COS cells were harvested 48-72 h after transfection. Analysis of the Binding of Recombinant Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 to Different GST-Syntaxin Fusion Proteins-Total solubilized homogenates were obtained from rat liver and brain as described and used for binding studies with recombinant GST-syntaxin fusion proteins (Hata et al., 1993aHata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). To analyze binding of recombinant Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2, COS cells transfected with control DNA or with Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 expression vectors were solubilized in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/liter leupeptin. Solubilized COS cell extract was incubated with various GST-fusion proteins attached to glutathione-agarose, centrifuged, washed three to five times in the solubilization buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting.Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions by the Yeast Two-hybrid SystemThe full-length or partial coding regions of syntaxins 1A, 2, 3, 4, and 5, SNAP-25A, synaptotagmin I, and neurexin II were cloned into the bait and prey yeast expression vectors pBTM116 and pVP16 (Vojtek et al., 1993Vojtek A.B.

After 2 days of incubation at 30°C, colonies were inoculated into supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine and placed in a shaking incubator at 30°C for 48 h. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on yeast extracts with protein concentrations of 20-40 mg/liter per assay as described (Rose et al., 1990Rose M.D. Winston F.

Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Protein assays were done with Coomassie Blue-based assay kit (Bio-Rad).RESULTSIdentification of a Non-neuronal Isoform of Munc-18We screened rat liver, intestine, and thymus cDNA libraries at low stringency with randomly labeled cDNA fragments from Munc-18-1 (Hata et al., 1993aHata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Multiple hybridization-positive clones were isolated. Sequencing revealed that they all encoded the same novel isoform of Munc-18 that we named Munc-18-2. The sequence of the coding region of Munc-18-2 was assembled from overlapping cDNA clones. The putative initiator methionine was identified in the cDNA sequence by comparison with the initiator methionine sequences of Munc-18-1 and its Drosophila and C. elegans homologues. The translated amino acid sequence of Munc-18-2 is shown in Fig. 1 in an alignment with the sequences of rat Munc-18-1 and its Drosophila and C. elegans homologues unc-18 and rop.Munc-18-2 is 63% identical with Munc-18-1, 55% identical with the Drosophila Rop protein, and 54% identical with the C. elegans unc-18 gene product. As previously described for Munc-18-1 (Hata et al., 1993aHata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar; Pevsner et al., 1994aPevsner J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), Munc-18-2 is distantly related to the three yeast proteins Sec1, Sly1, and Slp1 that function in the yeast secretory pathway. The sequence homology of the Munc-18s with rop and unc-18 is evenly distributed over the entire protein, with blocks of identical amino acids separated by divergent sequences (Fig. 1), suggesting that the entire protein is functionally important.A quantitative analysis of the relations between the different Munc-18 homologues was performed with the CLUSTAL program and is depicted in the form of a dendrogram in Fig. 2. This analysis demonstrates that Munc-18-1, 18-2, rop, and unc-18 form a closely related group of proteins that are distantly related to Sec1 and Sly1 and slightly less related to Slp1. Since Munc-18s are equally homologous to Sec1 and to Sly1, we do not know if Munc-18s are equivalent to only Sec1 or if they also functionally overlap with Sly1 and possibly Slp1. Therefore, we propose to name these proteins Munc-18s instead of mammalian Sec1 homologues. Tissue Distributions of Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2-To study the tissue distributions of Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2, RNA blots of total RNA from rat tissues were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes (Fig. 3). As previously described, Munc-18-1 is primarily expressed in brain, although testis also expresses significant levels (Fig. 3A). No differential expression of Munc-18-1 between different brain regions was observed in this experiment in which the brain was dissected into cerebellum, spinal cord, and forebrain. In contrast to Munc-18-1, Munc-18-2 mRNAs are expressed only at low levels in brain but could be detected in all tissues investigated (Fig. 3B). Two hybridizing mRNAs were observed in most tissues, possibly because of differential polyadenylation. Highest levels for Munc-18-2 were observed in spleen, lung, kidney, and testis. Thus, Munc-18-2 shows a more widespread distribution than Munc-18-1 and is expressed in visceral organs that lack high level expression of Munc-18-1. The expression of Munc-18-2 protein in liver was confirmed in experiments in which syntaxin binding proteins were affinity purified from liver using GST-syntaxin fusion proteins as previously described for brain (Hata et al., 1993aHata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar and data not shown). Binding of Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 to Syntaxins 1A, 2, 3, and 4-Munc-18-2 is highly homologous to Munc-18-1, suggesting that Munc-18-2 may also bind to syntaxin. To test this hypothesis, Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 were expressed by transfection in COS cells. Membrane proteins from COS cells expressing either Munc-18-1 or Munc-18-2 and from control COS cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and incubated with recombinant GST and GST-syntaxin fusion proteins attached to glutathione-agarose beads. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4).Fig. 2Dendrogram analysis of the Munc-18/Sec1 family using the CLUSTAL program.

Lysates from COS cells transfected with control DNA or with expression vectors encoding Munc-18-1 or Munc-18-2 were incubated with GST or with GST-syntaxins 1A, 2, 3, and 4 attached to glutathione-agarose and washed extensively. Proteins on the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Endogenous GSTs from the COS cells (25-30 kDa) were the major proteins bound to glutathione-agarose in this experiment, but Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 (arrows) were co-precipitated with syntaxins as 67-kDa bands running above the GST-syntaxins only from cell lysates transfected with the appropriate expression vectors. Numbers on the left of the figures indicate positions of molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)No protein in the COS cell extracts bound specifically to GST alone. In contrast, incubation of the COS cell extracts with GST-syntaxins 1A, 2, and 3 led to the purification of Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2 from the respective transfected cells but not from control cells (Fig. 4). GST-syntaxin 4 was only able to bind trace amounts of Munc-18-1 and Munc-18-2. The identification of the bound 67-kDa band from the transfected COS cells as Munc-18-1 or Munc-18-2 was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The fact that these proteins can be detected not only by sensitive immunoblotting but are also visible on Coomassie Blue-stained gels suggests that the interaction between them is of high affinity and stoichiometry.Use of the Yeast Two-hybrid System to Measure Interactions between Proteins Implicated in Membrane TrafficMost analyses of protein-protein interactions for the synaptic fusion complex have been performed using biochemical methods similar to those shown in the experiments in Fig. 4. The yeast two-hybrid system potentially provides a method of analyzing these interactions in vivo (Fields and Song, 1989Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Proteins to be analyzed are cloned into bait and prey vectors (pBTM116 and pVP16, respectively) (Vojtek et al., 1993Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) and expressed in yeast as fusion proteins with a DNA binding domain and a transcription activation domain, respectively. When the two fusion proteins bind to each other in the yeast nuclei via their fused components, transcription of a selectable marker and a β-galactosidase gene is activated. This binding can be selected for and measured as β-galactosidase activity.Since the yeast two-hydrid system measures nuclear protein-protein interactions, we decided to investigate its utility for analyzing interactions between the cytosolic domains of trafficking proteins by testing well characterized protein-protein interactions. The cytoplasmic domains of different syntaxins, neurexin II, synaptobrevin, three parts of synaptotagmin I, and full-length SNAP-25 were cloned into bait and prey vectors. Most sequences were cloned into both vectors to allow a pairwise analysis in both vector combinations. The strength of the interactions between the proteins encoded by these plasmids was determined by measuring activation of β-galactosidase in yeast strains harboring both respective plasmids. These experiments confirmed the strong interaction between syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 that was previously characterized biochemically (Hayashi et al., 1994Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Very high levels of β-galactosidase were observed with syntaxins 1A, 2, 3, and 4 but not with syntaxin 5, suggesting that only the presumptive plasma membrane syntaxins 1-4 but not the Golgi syntaxin 5 interacts strongly with SNAP-25 (Table I).Table IInteractions between synaptic trafficking proteins in the yeast two-hybrid systemTable IInteractions between synaptic trafficking proteins in the yeast two-hybrid systemAs an internal control, the interactions of syntaxins with SNAP-25 were analyzed with either syntaxins in the prey vector and SNAP-25 in the bait vector or the other w"

https://openalex.org/W1868379549,"The term zinc finger was first used to describe a 30-residue, repeated sequence motif found in an unusually abundant Xenopus transcription factor. It was proposed that each motif is folded around a central zinc ion to form an independent minidomain and that adjacent zinc fingers are combined as modules to make up a DNA-binding domain with the modules ""gripping"" the DNA (hence the term finger). We now know that these proposals were correct and that these DNA-binding motifs are found in many eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins. More recently, crystal structures of three different complexes between zinc finger domains and their target DNA binding sites have revealed a remarkably simple mode of interaction with DNA. The simplicity of the zinc finger structure, and of its interaction with DNA, is a very striking feature of this protein domain. After the discovery of the zinc finger motif, patterns of potential zinc ligands have been found in several other proteins, some of which also bind to DNA. Structural studies of these domains have revealed how zinc can stabilize quite diverse protein architectures. In total, 10 such small zinc-binding domains have been studied structurally. These form a diverse collection, but each in turn has been termed a zinc finger motif-although clearly what they have in common is only their zinc-binding property, which stabilizes an apparently autonomously folded unit."
https://openalex.org/W2132562760,"The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) controls both the peripheral and central components of the acute-phase response. These activities are mediated via the IL-6 membrane receptor, but probably also via agonistic soluble IL-6 receptors (sIL-6Rs). In the present study we conducted dose-response experiments with rats that were intracerebroventricularly i.c.v.) injected with recombinant human IL-6 and sIL-6R and determined body temperature, locomotor activity, food intake, and water consumption using radiotelemetry and continuous recordings of feeding and drinking. IL-6 injected i.c.v. at 1, 10, and 100 ng increased body temperature and decreased locomotor activity and food intake, but it did not affect water consumption. When 10 ng sIL-6R, which lacked detectable biological activity, was injected i.c.v. 1 h before 1 ng IL-6, the central effects of IL-6 were enhanced and prolonged, and this was not due to endotoxin contamination of the recombinant proteins. Our data suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in the regulation of body temperature, general activity, and food intake in sick animals. Moreover, we have shown for the first time that it is possible to potentiate the effects of a mediator in vivo by administration of the corresponding receptor, which is a novel pharmacological tool for increasing receptor capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1970939369,"Protein phosphatases PPZ1 and PPZ2 represent a novel form of Ser/Thr phosphatases structurally related to type 1 phosphatases and characterized by an unusual amino-terminal region. We have found that the deletion of PPZ1 gene results in increased tolerance to Na+ and Li+ cations. Simultaneous deletion of PPZ2 gene results in an additional increase in salt tolerance. After exposure to high concentration of Li+, the intracellular content of the cation was markedly decreased in ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutants when compared to wild type cells. No significant differences were observed between both strains when the Li+ influx was measured, but ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutants eliminated Li+ more efficiently than wild type cells. This can be explained by the fact that expression of the ENA1 gene, which encodes the major component of the efflux system for these cations, is strongly increased in ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cells. As expected, the disruption of the PPZ genes did not complement the characteristic hypersensitivity for Na+ and Li+ of a ena1Δ strain. The lack of protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) has been found to decrease salt resistance by reducing the expression of the ENA1 gene. We have observed that the disruption of the PPZ genes substantially enhances the resistance of the hypersensitive calcineurin-deficient mutants. Since PPZ phosphatases have been found to be functionally related to the protein kinase C/mitogen-activated kinase pathway, we have tested bck1 or mpk1/slt2 deletion mutants and found that they do not display altered salt sensitivity. However, disruption of PPZ1 fails to increase salt resistance in a mpk1/slt2 background.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to maintain a suitable intracellular concentration of Na+, even in the present of relatively high concentrations of this cation in the medium, through the coordinate regulation of uptake and efflux systems. Influx of Na+ (and Li+) occurs through the K+ uptake system. Exposure to sodium stress causes the conversion of the K+ uptake system to a high affinity mode, in which the entrance of Na+ is reduced (Haro et al., 1993Haro R. Bauelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Two components of this system, TRK1 and TRK2, have been identified and cloned (Gaber et al., 1988Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Ko and Gaber, 1991Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and it has been postulated that TRK1 is required for the expression of the high K+ affinity mode. The efflux of Na+ is mainly mediated by a putative P-type ATPase encoded by the gene ENA1 (for a recent review, see Rodrguez-Navarro et al., 1994Rodrguez-Navarro A. Quintero F.J. Garciadeblás B.

ENA2, ENA3, and ENA4 present a very weak constitutive expression, while ENA1, although poorly expressed on basal conditions, is induced upon exposure to high concentrations of Li+ or Na+, as well as to alkaline pH. Therefore, deletion of ENA1 results in cells hypersensitive to Na+ or Li+ (Haro et al., 1991Haro R. Garciadeblás B. Rodrguez-Navarro A.

Reversible protein phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism for the modulation of protein function, and protein phosphorylation mechanisms are likely to be involved in the control of Na+ homeostasis. For instance, increased dosage of YCK1 or YCK2, the genes encoding casein kinase I homologues, has been reported to increase tolerance to salt (Robinson et al., 1992Robinson L.C. Hubbard E.J.A. Graves P.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Kung C. Haas D.W. Hagerdorn C.H. Goebl M. Culbertson M.R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, disruption of the YCR101 gene, encoding a predicted protein kinase, confers sensitivity to salt (Skala et al., 1991Skala J. Purnelle B. Crouzet M. Aigle M. Goffeau A. Yeast. 1991; 7: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatases reverse the action of kinases. Traditionally, Ser/Thr phosphatases have been classified into four groups, namely types 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C (see Cohen, 1989Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar for a review), and this classification is useful for a large variety of organisms, including yeast. A role for the Ca+2-dependent Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) in the regulation of salt homeostasis has been suggested very recently (Nakamura et al., 1993Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar; Mendoza et al., 1994Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since disruption of the genes encoding either the catalytic (CMP1/CNA1 and CMP2/CNA2) or the regulatory (CNB1) subunits of this phosphatase results in increased sensitivity to salt. It has been proposed that, at least in part, this increase in sensitivity is due to the reduced expression of the ENA1 gene in a calcineurin-deficient background (Mendoza et al., 1994Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the mentioned Ser/Thr phosphatases, the genome of S. cerevisiae encodes a number of proteins structurally related to (but clearly different from) type 1 and 2A phosphatases. Almost without exception, the regulation and the biological functions of these novel phosphatases are largely unknown. A few years ago our laboratory identified and cloned a gene named PPZ1, encoding a 692-residue putative Ser/Thr phosphatase characterized by a carboxyl-terminal half related to the protein phosphatase-1 family and a large amino-terminal extension unrelated to protein phosphatases (Posas et al., 1992Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ario J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the simultaneous disruption of PPZ1 and a second, related gene designated PPZ2 results in increased sensitivity to caffeine that lead to cell lysis, pointing to a role for these phosphatases in the maintenance of cellular integrity (Posas et al., 1993Posas F. Casamayor A. Ario J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PPZ2 also encodes a large protein (710 residues) sharing most of the structural characteristics of PPZ1 (Lee et al., 1993aLee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Hughes et al., 1993Hughes V. Müller A. Stark M.J.R. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216 (2279): 2669Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been recently suggested that the PPZ1/PPZ2 phosphatases might be related to the SLT2/MPK1 pathway, since overexpression of gene PPZ2 suppresses the lytic defect of mpk1Δ strains and deletion of PPZ1/PPZ2 genes is additive with the mpk1Δ defect (Lee et al., 1993bLee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe H. Araki E. Nishida K. Matsumoto K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this paper we present evidence that the PPZ phosphatases are important determinants in salt tolerance by regulating the efflux of cations and that these phosphatases and calcineurin play opposite functional roles. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Strains were grown in S.D. or in complex YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 28°C for routine work and storage (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1986Google Scholar). YPD was supplemented with 20 mM TAPS( 1The abbreviations used are: TAPSN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acidPKCprotein kinase CMAPmitogen-activated protein.) 1 when used at pH 8.5. For Northern blot experiments YPD was supplemented with 50 mM HEPES and adjusted to pH 7.0.Table ISaccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this work N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid protein kinase C mitogen-activated protein. Escherichia coli NM522 strain was used as bacterial host for plasmids and was grown in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic when needed. The one-step gene disruption method (Rothstein, 1983Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) was used in all cases. ppz1 and ppz2 deletion mutants were obtained as described previously (Posas et al., 1992Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ario J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Posas et al., 1993Posas F. Casamayor A. Ario J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). cnb1 disruption mutants were obtained in our laboratory exactly as described previously (Mendoza et al., 1994Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed by using a modification of the lithium acetate method (Hill et al., 1991Hill J. Donald K.A. Ian G. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by Southern blot analysis using digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The sensitivity of the cells to NaCl, LiCl, or other salts was evaluated on freshly prepared YPD medium containing various concentrations of the salts. For drop tests cells were grown for 2 days in liquid culture without salt and then 3 μl of a 1/100 dilution were plated on YPD-agar medium with salt. Growth was recorded after 3 days at 28°C. Relative growth was measured in liquid cultures as growth, recorded by measuring the A660, of overnight cultures in different salt concentrations in comparison with growth monitored in the same medium without added salts. For measurement of ion fluxes, cells were grown in YPD until an A660 of 1 was reached. Then LiCl was added from a 5 M stock solution to achieve a final concentration of 200 mM (only of 50 mM in the case of strain RH16.6, because of its very high sensitivity to this cation). At the indicated intervals, samples were harvested by filtration and washed with three volumes of ice-cold water containing 1.5 M sorbitol and 20 mM MgCl2, rinsed with cold deionized water, and extracted by incubation at 95°C for 30 min as described (Gaxiola et al., 1992Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Li+ concentrations of the clarified extract were determined by flame spectrophotometry using a Corning 810 apparatus. For Northern blot analysis, cells from a stationary culture were grown as described until the culture reached an optical density of 1. Total RNA was prepared as described (Treco, 1989Treco D.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar), electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose-formaldehyde gels (20-30 μg/lane) and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.) under vacuum. Membranes were hybridized at 42°C in the presence of 50% (v/v) formamide and 106 cpm/ml of the appropriate 32P-labeled DNA fragment. The probes used were the 3.7-kilobase pair XhoI-PstI fragment of the ENA1 gene, kindly provided by Prof. A. Rodrguez-Navarro (Haro et al., 1991Haro R. Garciadeblás B. Rodrguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and a 1.75-kilobase pair fragment of the ACT1 gene (Gallwitz and Sures, 1980Gallwitz D. Sures I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2546-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Filters were washed in 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS at 55°C. During our studies on the role of the PPZ phosphatases in the maintenance of cellular integrity, we observed that the ppz1Δ ppz2Δ double mutant JA20-1C displayed a surprisingly vigorous growth compared to the wild type JA20-1D when exposed to moderate saline stress. This initial observation was further confirmed when the double disruption was carried out in other genetic backgrounds. The effect of increasing concentrations of salt on cell growth was studied by growing wild type as well as ppz1Δ and ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cells in plates containing different concentrations of LiCl. Lithium was used in these and other experiments instead of NaCl because these cations share the same uptake and efflux systems. Because Li+ is more toxic than Na+, the former cation could be used at lower concentrations, thus avoiding the osmotic effects derived of the use of very high concentrations of NaCl. As can be observed in Fig. 1 (panelA), wild type DBY746 cells grows poorly at 100 mM LiCl and cannot grow at all at 300 mM, whereas strain JA30 (which lacks a functional copy of gene PPZ1) can still grow at 300 mM LiCl. Simultaneous disruption of PPZ1 and PPZ2 genes, as in the case of strain JA31, allows cell growth even in the presence of 600 mM LiCl. This double disruptant was able to grow in YPD plates containing up to 800 mM LiCl (not shown). The effect of lack of PPZ phosphatases has also been observed in other genetic backgrounds, as in the case of the haploid cells derived from the diploid strain DL790 (ppz1Δ/PPZ1 ppz2Δ/PPZ2). Interestingly, in all cases the disruption of PPZ2 alone resulted in an almost negligible increase in salt tolerance when compared with wild type cells (not shown). The increased tolerance to lithium conferred to the cells by the disruption of the PPZ1 and PPZ2 genes can be also observed in liquid cultures (Fig. 1, panelB). Growth was also improved in the mutants in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl (rightpanel). When the pH of the medium was raised to 8.5, the resistance to Li+ and Na+ of the ppzΔ mutants was similar to than that observed when the medium was not buffered at alkaline pH (not shown). The described effects of the ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutations were specific for Li+ or Na+, since growth was not improved in the presence of equivalent concentrations of KCl. To learn whether the increased salt tolerance of ppzΔ mutants was due to the fact that these cells contain a reduced amount of cations, we grew wild type and ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cells for 90 min in YPD medium containing 200 mM LiCl. When the intracellular content of Li+ was measured, it became evident that mutant cells contained a lower amount of the cation (30.6 ± 1.9 nmol/mg dry cells) than wild type cells (48.1 ± 2.5 nmol/mg dry cells). The intracellular concentration of Na+ was similarly reduced in the mutant strain when cells were preloaded for 90 min with 0.96 M NaCl. The possibility that an altered cation uptake might be responsible for the observed differences was tested by determining the initial rate of Li+ uptake in both wild type and ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cells. As presented in Fig. 2, both strains take up Li+ at approximately the same rate (about 2 nmol●mg·●min·), suggesting that alterations in the uptake mechanisms are not responsible for the observed differences in the intracellular content of Li+. Changes in accumulation might also be caused by an altered efflux rate. To test this possibility, cells were incubated for 90 min in YPD medium in the presence of 200 mM LiCl and then centrifuged and resuspended in Li+-free medium. The internal Li+ content was then determined in both wild type and ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cells at different times after removal of the cation. As presented in Fig. 3, the rate of elimination of Li+ was clearly higher in mutant cells, suggesting that the decreased intracellular levels observed in these cells are essentially the result of an increased Li+ efflux.Fig. 3Determination of lithium efflux in wild type and ppzΔ cells. DBY746 (●) and JA31 (▲) cells were grown as described in Fig. 2. Then, the medium was made 200 mM LiCl and growth resumed for 90 min. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh YPD medium, samples were taken at the indicated times, and the intracellular lithium content determined as described. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The putative P-type ATPase encoded by the ENA1 gene is believed to constitute the major system for Na+ (and Li+) efflux in yeast cells. We compared the sensitivity to Na+ and Li+ of strains RH16.6 (ena1-ena4Δ PPZ1 PPZ2) and JA35 (ena1-ena4Δ ppzΔ ppz2Δ) in both YPD liquid cultures and YPD-agar plates. We found that in a ena1Δ background, the ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutation was unable to increase the tolerance to the cations (Table II). Furthermore, when RH16.6 and JA35 cells were loaded for 45 min in YPD medium containing 50 mM LiCl and the amount of internal Li+ was determined, no significant differences were found between both strains (32.4 ± 0.5 nmol/mg dry cells versus 30.2 ± 0.7, respectively). Both results were compatible with the notion of an involvement of the ENA1 gene product in the mechanism of action of the PPZ phosphatases. Since it is known that exposure to salt stress results in induction of gene ENA1, which otherwise is strongly repressed, we tested by Northern blot experiments the mRNA levels of the ENA1 gene in wild type and ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, exposure of wild type cells to Li+ cations results in a transient increase of ENA1 mRNA levels, which is clearly higher in ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cells. Remarkably, ppz-deficient cells contain more ENA1 message even in the absence of salt stress, suggesting an effect of the ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutation in basal conditions.Table IIEffect of ppzΔ and ena1Δ mutations on Li+ toleranceFig. 4Effect of lack of PPZ phosphatases in ENA1 mRNA levels. Wild type DBY746 cells (openbars) as well as JA31 mutants (ppz1Δ ppz2Δ) (stripedbars) were grown in YPD medium supplemented with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) as described and then made 200 mM LiCl. Growth was resumed, and cells collected at the indicated times for total RNA extraction. Northern blots were performed, membranes hybridized with a 32P-labeled ENA1 probe, and films exposed for 48 h. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with the ACT1 gene as control for the amount of RNA transferred. The levels of ENA1 mRNA were determined by densitometric scanning of the films. Data are referred to the signal obtained from wild type cells collected immediately prior to the addition of LiCl and is expressed as the mean ± S.E. from four independent experiments. Inset shows an autoradiogram obtained from a typical experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since it has been shown recently that the lack of the type 2B phosphatase (calcineurin) leads to a salt-sensitive phenotype, we constructed strains JA40 (PPZ1 PPZ2 cnb1Δ) and JA41 (ppz1Δ ppz2Δ cnb1Δ) and tested their sensitivity to LiCl in comparison with wild type and JA31 (ppz1Δ ppz2Δ CNB1) cells (Fig. 5, upperpanel). As reported previously, the lack of CNB1 (encoding the regulatory subunit of calcineurin) in an otherwise wild type background leads to hypersensitivity to salt. Simultaneous disruption of PPZ1 and PPZ2 in a cnb1 background results in higher tolerance than wild type cells, but this mutant is less resistant than a ppz1Δ ppz2Δ CNB1 strain, indicating that the effects of these mutations are independent and additive. Furthermore, exposure of strain YPH499 carrying the double disruption cna1Δ cna2Δ (the genes encoding the catalytic subunits of calcineurin) to 0.8 M NaCl prevents growth in rich medium plates. However, when these cells carry the ppz1Δ disruption, growth was restored (Fig. 5, middlepanel). Growth under higher concentrations of NaCl indicated that cna1Δ cna2Δ ppz1Δ cells were slightly less tolerant than wild type cells (data not shown). When the levels of ENA1 mRNA were determined, it was observed that, as expected, they were lower in cnb1Δ than in wild type cells. However, the levels of ENA1 message were dramatically increased when the cnb1Δ cells also contains the ppz1Δ ppz2Δ mutation (Fig. 5, lowerpanel). These observations indicate that the lack of PPZ phosphatases is able to increase salt tolerance in calcineurin-depleted cells and suggest that the mechanism of action of the PPZ phosphatases is not mediated by calcineurin. PPZ phosphatases appear to be related to some of the effects derived of blockage of the PKC/MAP kinase pathway (i.e. cellular lysis under temperature or caffeine stress). However, when strain DL456, which carries a disruption of the MAP kinase gene (SLT2/MPK1), is grown on YPD plates containing different concentrations of LiCl, it does not present a significantly altered salt tolerance when compared with the wild type strain (Fig. 6). Disruption of the bck1 gene, encoding a kinase acting upstream the MAP kinase gene product, equally results in absence of phenotypic change (not shown). Interestingly, the disruption of PPZ1 in a mpk1Δ background (strain DL823) does not result in improved growth in the presence of different concentrations of LiCl. Since DL823 cells must be grown in plates supplemented with 10% sorbitol, it is important to note that the failure of these cells to grow was due to Li+ toxicity and not to the rather high osmolarity of the medium, since this strain did survive when identical concentrations of the less toxic salt NaCl were used instead of LiCl (Fig. 6). In the last few years, a number of genes involved in the modulation of cellular sensitivity to Na+ and Li+ toxicity have been identified in yeast. Some of these genes encode components of the uptake and efflux systems located at the plasma membrane, as it is the case of genes TRK1/TRK2 and ENA1, respectively. Other genes would include regulatory components of the above mentioned systems, as it has been suggested in the case of calcineurin (Mendoza et al., 1994Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a number of genes have been described to produce a salt-sensitive phenotype when mutated or to confer increased salt tolerance when overexpressed, as it is the case of HAL1 and HAL2 (Gaxiola et al., 1992Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar; Gläser et al., 1993Gläser H.-U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R.

Acta. 1994; 1193: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, and the protein kinases encoded by genes YCK1/YCK2 (Robinson et al., 1992Robinson L.C. Hubbard E.J.A. Graves P.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Kung C. Haas D.W. Hagerdorn C.H. Goebl M. Culbertson M.R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and YCR101 (Skala et al., 1991Skala J. Purnelle B. Crouzet M. Aigle M. Goffeau A. Yeast. 1991; 7: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that, in all cases described so far, the lack of function of the identified genes results in increased sensitivity to salt. Here, we present the opposite situation and, as far as we know, this is the first case of genes that, when disrupted, yields a phenotype of strongly increased salt tolerance. Both PPZ1 and PPZ2 genes encode very similar proteins, characterized by a carboxyl-terminal half related to type 1 phosphatases and by a large amino-terminal half rich in Ser/Thr residues. Despite this similarity, our results suggest that both proteins do not contribute equally to the phenotype studied, since deletion of PPZ1, but not of PPZ2, already results in a noticeable increase in salt tolerance. However, since the double disruption gives a more dramatic phenotype, it has to be concluded that the lack of PPZ2 also provokes alterations in salt homeostasis. This situation is very much alike to the one previously observed in our laboratory regarding cell integrity of the ppz mutants under caffeine stress (Posas et al., 1993Posas F. Casamayor A. Ario J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and might be due to a number of factors, including lower levels or activity of the PPZ2 gene product. We postulate that the increased cation efflux observed in ppz1 ppz2 cells is due to the fact that the PPZ phosphatases negatively control the function of the ENA1 gene. This notion is based on several lines of evidence. First, we have observed that growth is improved in ppzΔ mutants even when the extracellular pH is high enough to block the function of the proposed Na+/H+ antiporter system (Rodrguez-Navarro et al., 1981Rodrguez-Navarro A. Sancho E.D. Pérez-Lloveres C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 640: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Rodrguez-Navarro et al., 1994Rodrguez-Navarro A. Quintero F.J. Garciadeblás B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, involvement of this hypothetical antiporter in the mechanism of action of PPZ phosphatases can be discarded. Second, the fact that the lack of PPZ cannot improve growth in the presence of salt of a hypersensitive ena1Δ-ena4Δ strain suggests that the mechanism of action of PPZ might be mediated by the ENA1 gene product. Finally, the observation that ENA1 mRNA levels are increased in ppzΔ mutants suggests that the increase in cation efflux is due, at least in part, to the existence of higher amounts of the ENA1 protein. A remarkable fact is that an increase in the expression of ENA1 can be detected in a PPZ-deficient background even when the cells have not been exposed to saline stress. This could be interpreted as if the PPZ phosphatases would negatively affect the expression of ENA1 under basal conditions, thus avoiding an unnecessarily excessive expression of ENA1, which is, by itself, detrimental for cell growth.( 2A. Rodrguez-Navarro, personal communication.) 2 Exposure of ppzΔ cells to salt would trigger a signaling pathway that would cause an additional increase in ENA1 mRNA levels. Of course, our present data cannot rule out the possibility of a negative control of the activity of the ENA1 protein by the PPZ phosphatases, conceivably through phospho-dephosphorylation reactions. It has been reported recently that calcineurin plays a role in salt homeostasis and that, at least in part, this occurs through the control of cation efflux. Loss of calcineurin function can be provoked by deletion of the single CNB1 gene (encoding the regulatory subunit of the phosphatase) or by deletion of the two genes encoding the catalytic polypeptides (CNA1/CMP1 and CNA2/CMP2). Both types of mutation result in decreased cation efflux (Nakamura et al., 1993Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar; Mendoza et al., 1994Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most probably as a result of a decrease in the expression of ENA1 (Mendoza et al., 1994Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations that the lack of PPZ phosphatases can counteract the lack of calcineurin by increasing ENA1 mRNA levels indicates that the effect of the PPZ phosphatases on sodium and lithium efflux is not mediated by calcineurin and provides a very interesting example of two different phosphatases playing opposites roles in a given biological system. This situation is reminiscent of the growth restoration observed in cAMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient strains upon disruption of the gene encoding the YAK1 kinase (Garret and Broach, 1989Garret S. Broach J. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar; Ward and Garret, 1994Ward M.P. Garret S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5619-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is compatible with the notion of both phosphatases acting in parallel pathways, with overlapping but antagonistic effects. While the involvement of calcineurin in adaptation to high salt stress conditions clearly suggests a role for a calcium-mediated signaling pathway, very little is known at present about the activity of PPZ1/PPZ2 and their regulation. We recently described that disruption of both PPZ genes resulted in cell lysis upon caffeine stress (Posas et al., 1993Posas F. Casamayor A. Ario J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cell lysis is also a characteristic phenotype of mutants in the PKC/MAP kinase pathway (Levin and Errede, 1993Levin D.E. Errede B. J. NIH Res. 1993; 5: 49-52Google Scholar). The role of the PPZ phosphatases in the maintenance of cell integrity was reinforced after the isolation of PPZ2 as a multicopy suppressor of the lytic effect of the mpk1Δ mutation (Lee et al., 1993bLee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe H. Araki E. Nishida K. Matsumoto K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that these phosphatases may function within this PKC1-mediated pathway. However, our finding that neither the lack of the BCK1 gene (Lee and Levin, 1992Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), encoding a putative MAP kinase kinase kinase that is believed to act directly downstream from PKC, nor the disruption of the SLT2/MPK1 gene, encoding the MAP kinase homologue of the pathway (Torres et al., 1991Torres L. Martn H. Garca-Sáez M.I. Arroyo J. Molina M. Sánchez M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1993aLee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), results in significant changes in salt sensitivity suggests that this pathway is not involved in the regulation of salt homeostasis. However, it is remarkable that the disruption of PPZ1 fails to increase the tolerance for Li+ or Na+ of a mpk1Δ strain. This observation suggests that a functional MAP kinase would be a requisite for the phenotypic expression of the lack of PPZ function and provides additional evidence for a functional link between both proteins. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the results presented here. First, the PPZ phosphatases negatively regulate the efflux of cations in yeast cells, most probably through the repression of the ENA1 gene. Second, this event is independent of the existence of calcineurin, thus suggesting that PPZ and calcineurin are two Ser/Thr phosphatases acting on parallel pathways. A tentative model for PPZ function is depicted in Fig. 7. In this model we favor the idea that the PPZ phosphatases do not directly regulate the expression of the ENA1 gene, since these phosphatases do not show the structural features of known transcriptional regulatory proteins and, in addition, we have found that PPZ1 is not present in nuclear fractions.( 3F. Posas and J. Ario, unpublished observations.) 3 Instead, a regulatory protein (denoted as X in Fig. 7) might act as a transcriptional repressor when dephosphorylated by PPZ1/PPZ2. Therefore, the lack of PPZ phosphatases would result in inactivation of the repressor and in increase of the expression of the ENA1 gene even in the absence of salt stress. Under saline stress, an independent signaling pathway would be activated and induce ENA1 expression, thus overriding the effect of the repressor. Finally, the combination of saline stress and lack of PPZ would result in stimulation of a positive effect and blocking of a negative one and would account for the strong expression of ENA1. It is worth noting that our results indicate that ENA1 is still induced in significant extent in the absence of the CNB1 gene, suggesting that calcineurin must not be solely responsible for salt-induced increased in ENA1 transcription. Alternatively, the PPZ phosphatases might inactivate a transcriptional activator. In this situation, the absence of PPZ would also result in an increased transcription of ENA1 in basal conditions that would be further enhanced by activation of the salt-induced pathway upon exposure to saline stress. In any case, the dramatic increase in salt resistance featured by ppzΔ strains reveals that these novel phosphatases, whose biological functions were essentially unknown, are important determinants in salt homeostasis in yeast cells.

This enzyme has a tetrameric structure composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) subunits and two β subunits. We have examined the subunit composition of tetrameric complexes of purified bovine CKII by immunoprecipitation using α, α′, or β subunit-specific antibodies.

To further examine subunit interactions between the α, α′, or β subunits of CKII, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system (Fields, S. and Song, O.(1989) Nature 340: 245-246). For these studies, each subunit of human CKII was expressed in yeast as a fusion with the DNA binding domain or with the transcriptional activation domain of the yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator. These studies demonstrate that the α or α′ subunits of CKII can interact with the β subunits of CKII, but not with other α or α′ subunits. By comparison, the β subunits of CKII can interact with α, α′, or β subunits. These results indicate that the CKII holoenzyme forms because of the ability of β subunits to dimerize, bringing two heterodimers (αβ or α′β) into a tetrameric complex.

INTRODUCTIONCasein kinase II (CKII)1( 1The abbreviations used are: CKIIcasein kinase IIX-galbromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside.) is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is ubiquitously distributed in mammalian tissues and is likely to play an important role in the control of proliferative events (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pinna L.A.

Although its exact biological functions remain poorly understood, genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(4Chen Wu J.L. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5711-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all suggest that CKII is essential for viability. Immunofluorscence localization studies have demonstrated that the enzyme is localized within the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells (9Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), observations that are consistent with the demonstration that CKII phosphorylates a variety of proteins in each of these compartments. Of particular relevance to a role in the regulation of proliferation is the demonstration that CKII phosphorylates a host of regulatory nuclear proteins including transcription factors such as the serum response factor, c-Myc, N-Myc, c-Myb, c-Jun, and the tumor suppressor p53 (reviewed in Refs. 3Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127-128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 11Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).CKII is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two α (and/or α′) subunits and two β subunits. The α and α′ subunits contain all of the conserved consensus motifs of protein kinase family members (12Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and have kinase activity (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The precise functions of the β subunit are not known, but β does appear to have a role in regulating the kinase activity of the α subunits (18Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although β enhances protein kinase activity exhibited by α toward most protein substrates, it actually inhibits the phosphorylation of calmodulin (21Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs encoding the α, α′, and β subunits of CKII have been isolated from human and chicken cDNA libraries (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that the α and α′ subunits are closely related proteins that are encoded by distinct genes. Between mammals and birds, the α and α′ subunits are very highly conserved with the deduced amino acid sequences of human and chicken α and α′ exhibiting 98 and 97% identity, respectively. The β subunit of CKII exhibits an even greater degree of conservation. Remarkably, the deduced amino acid sequences of human and chicken β are identical and differ from the deduced sequence of frog β by only a single amino acid (14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Heller-Harrison R.A. Meisner H. Czech M.P.

Hinrichs M.V. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that the functional properties of CKII are highly conserved throughout evolution. Furthermore, these results obviously indicate that the tetrameric structure of CKII is conserved between species.In the present study, we have demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using α- and α′-specific antibodies that mammalian CKII exists as homotetramers (α2β2 or α2′β2) and as heterotetramers (αα′β2). Furthermore, using a yeast two-hybrid system originally described by Fields and Song (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the α or α′ subunits of CKII can interact with the β subunits of CKII, but not with other α or α′ subunits. By comparison, the β subunits of CKII can interact with α, α′, or β subunits. These results indicate that the formation of the CKII holoenzyme involves dimerization of β subunits to bring two αβ or α′β heterodimers into a tetrameric complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCKII was purified from bovine testis (27Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera specific to the α, α′, or β subunits of CKII were previously described (28Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 283-318Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the human CKII α and CKII α′ subunits were isolated from a human T-cell library (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the β subunit of human CKII was similarly isolated from a human T-cell library and was a generous gift of Dr. F. Lozeman and Dr. E. Krebs (University of Washington, Seattle). Each of these cDNAs had been cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript (sk+) to make the following constructs sk+/CKII α, sk+/CKII α′, and sk+/CKII β. Plasmids encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (pAS1-CYH2) or the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (pACTII) were obtained from Dr. Stephen Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 32Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA synthesizer by Dr. Mike Mowat (Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology). Heat-killed, formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin) was obtained from Calbiochem. The Bst sequencing kit for DNA sequencing was purchased from Bio-Rad.ImmunoprecipitationsPurified CKII (0.25 μg) was immunoprecipitated using CKII subunit-specific antibodies by incubating the enzyme for 1 h on ice in phosphate-buffered saline with affinity-purified antibodies (5 μg). Immune complexes were isolated by the addition of 40 μl of Pansorbin (10% v/v) and further incubation on ice for 30 min. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and once with 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, prior to solubilization by the addition of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) sample buffer and incubation in a boiling water bath for 3 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar) using transfer buffer (25 mM Trizma (Tris base), 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol) containing 0.005% SDS. CKII subunits were detected using CKII subunit-specific antiserum (each added at a concentration of 1:1000) followed by the addition of 125I-protein A (1 μCi/ml, final concentration) as described previously (28Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive washing of the filter and drying, filters were subjected to autoradiography. For quantitation, individual 125I-containing bands were excised and analyzed by γ counting.Plasmid ConstructsTo facilitate cloning of the cDNAs encoding CKII α, α′, or β into the pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII vectors, a BamHI site was introduced at the 5′ end of the coding region for each cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction (35Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Method and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 3-12Google Scholar). A 718-base pair fragment of CKII α was amplified from an sk+/CKII α template using the following primers: 5′ CGC GGG ATC CTG TCG GGA CCC GTG CCA 3′ (sense primer) and 5′ ATC ATA ATT GTC ATG TCC ATG GAA 3′ (antisense primer). The fragment was digested with BamHI and NcoI and used to replace a corresponding BamHI/NcoI fragment of the sk+/CKII α construct. A 383-base pair fragment of CKII α′ was similarly amplified from an sk+/CKII α′ template using the following primers: 5′ GCG GGG ATC CTG AGC AGC TCA GAG GAG 3′ (sense primer) and 5′ CAG GAT CTG GTA GAG TTG C 3′ (antisense primer). The fragment was then digested with BamHI and PpuM1 and used to replace a corresponding BamHI/PpuM1 fragment of sk+/CKII α′. A 673-base pair fragment containing the entire coding region of CKII β was amplified from an sk+/CKII β template using the following primers to introduce BamHI sites at each end of the cDNA: 5′ GCG GGG ATC CTG AGC AGC TCA GAG GAG 3′ (sense primer) and 5′ CGG GGG ATC CAG ACT GCA GGA CAG GTG 3′ (antisense primer). The fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of sk+. The sequence of all amplified fragments was confirmed by sequencing of double-stranded Bluescript templates using the method of Sanger et al.(36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar), with a Bst sequencing kit. Each of the cDNAs was subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of pAS1-CYH2 and of pACTII. The pAS1-CYH2/CKII α and pACTII/CKII α constructs each encode fusion proteins containing the entire CKII α with the exception of Met1 which is lost through fusion to the respective domains of GAL4. Similarly, the pAS1-CYH2/CKII α′ and pACTII/CKII α′ constructs each encode fusion proteins containing the complete sequence of CKII α′ beginning at Pro2. The entire sequence of CKII β starting with Ser2 is contained within the fusion proteins that are encoded by the pAS1-CYH2/CKII β and pACTII/CKII β plasmids. All pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII plasmids were routinely maintained in Escherichia coli DH5α.Transformation and Maintenance of YeastYeast strains were grown and manipulated according to standard methods (37Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). For two-hybrid experiments, the yeast strain DGY63::171 (MAT a, ade2 trp1-Δ901 leu2-3, 112 his3-Δ200 gal4Δ gal80Δ::pRY171[GAL1→lacZ](38Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) was transformed with equal quantities of various pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII plasmids using the highly efficient method of Gietz et al. (39Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic complete minus Trp-Leu plates at 30°C and grown for 3-5 days. Colonies were then replicated onto synthetic complete minus Trp-Leu plates containing 50 mM KHPO4, 2% sucrose as a carbon source, and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to visualize colonies expressing β-galactosidase.Measurement of β-Galactosidase ActivityAssays for β-galactosidase activity were performed essentially as described previously (40Paetkau D.W. Riese J.A. MacMorran W. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2035-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast were grown on synthetic complete minus Trp-Leu plates for 3-5 days at 30°C. Several colonies from each plate were scraped from the plate with an inoculating loop, transferred to 1 ml of distilled water and thoroughly mixed. OD600 measurements were taken so that β-galactosidase activities could be normalized according to the density of yeast cells. An aliquot (200 μl) of each suspension of yeast was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged briefly to pellet the yeast cells. After removing the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of Z buffer (100 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 38 mM β-mercaptoethanol). A 50-μl aliquot of 0.1% SDS was added, and the cells were vortexed vigorously for 15 s. Chloroform (50 μl) was then added, and the cells were vortexed for an additional 15 s. Assays for β-galactosidase were immediately initiated by the addition of 100 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside. Following incubation for 6 min at 37°C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 1 M Na2CO3. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 1 min, and the OD420 was measured. β-galactosidase activities in Miller units were calculated according to the following formula: units = OD420 × 1000/(volume)(time)(OD600) (41Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar).RESULTSImmunoprecipitation of CKII with Subunit-specific AntibodiesCKII is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) subunits and two β subunits (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we had previously noted (27Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purified bovine testis CKII consists of comparable amounts of α and α′ subunits (Fig. 1A). Direct sequence analysis and molecular cloning studies have demonstrated that CKII α and CKII α′ are very closely related proteins that have distinct carboxyl-terminal domains (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antipeptide antibodies raised against carboxyl-terminal peptides of CKII α or CKII α′ do not exhibit any cross-reactivity on immunoblots (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4). Similarly, antibodies directed against β do not react with α or α′ subunits (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). On immunoblots the anti-α antisera recognizes CKII α more efficiently than anti-α′ antisera recognizes its respective antigen (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4).To determine whether CKII α and CKII α′ exist in the same tetrameric complex, we subjected purified bovine testis CKII to immunoprecipitation using these subunit-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). In an initial round of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A), purified CKII was immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against CKII α, CKII α′, or CKII β, respectively. Qualitatively, all immunoprecipitations are similar since α, α′, and β are present in each immunoprecipitate. This result indicates that some of the CKII exists in a heterotetrameric complex composed of one α subunit, one α′ subunit, and two β subunits. However, there are significant quantitative differences between the immunoprecipitates obtained with the different antibodies. All subunits of the purified enzyme are quantitatively immunoprecipitated with anti-β antibodies (Fig. 2A, lane 9) since none of any of the subunits can be detected in the immunoprecipitation supernatant (Fig. 2C, lane 10). The quantitative immunoprecipitation of CKII with anti-β antibodies confirms that the tetrameric complex was intact under our immunoprecipitation conditions. Quantitation of the 125I content resulting from the presence of 125I-protein A attached to immune complexes for the α and α′ bands indicates that the relative ratio of α:α′ is 2.4:1 for anti-β immunoprecipitates. Since comparable amounts of α and α′ are present in the testis enzyme (Fig. 1), it is apparent from this experiment that the antipeptide antibodies raised against α′ recognize α′ less efficiently than antibodies directed against α recognize α. By comparison with anti-β immunoprecipitations, all subunits are not quantitatively isolated when immunoprecipitates are performed with anti-α or with anti-α′ antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-8). Furthermore, alterations in the relative intensity of CKII α to CKII α′ are observed when the different antibodies are used for immunoprecipitation. While the amount of α that is isolated by immunoprecipitation using α or β antibodies is very similar (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4 compared with lane 9), significantly less α is isolated using anti-α′ antibodies. Also, the signals observed for α and α′ in immunoprecipitates using anti-α′ antibodies are very similar (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8). However, when it is considered that α′ is detected less efficiently than α, this result indicates that α′ is more abundant than α in immunoprecipitates performed with anti-α′ antibodies. The α:α′ ratio is 5.3:1 for anti-α immunoprecipitates and is only 0.67:1 for anti-α′ immunoprecipitates. These data reflect an enrichment of α relative to α′ in anti-α immunoprecipitates and a corresponding enrichment of α′ relative to α in anti-α′ immunoprecipitates. Collectively, these results indicate that some of the purified CKII is composed of homotetramers (i.e. α2β and α2′β2). Analysis of material isolated in a second round of immunoprecipitation supports this conclusion (Fig. 2B) as does the analysis of supernatants obtained following one or two rounds of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of purified CKII with subunit-specific antipeptide antibodies. A, pPurified CKII (0.25 μg) was immunoprecipitated using anti-α antibodies (lanes 1-4), anti-α′ antibodies (lanes 5-8), or anti-β antibodies (lane 9). Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using a mixture of anti-α, anti-α′, and anti-β antiserum each at a dilution of 1:1000. Immune complexes were detected with 125I-protein A and visualized by autoradiography. B, supernatants obtained following immunoprecipitation with either anti-α antibodies (lanes 1-3) or anti-α′ antibodies (lanes 4-6) were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with anti-α antibodies (lanes 1 and 4), anti-α′ antibodies (lanes 2 and 5), or anti-β antibodies (lanes 3 and 6). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting as in Panel A. Purified CKII was also analyzed (lane 7, 0.25 μg; lane 8, 0.125 μg). C, supernatants obtained following one or two rounds of immunoprecipitation were subjected to electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting as in Panels A and B. As a standard, purified CKII (0.25 μg) is also analyzed (lane 1). Supernatants are as follows: lane 2, one round of immunoprecipitation with anti-α; lane 3, two rounds of immunoprecipitation with anti-α; lane 4, immunoprecipitation with anti-α followed by anti-α′; lane 5, immunoprecipitation with anti-α followed by anti-β; lane 6, one round of immunoprecipitation with anti-α′; lane 7, immunoprecipitation with anti-α′ followed by anti-α; lane 8, two rounds of immunoprecipitation with anti-α′; lane 9, immunoprecipitation with anti-α′ followed by anti-β; lane 10; one round of immunoprecipitation with anti-β. The positions of the α, α′, and β subunits of CKII are marked as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Supernatants obtained following the first round of immunoprecipitation were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation using anti-α, anti-α′, or anti-β antibodies (Fig. 2B) or were analyzed directly on immunoblots together with supernatants obtained following two rounds of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C). When the supernatant from an anti-α′ immunoprecipitate is subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-α (Fig. 2B, lane 4), the immunoprecipitate contains primarily α and β subunits. The α:α′ ratio of this immunoprecipitate based on 125I content is 5.9:1. Similarly, the supernatant obtained following two rounds of immunoprecipitation with anti-α′ (Fig. 2C, lane 8) demonstrates that α is much more abundant than α′ (α:α′ ratio of 7.5:1). A corresponding enrichment of α′ relative to α is observed in the supernatant obtained following one or two rounds of anti-α immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C, lane 3; α:α′ ratio of 0.3:1) and when the supernatant from an anti-α immunoprecipitation is subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-α′ in the second round (Fig. 2B, lane 2; α:α′ ratio of 0.1:1.0).Analysis of Subunit Interactions with the Two-hybrid SystemTo examine subunit interactions between the various subunits of CKII, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system developed by Fields and Song (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). For these experiments, cDNAs encoding the α, α′, or β subunits of human CKII were each ligated into the pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII vectors described by Durfee et al.(31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) in order to express each subunit as a fusion with the DNA binding domain (pAS1-CYH2) or with the transcriptional activation domain (pACTII) of the yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator. The yeast strain DGY63::171, which expresses β-galactosidase under the control of the GAL1 promoter that is regulated by the GAL4 transcription factor was then cotransformed with different combinations of pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII constructs. Initial experiments were performed to verify that interactions between fusion proteins containing CKII α (or CKII α′) and CKII β could be detected in yeast and to determine whether any of the DNA-binding domain fusions encoded by pAS-CYH2/CKII α, pAS1-CYH2/CKII α′, pAS1-CYH2/CKII β nonspecifically stimulated β-galactosidase expression. Interactions between hybrid proteins are indicated when yeast that are grown on media containing X-gal turn blue because they express β-galactosidase. Yeast that had been cotransformed with combinations of α (or α′) and β hybrids turned blue when grown in the presence of X-gal, indicating that interactions between the CKII subunits can be detected with the two-hybrid system (data not shown). Importantly, β-galactosidase expression was not evident in those yeast expressing only one of the CKII subunit hybrids demonstrating that none of the CKII subunit hybrids can stimulate transcription in the absence of a binding partner (data not shown). To assess interactions between all of the subunits of CKII, yeast were cotransformed with all combinations of pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII constructs encoding each of the CKII subunits (Table I). An indication of interaction between the various fusion proteins was obtained by measuring β-galactosidase activity in extracts prepared from various transformants. All transformants obtained using various combinations of β subunits together with either α or α′ subunits express significant amounts of β-galactosidase activity. The highest β-galactosidase expression is observed when GAL4 DNA binding hybrids of the β subunit are cotransformed with GAL4 transcriptional activation hybrids of either α or α′. Less significant β-galactosidase expression is observed when these hybrid combinations are reversed such that the GAL4 DNA binding hybrids of α or α′ are cotransformed with GAL4 transcriptional activation hybrids of β. Although we do not know why different levels of β-galactosidase expression are achieved when the hybrid combinations are reversed, these results provide as expected, a clear indication that the α or α′ subunits of CKII interact with the β subunit of CKII in the two hybrid system. Interestingly, when yeast are cotransformed with the β subunit hybrid of the GAL4 DNA binding domain together with the β subunit hybrid of the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain, measurements of β-galactosidase expression are comparable to those observed when the GAL4 transcriptional activation hybrid of β is cotransformed into yeast with the GAL4 DNA binding domain hybrids of α or α′. By comparison, minimal β-galactosidase activity was expressed in yeast transformed with various combinations of hybrids encoding α and/or α′. Of these combinations, only yeast cotransformed with GAL4 DNA binding domain and GAL4 transcriptional activation domain hybrids of α expressed measureable activity. However, the activity of this combination was more than 20-fold less than observed for any of the combinations involving hybrids of β.Table ITranscriptional activation by hybrid proteinsTable ITranscriptional activation by hybrid proteinsDISCUSSIONIt is a general feature, although not necessarily a universal feature (i.e. no β subunit has been identified in Dictyostelium) (8Kikkawa U. Mann S.K. Firtel R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5711-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that CKII is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two β subunits and two α and/or α′ subunits. Data obtained in this study using the yeast two-hybrid system indicate that the β subunit can interact with another β subunit, suggesting that the tetrameric CKII complex forms through association between β subunits which brings two α·β and/or α′·β heterodimers into a tetrameric complex (Fig. 3). A low level of β-galactosidase activity is observed in yeast cells cotransformed with GAL4 DNA binding domain fusions of CKII α and with GAL4 transcriptional activation domain fusions of CKII α. However, it is unlikely that α·α interactions are responsible for tetramer formation since no activity is observed when any other combinations of CKII α or CKII α′ are analyzed. If one β subunit were unable to interact with another β subunit, we would predict that CKII would exist as a heterodimer rather than a tetramer.Fig. 3Model of tetrameric CKII complexes. Immunoprecipitations indicate that CKII exists in homotetrameric complexes (α2β2 and α2′β2) and in heterotetrameric complexes (αα′β2). Results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system indicate that tetrameric CKII complexes form through interactions of β subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously demonstrated that the bulk of newly synthesized α subunit is rapidly incorporated into complexes with β subunits (42Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By comparison, the β subunit is synthesized in excess of α and incorporates slowly with α. These observations imply that CKII complex formation would be governed by the availability of α subunit. From data presented here, it appears that formation of the tetrameric CKII complex is mediated through the β subunit and that there are only modest differences (i.e. approximately 2-fold) in the interactions of the α or α′ subunits of CKII with β. Therefore, the incorporation of α or α′ subunits into the tetramer would be determined by the availability of the respective proteins. We do not know whether the assembly of tetrameric CKII is an ordered process. However, since the two hybrid data indicates that β subunits can interact directly, presumably in the absence of α subunits, then formation of β dimers could precede incorporation of α or α′ subunits.At present, distinct functions for CKII α and CKII α′ remain poorly defined. The intracellular localization of the two isozymic forms has been examined by immunofluorescence techniques (9Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In chicken DU249 cells, Krek et al.(10Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggest that there is a great deal of overlap between the localization of α and α′ and that both isozymes are predominantly nuclear. By comparison, Yu et al. (9Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggest that there are dramatic differences between the localization of CKII α and CKII α′. Discrepancies between the two studies are difficult to resolve, but may result from the different experimental systems under examination. The results presented in this study demonstrate that bovine testis CKII exists in homotetrameric complexes (α2β2, α2′β2) and in heterotetrameric complexes (αα′β2) (see Fig. 3). We have previously noted that CKII α′ is much less prominent in other cell lines than it is in testis (28Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that, in systems in which α′ is less abundant than α, α′ is primarily in heterotetrameric (αα′β2) complexes. By comparison, in systems such as testis, where α′ is as abundant as α, then α′ also exists in homotetrameric α′2β2 complexes. Although we do not know the tetrameric composition of the CKII under examination in the studies or Krek et al.(10Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or Yu et al.(9Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), differences in the tetrameric composition of the CKII could determine whether or not α and α′ are actually colocalized. Clearly, it will be of interest to examine the localization of α and α′ in a cell system in which CKII α′ is abundant and a significant proportion of the enzyme is in homotetrameric α2′β2 complexes. A systematic analysis of the unique properties of CKII α and CKII α′ will undoubtedly yield a more complete understanding of the functions of the different tetrameric CKII complexes. INTRODUCTIONCasein kinase II (CKII)1( 1The abbreviations used are: CKIIcasein kinase IIX-galbromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside.) is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is ubiquitously distributed in mammalian tissues and is likely to play an important role in the control of proliferative events (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pinna L.A.

Although its exact biological functions remain poorly understood, genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(4Chen Wu J.L. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Padmanabha R. Chen Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (6Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and in Dictyostelium discoideum(8Kikkawa U. Mann S.K. Firtel R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5711-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all suggest that CKII is essential for viability. Immunofluorscence localization studies have demonstrated that the enzyme is localized within the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells (9Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), observations that are consistent with the demonstration that CKII phosphorylates a variety of proteins in each of these compartments. Of particular relevance to a role in the regulation of proliferation is the demonstration that CKII phosphorylates a host of regulatory nuclear proteins including transcription factors such as the serum response factor, c-Myc, N-Myc, c-Myb, c-Jun, and the tumor suppressor p53 (reviewed in Refs. 3Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127-128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 11Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).CKII is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two α (and/or α′) subunits and two β subunits. The α and α′ subunits contain all of the conserved consensus motifs of protein kinase family members (12Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and have kinase activity (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The precise functions of the β subunit are not known, but β does appear to have a role in regulating the kinase activity of the α subunits (18Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although β enhances protein kinase activity exhibited by α toward most protein substrates, it actually inhibits the phosphorylation of calmodulin (21Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs encoding the α, α′, and β subunits of CKII have been isolated from human and chicken cDNA libraries (13Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that the α and α′ subunits are closely related proteins that are encoded by distinct genes. Between mammals and birds, the α and α′ subunits are very highly conserved with the deduced amino acid sequences of human and chicken α and α′ exhibiting 98 and 97% identity, respectively. The β subunit of CKII exhibits an even greater degree of conservation. Remarkably, the deduced amino acid sequences of human and chicken β are identical and differ from the deduced sequence of frog β by only a single amino acid (14Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Heller-Harrison R.A. Meisner H. Czech M.P.

Hinrichs M.V. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that the functional properties of CKII are highly conserved throughout evolution. Furthermore, these results obviously indicate that the tetrameric structure of CKII is conserved between species.In the present study, we have demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using α- and α′-specific antibodies that mammalian CKII exists as homotetramers (α2β2 or α2′β2) and as heterotetramers (αα′β2). Furthermore, using a yeast two-hybrid system originally described by Fields and Song (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the α or α′ subunits of CKII can interact with the β subunits of CKII, but not with other α or α′ subunits. By comparison, the β subunits of CKII can interact with α, α′, or β subunits. These results indicate that the formation of the CKII holoenzyme involves dimerization of β subunits to bring two αβ or α′β heterodimers into a tetrameric complex."

M., and Fall, R.(1991) Plant Physiol. 97, 1588-1591). This enzyme, isoprene synthase, has now been purified 4000-fold to near homogeneity. The enzyme had a native molecular mass of 98-137 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.7 and contained 58- and 62-kDa subunits, implying that it is a heterodimer. Partial amino acid sequences of the two subunits indicated they are closely related to each other and that they do not share a strong homology with any other reported proteins. The isoprene synthase reaction was dependent on Mg2+ or Mn2+, and the reaction products were shown to be isoprene and pyrophosphate with a stoichiometry close to 1:1. The Km for DMAPP was high at 8 mM, and the kcat of 1.7 s−1 was low, but similar to those of other allylic diphosphate-utilizing enzymes. It is argued that the isoprene synthase reaction may be much more efficient in vivo, where it is under light-dependent control. It seems probable that this unique enzyme, rather than non-enzymatic reactions, can account for the emission of hundreds of millions of metric tons of isoprene from plants to the global atmosphere each year.

https://openalex.org/W1604414616,"Prosaposin, recently identified as a neurotrophic factor (1), is die precursor of saposins A, B, C, and D. The neurotrophic activity of prosaposin resides in the saposin C domain. We have pinpointed the active sequence to a linear 12-mer located in the NH2-terminal sequence of saposin C (LIDNNKTEKEIL). Nanomolar concentrations of a 22-mer peptide encompassing this region stimulated neurite outgrowth and choline acetyl- transferase activity, and prevented cell death in neuroblastoma cells. In primary cerebellar granule cells, the 22-mer also stimulated neurite outgrowth. Studies of the neuroblastoma line NS20Y using a radiolabeled 18-mer from the neurotrophic region identified a high-affinity (Kd = 70 pM) binding site indicative of receptor-ligand interaction. The 22-mer stimulated protein phosphorylation of several proteins, some of which were tyrosine- phosphorylated after brief exposure similar to saposin C. Circular dichroism studies demonstrated that the 22-mer was converted from a random to a helical structure by addition of ganglioside GM1. The results are consistent with receptor-ligand binding by the peptide initiating a signal transduction cascade and resulting in neuronal differentiation.—O'Brien, J. S., Carson, G.

GPIs are assembled in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, then transferred to protein in the lumen of that organelle, after which the GPI-anchored proteins are transported to the cell surface via the secretory pathway. GPIs have been proposed to be a signal in protein targeting (3Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), to participate in signal transduction by promoting clustering of the receptor proteins they anchor with other proteins in trans-membrane signaling pathways (4Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Lipke P.N. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 42-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Studies of GPI anchoring-deficient cells should shed light on both the function and synthesis of GPI anchors. A number of mutant mammalian cell lines have been isolated that fail to express GPI-anchored proteins on their cell surface (7Hyman R.

These mutant cell lines include three complementation groups that are defective in GlcNAc-PI synthesis, namely mutants defective in the PIG-A and GPI-H genes, as well the Thy-1 Class C murine lymphoma mutant (14Armstrong C. Schubert J. Ueda E. Knez J.J. Gelperin D. Hirose S. Silber R. Hollan S. Schmidt R.E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25347-25351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stevens V.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12119-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We set out to explore the synthesis and function of GPI anchors in genetically tractable eukaryotic microbes and developed a way to identify yeast GPI anchoring mutants in which colonies are screened for those defective in the incorporation of [3H]inositol into protein (18Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gpi1 mutant, which was identified in this way, is temperature sensitive both for growth and for [3H]inositol incorporation into protein and lacks the in vitro activity that catalyzes the first step in GPI synthesis, the formation of GlcNAc-PI. Our finding that the gpi1 mutant was temperature sensitive prompted us to screen a collection of temperature-sensitive yeast mutants for further strains defective in [3H]inositol incorporation into protein, hence in GPI anchoring. We report here the isolation of two further mutants, gpi2 and gpi3, which are defective in vitro in the synthesis of GlcNAc-PI. The GPI2 gene encodes a protein that does not resemble any protein known so far to participate in GPI synthesis, whereas the gpi3 mutant is defective in the yeast counterpart of PIG-A (19Fassler J.S.

Abelson J. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was obtained from the laboratory of J. Abelson. The primary isolates of the two GPI anchoring-deficient mutants identified in this collection and studied further were SS328-27 and SS328-53, whose genotype was MAT α ade2-101 his3 Δ200 lys2-801 ura3-52. These strains harbor, respectively, the gpi2 and gpi3 mutations. Strains 27-5A (gpi2 ura3-52 MATa), 27-5D (gpi2 ade2 ura3-52 MATa), and 53-12C (gpi3, lys2 MATa) were segregants from the second outcross of the gpi2 and gpi3 mutations. Strain 27-1C (gpi2 ura3-52 MATa) was a segregant from the third outcross of the gpi2 mutation and used for integrative mapping of the GPI2 locus.Growth media and materials were as described in Ref. 18Leidich S.D.

The filter-bound, radiolabeled cell patches were then extracted with ethanol/water/diethylether/pyridine/NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018 by volume) to remove all background signal due to [3H]inositol-labeled lipids. Remaining protein-linked [3H]inositol was then detected by fluorography.[3H]Inositol Labeling of Protein and Lipids-[3H]Inositol labeling of protein and lipids for subsequent separation, respectively, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography was carried out as detailed in Ref. 18Leidich S.D.

Palmitoyl CoA-dependent acylation of inositol in GlcN-PI was assayed by incubating membranes with TLC-purified [14C]GlcN-PI and 0.14 mM palmitoyl CoA (23Costello L.C. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8599-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Cloning of the GPI2 GeneA yeast genomic DNA library constructed in the centromeric plasmid YCp50 (24Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) was introduced into the gpi2 ura3 strain 27-5D using the lithium acetate transformation protocol (22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Uracil-prototrophic transformants were selected at 25°C, some 30,000 being obtained. When colonies of transformants just became visible (after 24-30 h of growth), the agar plates spread with the transformants were shifted to 37°C, and incubation was continued at this temperature. Plasmids were isolated from those colonies that continued to grow at 37°C.Molecular Biological Techniques and DNA Sequence AnalysisStandard procedures were used for the propagation and selection of plasmids and the growth of their bacterial hosts and for the subcloning of DNA fragments (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To locate the GPI2-complementing DNA sequence, restriction fragments of complementing plasmid pGC2-8.5 were subcloned into the yeast 2 micron shuttle vector pRS426 (26Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Cells of gpi2 ura3 strain 27-5D transformed with plasmids containing these different restriction fragments were tested for restoration of their ability to grow at 37°C.DNA sequencing was carried out using the dideoxy chain termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52363) Google Scholar) according to the double-stranded sequencing protocol described in the U. S. Biochemicals Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit. DNA fragments cloned into plasmid pRS426 were used as templates. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the Genetic Engineering Facility (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Analyses of DNA and protein sequence data were performed using the DNA Strider 1.1 program (28Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar).For Southern blot analyses, total chromosomal DNA was isolated from the untransformed Ura− diploid and from two Ura+ transformants, essentially as described in Ref. 22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar. DNA was digested with HindIII (6 units/μg), electrophoresed through 1% agarose, and transferred (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA was cross-linked to the membrane using a UV Stratalinker™ 1800 (Stratagene) delivering 120,000 μJ of ultraviolet radiation. The probe used was a 1.4-kilobase HindIII-SalI fragment containing the COOH-terminal half of the GPI2 gene, which was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using the Genius™ random-primed DNA labeling and detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Membranes were prehybridized in a rotating oven (National Labnet Co. Woodbridge. NJ) at 65°C for 2 h with 25 ml of 5 × SSC containing 0.1% (v/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, and 1.0% blocking reagent. Digoxigenin-labeled probe was added to the prehybridization solution at a concentration of approximately 30 ng/ml and was allowed to hybridize to the membranes overnight at 65°C. Membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 65°C and then twice with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65°C. Hybridized DNA fragments were detected using anti-digoxigenin antiserum and Lumi-Phos™ 530, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim).Disruption of the GPI2 GeneThe γ transformation technique (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to disrupt the GPI2 gene. An EcoRI-SalI fragment containing the 5′-portion of the GPI2 gene and a HincII-EcoRI fragment encoding the GPI2 3′-sequence were subcloned in tandem, but in reverse order, in the SalI and SmaI sites of the yeast-integrating vector pRS406 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), creating a unique EcoRI site between the two segments of GPI2 sequence (Fig. 6A). The EcoRI site in the HincII-EcoRI fragment is derived from polylinker sequence in the plasmid from which the fragment was excised. Construction of this plasmid, pgpi2::URA3, resulted in the deletion of a 167-base pair SalI-HincII portion of the coding region of GPI2. Plasmid pgpi2::URA3 was linearized by digestion with EcoRI and used to transform the Ura− diploid strain 9933-13A × XM37-10C. Ura+ transformants were selected, and two independent Ura+ diploids were analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm that the disrupted copy of GPI2 had been integrated at the expected chromosomal locus.RESULTSBiochemical Characterization of Two New GPI Anchoring MutantsSince the GlcNAc-PI synthesis-defective gpi1 mutant was temperature sensitive for growth, we reasoned that mutations in further genes encoding proteins involved in GPI synthesis could also give rise to conditional lethality. We therefore screened patches of cells from a bank of 940 temperature-sensitive mutants (21Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) for further strains defective in the incorporation of [3H]inositol into protein (18Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We focus here on two new GPI anchoring mutants we have identified. Biochemical analyses were carried out on the primary isolates, strains SS328-27 and SS328-53, and on haploid segregants obtained after the second outcross of these mutants to wild type strains (strains 27-5A and 53-12C).Mutants 27-5A and 53-12C showed a temperature-sensitive defect in [3H]inositol incorporation into protein, as did gpi1 (Fig. 1). Analysis of lipids radiolabeled with [3H]inositol at 25 and 38°C showed that strains 27-5A and 53-12C, like gpi1, incorporated substantial amounts of [3H]inositol into P[3H]I and are therefore affected in neither the uptake of [3H]inositol nor in the synthesis of P[3H]I, the immediate precursor of GPIs (Fig. 2). In all three mutants, incubation at high temperature had a similar effect on certain lipids that are not GPI precursors; incorporation of [3H]inositol into lyso-PIs and mannosyl di-inositol phosphoceramide was lowered. However, [3H]inositol incorporation into mannosyl di-inositol phosphoceramide was also perturbed at high temperature in the wild type strain, and formation of mannosyl inositol phosphoceramide, the precursor of mannosyl di-inositol phosphoceramide, was not affected in the mutants. These perturbations in the synthesis of certain [3H]inositol-labeled lipids may therefore be a secondary effect of the temperature shift and cessation of growth of the mutants.Fig. 1Three yeast mutants with a temperature-sensitive block in [3H]inositol incorporation into protein. Cultures of gpi1-8A, 27-5A (gpi2), and 53-12-C (gpi3) were grown at 25°C and divided into two equal portions, one of which was shifted to 38°C for 20 min. The shifted and control cultures were then radiolabeled with 100 μCi of [3H]inositol/ml for 40 min at 38 and 25°C, respectively, after which radiolabeled proteins were extracted and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 3H-labeled proteins were made visible by fluorography.

To establish whether the mutants have a specific defect early in the GPI synthetic pathway, we assayed for in vitro GPI biosynthetic activities. Membranes from the two candidate mutants were incubated with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, and radiolabeled lipids were extracted and separated by TLC. Whereas wild type membranes synthesized the first two yeast GPI precursors, [14C]GlcNAc-PI and [14C]GlcN-PI (18Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lanes1 and 5), membranes from isolates SS328-27 and SS328-53 made neither (Fig. 3, lanes3, 4, 7, and 8) and therefore, like the control gpi1 membranes (Fig. 3, lanes2 and 6), are defective in GlcNAc-PI synthesis.Fig. 3Mutant membranes lack in vitro GlcNAc-PI synthetic activity but show enhanced synthesis of Dol-PP-GlcNAc1-2. Washed mixed membranes were prepared from wild type strain PP-1B and from mutant strains gpi1-8A, SS328-27, and SS328-53, which had all been grown at 25°C. Glycosyltransferase assays and subsequent thin layer chromatographic separation of radiolabeled lipids were performed as detailed in Refs. 18Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol.

Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A straightforward explanation of this is that more UDP-[14C]GlcNAc is available to the first two enzymes of the asparagine-linked glycosylation pathway, which also use this sugar nucleotide as donor. When membranes from isolates SS328-27 and SS328-53 were incubated with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc in the absence of tunicamycin, they, like gpi1 membranes, made larger amounts of Dol-PP-GlcNAc1-2 (Fig. 3lanes6-8). This result indicates that the defect in the two new mutants is indeed in UDP-GlcNAc utilization.Mutant membranes were also tested for their ability to carry out the next two steps in the GPI synthetic pathway, deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI to GlcN-PI and then acylation of GlcN-PI to yield GlcN-(acylinositol)PI; both activities were present in the mutant membranes (not shown). Levels of activity of Dol-P-Man synthase, a glycosyltransferase of the endoplasmic reticulum that is required for GPI synthesis in yeast in vivo(30Orlean P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5796-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), were similar in mutant and wild type membranes (Fig. 3, lanes 9-12).Genetic Characterization of the MutantsIn crosses of isolates SS328-27 and SS328-53 to wild type strains, it was established that the mutations in these strains were recessive and that the [3H]inositol-labeling defect and temperature sensitivity for growth cosegregated in three successive back-crosses. Further crosses showed that the two new GPI anchoring mutants, SS328-27 and SS328-53, and the gpi1 mutant are in separate linkage groups. Mutants SS328-27 and SS328-53 will henceforth be designated gpi2 and gpi3, respectively. The temperature sensitivity of the three mutants could not be suppressed upon increasing the osmolarity of the medium by supplementation with either 0.25 M KCl or 1 M sorbitol; the GPI anchoring mutants are therefore not osmotically remedial.Haploid strains containing pairs of GPI anchoring mutations are not viable. gpi1, gpi2, and gpi3 haploids were mated to one another, and the resulting gpi1/gpi2, gpi1/gpi3, and gpi2/gpi3 diploids were induced to sporulate. Asci from 23 gpi1/gpi2, 21 gpi1/gpi3, and 20 gpi2/gpi3 diploids were dissected and allowed to germinate at 25°C on YPD medium. The patterns of viability of the haploid segregants and of the segregation of temperature sensitivity among the viable haploids were diagnostic of double mutant lethality. Thus, where tetrads yielded two viable and two non-viable haploids, both viable haploids grew at 37°C. Where tetrads yielded three viable and one inviable haploid, one segregant grew at 37°C, and the other two were temperature sensitive for growth. Where all four haploid segregants were viable at 25°C, they were all temperature sensitive. The same results were obtained when the ascospores were dissected onto YPD medium supplemented with either 0.25 M KCl or with 1 M sorbitol; the double gpi mutants are therefore not osmotically remedial at 25°C.The gpi3 Mutant Is Defective in the Yeast Counterpart of the Human PIG-A GeneThe gpi3 mutant proved to be in the same complementation group as the spt14 mutant, which had previously been isolated in a screen for extragenic suppressors of the histidine auxotrophy caused by the his4-917 transposon insertion mutation upstream of the yeast HIS4 gene (31Fassler J.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1988; 118: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the Spt14 protein (19Fassler J.S. Gray W. Lee J.P. Yu G. Gingerich G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) shows 44% identity to the product of the PIG-A gene, the latter having been cloned by complementation of a GlcNAc-PI synthesis-deficient human cell line (20Miyata T.

An activity to activate a recombinant rat SAPKα was detected in extracts obtained from rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells exposed to hyperosmolar media and was resolved into unadsorbed and adsorbed fractions on Q-Sepharose chromatography. The adsorbed activity was identified as XMEK2/SEK1/MKK4 by using several anti-XMEK2 antibodies. Thus, a 45-kDa protein that was recognized specifically by these anti-XMEK2 antibodies co-eluted with the SAPKα activating activity during chromatography on Q-Sepharose and Superose 6, and the activity could be immunoprecipitated by the antibodies from these fractions. The unadsorbed activity, whose level was much greater than that of the adsorbed activity, did not contain XMEK2/SEK1/MKK4 and was also activated in a time-dependent manner by osmotic shock. This activity was further resolved into several peaks during chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite. Most of these peaks eluted separately from major peaks of a kinase activity toward p38/MPK2, another subgroup of the MAPK superfamily, whereas the activated XMEK2/SEK1/MKK4 could phosphorylate p38/MPK2 efficiently. These results indicate the existence of multiple activators for SAPK/JNK; one is XMEK2/SEK1/MKK4, and the others are previously undescribed factors.

https://openalex.org/W2043663222,"Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of proteins that include IRF-1, IRF-2, and ISGF3γ which share sequence similarity at the putative DNA binding domain (DBD). ICSBP is expressed exclusively in cells of the immune system and acts as a repressor of interferon consensus sequence (ICS) containing promoters that can be alleviated by interferons. In this communication, we have searched for functional domains of ICSBP by dissecting the DBD from the repression activity. The putative DBD of ICSBP (amino acids 1-121) when fused in frame to the transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex VP16 (ICSBP-VP16) is a very strong activator of ICS-containing promoters. In addition, ICSBP-VP16 fusion construct transfected into adenovirus (Ad) 12 transformed cells enabled cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens as did treatment with interferon. On the other hand, the DBD of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 was fused in frame to a truncated ICSBP in which the DBD was impaired resulting in a chimeric construct GAL4-ICSBP. This construct is capable of repressing promoters containing GAL4 binding sites. Thus, ICSBP contains at least two independent domains: a DBD and a transcriptional repressor domain. Furthermore, we have tested possible interactions between ICSBP and IRFs. The chimeric construct GAL4-ICSBP inhibited the stimulated effect of IRF-1 on a reporter gene, implying for a possible interaction between IRF-1 and ICSBP. Electromobility shift assays, demonstrated that ICSBP can associate with IRF-2 or IRF-1 in vitro as well as in vivo. Thus, ICSBP contains a third functional domain that enables the association with IRFs. These associations are probably important for the fine balance between positive and negative regulators involved in the interferon-mediated signal transduction pathways in cells of the immune system."

Editing occurs in the intestine only in most mammals, and in both the liver and intestine in a few mammalian species including mouse. We have cloned the cDNA for the mouse apoB mRNA editing protein, apobec1. Expression of mouse apobec1 cDNA in HepG2 cells results in the editing of the intracellular apoB mRNA. The cDNA predicts a 229-amino acid protein showing 92, 66, and 70% identity to the rat, rabbit, and human proteins, respectively. Based on the estimated values of divergence of apobec1 sequences in terms of the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per site, we found that apobec1 is a fairly rapidly evolving protein. Sequence comparison among mammalian apobec1 sequences has permitted the identification of seven conserved regions that may be functionally important for editing activity. We present a phylogenetic tree relating apobec1 sequences to double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase and other nucleotide/nucleoside deaminases. Northern blot analysis indicates that apobec1 mRNA exists in two different sizes, a ∼2.2-kilobase (kb) form in small intestine and a ∼2.4-kb form in liver, spleen, kidney, lung, muscle, and heart. To study the molecular basis for the different sized apobec1 mRNAs, we cloned the apobec1 gene and characterized its exon-intron organization together with the sequences expressed in the hepatic and intestinal mRNA. The mouse apobec1 gene contains 8 exons and spans ∼25 kb, and is located in chromosome 6. The major hepatic mRNA contains all 8 exons, whereas the major small intestinal mRNA misses the first 3 exons and its transcription is initiated in exon 4. The intestinal mRNA also contains at its 5′ end a unique 102-nucleotide piece that is absent in the liver mRNA. We also identified two alternatively spliced hepatic apobec1 mRNAs with different acceptor sites in exon 4.

ApoB mRNA editing involves a single base C→U conversion of the first base of a codon CAA, encoding Gln-2153, in apoB-100 mRNA, to UAA, a translational termination codon, in apoB-48 mRNA. The unedited mRNA encodes apoB-100, which contains 4536 amino acid residues, whereas the edited mRNA encodes apoB-48, which contains 2152 residues. In humans, apoB-100 is synthesized exclusively in the liver, and is an essential component of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its metabolic products, intermediate density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (12Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB-48 is synthesized in the small intestine in all mammals, and is an obligatory structural component of chylomicrons (12Chan L. J. Biol.

In rats and mice, apoB-48 is also synthesized in the liver and apoB-48 can be detected in hepatic VLDL particles in these animals. However, apoB-48-containing VLDL particles do not contribute to LDL production (13Van't Hooft F.M. Hardman D.A. Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rat hepatic and small intestinal apobec1 mRNAs differ significantly in size, being predominantly 1.24 kb in the liver and 1.0 kb in the small intestine (24Teng B.-B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The genomic structure of rat apobec1 and the molecular basis for the size difference between mRNAs from the two tissues are currently unknown. In this article, we have cloned the cDNA and genomic sequences of mouse apobec1. The cDNA predicts a 229-residue protein. Computational analysis of apobec1 sequence from different mammalian species indicates that it is a fairly rapidly evolving protein. Seven regions of relative sequence conservation can be identified. Mouse apobec1 mRNA is expressed in small intestine, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, muscle, and heart. It shows tissue-specific size difference in that the predominant hepatic mRNA is ∼2.4 kb (which is similar to that in other tissues except small intestine), and the major small intestinal mRNA is ∼2.2 kb. To investigate the molecular basis for this observation, we determined the structure of the apobec1 chromosomal gene and the structure of the mRNAs expressed in the two tissues. Our analysis indicates that the apobec1 gene is located in mouse chromosome 6. It contains 8 exons and spans ∼25 kb. We found that the major hepatic mRNA contains all 8 exons. In contrast, the major small intestinal mRNA misses the first 3 exons and its transcription is initiated in exon 4 with the mRNA containing exon 4→8. Exon 4 contained a 102-nt piece unique to the 5′ end of intestinal mRNA. Two alternatively spliced mRNAs with different acceptor sites in exon 4 were also identified in the hepatic species. Transient expression studies using promoter-reporter constructs in transfected cells indicate that the 5′-flanking sequences of the liver mRNA (i.e. upstream of exon 1) have predominantly hepatic promoter activity and the 5′-flanking sequences of the small intestinal mRNA (i.e. upstream of exon 4) have preferential intestinal promoter activity. Our studies provide information on unique aspects of apobec1 gene expression that will be useful for future investigations on the tissue-specific regulation and evolutionary basis of RNA editing in mammals. A λZAP II mouse small intestine cDNA library and a λZAP liver cDNA library (Stratagene) were screened with a 0.7-kb fragment of the rat apobec1 cDNA amplified from rat liver poly(A) RNA by reverse transcription-PCR described previously (28Lau P.P.

A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 plaque-forming units were screened from the small intestine cDNA library; seven clones were identified. Three positive clones (λEPS 4, λEPS 5, and λEPS 17) were chosen for further analysis. We screened a total of 1.4 × 106 plaque-forming units from the liver cDNA library and identified five independent cDNA clones. All five were characterized by restriction mapping and the two longest clones (λEPL 28, and λEPL 31) were chosen for complete sequence analysis. Sequencing of cDNAs subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) was performed with the dideoxy chain termination technique (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The sequences presented have been established from data obtained from multiple sequence determinations and, for the most part, from both DNA strands. The protein coding region of mouse apobec1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotides. The sequences of oligonucleotides were 5′-GAAGGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGAGTTCCGAGACAGGCCC-3′ for the 5′ upstream primer, and 5′-CGCGGGAATTCTCCCAGAAGTCATTTCAACCCT-3′ for the 3′ downstream primer. The 5′ forward primer contained Kozak consensus sequence at the translation initiation site (32Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). Artificial BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites (underlined) were incorporated in these sequences for cloning purposes. The PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript II KS and sequenced. The insert was removed by digestion with ClaI and BamHI and subcloned into the BglII and ClaI sites of the expression vector pCMV4 (33Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J.

HepG2 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-cm culture dishes the day before transfection. Transfection was carried out with 3.8 μg of pCMV4 containing mouse apobec1 cDNA and 0.2 μg of pMC1neo poly(A) (Stratagene) by using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in media supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). After 3 weeks, G418-resistant colonies were transferred to a 24-well plate. Finally they were grown in 6-well plates. We prepared total cellular RNA using Ultraspec II and screened for the expression of apobec1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. The RNA preparation was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Stratagene), then proteinase K, extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and suspended in water. Total apoB mRNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Reverse transcription was performed at 42°C for 30 min in a total volume of 10 μl of reverse transcriptase buffer containing 1 × PCR buffer II (Perkin-Elmer), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 250 μM each dNTP, 25 pmol of 3′ downstream oligonucleotide (5′-CACGGATATGATAGTGCTCATCAAGAC-3′), 40 mM dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 20 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). At the end of the reaction, each reaction mixture was added to a tube containing 40 μl of a solution containing (1 × PCR buffer II, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 187.5 μM each dNTP, 25 pmol of 5′ upstream primer (5′-CTGACTGCTCTLACAAAAAAGTATAGA-3′), and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega)). PCR was performed for 35 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 20 s at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C. For each RNA sample, a negative control was run in the absence of reverse transcriptase. The degree of editing was determined by primer extension assay (18Driscoll D.M. Wynne J.K. Wallis S.C. Scott J. Cell. 1989; 58: 519-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34Wu J.H. Semenkovich C.F. Chen S.-H. Li W.-H. Chan L. J. Biol.

One to two μl (∼50 ng) of purified PCR products was denatured for 5 min in boiling water under 10 μl of mineral oil and annealed for 30 min at 37°C in a 7-μl solution containing 2 μl of 5 × first strand synthesis buffer (Life Technologies), 5 × 104 cpm of human apoB complementary oligonucleotide (5′-ATCATAACTATCTTTAATATACTGA-3′) 5′-end labeled by [γ-32P]ATP. After annealing, 1 μl of 1 M dithiothreitol, 0.5 μl of 10 mM dATP, dCTP, and dTTP, 1 μl of 5 mM ddGTP, and 20 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase were added in a total volume of 3 μl and primer extension was performed for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of sequence loading buffer. The extension product was heated for 10 min at 70°C and loaded on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to XAR-5 film and the autoradiograph was scanned by densitometer. We isolated total mouse RNA from the small intestine and the liver by Ultraspec RNA Isolation System (Biotecx). Poly(A) RNA was prepared by using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2 μg of poly(A) RNA was size-fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel in MOPS buffer (20 mM), pH 7.0, transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham). This membrane and the multiple tissue Northern blot membrane (Mouse MTN Blot 7762-1, Clontech) were probed by a random-primed 32P-labeled mouse apobec1 cDNA probe (complete coding region) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The filters were hybridized at 42°C for 16 h and then washed sequentially with 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS, and 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and finally with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. (1 × SSC = 15 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 9.0.) The filters were exposed to x-ray films with two intensifying screens at −80°C for 24-72 h. The rat, rabbit, and human apoB mRNA editing protein sequences were retrieved from the GenBank data base by using the NCBI Retrieve e-mail server (35Benson D. Lipman D. Ostell J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2963-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The numbers of the non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions per site between sequences were estimated by the Li (36Li W.-H. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) method. To identify conserved regions within the sequences of the apoB mRNA editing protein, the sliding window approach was applied to the alignment of these sequences. For every window, the average proportion of differences per sequence pair per window position was computed and assigned to the position in the middle of the window. To study the relationships among the apoB mRNA editing proteins and different nucleotide and nucleoside deaminases, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed on the basis of a region conserved among the different groups of sequences. Search for homologous sequences was performed throughout the GenBank (35Benson D. Lipman D. Ostell J.

Sequences were extracted by using the NCBI Retrieve e-mail server. The total number of sequences included in the analysis was 20, including apobec1 sequences from four mammalian species. Two human apobec1 sequences were included because there were minor differences between them. The sequences examined and their identification numbers are listed in Table I.Table IList of sequences used for phylogenetic analysis The region of homology among different sequences was identified after the sequences were aligned by the manual alignment program from the VOSTORG package for phylogenetic analysis (41Zharkikh A.A.

In total, 34 positions with reliable alignment were used for the tree inference. The tree was inferred on the basis of amino acid distances. The observed proportions of differences between sequences were corrected for multiple substitutions by the empirical formula (42Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, NY1983Crossref Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was inferred by the neighbor-joining method (43Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The root position was determined by the UPGMA method (44Sneath P.H.A. Sokai R.R. Numerical Taxonomy, The Principles and Practice of Numerical Classification. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1973Google Scholar). We screened a total of 1.5 × 106 plaque-forming units of a λ DASH II mouse genomic library (Stratagene) with the 32P-labeled mouse apobec1 cDNA probe and identified three mouse apobec1 subgenomic clones (λ mgE5, λ mgE7, and λ mgE9). Subgenomic DNA fragments carrying exons and the 5′-flanking region were characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blotting. After subcloning into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene), the sequences of exons, exon/intron boundaries, and the 5′-flanking region were determined. We purchased the BSS panel 2 Southern blot filter sets from the Jackson Laboratory, ME. These contain DNA from panels of 94 backcross animals from the cross ((C57BL6/Ei × SPRET/Ei) × SPRET/Ei). Mouse apobec1 cDNA was 32P-labeled by random priming and used as hybridization probe. The conditions for prehybridization, hybridization, and subsequent washes were those recommended by the Jackson Laboratory. The filters were exposed to x-ray films at −80°C for 72 h. A HindIII-AvaI fragment of subgenomic DNA (276 bp) including exon 4 and its 5′-flanking region was subcloned into SmaI site of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene), and cut with EcoRI to generate linearized DNA template. An antisense RNA probe was synthesized using the DNA template, T7 RNA polymerase [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and T3/T7 in vitro Transcription System (Clontech). We performed RNase protection assays by using RPA II kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 6 μg of poly(A) RNA were hybridized with 3 × 104 cpm of the 32P-labeled RNA probe at 55°C for 16 h after denaturation at 90°C for 5 min. The annealed mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with RNase (A/T1). The protected fragments were precipitated and analyzed on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. An EcoRI-HindIII subgenomic DNA fragment including exon 1 and its 5′-flanking region (1598-bp 5′-flanking DNA + 72-bp exon 1) was subcloned into the HindIII site of pCAT-Basic Vector (Promega) and pCAT-Enhancer Vector (Promega) to be tested for promoter activity. These plasmids were designated pCAT-EX1 and pCAT-EX1E, respectively. A PstI-PstI DNA fragment including exon 4 and its 5′-flanking region (1575-bp 5′-flanking DNA + 168-bp intestinal exon 4) was also subcloned into the PstI site of pCAT-Basic and pCAT-Enhancer, designated pCAT-EX4 and pCAT-EX4E, respectively. As a positive control, we used pCAT-Promoter Vector (Promega), which contains an SV40 promoter upstream from the CAT gene of pCAT-Basic. HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with Earle's salts, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acid solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Caco-2 (a human intestinal carcinoma cell line) cells were cultured in minimal essential medium with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acid, 20% fetal bovine serum, and were used at confluency for 1 week (45Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All cultures were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2. Media for all cultures routinely included 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/"

To determine whether PH domain peptides would behave as antagonists of Gβγ subunit-mediated signal transduction in intact cells, plasmid minigene constructs encoding these PH domains were prepared, which permit transient cellular expression of the peptides.

When this portion of the k receptor was replaced by that of the μ receptor, affinities of μ selective agonists, DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Gly-ol), PL017 (Tyr-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2), sufentanil, and morphine, were greatly increased as compared to those for the k receptor.

It has been now well established that HDLs constitute a collection of particles that vary in size, density, and composition. In particular, the two major HDL apolipoproteins, i.e. apoA-I and apoA-II, define two major populations of particles which contain either both apoA-I and apoA-II, designated LpA-I/A-II, or apoA-I and no apoA-II, designated LpA-I (2Cheung M.C.

Conflicting observations might relate to the heterogeneity of lipoprotein substrates used, i.e. native HDL or reconstituted particles.

It results therefore that neither native HDL nor reconstituted phospholipid emulsions may constitute ideal models for determining the specific effects of HDL apolipoproteins on cellular cholesterol efflux. In the former case, LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II isolated directly from human plasma do not vary only in their apoA-I and apoA-II content but also in their size and lipid composition (29James R.W.

It is possible to circumvent some of the concerns linked to the use of native HDL by preparing phospholipid/apoA-I and phospholipid/apoA-II discoidal complexes with similar size and phospholipid/protein mass ratio (14Mahlberg F.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in that latter case, recombinant particles do not match exactly the overall structure and composition of native particles, a drawback that may alter the conformational state of apolipoproteins (33Curtiss L.K.

In addition to alterations in lipoprotein substrates, diversity of selected cell types may account for discrepancies among reported cholesterol efflux measurements (14Mahlberg F.H. Glick J.M.

The present study was focused on the influence of apoA-I and apoA-II on cellular cholesterol efflux independently on the structure and lipid composition of HDL particles. To this end, apoA-I was progressively replaced by apoA-II in ultracentrifugally isolated HDL3 particles without inducing changes in other remaining lipoprotein components, a strategy that has been used previously in our laboratory to compare the effects of apoA-I and apoA-II on cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell line used in the present study was the Fu5AH rat hepatoma, which has been shown previously to constitute a convenient and reproducible model for measurement of free cholesterol surface transfer (39Phillips M.C. McLean L.R. Stoudt G.W. Rothblat G.H. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 36: 409-422Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By using that experimental system, the ability of HDL3 particles to promote cellular cholesterol efflux was shown to be significantly influenced by their apoA-I and apoA-II content. Blood from healthy normolipidemic volunteers was collected into tubes containing EDTA-Na2 (final concentration, 1 mg/ml), and plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 4°C. Subsequently, HDL3 were isolated as the plasma fraction of density 1.13-1.21 g/ml by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL3 containing only apoA-I (HDL3-A-I) were separated from HDL3 containing apoA-I and apoA-II (HDL3-A-I/A-II) by chromatography on an anti-apoA-II column as described previously (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass in the immunopurified HDL3-A-I particles was constantly lower than 5%. HDL3 were progressively enriched with apoA-II according to the general procedure previously described (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, apoA-II-enriched HDL3 was prepared by replacing apoA-I by apoA-II upon the incubation of HDL3 in the presence of increasing amounts of delipidated HDL apolipoproteins (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HDL3 protein to apoHDL ratio ranged between 1:0 and 1:4, allowing to obtain HDL3 particles with increasing apoA-II:apoA-I+apoA-II percentage mass (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed by using SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, apoA-I and apoA-II were virtually the only proteins present in the isolated HDL3 fractions (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by using rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells following the procedure previously described by de la Llera Moya and co-workers (16de la Llera Moya M. Atger V. Paul J.L. Fournier N. Moatti N. Giral P. Friday K.E. Rothblat G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% calf serum. 20,000 Fu5AH cells/ml were plated on 2.4 cm multiwell plates (Linbro, Polylabo) using 2 ml/well. Two days after plating, cellular cholesterol (approximately 25 μg/well) was labeled during a 48-h incubation with [3H]cholesterol (NEN, Dupont de Nemours) (1 μCi/well). To allow equilibration of the label, the cells were rinsed and incubated for 24 h in MEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. For determination of cholesterol efflux, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37°C with isolated HDL fractions diluted in MEM without albumin supplementation. At the end of the efflux period, medium was removed and centrifugated. Cell monolayer was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 0.5 ml of 0.1 mol/liter NaOH. Finally, radioactivity was measured in both medium and cells, allowing to determine the total radioactivity content in each well. Fractional cholesterol efflux, expressed as percent, was calculated as the amount of label recovered in the medium divided by the total label in each well. HDL particle size was determined by electrophoresis in 1.5-25.0 g/liter polyacrylamide gradient gels according to the general procedure previously described (40Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 1085: 209-216Google Scholar). Mean apparent diameters of HDL fractions were determined by comparisons with protein standards (high molecular weight protein calibration kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which were submitted to electrophoresis together with the samples. Chemical assays were performed on a Cobas-Fara Centrifugal Analyzer (Roche). Total cholesterol, unesterified cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid concentrations were measured by enzymatic methods using Boehringer Mannheim reagents. Concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II were determined by immunoturbidimetry (41Rifai N. King M.E. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with anti-apoA-I and anti-apoA-II antibodies purchased from Behringwerke AG (Marburg, Germany). ApoA-I standard was purchased from Behringwerke AG. ApoA-II standard was purchased from Immuno AG (Vienna, Austria). One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of the difference between data means. Coefficients of correlation, r and ρ, were calculated by using linear regression and Spearman rank correlation analysis, respectively. Incubation of ultracentrifugally isolated HDL3 in the presence of increasing concentrations of delipidated HDL3 apolipoproteins (native HDL3:delipidated HDL3 protein ratio ranging between 1:0 and 1:4) induced the progressive replacement of apoA-I by apoA-II (Table I). As reported previously when substituting apoA-II for apoA-I in canine HDL3(42Lagocki P.A. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3701-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apoA-I-phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol complexes (43Rosseneu M. Van Tornout P. Lievens M.-J. Assman G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and human HDL (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol.

Acta. 1983; 751: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), approximately two molecules of apoA-II displaced one molecule of apoA-I from HDL3. In agreement with previous observations from our laboratory (38Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apoA-II enrichment was not accompanied by significant changes in the lipid composition of HDL3 (Table I).Table IComposition (mass percent) of HDL3 after enrichment with apoA-II In order to set up appropriate experimental conditions to compare the effect of various HDL particles on cholesterol efflux, Fu5AH cells were incubated for up to 24 h in the presence of HDL3 containing various proportions of apoA-I and apoA-II. As shown in Fig. 1, the rise in cholesterol efflux was approximately linear during the first 4 h of incubation, while kinetic curves tended to reach a plateau for longer incubation times. Interestingly, enrichment of HDL3 particles with apoA-II seemed to be linked to a substantial reduction of cellular cholesterol efflux during the first part of the incubation period. In contrast, after 24 h of incubation, an inverted tendency was observed and curves obtained with various HDL3 particles intersected for incubation time longer than 8 h. Since differences in the ability of various HDL3 substrates to promote cholesterol efflux are susceptible to be more apparent in the linear portion of time-dependent curves, subsequent experiments compared cholesterol efflux rates after relatively short incubation periods, not exceeding 4 h. As compared with non-enriched HDL3 (A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass of 29.5%), the rate of cholesterol efflux was gradually and significantly decreased as apoA-II was progressively substituted for apoA-I in apoA-II-enriched homologous particles (A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass, 47.6-98.9%) (Fig. 2). Consistent data were obtained after 2 and 4 h of incubation (Fig. 2). By using linear regression analysis, cholesterol efflux after 2 h of incubation was shown to correlate negatively with A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass in HDL3 particles (r = −0.86; p < 0.0001; n = 20) (Fig. 3). In contrast, no significant relationships were observed between the rate of cholesterol efflux and either free cholesterol:phospholipid ratio (r = −0.04; not significant) or A-I+A-II:total lipid ratio (r = −0.28; not significant) in HDL3 particles (Fig. 3). In addition, cholesterol efflux did not correlate with the mean size of HDL3 (r = 0.04; not significant).Fig. 3Correlation between the composition of HDL3 and cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH hepatoma. [3H]Cholesterol-labeled cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of HDL3 (phospholipid concentration, 50 mg/liter) containing various proportions of apoA-I and apoA-II (A-II:A-I+A-II mass ratio ranging from 0.24 to 0.99). Linear regression graphs present efflux values obtained with 20 apoA-II-enriched HDL3 fractions from four distinct experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Experiments described above were conducted with total HDL3, which consist of a mixture of two types of particles containing either only apoA-I (HDL3-A-I) or both apoA-I and apoA-II (HDL3-A-I/A-II). It results that total HDL3 do not allow investigation of the effect of apoA-II in the low range values (i.e. A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass lower than 29%) (see Table I). In order to circumvent that problem, HDL3-A-I were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography and were progressively enriched with apoA-II (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Table II, and as observed with the total HDL3 fraction (Table I), the replacement of apoA-I by apoA-II did not induce marked changes in the lipid composition of the particles. In agreement with cholesterol efflux data obtained with total HDL3 enriched with apoA-II, increasing the A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass in HDL3-A-I progressively reduced cholesterol efflux from the Fu5AH hepatoma cells (Fig. 4).Table IIComposition (mass percent) of HDL3 after enrichment of HDL3 -A-I with apoA-IIFig. 4Effect of enrichment of HDL3-A-I particles with apoA-II on cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH hepatoma.

At the end of the incubation period, cholesterol efflux was calculated as the percentage of total label released (see “Materials and Methods”). Data are mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate determinations and are representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to gain insight into the mechanism by which apoA-I and apoA-II can modulate cholesterol efflux, Fu5AH cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of different concentrations of HDL3 (HDL3 phospholipid, 12.5-200.0 mg/liter), which varied only in their apoA-I and apoA-II contents. Fig. 5A shows three dose-response curves, which were obtained with either non-enriched HDL3 (A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass, 29.4%) or apoA-II-enriched homologous particles (A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass, 50.6% and 87.0%). As HDL3 concentration increased, cholesterol efflux increased progressively and tended to reach a maximal value with the highest concentration studied (Fig. 5A). As proposed by others with various cell models (16de la Llera Moya M. Atger V. Paul J.L. Fournier N. Moatti N. Giral P. Friday K.E. Rothblat G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Li Q. Komaba A. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4597-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), estimates of the apparent maximal efflux (Vmax(efflux)) and of the HDL3 concentration required to obtain 50% of maximal efflux (Kmefflux) were determined from double-reciprocal plots as the intercepts of the y and x axes, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, whereas similar Kmefflux values were obtained with various HDL3 fractions, Vmax(efflux) tended to be progressively reduced as the A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass increased. That tendency was confirmed by calculating Vmax(efflux) and Kmefflux values from dose-response curves, which were obtained with 10 distinct HDL3 preparations containing various proportions of apoA-I and apoA-II (A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass, 29.4-96.0%). Indeed, as determined by using Spearman rank correlation analysis, the A-II:A-I+A-II mass ratio was shown to correlate negatively and significantly with maximal cholesterol efflux (ρ = −0.68; p < 0.05). In contrast, no significant correlation was found between A-II:A-I+A-II percentage mass and Kmefflux values (ρ = −0.08; not significant). It has been demonstrated clearly that both the structure and concentration of lipoprotein acceptors can influence the transfer of cellular cholesterol toward the extracellular medium (22Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That latter statement raised considerable interest in determining the precise effects of variations in the structure and composition of lipoprotein particles on their ability to remove cholesterol from cells. While the knowledge of the precise role of the two major HDL apolipoproteins, apoA-I and apoA-II, in cellular cholesterol efflux would contribute to a better understanding of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, previous studies from different laboratories led to inconsistent results. Earlier studies showed that cholesterol efflux from cultured fibroblasts relates mainly to the presence of a specific, dense, minor lipoprotein fraction containing apoA-I but no apoA-II (26Oram J.F. Albers J.J. Cheung M.C. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8348-8356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 78: 3911-3914Google Scholar). In fact, subsequent studies demonstrated that a specific, pre-β-migrating LpA-I fraction, namely LpA-Ipreβ1, constitutes the preferential recipient of cellular cholesterol (49Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), suggesting that LpA-I rather than LpA-I/A-II would mediate cellular cholesterol efflux. In accordance with that latter view, only LpA-I, but not LpA-I/A-II, were shown to promote cholesterol efflux from Ob1771 cultured adipose cells (11Barbaras R. Grimaldi P. Negrel R. Ailhaud G.

Furthermore, the α3(VI) chain differs from the other two chains due to the presence of unique additional sequences at the C terminus (13Chu M.-L. Zhang R.-Z. Pan T.-C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.-J.

Tissue extraction and biosynthetic studies have demonstrated that the three chains occur in stoichiometric proportions in a 1:1:1 ratio (17Jander R. Rauterberg J. Glanville R.W. Eur. J.

In vitro studies have shown that type VI collagen has a peculiar pathway of intracellular assembly; association of the three chains in a type VI collagen monomer is followed by the formation of S-S bonded dimers (6 chains) and tetramers (12 chains) before secretion (19Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Ainger K. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14454-14460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the biology of type VI collagen assembly and cell-matrix interactions, a model system was initially developed in which murine NIH/3T3 cells were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding chicken type VI collagen chains. Cell lines were obtained that constitutively express the individual chicken chains; no self-association was observed with α1(VI) nor with α2(VI) chains, which were secreted as single polypeptides. Instead, chimeric chicken/murine type VI collagen molecules were detected in cell lines transfected with the chicken α3(VI) cDNA (21Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Bucciotti F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study, NIH/3T3 cells were successfully cotransfected with the cDNAs (3.15, 3.2, and 8.1 kb)1( 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)ECMextracellular matrixMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibody.) coding for the three chicken type VI collagen chains and for a selectable marker. Stable coexpression of all three chains was obtained, and the three transfected chains were assembled into pepsin-resistant type VI collagen. These molecules were secreted as monomers and higher order multimers of the proper size and became deposited into the extracellular matrix (ECM). This approach demonstrates for the first time the production of a recombinant nonfibrillar collagen composed of three genetically different chains. kilobase(s) extracellular matrix 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline monoclonal antibody. The following rabbit polyclonal antisera were used: AS-5, specific for chicken type VI collagen (19Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Ainger K. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14454-14460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); AS-72, specific for murine type VI collagen; and AS-46 and AS-47, specific for the chicken α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains, respectively.2( 2A.

Tissue culture supernatants of the mAbs 111A3, 116A8, 192C2, and 76G11, specific for the chicken α3(VI) chain, and mAb 108F3, specific for the chicken α1(VI) chain (22Colombatti A. Ainger K.

Magris, manuscript in preparation.) were used; ascites of the antifibronectin mAb HB91 (ATCC) was also used. Construction of the α1(VI) full-length cDNA (3.15 kb) and insertion into the SV40 early replacement vector pSV23 plus (23Huylebroeck D. Maertens G. Verhoeyen M. Lopez C. Raeymakers A. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 66: 163-181Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was described previously (24Bonaldo P. Mucignat M.T. Colombatti A. Matrix. 1990; 10: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The α2(VI) full-length cDNA (3.2 kb) was constructed from four partial cDNA clones (7a, 7u, 4a0, and 2a0) obtained from Dr. B. Trüeb (Zurich, Switzerland). The clones were digested with XbaI and AccI (7a), AccI and EcoRI (7u), EcoRI (4a0), or EcoRI and BglII (2a0) and were ligated in the M13mp19 vector. An XbaI-NheI full fragment was then excised from M13 and inserted into the pSV23 plasmid. The construction of α3(VI) cDNA (8.1 kb) required the use of four cDNA clones that were ligated two by two (pB118 with pB4 and pB32 with pB72) in the M13 mp 18 vector. The two constructs were then excised from M13 and ligated into pSV23 digested with SmaI. The pB118 cDNA clone used for this construction lacked the modules A8 and A6, which are coded by individual exons that can undergo alternative splicing (14Doliana R. Bonaldo P. Colombatti A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A schematic drawing of these steps is shown in Fig. 1. NIH/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin. DNA transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure of Graham and van der Eb (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar) as modified by Chen and Okayama (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar), and DNA was purified by double sedimentation in a cesium chloride gradient. In a typical experiment, 6 × 105 cells plated 24 h earlier in a 60-mm Petri dish were cotransfected for 20 h at 37°C with 1.5 μg each of supercoiled DNA of pSV23-α1(VI) and -α2(VI) and 3 μg of supercoiled DNA of pSV23-α3(VI) plus 40 ng of a plasmid containing the neo gene (pWLneo, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells were maintained overnight in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 3% CO2 atmosphere, and the following day the medium was changed and the CO2 concentration was raised to 5%. Selection was carried out in 500 ng/ml of G418 (Sigma), and individual colonies were isolated and grown into separate cell lines. High molecular weight DNA was isolated from transfected cell lines following established procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and 3 μg were digested to completion with restriction enzymes. The fragments were resolved on a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel, transferred onto Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK), and hybridized to cDNA probes of the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) by the random primed oligolabeling method (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of the RNA was performed on a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel containing 2.3 M formaldehyde in MOPS buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA) for 8 h at 150 V using 20-cm-long plates. RNA was then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes specific for the different type VI collagen chains. The filters were hybridized at 68°C overnight in 5 × NaCl/phosphate/EDTA (180 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.7) (buffer A) containing 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After washing in 2 × NaCl/phosphate/EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, in 1 × buffer A plus 1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C, and in 0.1 × NaCl/phosphate/EDTA for 30 min at room temperature, the filters were exposed to β-max Hyperfilms (Amersham). Cells were metabolically labeled in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Labeling with [35S]methionine (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham) at 100-300 μCi/ml was carried out in the presence or the absence of 50 μg/ml ascorbate. After 3-4 h the cell layer was solubilized for 30 min at 0°C in extraction buffer with the following final concentrations: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 25 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mMpara-aminobenzamidine. When needed, the medium was brought to extraction buffer. The medium and the cell lysate were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and used for immunoprecipitation. The samples were first precleared by incubation with 2 μl of antifibronectin mAb (HB91) followed by incubation with 100 μl protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 0°C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 × g, 2 μl of AS-5 or 100 μl of mAbs against the chicken α3(VI) chain and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added to the supernatant, and the incubation proceeded for 4-6 h. The samples were centrifuged, and the precipitates were washed extensively in extraction buffer prior to dissolving in Laemmli sample buffer in the presence or in the absence of 5% (v/v) 2-β-mercaptoethanol (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). In some instances, before proceeding with the immunoprecipitation with anti chicken type VI collagen antibodies, the medium and the cell lysate were preincubated with AS-72. Immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6% (v/v) or 3-10% linear gradient polyacrylamide slab gels using the buffer system of Laemmli and was exposed to MP hyperfilms (Amersham). Cultures of D23/3 cells in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium containing fetal calf serum and supplemented for 2-3 days with ascorbate (50 μg/ml) were washed with serum-free medium and then maintained overnight in serum-free medium. The culture medium was collected, dialyzed against PBS, and labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method. Labeled proteins were separated from free iodine by gel filtration and brought up into 0.5 M acetic acid for treatment with 100 μg/ml pepsin for 3 h at 4°C. The sample was dialyzed extensively against PBS, and aliquots were immunoprecipitated with AS-5, AS-46, and AS-72. Immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% (v/v) polyacrylamide slab gels and exposed to MP Hyperfilms. Matrix deposition of transfected chicken type VI collagen polypeptides was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. NIH/3T3 cell clones expressing the three chicken type VI collagen chains were cultured on chamber slides (A/S Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) until almost confluent, washed with PBS, and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with iced 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Slides were incubated for 60 min at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA in a moist chamber. Subsequent incubations were with rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated antibodies (A/S Dako, Glastrup, Denmark). Stained slides were mounted in glycerol and examined with an epifluorescent Leitz microscope using a 25× phase/fluorescence objective. Slides were photographed with Ilford HP5 400 (Ilford, Ltd., Mobberley Cheshire, UK). NIH/3T3 cells were cotransfected with the cDNAs coding for chicken type VI collagen chains along with the neo gene. Cells were put into selective G418 medium, and, after 14 days, 10 colonies were isolated and 6 grew into individual stable cell lines. The expression of chicken type VI collagen chains was investigated by immunostaining permeabilized cells with antibodies specific for the individual chicken type VI collagen chains. This screening (data not shown) suggested that three cell lines (D10/1, D23/3, and D24/1) coexpressed all transfected chains, two cell lines (D23/2 and D28/1) coexpressed only the α2(VI) and α3(VI) chains, and one cell line (D26/1) coexpressed the α1(VI) and α3(VI) chains (data not shown). Next, the six cell lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with AS-5 (Fig. 2). No material was immunoprecipitated from normal NIH/3T3 cells, confirming that the antibody was specific for chicken type VI collagen and did not recognize murine type VI collagen. The immunoprecipitates from the six transfected cell lines contained several bands of different intensity and migration. Five cell lines showed bands, prominent in D10/1, D23/2, and D26/1, at about 240 kDa, consistent with the size expected for the transfected chicken α3(VI) cDNA. In the D28/1 cell line, the 240-kDa band was absent, whereas a band migrating at about 220 kDa was immunoprecipitated. A band of similar size also was detected in D24/1 cells. Lower bands migrating in the range of 130-140 kDa as expected for α1(VI) and/or α2(VI) chains were present in all six cell lines. Two cell lines (D23/3 and D24/1) coexpressing all three transfected cDNAs were successfully subcloned, and their DNA and RNA were isolated. To demonstrate the presence of each of the integrated cDNAs, high molecular weight DNA was digested and analyzed by Southern blotting. Under the stringent conditions used, no hybridization with endogenous murine type VI collagen genes was detected. On the other hand, both cell lines incorporated several copies of all three chicken cDNAs (Fig. 3). Because the sizes of the bands were ambiguous in the first series of immunoprecipitation, Northern blot analysis was carried out to control for the sizes of the transcripts (Fig. 4). Both subcloned D23/3 and D24/1 cell lines showed α1(VI) and α2(VI) transcripts of the proper size (about 3.2 kb). The D23/3 cell line had a properly sized α3(VI) chain transcript of about 8.0 kb, whereas in the D24/1 cell line the α3(VI) transcript was of slightly smaller size (about 7.0 kb). In addition, hybridization with the α3(VI)-specific probe revealed in both cell lines a prominent band at about 5.4 kb and, in D23/3 cells, also a minor signal at about 3.0 kb. It is possible that these smaller RNAs are transcribed from incorrectly integrated cDNAs or that they are the result of aberrant splicing. Immunoprecipitation and Northern blot analyses revealed variant α3(VI) mRNAs and polypeptides in some cell lines. To further investigate these aberrantly sized chicken α3(VI) chains, the D28/1, D23/3, and D24/1 cell lines were metabolically labeled, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAbs specific for different domains of the chicken α3(VI) chain (Fig. 5). In the D28/1 cell line, AS-5 immunoprecipitated two major bands, one at about 220 kDa and one at 130 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 2, and also see Fig. 2, lane 7). Accordingly, the D28/1 cells expressed a correct α2(VI) mRNA (about 3.2 kb) and an aberrant α3(VI) mRNA of about 7.0 kb (not shown). In addition, the chicken α3(VI)-specific mAbs 192C2 and 116A83 immunoprecipitated the 220 kDa band nearly exclusively (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 7), whereas neither mAb 111A3 nor 76G11 immunoprecipitated any polypeptide from D28/1 cells, suggesting that their epitopes are not present or not exposed in this smaller α3 (VI) polypeptide. Instead, a polypeptide of about 220 kDa was recognized by mAb 111A3 in D24/1 cells (Fig. 5, lane 9, and also see Fig. 2, lane 6), suggesting that this α3(VI) form differs from the similarly sized 220-kDa α3(VI) polypeptide of D28/1 cells. mAb 111A3 immunoprecipitated from D23/3 cells a polypeptide at about 240 kDa, which is the size expected for the correct α3(VI) transfected cDNA (Fig. 5, lane 8, and also see Fig. 2, lane 4). In this experiment a longer 6% gel was run, and the chicken and murine α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains could be resolved. In this gel it was evident that both chicken and murine bands were coimmunoprecipitated in D23/3 and D24/1 cells. In addition, mAb 111A3 was able to immunoprecipitate from both D23/3 and D24/1 cell lines a heavily labeled polypeptide of about 160 kDa that migrated slightly above the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 9). A similarly sized polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by mAbs 111A3 and 76G11 also from a cell line (C11B7) transfected only with the α3(VI) cDNA (Fig. 5, lanes 10 and 12) (21Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Bucciotti F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This set of immunoprecipitations indicates that there is a certain degree of heterogeneity in the nature of the α3(VI) chains produced by different cell lines. Type VI collagen chains usually form stable (α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI)) monomers that assemble intracellularly to give rise to S-S bonded dimers (6 chains) and tetramers (12 chains). To study the assembly of the transfected chicken chains, we first assessed that extensive and repeated immunoprecipitations depleted all of the murine chains from D23/3 cell lysates, leaving behind polypeptides that could be specifically immunoprecipitated with AS-5 (Fig. 6A, lane 2) but not with AS-72 (Fig. 6A, lane 3). D23/3 cells were selected for these experiments because they synthesize type VI chains of the correct size. Next, in a similar type of experiment we evaluated the extent of assembly of chicken type VI collagen chains in cell lysates. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitate were run in SDS-PAGE in the absence of 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and, under these conditions, most of the material consisted of larger forms that barely entered the 6% separating gel (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Secretion of chicken type VI collagen assemblies was studied in D23/3 cells labeled in the presence of ascorbate. The cell medium was immunoprecipitated with AS-5, and the immunoprecipitate was run under reducing and nonreducing conditions in a 3-10% linear gradient SDS-PAGE without stacking gel in order to resolve also the larger assembled composites (Fig. 6C). In the nonreduced gel, the major polypeptide of 240 kDa corresponding to the chicken α3(VI) chain and other bands in the range of 130-140 kDa were strongly decreased. Instead, a larger form (about 500 kDa) slightly above the fibronectin dimer and more heavily labeled higher bands were detected. The sizes of these disulfide-bonded aggregates are similar to the sizes of properly assembled type VI monomers (about 500 kDa), dimers (about 1,000 kDa), and tetramers (about 2,000 kDa). To avoid the extensive immunodepletion of the murine type VI collagen that could eliminate coassociated chicken type VI collagen forming the higher order structures present in the cell medium, the preclearing steps with AS-72 were not very extensive. As a consequence, the pattern of chains immunoprecipitated from the cell medium was more complex than the pattern of chains immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate (see Fig. 6B), especially in the range of 130-140 kDa. In this case, when the supernatant from the first immunoprecipitation with AS-5 was subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with AS-72, some murine type VI collagen could still be revealed (Fig. 6C, lane 7). The demonstration that transfected chicken type VI polypeptides apparently assembled to form S-S bonded tetramers suggests but does not prove that these composites are stable and have a proper triple helical conformation in their collagenous domain. The low methionine content of the triple helix and the amounts of transfected chicken type VI collagen secreted by [35S]methionine-labeled D23/3 cells prevented the elucidation of this matter, because no polypeptides corresponding to the pepsin form of type VI collagen could be detected. Therefore, serum-free medium from ascorbate-treated D23/3 cells was collected, labeled with 32I, brought to 0.5 M acetic acid, and digested with pepsin. This analysis was facilitated by the notion that chicken and murine α1(VI) pepsinized chains migrate at distinct positions in SDS-PAGE (18Trüeb B. Schreier T. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, not only AS-5 (lane 2), which recognizes all three chicken chains, but also AS-46 (lane 4), which is specific for only the chicken α1(VI) chain, immunoprecipitated three pepsin-resistant fragments. With both antisera, the mobility of the α1(VI) band and also of the α3 (VI) band was slower compared with the mobility of the bands detected when the sample was immunoprecipitated with AS-72 (Fig. 7, lane 3). Although a low contamination of murine chains also was present in lanes 2 and 4 (Fig. 7), these results demonstrate that recombinant chicken type VI collagen can form stable triple helices. The ability of D23/3 cells to incorporate the secreted recombinant chicken type VI collagen into their ECM was investigated by staining D23/3 cells with different combinations of polyclonal antisera and mAbs that react with chicken or murine type VI collagen and with fibronectin. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Cells incubated with preimmune serum or an unrelated mAb showed only background fluorescence (not shown). Also negative were untransfected NIH/3T3 cells incubated with AS-5 (Fig. 8b). In contrast, strong immunofluorescence in a fibrillar pattern was detected when D23/3 cells were incubated with the AS-5 or with antibodies specific for each of the transfected chicken chains (Fig. 8, c, d, e, and g). This staining pattern was superimposable with the pattern of endogenous murine type VI collagen (Fig. 8, f and h). The incorporation of heterologous chicken type VI collagen into the ECM of NIH/3T3 cells indicates that transfected chicken type VI collagen assemblies are competent for matrix formation. In this study, we have constructed cDNAs encoding the chicken α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) collagen chains and show that these three exogenous polypeptides can be constitutively expressed in murine NIH/3T3 cells in the forms of properly folded pepsin-resistant type VI collagen monomers and higher order disulfide-bonded multimers. Cotransfection with a high ratio of the chicken type VI cDNAs versus the neo selectable marker gene (about 30:1) resulted in the efficient and stable introduction of all cDNAs; three out of six selected cell lines expressed all three chains of chicken type VI collagen. Furthermore, in at least one cell line, heterologous recombinant chicken type VI collagen was secreted and incorporated into the ECM. The immunofluorescence pattern obtained with antibodies specific for the chicken and murine type VI collagen was superimposable and suggests that molecules made only of chicken or murine chains or chimeric chicken/murine type VI collagen might coassemble and be deposited. Production of chicken type VI collagen assemblies was confirmed by preclearing experiments in which the murine type VI collagen present in cell lysates was specifically and completely removed, allowing the recovery of pure transfected heterologous chicken type VI collagen. The preclearing steps could not be as extensive with cell medium, because in this case also the chicken molecules were removed. Secreted type VI collagen multimers are larger than those present in cell lysates (21Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Bucciotti F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar),2 and it is likely that chicken molecules coassemble with secreted murine molecules in larger assemblies and are more easily removed by the preclearing steps. To analyze secreted molecules it was necessary to compromise between detecting a discrete but only partially purified chicken type VI collagen signal and no signal at all. However, when a more sensitive 32I labeling of pepsin-resistant secreted material was used, polypeptides largely corresponding to chicken type VI collagen were specifically immunoprecipitated. The resistance to pepsin digestion demonstrated the triple helical conformation of recombinant chicken type VI molecules. Antibodies specific for the α1(VI) chicken chain were able to immunoprecipitate composites including mainly chicken α2(VI) and α3(VI) chains, indicating minimal interference from endogenous murine type VI polypeptides in the formation of chicken type VI monomers. Because the acetic acid treatment necessary for pepsin digestion disrupts all of the noncovalent bonds, nearly pure chicken macromolecular assemblies were immunoprecipitated. On the other hand, chimeric assemblies were more easily detected in immunoprecipitates made with molecules kept under native conditions. Therefore, the contribution of some chimeric murine/chicken molecules (i.e. murine α1(VI) and α2(VI) and chicken α3(VI)) also should be considered in interpreting the immunodetection of collagen type VI in the deposited ECM. However, the presence of chimeric assemblies will not undermine the conclusion that at least a fraction of deposited type VI collagen is solely of chicken origin. The synthesis of endogenous type VI collagen in NIH/3T3 cells renders more complex the analysis of transfected cell lines. In preliminary experiments we have attempted to stably transfect with chicken type VI collagen cDNAs cell lines that do not produce endogenous type VI collagen, but we have so far failed to demonstrate assembly and secretion of transfected chains. It is possible that cells that already synthesize and secrete their own type VI collagen also favored the assembly and deposition into the ECM of the transfected chicken chains. Previously reported cell systems for analysis of transfection and full expression of type I collagen DNAs made use of cell lines that retained (31Schnieke A. Dziadek M. Bateman J. Mascara T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24126-24133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) endogenous expression of one of the two chains of type I collagen. Secretion of trimers of type XII collagen was achieved in HeLa cells (34Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 3029-3032Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), which are known to synthesize only low levels of type IV and type V collagens (35Furth J.J. Wroth T.H. Ackerman S. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In these latter studies, only the formation of a proper triple helix was reported, whereas the ECM deposition of heterologous recombinant collagens was not investigated. One observation we have made frequently is that, in addition to the correct 8.0-kb α3(VI) mRNA signal and the 240-kDa α3(VI) polypeptide band, shorter messages in the range of 5.4-7 kb and polypeptides in the range of 160-220 kDa, which are present together with or instead of the properly sized molecules, are detected. The 5.4-kb mRNA band has been detected in most lines, and, because of its frequency, it seems unlikely that this shorter mRNA is transcribed from incorrectly integrated cDNAs. Alternatively, the 5.4-kb transcripts and the 160-kDa polypeptides might be due to aberrant splicing from cryptic splice donor sites of the α3(VI) cDNA, as has been reported in other experimental systems (36Wise R.J. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6591-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 37Huang M.T.F. Gorman C.M. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6253-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The inability of some antibodies to immunoprecipitate the 160-kDa truncated α3(VI) polypeptide could depend on the localization of the recognized epitopes that are localized in the triple helix (AS-5) or in the C terminus (mAbs 116A8 and 192C2). This suggests that the truncated 160-kDa polypeptide is comprised of the N-terminal globular end of the α3(VI) chain. The 160-kDa polypeptide does not associate with α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains,2 and, therefore, it is likely that this smaller α3(VI) form lacks some sequences/domains that are involved in the association with the other two chains. It is noteworthy that a recombinant fragment of the human α3(VI) chain that includes all of the N-terminal globule and that corresponds to a large extent to the present 160 kDa polypeptide displayed several functional interactions, including binding sites for heparin, for hyaluronan, and also for the triple helical domain of type VI collagen (40Specks U. Mayer U. Nischt R. Spissinger T. Mann K. Timpl R. Engel J. Chu M.-L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The present model offers a tool for detailed mutational analysis and the production of recombinant type VI collagen molecules of predefined composition to clarify the contribution of their globular non-triple helical domains in cell adhesion and migration phenomena (41Perris R.

INTRODUCTIONThe OmpT protease,1( 1The abbreviations used are: OmpTouter membrane protein TRMCKrabbit muscle creatine kinaseTCKTorpedo californica creatine kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBCAbicinchoninic acidDTTdithiothreitol.) located in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, has a narrow substrate specificity, primarily for paired basic residues (1Grodberg J. Dunn J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OmpT expression is thermoregulated showing much lower expression levels below 32°C (3Manning P. Reeves P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1977; 1: 275-278Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although OmpT has been purified (4Sugimura K. Nishihara T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ompT gene cloned and sequenced (5Grodberg J. Lundrigan M.D. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Dunn J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), little is known about the in vivo function of the enzyme. The ompT gene is apparently not essential as its deletion has no effect on growth rate of E. coli(6Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no natural substrates for OmpT have been identified, observations of activity on recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli are suggestive of possible physiological functions. For example, a fusion protein carrying the HlyA transport signal, which was expressed in E. coli and secreted through the outer membrane, was observed to be cleaved by OmpT (7Hanke C. Hess J. Schumacher G. Goebel W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). OmpT cleaves another fusion protein including both the C-terminal domain of the Neisseria Igaβ protease precursor and the Vibrio cholerae toxin B subunit (CtxB), causing the extracellular release of the toxin B subunit (8Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, OmpT appears to be involved in the degradation of a β-lactamase-protein A fusion protein in the periplasmic space of E. coli(6Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations point to a possible role for OmpT in the processing of precursor polypeptides and suggest that it may also have a role in turnover/degradation of membrane proteins of both the inner and outer membranes of E. coli.Other possible roles for OmpT may be hypothesized from analogy to other proteases. There are functional and structural similarities between OmpT and the plasminogen activator of Yersinia pestis (47% sequence identity) and OmpT is able to cleave plasminogen to plasmin (9Leytus S.P. Bowles L.K. Konisky J. Mange W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since the plasminogen activator is a virulence factor, it has also been suggested that OmpT may contribute to the pathogenic potential of E. coli(10Lundrigan M.D. Webb R.M. FEMS Lett. 1992; 97: 51-56Crossref Google Scholar).OmpT is known to create problems in the expression of recombinant proteins. Several recombinant proteins expressed in the cytosol have been proteolyzed by OmpT after cell lysis (1Grodberg J. Dunn J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 8Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Leytus S.P.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, OmpT also interferes with recovery of expressed proteins by degrading recombinant fusion proteins secreted into the periplasmic space (6Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results identify OmpT as the protease involved in the degradation of denatured inclusion body proteins, and this has led to the discovery of a previously unknown property of the OmpT protease: activity under extreme denaturing conditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Growth ConditionsTorpedo californica creatine kinase (TCK) was expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in the E. coli strain JA221 as described previously (15Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Chen L.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Georgiou G. De Bernardez-Clark E. Protein Refolding. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 154-168Google Scholar). OmpT was overexpressed in the E. coli strain UT5600 (an OmpT deletion mutant) transformed with the plasmid pML19 (1Grodberg J. Dunn J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) containing the ompT gene (a generous gift from Professor George Georgiou). UT5600 cells and overexpressed OmpT (UT5600 harboring pML19) were grown to an A600 of 2.0 in LB at 37°C.Extraction of the Protease Activity from TCK Inclusion BodiesThe TCK inclusion bodies were resuspended at approximately 0.5 mg/ml TCK in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, containing 2.5% octyl glucoside (Sigma) and 5%β-mercaptoethanol. This suspension was incubated with slow shaking at 37°C for >16 h and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Purification of inclusion body proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The extract was exchanged by ultrafiltration into 1% octyl glucoside, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein concentration assay (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Protease Degradation Assay of Inclusion BodiesTCK inclusion body protein was resuspended to ~1 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5. Thirty microliters of this suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was resuspended to a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5. Solid ultrapure urea (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and 1 M DTT were added to give final concentrations of 8 M and 100 mM, respectively, when the total volume was adjusted to 30 μl (1 mg/ml protein). The extracted and unextracted TCK inclusion bodies were assayed for protease activity under either native (DTT only) or denaturing (DTT + urea) conditions by incubation at 37°C for 30 min. Degradation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.RMCK Degradation Assay Using Protease ExtractRabbit muscle creatine kinase (RMCK) was used as a soluble substrate for the protease. The reaction contained: RMCK (1 mg/ml), protease extract (0.1 mg/ml protease extract), DTT (1 mM), urea (4 M, for denatured samples only), and 0.15% octyl glucoside in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, in a final assay volume of 100 μl. Assay conditions were identical with those used for inclusion bodies. Inhibition experiments were done using the soluble RMCK assay by adding potential inhibitors to a final concentration of 0.5, 1, 5, 10, or 12.5 mM to the assay mixture immediately prior to adding the protease extract. The degree of protease inhibition was assumed to correlate with the amount of full-length RMCK remaining as judged by SDS-PAGE.Determination of the Urea Optimum of the Protease ExtractResidual CK activity was measured following refolding of RMCK (15Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Chen L.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Georgiou G. De Bernardez-Clark E. Protein Refolding. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 154-168Google Scholar) denatured at various urea concentrations (0-8 M) in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5. CK activity was determined by the method of Tanzer and Gilvarg (16Tanzer M.L. Gilvarg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3201-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Membrane ExtractsOmpT deletion mutant strain UT5600 cells and UT5600 transformed with plasmid pML19 (overexpressing OmpT) (5Grodberg J. Lundrigan M.D. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Dunn J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) cells, grown as described, were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated overnight at 4°C, and sonicated. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the insoluble material was extracted as described.Enzyme PurificationJA221 cells expressing TCK (15.5 g) were lysed, and the protease activity was extracted (17Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The extract was exchanged into 1% octyl glucoside, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (buffer A) by ultrafiltration. Protease extract (27 mg) was filtered (0.2 μM) and loaded onto an AP-1 Waters column (10 × 100 mm) containing benzamidine Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with 40 ml of buffer A. The protease activity was eluted using a linear gradient of buffer B (buffer B contains 1 M NaCl + buffer A) in one peak at 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The active fraction contained 9.5 mg of protein and was exchanged back into buffer A. The benzamidine-purified extract was then loaded onto a HR(5/10) Mono Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A, and the protease activity was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (buffer B) and eluted from the column in 4 incompletely resolved peaks from 180 mM NaCl to 240 mM NaCl. The active fractions from Mono Q contained 3 mg of protein.N-terminal Sequence Determination of the Protease Extracted from Inclusion BodiesThe most active fraction from the Mono Q anion exchange column was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a Problot membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The protein in the enriched 37-kDa band was subjected to 8 rounds of automated Edman degradation at the UCSF Biomolecular Resource Center.RESULTSProteolysis Occurs under Denaturing ConditionsFormation of inclusion bodies is a major problem encountered in bacterial expression systems. During attempts to recover active enzyme by denaturation and refolding, we have observed proteolytic degradation in inclusion bodies containing both T. californica creatine kinase (TCK) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (15Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Chen L.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Georgiou G. De Bernardez-Clark E. Protein Refolding. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 154-168Google Scholar, 17Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Babbitt P.C. Chen Q. Kenyon G.L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: A325Google Scholar). As reported previously, this proteolysis occurs under the extreme denaturing conditions (8 M urea) which are necessary to solubilize inclusion body proteins prior to refolding. The proteolytic activity can be isolated by detergent extraction of the insoluble pellet containing the TCK inclusion bodies and membrane fragments.In order to characterize this protease activity in a soluble system, we optimized the assay reported earlier (15Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Chen L.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Georgiou G. De Bernardez-Clark E. Protein Refolding. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 154-168Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, TCK inclusion bodies under native conditions were not degraded (lanes 1 and 3), but were degraded extensively after incubation with 8 M urea (lane 2). There was no significant degradation of denatured TCK inclusion bodies after the protease was extracted (lane 4). The protease activity that is removed by detergent extraction contains a mixture of proteins as shown in lane 5. It can be incubated with soluble RMCK, under denaturing conditions, to give a similar degradation pattern (lane 7) to the denatured TCK inclusion bodies (lane 2). The RMCK is not proteolyzed when denaturant is left out of the assay mix (lane 6). These data show that soluble RMCK incubated with detergent-extracted protease can be used in place of inclusion body TCK to assay for the proteolytic activity. This result is not surprising as TCK and RMCK are very similar proteins (85% sequence identity).Optimum Denaturant Concentration for ProteolysisThe optimum denaturant concentration for protease activity was determined by both the SDS-PAGE assay and by quantitation of residual CK activity following refolding of RMCK that had been denatured in the presence of the protease extract. Urea was used in preference to guanidine HCl because it can be used in a gel assay, and care was taken to use only freshly prepared, ultrapure urea in the experiments. The urea optimum for the proteolytic activity on substrate RMCK was 4-5 M urea (Fig. 2). Although the degradation of RMCK (data not shown) also correlated with the loss of residual CK activity following refolding, residual CK activity was a more quantitative indicator of the protease activity under a range of denaturant concentrations than the gel assay.Fig. 2Denaturant optimum for protease activity on substrate RMCK. Loss of CK activity (units/ml) following refolding was measured at increasing concentrations of urea.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the Protease as OmpTCharacterization of this protease allowed us to ask whether this activity could be attributed to any known bacterial protease. Our experimental evidence suggests that the E. coli protease OmpT is responsible for the proteolytic degradation of TCK inclusion bodies under the denaturing conditions required for solubilization and refolding. This conclusion is based on several types of experimental evidence as detailed below.The protease extract isolated from TCK inclusion bodies has a substrate specificity for the scissile bond between paired basic residues, the same specificity as that previously reported for OmpT (2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Substrate specificity of protease activity on denatured TCK inclusion bodies (top sequence) and denatured soluble RMCK (bottom sequence). Alignment of TCK and RMCK shows locations in the sequences where proteolysis occurs. Degradation products of both enzymes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and N-terminal sequences were determined for the major degradation fragments (boxed). Arrows mark the position of the scissile bond in each sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The protease extract also has the same inhibitor profile as that reported for OmpT (2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Benzamidine, ZnCl2, and CuCl2 inhibit proteolysis of substrate RMCK at millimolar concentrations as previously reported for OmpT (2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride do not.Table IInhibition of the protease activity on denatured substrate RMCK was measured by loss of full-length RMCK on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gelsTable IInhibition of the protease activity on denatured substrate RMCK was measured by loss of full-length RMCK on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gelsUsing the RMCK assay, the degradation pattern for the protease extracted from TCK inclusion bodies (Fig. 4, lane 2) is essentially the same as that of the overexpressed OmpT extract (Fig. 4, lane 4). In contrast, the detergent extract from a membrane preparation of the OmpT deletion mutant has no proteolytic activity using our assay conditions (Fig. 4, lane 6).Fig. 4SDS-PAGE (12.5%) comparison of protease activity from membrane extracts of JA221 cells (used to express TCK), UT5600 (OmpT−), and UT5600 + pML19 (overexpressed OmpT).

The purification of the protease extracted from TCK inclusion bodies is also shown in Fig. 5 (lanes 4, 5, and 6). This extract also contains a 37-kDa band that increases in intensity at each step of the protease purification. The N-terminal sequence of this enriched band is STETLSFT, which is identical with that of the mature OmpT protease (5Grodberg J. Lundrigan M.D. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Dunn J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis of the large band directly below the band identified as OmpT (Fig. 5, lane 6) suggests that they are the porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC. This band was blotted and subjected to 6 rounds of Edman degradation resulting in a primary and a secondary sequence. The primary sequence is AEIYNK, which is the N-terminal sequence for the mature OmpF porin protein (19Inokuchi K. Mutoh N. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6957-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Mutoh N. Inokuchi K. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 137: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The secondary sequence that was obtained from this band, AEVYNK, corresponds to the N-terminal sequence of the mature OmpC porin protein (21Mizuno T. Chou M.-Y. Inouye M. J. Biol.

The identification of this protease as OmpT was based on four criteria: substrate specificity, inhibitor profile, the complete lack of proteolytic activity of an OmpT− mutant, and N-terminal sequence confirmation that the 37-kDa band enriched by purification of the protease activity is identical with the N-terminal sequence of OmpT and corresponds to its predicted molecular mass. The overexpressed OmpT also appears to have the same degradation pattern as the protease activity extracted from TCK inclusion bodies.Technical difficulties in extraction and purification of the protease from inclusion bodies resulted in incomplete purification, preventing us from obtaining direct confirmation of its identity. The major contaminants were identified as the E. coli porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC. The physical nature of inclusion bodies has not been explored, and little is known either about the forces which hold inclusion bodies together or exactly how they are formed. Although the scheme used to purify the protease was quite similar to that reported for OmpT, the extraction conditions required to remove the protease from the TCK inclusion bodies required high detergent concentrations (2.5%) and was much more rigorous than that required for the removal of OmpT from the membrane. This resulted in extraction of other integral membrane proteins not present in the reported descriptions of OmpT purification (2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and led to increased difficulty in purifying the protease activity from the inclusion body extract. Even though this resulted in an incomplete purification, the enrichment of the 37-kDa band verified as OmpT by N-terminal sequence determination shows that OmpT was present in relatively high concentration in the most active fraction.The fact that OmpT is active under extreme denaturing conditions has implications for elucidating the currently unknown function of this enzyme. Although no native substrates for OmpT have been found, its location in the outer membrane combined with its unusual and selective substrate specificity and the preference for denatured substrates lends support to a suggested role in processing proteins secreted through the outer membrane (7Hanke C. Hess J. Schumacher G. Goebel W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether OmpT has a functional homolog in eukaryotic systems. We find no evidence, however, for an ancestral link between OmpT and eukaryotic processing proteins such as kex2 in yeast, a unicellular eukaryote (22Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 37: 1075-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the substrate specificity of OmpT is similar to that of kex2 (the scissile bond is on the carboxyl side of two consecutive basic residues), their inhibitor profiles are markedly different. kex2 is sensitive to thiol modifying reagents, whereas OmpT is not inhibited by thiol modifying reagents, but rather is sensitive to the serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there appears to be no sequence similarity between kex2 and OmpT.The preference of OmpT for denatured substrate as observed in our system is an interesting and as yet not well understood property of the enzyme. This finding may help to illuminate other observations of OmpT degradation of regions of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli which appear to contain relatively unorganized structures in the native protein. For example, a conformational study of recombinant human γ-interferon shows that the 20 amino acids at the C terminus lacks structure in comparison to the rest of the molecule. This was the only region of the protein susceptible to proteolysis under nondenaturing conditions (2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When α-helix-breaking amino acids were introduced into a linker sequence of the fusion protein containing PhoA and hemolysin A expressed in E. coli, the cleavage of OmpT sites in the linker sequence was substantially increased (7Hanke C. Hess J. Schumacher G. Goebel W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One likely explanation for these results is that OmpT acts on relatively unstructured regions of the substrate, mimicked in our soluble assay system by addition of denaturant. At high denaturant concentrations (above 5 M urea), there is reduced activity of OmpT on substrate RMCK. As the urea concentration increases, it is likely that the protease itself begins to denature, leading to a loss of activity. This suggests that the optimum denaturant concentration for OmpT proteolysis will be substrate-dependent. The efficiency of proteolysis will involve a trade-off between substrate stability and OmpT stability at a given concentration of denaturant. (Creatine kinase shows loss of activity and denaturation of tertiary structure at urea concentrations below those used in our assay (23Zhou H. Tsou C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Qizhi Y. Shujian L. Min T. Chenglu Z. Sci. Sin. 1985; 28B: 484-493Google Scholar, 25Qizhi Y. Haimeng Z. Lixiang H. Chenglu Z. Sci. Sin. 1982; 25B: 1296-1302Google Scholar).) Under our assay conditions, there is presumably sufficient denaturant present to induce a relaxed creatine kinase structure susceptible to proteolysis. The concentration of urea required to achieve this is, however, insufficient to denature OmpT itself.The preference of OmpT for denatured substrates, its limited substrate specificity, and its activity under denaturing conditions make OmpT particularly well suited for specific and selective modification of proteins not only in vivo but in vitro as well. Trypsin, which is also active in 4 M urea (26Harris J.I. Nature. 1956; 177: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), is most commonly used for this purpose, although the substrate specificity is broader. The narrower substrate specificity of OmpT suggests its potential for use in obtaining internal sequence of proteins without excessive degradation. In addition, OmpT appears to be a highly efficient enzyme under denaturing conditions. Ten μg of the unpurified extract can degrade 100 μg of CK at 37°C in 30 min to give reproducible degradation patterns. Work to develop this enzyme as a biochemical tool is on-going.The ability to proteolyze substrates at high denaturant concentrations is not a property unique to OmpT. Some other proteases which retain activity in 8 M urea are subtilisin (27Ottensen M. Svendsen I. Perlman G.E. Lorand L. Methods in Enzymology: Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1970: 199-214Google Scholar), papain (28Shapira E. Arnon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1026-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thermophilic aminopeptidase I (29Roncari G. Stoll E. Zuber H. Lorand L. Methods in Enzymology: Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1976: 522-530Google Scholar), extracellular protease from Penicillium notatum(30Belew M. Porath J. Perlman G.E. Lorand L. Methods in Enzymology: Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1970: 576-581Google Scholar), thermolysin (31Matsubara H. Perlman G.E. Lorand L. Methods in Enzymology: Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1970: 642-651Google Scholar), and Aeromonas aminopeptidase (32Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Perlman G.E. Lorand L. Methods in Enzymology: Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1970: 530-543Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether the stability of OmpT can be correlated with structural properties similar to those exhibited by some of these other enzymes.Our conclusion that the protease responsible for the degradation of inclusion body CK in the presence of denaturant is OmpT may be useful in resolving problems associated with the recovery of active proteins expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli. For example, the BL21 strain of E. coli, used with a range of commercially available expression vectors, is OmpT−. In cases where proteolysis of inclusion body proteins occurs during denaturation and refolding, use of such a strain might provide a simple and viable solution. Alternatively, use of OmpT inhibitors may be useful for recovery of inclusion body proteins from such systems. Although the generality of this proteolysis phenomenon has not been formally established, two recombinant proteins (TCK and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) have been shown to be proteolyzed during denaturation and refolding from inclusion bodies (15Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Chen L.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Georgiou G. De Bernardez-Clark E. Protein Refolding. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 154-168Google Scholar). We suggest that this protease may be responsible for the proteolysis of other inclusion body proteins degraded during the denaturation and refolding procedures used to recover soluble protein from such systems. Many schemes for recovery of inclusion body proteins include extraction procedures for removal of contaminating proteases prior to denaturation. It is possible that OmpT proteolysis of inclusion body proteins could be minimized by such procedures as Triton X-100 washes. As reported previously, however, Triton treatment may only be effective with OmpT when it is used in the lysis buffer (17Babbitt P.C. West B.L. Buechter D.D. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to octyl glucoside, extensive Triton or Triton/deoxycholate washes of the inclusion body CK after the cells were lysed did not extract the protease effectively.2( 2P. C. Babbitt, unpublished results.) INTRODUCTIONThe OmpT protease,1( 1The abbreviations used are: OmpTouter membrane protein TRMCKrabbit muscle creatine kinaseTCKTorpedo californica creatine kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBCAbicinchoninic acidDTTdithiothreitol.) located in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, has a narrow substrate specificity, primarily for paired basic residues (1Grodberg J. Dunn J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Sugimura K. Higashi N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OmpT expression is thermoregulated showing much lower expression levels below 32°C (3Manning P. Reeves P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1977; 1: 275-278Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although OmpT has been purified (4Sugimura K. Nishihara T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ompT gene cloned and sequenced (5Grodberg J. Lundrigan M.D. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Dunn J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), little is known about the in vivo function of the enzyme. The ompT gene is apparently not essential as its deletion has no effect on growth rate of E. coli(6Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no natural substrates for OmpT have been identified, observations of activity on recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli are suggestive of possible physiological functions. For example, a fusion protein carrying the HlyA transport signal, which was expressed in E. coli and secreted through the outer membrane, was observed to be cleaved by OmpT (7Hanke C. Hess J. Schumacher G. Goebel W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). OmpT cleaves another fusion protein including both the C-terminal domain of the Neisseria Igaβ protease precursor and the Vibrio cholerae toxin B subunit (CtxB), causing the extracellular release of the toxin B subunit (8Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, OmpT appears to be involved in the degradation of a β-lactamase-protein A fusion protein in the periplasmic space of E. coli(6Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations point to a possible role for OmpT in the processing of precursor polypeptides and suggest that it may also have a role in turnover/degradation of membrane proteins of both the inner and outer membranes of E. coli.Other possible roles for OmpT may be hypothesized from analogy to other proteases. There are functional and structural similarities between OmpT and the plasminogen activator of Yersinia pestis (47% sequence identity) and OmpT is able to cleave plasminogen to plasmin (9Leytus S.P. Bowles L.K. Konisky J. Mange W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since the plasminogen activator is a virulence factor, it has also been suggested that OmpT may contribute to the pathogenic potential of E. coli(10Lundrigan M.D. Webb R.M. FEMS Lett. 1992; 97: 51-56Crossref Google Scholar).OmpT is known to create problems in the expression of recombinant proteins. Several recombinant proteins expressed in the cytosol have been proteolyzed by OmpT after cell lysis (1Grodberg J. Dunn J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 8Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Leytus S.P.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, OmpT also interferes with recovery of expressed proteins by degrading recombinant fusion proteins secreted into the periplasmic space (6Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results identify OmpT as the protease involved in the degradation of denatured inclusion body proteins, and this has led to the discovery of a previously unknown property of the OmpT protease: activity under extreme denaturing conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1588036636,"ATP-powered Ca2+ pumps are located in the plasma membrane (PMCA) and the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SERCA). The two pump types share numerous structural and functional features; nevertheless, they are strictly targeted to different cell compartments. Chimeric SERCA/PMCA pumps were constructed to investigate the structural determinants responsible for their specific cellular location. The level of expression of the chimeric constructs and of the wild-type pumps in COS-7 and Sf9 cells was the same and so was their stability. One exception was chimera D, which showed special propensity to degradation. The chimeric constructs had no Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity, although in one trace amounts of the Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoenzyme intermediate were detected. Thus, the exchange of the regions encompassing the (NH2-terminal) transmembrane domains apparently is incompatible with the activity of the pump. The immunofluorescence experiments showed that the 85 NH2-terminal residues of the SERCA pump, encompassing the first transmembrane domain, contain a signal-promoting retention of chimeric constructs otherwise consisting of the PMCA pump structure in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additional structural determinants most likely also contribute to the retention of the SERCA pump in the endoplasmic reticulum: one chimeric construct (E) composed of the first two transmembrane domains of the PMCA pump, followed by the remainder of the SERCA pump structure, was still retained, even if not completely, in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2046609576,"The role of Glu379 in the lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied by analyzing the kinetic mechanism of transport of wild-type and Ala379, Asp379, and Gln379 mutant proteins. Glu379 forms part of the sequence motif Lys-X-X-His-X-X-Glu that is present in a number of sugar transport proteins, including LacY of Escherichia coli. The E379A and E379Q mutants were defective in the uptake of lactose against a concentration gradient and lactose-dependent proton uptake, but catalyzed facilitated influx of lactose down a concentration gradient and equilibrium exchange with rates similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The E379D mutant was partially defective in the coupled transport of lactose and protons. These results suggest that an acidic residue at position 379 is required for the coupled uptake of lactose and protons and are consistent with a mechanism in which lactose transport in the E379A and E379Q mutants occurs by uniport rather than proton symport. Lactose efflux down a concentration gradient in wild-type LacS and LacS-E379D increased with pH with apparent pK (pKα) values of ≥8.5 and 8.0, respectively, whereas efflux in the E379Q mutant increased sigmoidally with a pKα of about 6.0. Imposition of an artificial membrane potential (inside negative) in membrane vesicles bearing wild-type LacS or LacS-E379Q not only inhibited the lactose efflux mediated by wild-type but also that of the mutant enzyme. To associate the role of Glu379 with specific step(s) in the translocation cycle of LacS, the properties of wild-type LacS and the Glu379 mutants have been evaluated by numerical analysis of simple kinetic schemes for translocation catalysis by solute H+ symport proteins. The properties of the wild-type enzyme are consistent with a mechanism in which the order of ligand binding on the inside is substrate first and proton last, whereas the order is random (or proton first, substrate last) at the outer surface of the membrane. The wild-type enzyme is asymmetric with regard to proton binding; the pK for proton binding on the outside is at least 4 units higher than the pK on the inside. The properties of the Glu379 mutants correspond with a lowering of the pK on the outside (pKOUT∼ pKIN), and the induction of a leak pathway in which the binary enzyme-substrate complex becomes mobile.

The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the uptake of galactosides in symport with a proton (Foucaud and Poolman, 1992Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo the dominant transport reaction corresponds with an exchange of lactose for intracellularly formed galactose without net movement of protons (Poolman, 1990Poolman B. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Foucaud and Poolman, 1992Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the LacS protein differs from other secondary transport proteins by the presence at the carboxyl terminus of a hydrophilic domain that is homologous to IIA of various phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase systems (Poolman et al., 1989Poolman B. Royer T.J. Mainzer S.E. Schmidt B.F. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 244-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the IIA domain of LacS is not essential for translocation catalysis, phosphorylation of a histidine residue in the IIA domain by phosphoenolpyruvate and the general energy coupling proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase systems reduces the transport activity (Poolman et al., 1992Poolman B. Modderman R. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9150-9157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Poolman et al., 1995Poolman B. Knol J. Mollet B. Nieuwenhuis B. Sulter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal carrier domain of LacS corresponds with a polytopic membrane protein that traverses the membrane most likely 12 times. The primary sequence of the hydrophobic carrier domain of LacS classifies this protein as a member of a family which also includes MelB of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium, the glucuronide transporter (GusB) of E. coli (Liang, 1992Liang, W.-S., 1992, The Glucuronide Transport Protein of Escherichia coli, Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge.Google Scholar), and the xylose transporter (XylP) of Lactobacillus pentosus (for a review, see Poolman and Konings, 1993Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 5-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The lactose transport protein (LacY) of E. coli is not homologous to members of this family of transporters, however, a stretch of about 20 amino acids around His322 in LacY can be identified in LacS (Fig. 1). Conserved residues include a lysine (position 319 in LacY, 373 in LacS; arrow 1), a histidine (position 322 in LacY, 376 in LacS; arrow 2), and a glutamic acid (position 325 in LacY, 379 in LacS; arrow 3). Residues His322, Glu325 (which should be on the same side of putative α-helix X), and Arg302 (putative helix IX) of LacY have been proposed to participate in proton translocation via a charge relay mechanism (Püttner et al., 1986Püttner I.B.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2540-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is based on analogies with proton transfer via Asp, His, and Ser in serine type proteases (Kraut, 1977Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In this view, Glu325 and His322 are ion-paired and interact with Arg302; Glu325 and Arg302 would polarize the imidazole group of His322 which enhances its capacity to act as a proton shuttle. His322 is poised to accept a proton from Glu325 and subsequent transfer of this proton to Arg302, another residue or the medium would lead to net proton translocation. The role of His322 in proton translocation can be questioned since the requirement for an ionizable histidine residue at position 322 in LacY is not always needed for galactoside accumulation and galactoside-dependent proton transport (King and Wilson, 1989aKing S.C. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 1989b, 1990; Franco and Brooker, 1991Franco P.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6693-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, some substitutions of Arg302, i.e. R302S and R302H, result in mutant proteins that do accumulate galactosides albeit to lower levels and do exhibit sugar-dependent proton transport (Matzke et al., 1992Matzke E.A. Stephenson L.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19095-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of uncoupling of sugar transport from H+ transport not only varies with the substitutions made for Arg302 and His322, but also with the sugar used in the transport assay (King and Wilson, 1989aKing S.C. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, King and Wilson, 1989bKing S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7390-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other parameters such as the pH of the assay medium (Franco and Brooker, 1991Franco P.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6693-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, one could conclude that Arg302 and His322 play an auxiliary role in proton translocation, e.g. via modulating the pK of an essential nearby residue. From the analysis of LacY Glu325 mutants, it is clear that an acidic residue at position 325 is required for proton-linked galactoside transport (Carrasco et al., 1989Carrasco N. Püttner I.B. Antes L.M. Lee J.A. Larigan J.D. Lolkema J.S. Roepe P.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; Franco and Brooker, 1994Franco P.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7379-7386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we focus on the role in translocation of Glu379 in the lactose transport protein of S.thermophilus. The data indicate that Glu379 is required for the coupled uptake of lactose and protons possibly by modulating the pK of an essential protonatable residue. The properties of the S.thermophilus LacS(Glu379) mutant proteins are highly diagnostic of an enzyme with a substrate leak pathway that allows uncoupled transport at rates similar to or better than the coupled transport by the wild-type enzyme.

When appropriate, the medium was supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), and/or streptomycin (25 μg/ml). Overnight cultures or exponentially growing cells (OD660 = 0.4-0.8; Erlenmeyer flasks) were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, and resuspended to a final protein concentration of about 40 mg/ml in 100 mM potassium phosphate 2 mM magnesium sulfate (KPM buffer) or 30 mM K-citrate, 30 mM K-piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 30 mM K-2(N-cyclohexylamine)ethanesulfonic acid, 2 mM MgSO4 (CPC buffer) (pH 6.5, unless indicated otherwise). Concentrated cell suspensions were stored on ice until use. For the isolation of right-site-out membrane vesicles cells were grown in 10-15-liter fermentors with vigorous aeration using M9 mineral medium supplemented with 4 g/liter casamino acids and 50 mM glucose. The cells grew exponentially up to optical densities at 660 nm of 2.5. Cells were harvested at OD660 of 2.0-2.5, and right-site-out membrane vesicles were prepared according to Kaback, 1971Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by a 2-fold passage of the cells through a French pressure cell (20,000 pounds/square inch) as described (Poolman et al., 1983Poolman B. Konings W.N. Robillard G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transport experiments were performed at 30°C unless specified otherwise. Cells (0.6-1.2 mg/ml) in KPM buffer containing 10 mMD-Li-lactate as the electron donor were preenergized for 2 min in the presence of oxygen. At time 0, radiolabeled substrate was added, and at appropriate time intervals the uptake reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 100 mM LiCl. Cells were filtered (0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Millipore Corp.)) and washed with 2 ml of ice-cold LiCl. For the estimation of intracellular concentrations, a specific internal cell volume of 3 μl/mg of protein was used. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with the appropriate concentration of radiolabeled galactoside and in the presence of deoxyribonuclease I (20 μg/ml). The next day, potassium azide and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone were added to final concentrations of 30 mM and 50 μM, respectively, and the cells were incubated for another 2 h at room temperature essentially as described (King and Wilson, 1990King S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3153-3160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 1 μl of concentrated cell suspension (50-80 mg/ml) were diluted into 500 μl of KPM or CPC buffer containing no substrates (efflux) and unlabeled galactosides (exchange), respectively. The transport reaction was stopped by rapid filtration as described above. For efflux and exchange in the presence of artificially imposed diffusion potentials, membrane vesicles were resuspended to a final concentration of 30-40 mg of protein/ml in the buffers specified below prior to loading with 5 mM [14C]lactose or 2 mM [14C]methyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. To generate a ΔΨ, valinomycin was added to the membrane suspension to a final concentration of 2 nmol/mg of protein. The membranes were washed and resuspended in 120 mM potassium Pi or 120 mM sodium phosphate (NaPi), pH 8.0, containing 2 mM MgSO4. Potassium-loaded membranes were diluted into the same buffer (no gradient) or in NaPi buffer (ΔΨ, interior negative). Sodium-loaded membranes were diluted into the same buffer (no gradient) or in potassium-containing buffers (ΔΨ, interior positive). Sugar-induced proton uptake was measured essentially as described by Henderson and Macpherson, 1986Henderson P.J.F. Macpherson A.J.S. Methods. Enzymol. 1986; 125: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Cells were washed and resuspended in an equal volume of 150 mM KCl plus 2 mM glycylglycine, pH 6.5. The cells were starved for 3 h at 37°C (shaking cell suspension), washed two more times, and resuspended in the KCl-glycylglycine medium to a final protein concentration of 60-70 mg/ml. Proton transport was measured with a pH electrode in 150 mM KCl, 30 mM potassium thiocyanate plus 2 mM glycylglycine, pH 6.2, at a cell density of 3 mg/ml. The cell suspension was made anaerobic by flushing with argon. Proton uptake was induced by addition of 5 mM sugar. The amount of wild-type and various mutant LacS proteins in the membrane was estimated by immunoblotting with an anti-carboxyl terminus antibody directed against the synthetic peptide NH2-Cys-Glu-Lys-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu-Ser-Glu-Val-Ile-Thr-Phe-Lys-Lys-Gly-Glu (COOH-terminal acid)). The synthetic peptide (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the cysteine at the amino terminus of the peptide (Harlow and Lane, 1988Harlow E. Lane D. Antbodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunization of rabbits and collecting blood samples were performed using standard procedures (Harlow and Lane, 1988Harlow E. Lane D. Antbodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Inside-out or right-site-out membrane vesicles of E. coli DW2 (or HB101) carrying plasmid pSKE8 and expressing wild-type or mutant LacS protein were used to estimate the expression of the lactose transport protein. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% polyacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semidry electrophoretic blotting. Processing of the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (antibody binding: serum dilutions of 10,000-40,000-fold), and immunoblot detection using a secondary alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was performed as described (Harlow and Lane, 1988Harlow E. Lane D. Antbodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers used are E379A, 5′-CACCGTGATGCT-TCGTTAACTTTGTCA; E379D, 5′-CACCGTGATGATTCGTTAACTTTGTCA; and E379Q, 5′-CACCGTGATCAATCGTTAACTTTGTCA. The nucleotides changed by the site-directed mutagenesis are underlined. The nucleotide changes resulting in the desired amino acid substitution are indicated in bold. The other (silent) mutations were made to create a new HincII site. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the Kunkel method (Kunkel et al., 1987Kunkel T. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Single-stranded uracil-containing DNA of pSKE8 was isolated from E. coli CJ236 (dut−, ung−)/pSKE8 after infection with helper phage M13KO7 (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Closed circular heteroduplex DNA with the desired mutations was synthesized in vitro as described (Kunkel et al., 1987Kunkel T. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) and transformed to E. coli JM101 (ung+). Plasmid DNA was isolated from a number of transformants and plasmids bearing the desired mutation(s) were identified by digestion with HincII. The plasmids with an extra HincII site were transferred to E. coli HB101, and the phenotype (growth on MacConkey-lactose agar and mineral media, transport activity) of at least two independent isolates was determined (see “Results”). Subsequently, mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing of double-stranded DNA using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) and a set of primers complementary to a region of lacS located 50-100 bases downstream or upstream of the mutation site. The nucleotide sequence of the entire lacS-E379Q gene was determined. Fig. 1 shows the alignment of the amino acid sequence of putative interhelix loop X-XI of the lactose transport protein (LacS) of S.thermophilus and homologous regions in other sugar transport proteins. The glutamate residue at position 379 of LacS is conserved in each of the aligned sequences (arrow 3). Glu379 of the lactose transport protein (LacS) was replaced by site-directed mutagenesis with aspartate, glutamine, or alanine. Each mutant was isolated independently at least twice, and the phenotypes were compared with those of the wild-type. Plasmids with the mutations were used to transform E. coli HB101 (lacY1), and transformants were streaked on lactose MacConkey agar plates or mineral medium plates supplemented with lactose. The lac phenotype of each of the position 379 mutants on both types of media was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain, i.e. HB101/pSKE8. To measure uphill transport of lactose, each of the plasmids, bearing lacS wild-type or a mutant allele, was used to transform E. coli DW2 (ΔlacZY). The wild-type protein accumulated lactose 13-14-fold within 4 min, LacS-E379D accumulated 2-3-fold, while no accumulation was observed with the mutants in which Glu379 was replaced by alanine or glutamine. The LacS-E379A and LacS-E379Q exhibited an initial rate of lactose uptake that was significantly higher than the strain with the plasmid control (Fig. 2, left panel). For downhill uptake of lactose, E. coli HB101 was used as host, and cells were grown in the presence of 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside in order to express the β-galactosidase activity maximally. Uptake of lactose down its concentration gradient was observed with LacS (wild-type) but also with the Glu379 mutants (Fig. 2, right panel). In fact, the rates of lactose uptake by the Glu379 mutants were significantly higher than those of the wild-type. The relative amounts of LacS were estimated by immunoblotting with a anti-IIA domain antibody. Membranes prepared from strains expressing either the wild-type or one of the mutant LacS proteins showed no significant differences in the expression levels of LacS (data not shown). The apparent inability of the LacS-E379Q and E379A mutants to transport lactose against a concentration gradient (Fig. 2, left panel) could be due to a defect in the coupling of lactose and proton transport. Lactose uptake by E. coli DW2/pSKE8 wild-type LacS and LacS-E379Q was measured for prolonged time intervals (up to 30 min, sampling every 1-2 min) and at pH 5.0, 5.7, 6.6, and 7.5. Fig. 3 shows that highest accumulation levels are observed at pH 5.7 (lactosein/lactoseout is 33 for wild-type LacS). For LacS-E379Q some accumulation can be observed at pH 5.0 and 5.7, but not at pH 6.6 and 7.5. Lactose-induced H+ uptake was measured with a pH electrode. Addition of 5 mM lactose to a suspension of E. coli DW2/pSKE8 wild-type LacS resulted in a transient alkalinization of the medium which is consistent with a lactose H+ symport mechanism (Fig. 4). The alkalinization was reduced in the LacS-E379D mutant and was not observed with strains carrying either the control plasmid (LacS−), LacS-E379A, or LacS-E379Q. From these experiments it is tentitatively concluded that lactose and H+ uptake in the LacS-E379Q (and E379A) mutant(s) is uncoupled and that lactose uptake proceeds via uniport. The experiments presented above describe uphill (Δp-driven) and downhill (driven by the lactose concentration gradient, ΔpLac; [lactose]in < [lactose]ex due to high β-galactosidase activity) lactose uptake. The lactose transport protein also catalyzes reaction(s) in the opposite direction, e.g. efflux down a concentraton gradient as well as exchange (Foucaud and Poolman, 1992Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows efflux and equilibrium exchange of lactose at pH 6.6 (pHin = pHout) by wild-type LacS and the various Glu379 mutants. Lactose efflux down a concentration gradient was slow for the wild-type protein, much faster for LacS-E379D, and fastest for LacS-E379A and LacS-E379Q (Fig. 5, left panel). This indicates that substitution of Glu379 for Asp, Ala, or Gln alters the rate-determining step(s) of the efflux reaction, possibly by shifting the protonation equilibrium at the outer surface of the membrane to the deprotonated form of the carrier molecule or allowing a more rapid return of the unloaded carrier to the inner surface of the membrane. The differences in the rates of lactose exchange catalyzed by the wild-type and mutant proteins were relatively small (Fig. 5, right panel), suggesting that the rate-determining steps in the translocation cycle for exchange are different from those in efflux transport. Under conditions of exchange with 5 mM [14C]lactose inside and 5 mM [12C]lactose outside the cell, the exchange reaction of the Glu379 mutants was consistently faster than that of the wild-type. Since the release of [14C]lactose from the cell is monoexponential, at least initially, with a slope that depends upon the external lactose concentration, an apparent Kmout for the exchange reaction can be estimated. The KmAPP values of the wild-type LacS and LacS-E379D were 10 and 2.5 mM, respectively (Fig. 5, right panel, inset). The maximal rates of exchange were the same for the wild-type and E379D mutant protein. Since the wild-type and Glu379 mutant proteins are expressed to the same level in E. coli membranes, the differences in the equilibrium exchange reactions shown in Fig. 5, right panel, can be explained by the lower KmAPP of the E379D mutant relative to the wild-type protein. The pH dependence of the first-order rate constant (k) of the efflux reaction of the wild-type, E379D, and E379Q mutant proteins is shown in Fig. 6A. The pH profile of the E379D mutant is shifted to lower pH values by at least 2 units, whereas the profile of the E379Q mutant is shifted even further (pK of about 6.0). This suggests that residues at position 379 directly affect the deprotonation of the carrier molecule at the outer surface of the membrane, perhaps by modulating the pK of a nearby group that is on the pathway of proton translocation. Equilibrium exchange of galactosides in membrane vesicles of S.thermophilus, expressing LacS, exhibits an optimum between pH 6-7 (Foucaud and Poolman, 1992Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the product of the lacS gene cloned in E. coli (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the pH profile of the exchange reaction of the wild-type and E379D mutant LacS proteins was similar. In contrast to the wild-type protein and LacS-E379D, the E379Q mutant was much less affected by pH in the range of 4 to 10. Neutral substitutions of Glu379 result in a carrier protein that is unable to transport lactose against a concentration gradient. To test whether a membrane potential (ΔΨ) has a kinetic effect on the apparent uniport of lactose, efflux down a concentration gradient by the wild-type and E379Q mutant in the presence and absence of a ΔΨ was compared. Fig. 7, left panel, shows, as expected, that lactose efflux in membrane vesicles bearing wild-type LacS is retarded by a ΔΨ (inside negative). Comparable results were obtained with LacS-E379D (data not shown), but also (at least qualitatively) with membrane vesicles derived from strains expressing LacS-E379Q (Fig. 7, right panel). These results indicate that also for the LacS-E379D and LacS-E379Q enzymes one or more steps in the translocation cycle are affected (kinetically) by the membrane potential. Equilibrium exchange of lactose by LacS wild-type and position-379 mutants was not affected by the ΔΨ (data not shown). In this paper the effects on the kinetic parameters of transport of different substitutions of Glu379 in the lactose transport protein of S.thermophilus have been analyzed. The properties of LacS Glu379 mutants reveal some striking similarities and differences with the corresponding mutations in LacY (Table I). The mutations reduce the ability of both enzymes to accumulate sugars against a concentration gradient. Neutral substitutions abolish uphill transport completely whereas the Glu to Asp substitutions result in reduced accumulation levels. For both types of mutants, and both in LacS and LacY, the rate of downhill uptake is not much affected. Also, the apparent affinity constants for transport or sugar binding are only moderately affected by the Glu379 and Glu325 mutations in LacS and LacY, respectively.Table IProperties of the LacS Glu379 and LacY Glu325 mutants The mutant alleles of both permeases differ in those aspects where also the properties of the wild-type enzymes are different. Equilibrium exchange of lactose mediated by the wild-type LacY protein is independent of pH in the range of 5-10 but becomes dependent on pH in the E325D mutant (Roepe and Kaback, 1990Roepe P.D. Kaback H.R. Progr. Cell Res. 1990; 1: 213-229Crossref Google Scholar). Neutral substitutions result in wild-type exchange activities (Carrasco et al., 1989Carrasco N. Püttner I.B. Antes L.M. Lee J.A. Larigan J.D. Lolkema J.S. Roepe P.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Equilibrium exchange of lactose by wild-type LacS and LacS-E379D exhibits a typical pH optimum around pH 6, whereas exchange by LacS-E379Q is largely independent of pH (Fig. 6B). The rate of efflux of lactose down a concentration gradient at alkaline pH va"

Two compounds, 1-pyrenesulfonyl chloride or N-(1-pyrene)maleimide, were used to incorporate up to 8 mol of pyrene per mol of cpn60 14-mer. The fluorescence lifetime of the cpn60-pyrenesulfonyl chloride conjugate exhibited a double exponential decay: 5.36 ns, with a fractional contribution to the intensity of 7%, and 48.77 ns, with a fractional contribution to the intensity of 93%. These yield a second-order average lifetime of 45.58 ns at 20°C. Analysis of the fluorescence polarization data for the pyrene probe by the Perrin-Weber treatment revealed the existence of two components that account for the depolarization. The fast component accounted for 24% of the depolarization at 20°C. The rotational relaxation time for the cpn60 14-mer derived from the low viscosity part of the Perrin-Weber plot which accentuates the slow motion gave ρh= 1113 ± 55 ns. When this value of ρh is compared with the ρh calculated based on the Stokes radius of cpn60 from ultracentrifugation, ρStokes, it leads to ρh /ρStokes = 0.4 which is considerably smaller than the value expected (ρh /ρStokes = 1) or actually found in the cpn60-rhodanese complex (ρh /ρStokes = 0.93). These considerations and the observed presence of the fast motion suggest that cpn60 is not a rigid protein. Analysis of the polarization data as a function of temperature, which is weighted more toward the fast motion, showed that the rotational relaxation time assessed by temperature variation is greatly increased (from 552.5 to 2591 ns) for the complex of cpn60 with partially folded rhodanese (34-kDa monomeric protein). No change in ρh was observed upon formation of the cpn60·ATP complex (ρh= 556.9 ns). These data indicate that there is local motion in the cpn60 14-mer molecule that can be frozen by formation of a binary complex with partially folded proteins. This conclusion is in keeping with results showing that the structure of cpn60 is generally stabilized when it forms complexes with passenger proteins (Mendoza, J. A., and Horowitz, P. M.(1994) J.

Two major deoxyribonuclease activities were detected in the extract of IL-2-deprived CTLL2 cells in a zymographic assay. They were designated nuc-58 and nuc-40, based on their apparent molecular mass of 58 and 40 kDa. The activity of both DNases was greatly induced in CTLL2 cells deprived of IL-2 or treated with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Deregulated expression of bcl-2 cDNA suppressed the induction of both nuclease activities. Nuc-58 was dependent on both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions alone. Nuc-40 showed a preferential nuclear localization over that of nuc-58, which was found primarily in the cytoplasm. Optimal activity of both DNases required neutral pH and was inhibited by zinc ions. The physicochemical characteristics of the nucleases indicate that they are novel DNases associated with apoptosis in CTLL2 cells."

RegA is unusual in that it represses the translation of about 35 early T4 mRNAs but does not affect nearly 200 other mRNAs. The crystal structure of regA was determined at 1.9 A resolution; the protein was shown to have an alpha-helical core and two regions with antiparallel beta sheets. One of these beta sheets has four antiparallel strands and has some sequence homology to RNP-1 and RNP-2, which are believed to be RNA-binding motifs and are found in a number of known RNA-binding proteins.

For human erythrocyte Glx I, catalysis is unlikely to be coupled to major changes in protein secondary structure, as the circular dichroism spectrum of the enzyme (190-260 nm) is insensitive to saturating concentrations of either enediol analog or S-D-lactoylglutathione, the product of the Glx I reaction. However, a small conformational change is indicated by the fact that binding of enediol analog to the active site decreases intrinsic protein fluorescence by 11%, and protects the enzyme from proteolytic cleavage by Pronase E at the C-side of Ala-92 and Leu-93.
